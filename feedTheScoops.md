You're creating feedTheScoops.md to track this. Key questions to answer there:
 - Self-hosted (VPS) vs. managed hosting?
 - Auth: Patreon OAuth (only subscribers get access)?
 if this is aviaable that would be awsome. Would it check once auth if they subscribe to the pod?
 - Data sync: Does the local Tauri app become the "ingest server" and the web app reads a shared DB?
 I would want to move all to we so all the data on an amazon bucket I think was maybe a cheap option for the audio, 
 - What features go to web first? (Search is the obvious first win)
 search and then what ever we come up with

 we could have social media tiktok like feed of podcast segments to scroll and listen. (This is kind of an ultimate goal) This could be shareable across all social media platforms and its own stand alone platform. inspiration(https://github.com/rebane2001/xikipedia)
