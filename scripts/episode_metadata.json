      "description": "<p>Hey Scoops, I am sharing this interview here on the ICS feed because it was on ICS that members of the trans community, with great respect and affection, helped me evolve and understand the complexity a world I knew very little about. I am so thankful for our listeners regarding this and so many things. On this podcast, you'Il hear how I witnessed my mother-in-law experience something unique in powerful along these same issues of understanding and evolution. Here is the podcast and post from Abracababble feed: </p><p>\"Hey it's Matt. For a guy who regularly appears on 4 different podcasts every week, I'm as surprised as anyone when sometimes I want to interview someone or even get a specific story on air and I don't quite know where to do it.  This podcast has a story that needs to be heard.</p><p>My mother in law, Gwen Hillier, is an incredible woman with a remarkable career (not to mention a pretty awesome daughter). From working with Bob Fosse as his dance captain for Pippin, her numerous Broadway shows, casting at General Hospital for 26 years, to now working as actor again, she has some stories. Now, this one story, where she was cast in the Transparent Season 5 finale, I saw beautifully open minded artist, get challenged to be even more open minded.</p><p>Jeffrey Tambor, after winning numerous awards for a show that put the story of someone in the trans community on world wide mainstream platform, devastated the cast, crew and fans of the show when his behavior lead to his dismissal from the show. That story made headlines, but the story of how the show carried on without him did not. Gwen was cast as a dancer for the Season 5 finale and that is the story I thought needed to be told.</p><p>Note: This audio post is open to the public right here on this page. So feel free to share a link to it for anyone who might take interest: <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/37668746\">https://www.patreon.com/posts/37668746</a>\"</p>",

      "description": "<p>Hey Scoops, </p><p>7 years ago today, on Penn's Sunday School, Matt asked to the world to check out a new podcast called Matt and Mattingly's Ice Cream Social. There, he asked his comedy partner Paul about growing up the son of a former priest and nun as parents and the rest is history. Adopting \"preaching fun\" as slogan akin to PSS's \"preaching love\", we felt that people don't always need reminding of the world's stresses and pressures. Our goal was to give people a time out from their regular lives and feel like they were joking around with friends. Now here we are in the craziest of circumstances across the globe and more than ever, we give you credit for feeling the weight of this all in your own personal ways. Now more than ever, we feel like we should offer silly in the face of serious. Thank you all so much for making this community so beautiful and being a source of light to the three of us. </p><p>FYITF</p><p>Matt, Paul and Jacob</p>",

It's been both frustrating and flattering to be told to write a book by numerous people. One is which is Chris Caniglia who I worked with and performed with for years at The PIT. He wants to help me get this book done. So when I was opening for Piff in Portland, he came to my hotel, we sat down in the lobby and recorded a brain storm of sorts. -something to get the ball rolling. </p><p>What you are about to hear is a majorly nerdy, passionate, historically embellished conversation by two people who are happy to be nerding out so hard about the artform we love, improv.</p><p>I think at one point, Chris thought I might have spoken out of school and disparaged the owner of the PIT. If it comes off that way, please know that's not how I meant it at all. I could have edited it out, but I don't know how to. So I guess I couldn't have edited it out.
