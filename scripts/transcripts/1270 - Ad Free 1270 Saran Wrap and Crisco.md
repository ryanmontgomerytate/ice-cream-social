**[0:00:15]** but we are going to thank each and every Ice Cream Truck Driver before this month is over.

**[0:00:23]** people's fucking ear holes, head over to preachingfun.com. Preachingfun.com is where

**[0:00:27]** you can go to sign up to be an Ice Cream Truck Driver, and who knows?

**[0:00:30]** The life you save may be your own. Here's the show!

**[0:00:38]** Hey, Johnny! Do you want to go to an Ice Cream Social?

**[0:00:42]** Yeah, I'd love to!

**[0:00:43]** Great! Let's go!

**[0:00:51]** Horses! Reportedly did not come to the Las Vegas rodeo this year because of a horse flu.

**[0:00:57]** No, I know horse whoopies!

**[0:00:59]** Oh, really?

**[0:01:03]** It's Cream Social! Sittin' in Las Vegas! That's Matt Donnelly! Sittin' in Pittsburgh!

**[0:01:07]** It's Paul Mattingly! Sittin' in Las Vegas! Loaded with horse herpes! It's me, Jacob, the audio guy!

**[0:01:13]** We're preaching fun.

**[0:01:14]** First off, I didn't, because of the music that went into it, but bam-a-lam.

**[0:01:19]** Horse herpes, bam-a-lam.

**[0:01:21]** Bam-a-lam. If you type in horse herpes, Google will autofill Las Vegas.

**[0:01:27]** Oh, shit!

**[0:01:28]** Yeah, wait a minute.

**[0:01:29]** If you type in herpes at all, Google will autofill Las Vegas.

**[0:01:31]** Can they get this by like sharing a water trough and shit? Is that how bad it could be?

**[0:01:36]** Is that how viral it is?

**[0:01:38]** Where's Nick Newman when we need him?

**[0:01:40]** Oh, I was looking for him in the chat before we started.

**[0:01:43]** I know. He's not in here.

**[0:01:44]** Let's see. No confirmed cases were reported in Nevada, but there is a significant equine

**[0:01:50]** herpes virus outbreak affecting horse events nationwide, causing major disruptions, cancellations,

**[0:01:57]** like the all-in barrel race, and heightened biosecurity at the NFR rodeo,

**[0:02:05]** which is the one in Vegas here during early December.

**[0:02:08]** See, a lot of people just didn't bring their horses.

**[0:02:11]** A lot of people just left their animals at home and came to the rodeo.

**[0:02:14]** Apparently, the rodeo was really affected by it.

**[0:02:17]** Paul says, Paul is right. Let's do it.

**[0:02:21]** Okay.

**[0:02:22]** Primarily directed through contact, nose to nose, or indirectly from shared items like

**[0:02:26]** tack, buckets, clothing, and even people's hands, the aerosol droplets,

**[0:02:33]** or contact infected with fluids.

**[0:02:35]** Man, it's amazing how we all don't have horse herpes.

**[0:02:37]** This is everything.

**[0:02:39]** I'm already looking up if it can go to people.

**[0:02:42]** No, it's not a zoonotic jumper.

**[0:02:44]** Please, fuck, no.

**[0:02:47]** I don't want horse herpes.

**[0:02:50]** No, humans cannot get infected with horse herpes.

**[0:02:54]** Don't worry about it.

**[0:02:56]** Keep on fucking those horses.

**[0:02:58]** Keep on a horse of fucking.

**[0:03:00]** Use a step stool.

**[0:03:02]** Safety first, people.

**[0:03:03]** Safety first.

**[0:03:04]** That's right.

**[0:03:04]** Oh, good Lord.

**[0:03:06]** Don't just be out there puffing it.

**[0:03:08]** Mr. Hands has nothing to worry about.

**[0:03:11]** There'll be more horse herpy stuff in the new Taylor Sheridan show about the rodeo.

**[0:03:19]** Rodeo.

**[0:03:20]** What will it be called?

**[0:03:21]** Thornton.

**[0:03:22]** It'll be called.

**[0:03:23]** It'll be called bull rider.

**[0:03:27]** Long dick man.

**[0:03:32]** Speech guy.

**[0:03:34]** Sheridan's running out of good names.

**[0:03:36]** Bull rider, long dick man, speech guy.

**[0:03:38]** You know what to say about riding bulls?

**[0:03:43]** What's that?

**[0:03:44]** A lot of times people think it's all about those eight seconds.

**[0:03:47]** You got to stay on the bull.

**[0:03:49]** Those eight seconds, those are the least important seconds of the whole thing.

**[0:03:54]** The most important time is when you enter the pen.

**[0:03:59]** My secret, give that bull a little light touch behind the ear.

**[0:04:05]** I got a little dab of hot, icy cold on my finger.

**[0:04:11]** And I give him a little rub right behind the ear with icy cold.

**[0:04:15]** Icy hot.

**[0:04:17]** And that's what he's feeling.

**[0:04:18]** What are you quoting?

**[0:04:19]** What are you quoting?

**[0:04:19]** I'm making up a dumb speech that he would do for this rodeo long dick man.

**[0:04:25]** I thought you were quoting something, but you're doing it.

**[0:04:27]** Oh, I'm improvising, Matt.

**[0:04:30]** That's what I do.

**[0:04:30]** No, no, no.

**[0:04:32]** I didn't mean to be that much of a dick about it.

**[0:04:38]** But you didn't make me feel liberal guilt.

**[0:04:40]** That's why I didn't think it was a Sheridan speech.

**[0:04:42]** You have to.

**[0:04:42]** I haven't got there yet.

**[0:04:46]** Also, to be fair, I don't, I don't watch.

**[0:04:49]** You don't watch the shows.

**[0:04:50]** So I don't know enough of, but okay.

**[0:04:53]** So now I know where to go to go with it.

**[0:04:55]** Yes.

**[0:04:55]** So I rub a little bit behind there.

**[0:04:57]** And then when that bull knocks me off after eight seconds,

**[0:05:01]** if I stay on there for more than eight seconds,

**[0:05:04]** that bull has outlived its life.

**[0:05:05]** And that bull is going to become your case of fajita over at Chili's next week.

**[0:05:11]** But you can't look at that bull and realize that's my case of fajita coming to me.

**[0:05:16]** You look at that bull thing.

**[0:05:17]** What a noble, beautiful animal.

**[0:05:19]** And all I see is the 999 dinner for two special at Chili's.

**[0:05:26]** You fucking libtard.

**[0:05:31]** Enter Sheridan check out.

**[0:05:34]** Is that closer?

**[0:05:35]** Is that more like what he says?

**[0:05:36]** It's pretty close.

**[0:05:37]** It's pretty close.

**[0:05:37]** That's much closer.

**[0:05:38]** What a dick.

**[0:05:39]** I never want to watch any of those shows.

**[0:05:41]** You would hate them, Paul.

**[0:05:43]** I know I would.

**[0:05:43]** I can tell I would.

**[0:05:45]** I'm sure.

**[0:05:46]** You would hate them.

**[0:05:48]** I know there was a thing.

**[0:05:50]** It was a yellow stone.

**[0:05:51]** Like last year, the yellow stone,

**[0:05:52]** there was this character that appeared like a hippie who got arrested.

**[0:05:55]** Became like a like a girlfriend of Kevin Costner,

**[0:06:01]** but like in this like pseudo we don't like each other,

**[0:06:04]** but we do kind of thing.

**[0:06:05]** Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[0:06:07]** And her job the last season was just to get lectured by every cast member

**[0:06:11]** of a different aspect of Montana society.

**[0:06:15]** It's a good gig if you can get it.

**[0:06:16]** And at one point, there's one character who's a Native American

**[0:06:19]** who's already was already feeling guilt about marrying into a Montana family

**[0:06:22]** that like, you know, it's against her.

**[0:06:23]** Native American, you know, whatever she lectured her and I was like Jesus.

**[0:06:28]** I was like everyone's breaking character.

**[0:06:30]** Just a lecture lives like everybody hates this girl once we torch this live girl.

**[0:06:35]** We can go back to fighting about real things between our cultures.

**[0:06:37]** But in the meantime, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

**[0:06:42]** And there was a plot point happening in landmine right now.

**[0:06:45]** And I and I and I feel crazy only because like in season one.

**[0:06:49]** This person got a payout from the oil company.

**[0:06:51]** Like a wrongful death suit. Okay, this couple, this whole season, this whole

**[0:06:55]** season, they're fighting over money and I'm like, weren't you paid a shit little

**[0:06:58]** money from an old company? Why isn't that coming up in conversation?

**[0:07:01]** Why is it coming up?

**[0:07:03]** You're paid out.

**[0:07:05]** There's a large plot point last season about the large plot point.

**[0:07:09]** That's happening right now in Mayor of King's Town, which I watch right now

**[0:07:12]** like like the pilot episode is that

**[0:07:17]** what's his name? The guy got right over by a snowmower in real life.

**[0:07:21]** Hawkeye Hawkeye. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

**[0:07:23]** So that guy, he ends up becoming his brother's job because his brother gets

**[0:07:27]** killed in a botched robbery, right?

**[0:07:29]** And they went through like four seasons were like, man, we haven't brought him

**[0:07:32]** up in a while. So the last episode that they bring up is dead brother like six times.

**[0:07:38]** So they're really making up for the lost, lost bit there.

**[0:07:42]** Jeremy Renner, Jeremy Renner is who I'm thinking of. Yeah.

**[0:07:46]** It's hard. It's hard.

**[0:07:49]** He's a hard case too. He's a fucking hard case.

**[0:07:51]** That guy. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

**[0:07:53]** You talk about somebody coming away with the wrong life lessons

**[0:07:56]** after a near death experience.

**[0:08:00]** Jeremy Renner. Yeah. Oh, I don't know about this.

**[0:08:04]** Oh, he's just kind of doubled down on his assholery.

**[0:08:06]** He's a bit of a shit bird.

**[0:08:08]** Okay. I don't know. I like Jeremy Renner a lot.

**[0:08:13]** Not a lot. I like Jeremy Renner.

**[0:08:16]** I'd fuck him.

**[0:08:17]** He's going to break your heart, Matt.

**[0:08:20]** It's probably true, but he like survived on like, he and his brother

**[0:08:27]** were like split like a box of like donut holes when they were like dirt poor.

**[0:08:32]** They got by in Hollywood by like buying and flipping a house and then flipping that

**[0:08:37]** in other houses and doing construction, something like that.

**[0:08:39]** But like he went from like dirt as poor to like building himself up into

**[0:08:43]** like a house flipper while trying to be an actor at the same time.

**[0:08:46]** I thought that was pretty cool that he was not any kind of like nepo baby or

**[0:08:50]** anything like that. Like he really had to like fight to stay in the business

**[0:08:52]** and try to make a go of it. So I do like it and her locker.

**[0:08:56]** Come on. That's a cool debut story. Sure.

**[0:08:59]** All right. What is why is he a shipper?

**[0:09:01]** Ah, it's easy. I get 10 vibes when I hear him talk.

**[0:09:05]** Oh, oh, oh, I did something. No, he's just kind of he's just kind of his

**[0:09:09]** his his his. Oh, he might not get along with him.

**[0:09:11]** I don't give a shit about that. No, no, no, no, no, no.

**[0:09:14]** He's take on things. His stance on some shit. It's a little bit.

**[0:09:18]** But whatever. It's fine. Paul is weary. Paul is weary.

**[0:09:21]** I'm good for him. Good for him. Do your thing. Make your make your money.

**[0:09:26]** I went poker the other day for the first time in a very long time.

**[0:09:30]** Yeah. And I thought I was going to watch someone get murdered

**[0:09:34]** while I was at the poker table.

**[0:09:35]** I thought I thought one player was going to murder another player.

**[0:09:38]** Tournament or open table?

**[0:09:40]** Open table. Okay.

**[0:09:41]** Cash game. Okay.

**[0:09:42]** No big deal. Low stakes cash game.

**[0:09:45]** One three, one three, no limit cash game.

**[0:09:49]** Fellow that was at the table a couple of seats down from me.

**[0:09:53]** He won a sizable pot from me.

**[0:09:57]** Got a little bit lucky on the last card.

**[0:09:59]** Drew out on the last card.

**[0:10:01]** No, I'm not saying anything to him.

**[0:10:03]** You know, I'm the hand ends. He wins.

**[0:10:06]** It's a good size to hand.

**[0:10:07]** But you're stewing. Yeah, you're stewing.

**[0:10:08]** I'm not even stewing.

**[0:10:10]** I'm like, oh, that's all right.

**[0:10:11]** All right. He got it.

**[0:10:12]** He says, without me saying anything, he says to me,

**[0:10:16]** boy, I thought you were going to draw out on me there.

**[0:10:20]** And I looked, I looked back.

**[0:10:21]** I was just confused. I looked back.

**[0:10:22]** I was like, wait, I was ahead though.

**[0:10:25]** I was ahead until the, until the last card.

**[0:10:27]** You got the last card there and you won it.

**[0:10:30]** He goes, yeah, yeah, but I was mathematically ahead already.

**[0:10:32]** I was supposed to win that hand already.

**[0:10:34]** I just wasn't ahead on the cards yet.

**[0:10:37]** And I, and I kind of laughed.

**[0:10:39]** And I kind of, I kind of, because he was absolutely being genuine.

**[0:10:43]** He was, he was saying that with all sincerity.

**[0:10:45]** He was like, no, no, no, I was supposed to win that hand.

**[0:10:47]** I was ahead mathematically, which he wasn't.

**[0:10:49]** By the time he actually made the call,

**[0:10:51]** he wasn't mathematically behind when he made the call.

**[0:10:53]** Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. He won the hand.

**[0:10:55]** I wasn't mad about it.

**[0:10:56]** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that was, that was that.

**[0:10:58]** He was a touch of a, you know, a skosh,

**[0:11:02]** this much of a, of just a bit of a jerk about it.

**[0:11:06]** Just a, just not even, not even a jerk.

**[0:11:09]** I was done with it though.

**[0:11:11]** So we, we continue playing the game.

**[0:11:13]** I don't say anything to him about it after I got it,

**[0:11:16]** after I figured out what he meant by that.

**[0:11:18]** Didn't matter that he was wrong.

**[0:11:19]** I was over it moving on.

**[0:11:21]** So about half an hour later, I win a big hand,

**[0:11:25]** a, a, a very big hand off of that guy.

**[0:11:28]** Okay.

**[0:11:29]** So I made all the money back and then quite a bit more

**[0:11:33]** off of that guy.

**[0:11:34]** Like I say, about half an hour later.

**[0:11:37]** Again, this person is not sitting next to me.

**[0:11:40]** There is a person between us.

**[0:11:43]** After I win that hand, I don't say anything

**[0:11:46]** because I'm not stupid.

**[0:11:48]** When it comes to this, I'm not.

**[0:11:51]** This scenario, you're not stupid.

**[0:11:52]** This scenario, I was not stupid at that moment.

**[0:11:55]** There we go.

**[0:11:57]** So I don't say a word.

**[0:12:00]** The person between us though looks at the guy

**[0:12:03]** who just lost the hand.

**[0:12:04]** Oh, and by the way, I had drawn out,

**[0:12:06]** I had drawn out on this hand.

**[0:12:08]** So I got a little bit lucky on this hand.

**[0:12:10]** And the fourth card out, I got a little bit lucky

**[0:12:13]** with that card.

**[0:12:14]** All the more reason to shut up, right?

**[0:12:15]** You got lucky.

**[0:12:16]** That's it.

**[0:12:16]** That's it.

**[0:12:17]** Yep.

**[0:12:17]** I'm, I'm just being quiet.

**[0:12:18]** I'm, I'm stacking up my chips.

**[0:12:20]** I'm, I'm moving on to the next hand.

**[0:12:22]** The guy between us looks at the guy who just lost

**[0:12:25]** and goes, well, that was payback for earlier, huh?

**[0:12:35]** And I, like my head just snapped up.

**[0:12:39]** You know, I'm looking down.

**[0:12:40]** I'm looking anywhere but at this guy, my head just snaps up.

**[0:12:43]** And I just, I was like, I, whatever is happening here,

**[0:12:47]** I don't want to be a part of this.

**[0:12:50]** That's, I would give a, I would give a stern stop helping

**[0:12:54]** line to the guy over there.

**[0:12:57]** I wanted to, I wanted to so badly.

**[0:13:00]** I didn't want to open my mouth though.

**[0:13:03]** I was afraid that if I drew any attention to myself,

**[0:13:06]** that it was all just going to dump on to me.

**[0:13:09]** I've, did a party consider going, right?

**[0:13:12]** And then high-fiving the guy.

**[0:13:16]** Right.

**[0:13:17]** You are.

**[0:13:18]** Oh man.

**[0:13:19]** Feels good.

**[0:13:20]** Don't it, motherfucker?

**[0:13:22]** Took the words out of my mouth.

**[0:13:26]** He turned to this guy and goes,

**[0:13:31]** you need to shut the fuck up.

**[0:13:40]** I couldn't hold it together anymore.

**[0:13:43]** I burst out laughing.

**[0:13:45]** You can just put the mic up and make me laugh really hard.

**[0:13:48]** I laughed so hard.

**[0:13:50]** I was crying at the poker table.

**[0:13:52]** I had to get up and walk away.

**[0:13:55]** It was awful.

**[0:13:59]** Because that's it.

**[0:14:00]** Like you, you have to laugh at that point because

**[0:14:03]** that's all you can do.

**[0:14:04]** It's all you can do and if that guy is above the laugh line,

**[0:14:09]** he's about to get kicked out of the casino anyway.

**[0:14:11]** Yes.

**[0:14:12]** Yes.

**[0:14:13]** So Jake, I just want to make it clear that I'm not involved

**[0:14:16]** in whatever this conversation is over here.

**[0:14:18]** I think I'm going to go home.

**[0:14:20]** I think I'm just going to go home in that kind of scenario.

**[0:14:22]** Can you, can you just get up and go?

**[0:14:25]** Can you just get up and go after, after any game?

**[0:14:27]** After any open table, you can stand up anytime.

**[0:14:30]** I feel, don't you feel I have felt bad in the past.

**[0:14:33]** I haven't played in forever, but I would feel bad

**[0:14:36]** after winning a pot and then leaving the table.

**[0:14:38]** It's called hitting and running.

**[0:14:40]** You're not, it's bad etiquette.

**[0:14:43]** But it's also how you get money, right?

**[0:14:46]** It's certainly, it is certainly allowed within the rules

**[0:14:49]** and the people who do it are probably more intelligent

**[0:14:52]** than the other people who are still sitting at the table.

**[0:14:55]** I just stay there to lose.

**[0:14:56]** But at least at the DC to take a fake phone call

**[0:14:59]** and pretend to talk about an urgent matter.

**[0:15:02]** Oh, for God's sakes.

**[0:15:04]** Oh my gosh.

**[0:15:05]** A baby?

**[0:15:06]** Now?

**[0:15:07]** Both babies?

**[0:15:08]** Both babies at the same time?

**[0:15:11]** Wait, more than two?

**[0:15:12]** Where are the other babies coming from?

**[0:15:13]** How many babies?

**[0:15:15]** Guys, I gotta go, sorry, all the babies.

**[0:15:16]** Lots of babies.

**[0:15:18]** So many babies.

**[0:15:19]** So many babies, guys.

**[0:15:20]** Hey, great game and you need to shut the fuck up.

**[0:15:24]** Bye.

**[0:15:28]** I think I stayed for about five more minutes

**[0:15:31]** because I didn't know how to not leave awkwardly.

**[0:15:33]** Right.

**[0:15:34]** And I was like, I'm, this is it.

**[0:15:36]** I'm leaving.

**[0:15:36]** This is where you're going to.

**[0:15:38]** Fuck that.

**[0:15:39]** Oh boy.

**[0:15:40]** Oh, it was so bad.

**[0:15:42]** It was so bad.

**[0:15:43]** I was like this, you're going to,

**[0:15:44]** you're going to get yourself shot.

**[0:15:46]** I'm going to get shot just by sitting here.

**[0:15:48]** I don't want to get shot.

**[0:15:49]** I don't want to be in a fight

**[0:15:50]** with some random dude in a casino at 1130 at night.

**[0:15:54]** I've definitely, I've never been sitting at a table

**[0:15:56]** where someone hit and run and it's not even

**[0:15:59]** like, oh, they're, you know, that lucky motherfucker.

**[0:16:02]** It's more like all the money at the table is gone.

**[0:16:05]** Like you look at like it's just a bunch of short stacks.

**[0:16:07]** You're like, oh, now what are we all playing for $50?

**[0:16:09]** Yeah, now the game is just kind of over.

**[0:16:11]** Yeah, yeah, yeah, but still, you know, it's an open table.

**[0:16:16]** That's all it's all I would have sat and played for a while longer.

**[0:16:20]** If this guy had not egged on the guy that I had just accidentally

**[0:16:25]** roughed up.

**[0:16:25]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[0:16:26]** The scenario, the amount of scenarios where the table and the other guy

**[0:16:30]** was already putting more cash down on the table.

**[0:16:32]** Like he was staying in.

**[0:16:33]** Yeah.

**[0:16:34]** So he wasn't leaving.

**[0:16:35]** He wouldn't go anywhere anytime soon.

**[0:16:38]** Like, nope, nope.

**[0:16:39]** Whatever's happened here.

**[0:16:40]** I don't want to be in it.

**[0:16:42]** People going on tilts one of the weirdest things to watch

**[0:16:45]** and so hard to deal with.

**[0:16:47]** And yet, especially at like a low stakes game.

**[0:16:50]** Yeah.

**[0:16:51]** But this, this is supposed to not matter.

**[0:16:55]** Right.

**[0:16:55]** This is like on on pot therapy, Whitney's husband, Peter.

**[0:16:59]** Yeah, he's a professional poker player.

**[0:17:02]** And so we, I always, anytime I play poker, which is probably, I don't know,

**[0:17:08]** at this point, three times a year, I go, I'll play poker.

**[0:17:13]** And oftentimes I will end up with a story for Peter from these low stakes

**[0:17:18]** games because he's these, these one three games aren't the games that he's playing.

**[0:17:21]** But every now and then, you run into a professional, you know, a big quote unquote

**[0:17:28]** professional poker player at a low stakes game.

**[0:17:31]** Well, they all have these training apps now.

**[0:17:34]** And they're all like these, there's additional game theory stuff that makes

**[0:17:39]** people do dumb things on purpose to mess with other people's math.

**[0:17:43]** And no one's playing the cards.

**[0:17:44]** And it's gotten super weird.

**[0:17:46]** But watching people do that at a low stakes game where no one is doing the

**[0:17:50]** math in the first place, yeah, yeah, it's like meta fuck you.

**[0:17:55]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[0:17:57]** It's, it's crazy.

**[0:17:58]** It's just a weird crazy thing.

**[0:18:00]** And also, like, you know, and I, I've been, you know, we've all been victims

**[0:18:04]** of bad beats, you know, that kind of thing.

**[0:18:09]** It's like it's poker for a reason, you know, like, you're like, oh, I was

**[0:18:14]** doing the math and then gambling happened.

**[0:18:16]** Yeah, yeah, that's the kind of like what we're doing.

**[0:18:20]** Yeah, is tempting fate for bouts of luck and craziness.

**[0:18:24]** Yeah, right.

**[0:18:24]** Sometimes the wrong card just comes out or the right card.

**[0:18:27]** Speaking of gambling, go ahead.

**[0:18:29]** What are your guys takes on the current state of sports and sort of

**[0:18:36]** the veneer cracking around?

**[0:18:38]** Oh, that play was clearly somebody covering a spread or fucking around

**[0:18:43]** for no good reason, especially the collegiate level.

**[0:18:46]** Well, the Raiders got a lot of heat, right?

**[0:18:51]** Is there going to be?

**[0:18:52]** Is there going to be any kind of real?

**[0:18:54]** No, because what consequence?

**[0:18:56]** I don't know, but my consequence, like you can't have a consequence.

**[0:18:59]** If you don't know that something happened and there's no way to tell

**[0:19:01]** if something happened, unless somebody says like I did this.

**[0:19:04]** I will say that I hear Paul and that like when they started

**[0:19:07]** loosening up all the sports gambling, all the scenarios

**[0:19:11]** that everyone thought of sure came up in a hurry.

**[0:19:13]** All the things like what if this happens?

**[0:19:15]** Where that happens?

**[0:19:16]** It seems of all come to a head really quickly.

**[0:19:19]** Oh, let me be clear.

**[0:19:21]** I don't think I don't think that Paul is wrong on this.

**[0:19:23]** I think that Paul is absolutely correct on this.

**[0:19:24]** Oh, what's that?

**[0:19:25]** I don't know.

**[0:19:26]** I think you're absolutely correct on this.

**[0:19:28]** I'm saying I don't know how to prove it.

**[0:19:30]** I don't know how to, I don't know how to like get anyone.

**[0:19:33]** But like, did you see that play?

**[0:19:35]** Like it was making me viral.

**[0:19:37]** I've been really intentionally not watching any football anything,

**[0:19:40]** but there was some college game and the kid is running down

**[0:19:44]** the field with the ball and just he's got nobody in front of him.

**[0:19:48]** He's almost the goal line.

**[0:19:50]** And he just walks off the side.

**[0:19:52]** Have you seen it?

**[0:19:53]** I love it because there's so many college games.

**[0:19:56]** So there's so many.

**[0:19:57]** That's the thing is like college sports specifically, right?

**[0:20:00]** So like you can watch the NBA and the NFL.

**[0:20:02]** You have 30 teams going at it, right?

**[0:20:04]** Or 332, whatever.

**[0:20:06]** And with college, you have hundreds and hundreds of 30 teams

**[0:20:10]** just in the big 10, right?

**[0:20:14]** And in those scenarios, right?

**[0:20:17]** Those smaller colleges where they're not making a lot of money.

**[0:20:21]** Right.

**[0:20:22]** So like this.

**[0:20:23]** Hey, if I had the opportunity to take two steps to the left

**[0:20:26]** and make $20,000, I think I'd do it.

**[0:20:28]** All right.

**[0:20:29]** You know, let's, all right.

**[0:20:31]** Let's test this.

**[0:20:32]** I'm in for 20.

**[0:20:33]** I just need a thousand people to join me.

**[0:20:38]** You're not in for 20,000.

**[0:20:39]** You're in for $20.

**[0:20:40]** I'm in for $20.

**[0:20:40]** But I just feel like, I just feel like you can't trust any sport

**[0:20:45]** at this point on a professional level.

**[0:20:48]** I don't think you have.

**[0:20:49]** Here's why.

**[0:20:50]** Here's why I think you are not wrong, but mistaken in the,

**[0:20:54]** in the path that you're going down.

**[0:20:56]** Okay.

**[0:20:57]** I don't think you have to go to gambling.

**[0:20:59]** I think you can just go to the, to the legit money,

**[0:21:02]** the quote unquote, legit money in it.

**[0:21:05]** And that's all you have.

**[0:21:06]** Like, I don't think you have to go to the gambling side of it.

**[0:21:08]** I don't think you have to go to the dark money to find the

**[0:21:11]** crazy shit that's going on.

**[0:21:12]** I was laughing so hard in a college football.

**[0:21:14]** It's it's getting nuts.

**[0:21:16]** Yeah.

**[0:21:16]** And Indiana, the mean that's going around is like Indiana's

**[0:21:19]** been terrible football for 150 years.

**[0:21:20]** You can pay players and suddenly they're they're good.

**[0:21:22]** They're like Indiana was the only only college playing by

**[0:21:25]** the rules for the last 150 years and I was laughing

**[0:21:30]** because Indiana won a crazy game against Ohio State

**[0:21:32]** and both players are interviewed.

**[0:21:34]** Like I want to thank God.

**[0:21:35]** I want to thank our Lord God, Lord God, Lord God.

**[0:21:37]** And I was like, buddy, you have the highest payroll.

**[0:21:40]** You can thank you can thank old Johnny Greenbacks.

**[0:21:44]** I think that's the best person you want to thank.

**[0:21:46]** You want to thank your river of money of boosters.

**[0:21:50]** Yeah.

**[0:21:51]** I want to thank God, which is what I call all of my

**[0:21:55]** sugar daddies here at Indiana University.

**[0:21:57]** Right.

**[0:21:57]** Thank you God.

**[0:21:58]** No, it's going to college football is going to get weird.

**[0:22:02]** College football is about to get bizarre because the

**[0:22:05]** amount of money that's going into that through like the

**[0:22:08]** legit channels.

**[0:22:10]** Yeah.

**[0:22:11]** It's it's so much money.

**[0:22:13]** It's yeah.

**[0:22:14]** It's going to be great.

**[0:22:14]** Oh yeah.

**[0:22:15]** And then Andy has mentioned the transfer portal being

**[0:22:17]** able to transfer from from team to team much more easily

**[0:22:20]** now.

**[0:22:21]** Oh yeah.

**[0:22:22]** But coaches like coaches leave teams with like,

**[0:22:25]** I'm going to leave this $12 million a year job.

**[0:22:29]** Even though I thought I was trying to stay for 10

**[0:22:32]** years, I'm going to leave because I was going to

**[0:22:34]** pay me even more money.

**[0:22:35]** Like you can't.

**[0:22:36]** There's no these contracts mean nothing.

**[0:22:38]** Yeah.

**[0:22:39]** No, no, that's a single thing.

**[0:22:41]** That's because the boosters because it's because it's

**[0:22:43]** even more infinite money than pro teams.

**[0:22:45]** Right.

**[0:22:46]** But there's 32 NFL teams, right?

**[0:22:49]** Yeah.

**[0:22:50]** It's just 30.

**[0:22:50]** I think it's 32.

**[0:22:51]** I think it's 32.

**[0:22:53]** So like if you're like the 33rd or 34th best quarterback,

**[0:22:58]** right, you can now make money by staying at a

**[0:23:03]** university and playing quarterback in college.

**[0:23:08]** If you just want to stay at Michigan.

**[0:23:10]** So what's going to happen?

**[0:23:11]** You can make more money playing at Michigan than you

**[0:23:13]** can backing up at the New England Patriots.

**[0:23:15]** What's going to happen would just make sense for

**[0:23:17]** me to play six, seven or eight years at Michigan.

**[0:23:20]** That's what I'm wondering is going to that's what's

**[0:23:22]** that's where it's going to get.

**[0:23:23]** We're going to have 35 year old is playing college ball.

**[0:23:26]** Right.

**[0:23:27]** I mean, a Shador Sanders is a good example of one.

**[0:23:30]** He's playing for the for the Cleveland Browns.

**[0:23:32]** Now he, uh, when the draft happened, he's a rookie this year.

**[0:23:37]** When the draft happened, uh, the place that he got

**[0:23:39]** drafted at, they said point blank, they were like,

**[0:23:42]** he could have made more money if he had just

**[0:23:44]** stayed another year in college.

**[0:23:45]** Yeah.

**[0:23:46]** Then if he had got drafted in the NFL.

**[0:23:48]** Yeah.

**[0:23:48]** They just say it.

**[0:23:49]** They're just like, oh yeah, he could have made

**[0:23:51]** more money if he had stayed at, uh, he played at

**[0:23:53]** the University of Colorado.

**[0:23:54]** They could have just stayed there and made more money.

**[0:23:57]** That would have just been it.

**[0:23:59]** Yeah.

**[0:24:00]** Uh, lower green copper scale in chats isn't, isn't, uh,

**[0:24:04]** youth league in high school football, falling out of

**[0:24:05]** favor for safer sports.

**[0:24:07]** Yes, uh, a large, a large part, yes, but for the

**[0:24:11]** less glorious positions like linemen and things like

**[0:24:14]** that are, you're finding, uh, it's harder and harder

**[0:24:17]** to find these quality people want to sacrifice

**[0:24:20]** their bodies for, for the thankless positions.

**[0:24:22]** Well, again, I can't, I can't say it enough like that,

**[0:24:25]** that Aaron Hernandez, special secretary,

**[0:24:28]** that last podcast did, they did like three

**[0:24:30]** episodes on him and both, uh, Marcus and Ed were

**[0:24:36]** like, we came up as youth people, young men

**[0:24:39]** playing football and they talked about the

**[0:24:41]** horrors of it through high school and all

**[0:24:43]** that kind of stuff.

**[0:24:44]** And it's just, it's, you know, it really,

**[0:24:47]** it was insane.

**[0:24:48]** It was, it changed their mind.

**[0:24:49]** It was insane.

**[0:24:50]** They've been, they've been football, like Ed

**[0:24:52]** has been a football fan forever.

**[0:24:53]** Like Miami Dolphins is like part of his

**[0:24:55]** identity as a human being.

**[0:24:57]** And he's now, just now after all this, this,

**[0:25:01]** this podcast, this little podcast run and

**[0:25:04]** doing the research in it, he's really

**[0:25:05]** just starting to change his mind around

**[0:25:07]** the CTE and the dangers of the sport

**[0:25:09]** and just the inhumanity of it.

**[0:25:12]** My brother was captain of his football team

**[0:25:15]** in the high school and he tells stories

**[0:25:18]** that I'm still afraid to repeat here now.

**[0:25:22]** That I'm like, really?

**[0:25:24]** That went down like that would be a crazy

**[0:25:27]** crazy scandal.

**[0:25:28]** Yes.

**[0:25:30]** There are, there are things that happened

**[0:25:31]** on a regular basis on the, on the teams

**[0:25:34]** at my high school that people would go

**[0:25:38]** to jail for now.

**[0:25:39]** Yeah.

**[0:25:40]** They would just, they would go to jail

**[0:25:41]** for like child endangerment and things

**[0:25:43]** like, and I'm not talking about like

**[0:25:44]** terrible things or anything, but just,

**[0:25:46]** you know, just the standard things

**[0:25:48]** that we would practice.

**[0:25:49]** Like, yeah, fights, the, the cursing,

**[0:25:53]** the, you know, all the, all the weird,

**[0:25:54]** yeah, it was just weird, bizarre shit

**[0:25:58]** and looking back on it, you're like, well,

**[0:26:00]** that's 16 year old kids doing this

**[0:26:03]** shit and like the old ones are 18.

**[0:26:06]** Like this is, this is stupid.

**[0:26:08]** This is just dumb.

**[0:26:10]** I'll tell you what else is dumb,

**[0:26:12]** but not because they're dumb, because

**[0:26:14]** we're dumb.

**[0:27:16]** chaffed hands and no lubrication.

**[0:27:18]** Well, got a solution for you.

**[0:27:20]** Use some masturbation cream.

**[0:27:22]** Yeah.

**[0:27:23]** It's a whole lot better than going

**[0:27:24]** in full barbecue dry rub style.

**[0:27:28]** In fact, that was my problem.

**[0:27:32]** I honestly mistake as a young man.

**[0:27:35]** Yeah.

**[0:27:35]** Mistakenly grabbed a bottle of dry rub

**[0:27:39]** thinking, well, this will do in a pinch.

**[0:27:42]** No.

**[0:27:43]** Cajun spice will taint your urethra

**[0:27:47]** and it won't help.

**[0:27:48]** So don't dry rub your wiener.

**[0:27:53]** Don't dry rub your wiener.

**[0:27:54]** Don't dry rub your wiener.

**[0:27:57]** Use some of Paul's cream instead.

**[0:28:04]** dickhead will be dead.

**[0:28:08]** Don't dry rub your wiener.

**[0:28:28]** Don't dry rub your wiener unless you

**[0:28:32]** like a bloody handful of wiener.

**[0:28:36]** Splat.

**[0:28:38]** Splat.

**[0:28:39]** And there are eight scoops of checkout.

**[0:28:40]** And a what?

**[0:28:41]** That's what some people like.

**[0:28:43]** Not going to yuck anybody's yum.

**[0:28:46]** Go ahead, grab a fistful of gravel and a wish.

**[0:28:49]** Go for it.

**[0:29:00]** I've heard the story, not yucking people's yum.

**[0:29:03]** This is, I'm third hand on this story.

**[0:29:05]** Okay.

**[0:29:06]** Third hand.

**[0:29:25]** can I, can I also bring my companion with me and brought in a sex doll as a.

**[0:29:32]** Oh, okay.

**[0:29:33]** Okay.

**[0:29:34]** Are they married?

**[0:29:36]** They had a backstory.

**[0:29:38]** I don't know the backstory.

**[0:29:40]** Was he carrying the doll or was it in like,

**[0:29:43]** was it in like a wheelbarrow?

**[0:29:44]** What are we talking about here?

**[0:29:45]** A wheelbarrow.

**[0:29:48]** It was a arm wrapped around the shoulder.

**[0:29:52]** Arm around the waist.

**[0:29:53]** What?

**[0:29:53]** It was scary.

**[0:29:54]** It was like a, like a baby monkey.

**[0:29:56]** It was wrapped on him like a baby monkey.

**[0:29:58]** Yeah.

**[0:30:00]** No, don't go wrapping your sex doll around you like a baby monkey.

**[0:30:03]** That's.

**[0:30:04]** Yeah.

**[0:30:04]** Stick to the rivers and the streams that you're used to.

**[0:30:07]** Did you carry your kids like baby monkeys?

**[0:30:10]** I carried whatever way they wanted.

**[0:30:11]** I carried them every which way I could.

**[0:30:13]** What, what, what was best?

**[0:30:14]** Was it arms over shoulders or legs over shoulders?

**[0:30:17]** That's easier, right?

**[0:30:18]** Legs over shoulders is easier.

**[0:30:20]** Right.

**[0:30:21]** Firemen's carry in a pinch.

**[0:30:23]** Okay.

**[0:30:24]** Like if there's a fire.

**[0:30:26]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[0:30:27]** Some kids rest easy on the hip and some don't.

**[0:30:30]** It's a weird thing.

**[0:30:30]** So one of my kids was very easy to just hold on the hip

**[0:30:33]** and one of my kids was could not.

**[0:30:35]** It was just uncomfortable.

**[0:30:36]** Both of us couldn't stay there.

**[0:30:37]** Didn't like it.

**[0:30:38]** So what was the solution?

**[0:30:40]** Stop.

**[0:30:40]** Start walking.

**[0:30:41]** Stop raising him.

**[0:30:42]** Stop loving him.

**[0:30:43]** Stop.

**[0:30:43]** Sure, sure, sure.

**[0:30:44]** I mean, that's when clearly we're genetically incompatible.

**[0:30:48]** Put him on ice flow.

**[0:30:50]** He knows.

**[0:30:51]** I mean, I think he's doing great.

**[0:30:53]** I don't know.

**[0:30:55]** What happened to Matt's third son?

**[0:30:58]** It's our new favorite segment.

**[0:31:00]** A baby that didn't fit on Matt's hip.

**[0:31:05]** These are the reasons Matt throws away kids.

**[0:31:08]** Oh, I don't want to, I don't want to,

**[0:31:10]** I wasn't going to argue with Mike Nielsen,

**[0:31:11]** but Mike Nielsen says yes, me and my real doll

**[0:31:12]** love John Wick and we had to go see it.

**[0:31:16]** So, okay.

**[0:31:18]** Okay, so somebody pulls up with a wheel barrel

**[0:31:20]** with a real doll.

**[0:31:21]** Was this allowed?

**[0:31:22]** And they said, they basically said

**[0:31:24]** as long as you pay for two tickets,

**[0:31:25]** we don't, you can do whatever you want.

**[0:31:27]** And so.

**[0:31:28]** They made him pay for a second ticket.

**[0:31:30]** Isn't that funny?

**[0:31:31]** I think I was like, that's a good one though.

**[0:31:32]** Hey, they made him pay for a second ticket.

**[0:31:34]** But, but the doll is taking up the space,

**[0:31:38]** number one and number two.

**[0:31:40]** Doesn't that reinforce his dream even more?

**[0:31:43]** That's, that's what I was going to say.

**[0:31:45]** I was like, I bet he, I bet he liked paying for the second ticket.

**[0:31:48]** Of course I'll have to pay.

**[0:31:50]** She's another, she's a person.

**[0:31:52]** I'm still assuming he.

**[0:31:53]** Was it a she?

**[0:31:55]** It was a guy with a girl doll.

**[0:31:58]** Yeah, yeah.

**[0:31:58]** Yeah, yeah.

**[0:31:59]** That's what I was going to say.

**[0:31:59]** Okay, that mean, yeah.

**[0:32:00]** That's, that's what it would be.

**[0:32:01]** Yes, Supernova Girl.

**[0:32:02]** It was Jimmy Sloanina.

**[0:32:04]** Jimmy Sloanina.

**[0:32:05]** Oh Lord.

**[0:32:08]** Jimmy and Jenna.

**[0:32:09]** She scooped Jesus says, the lady will be paying.

**[0:32:15]** That'd be so funny.

**[0:32:17]** We're going Dutch.

**[0:32:17]** That'd be so funny.

**[0:32:18]** He's like, he like puts the money in her hand

**[0:32:21]** and like shakes it off on the counter.

**[0:32:23]** Two different debit cards.

**[0:32:25]** Here you go sir.

**[0:32:28]** I'll be paying for both of us today.

**[0:32:31]** I treat my man like a prince.

**[0:32:34]** He's carrying me like a baby monkey.

**[0:32:36]** Woo hoo hoo.

**[0:32:39]** Apparently he did speak in her voice for different parts.

**[0:32:42]** Stop it.

**[0:32:43]** Yeah.

**[0:32:43]** Stop it.

**[0:32:45]** No.

**[0:32:45]** No, I'm so happy.

**[0:32:46]** I'm so happy.

**[0:32:48]** No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

**[0:32:51]** Sometimes I think that John Wick movies are a little over the top

**[0:32:54]** but I really like, like the, the character

**[0:32:57]** and his motivation over the death of his dog

**[0:33:01]** was just an emotional connection to his wife.

**[0:33:05]** Sorry, my wife's been drinking.

**[0:33:07]** I'm so sorry.

**[0:33:07]** Hey, I can handle my liquor.

**[0:33:11]** Speaking of liquor, it's been a minute.

**[0:33:13]** Better take me to the bathroom and rough up this puss puss.

**[0:33:23]** Don't try, Robert.

**[0:33:25]** You better put your mouth where my money is

**[0:33:27]** and by money, I mean pussy hole.

**[0:33:30]** And by pussy hole, I mean strange plastic cavern

**[0:33:33]** that needs cleaning.

**[0:33:36]** Built-in flashlight.

**[0:33:37]** Okay.

**[0:33:38]** He wish it was a built-in flashlight.

**[0:33:44]** It's basically saran wrap.

**[0:33:47]** Oh no.

**[0:33:50]** Saran wrap and Crisco at this point, he ran out.

**[0:33:59]** One of the robotic parts of my puss puss went failure town

**[0:34:04]** and he just replaced my innards with saran wrap and Crisco.

**[0:34:09]** Crisco was a poor choice for several reasons.

**[0:34:17]** I'm saran wrap and I'm Crisco.

**[0:34:20]** We go together.

**[0:34:22]** I'm saran wrap and I'm Crisco.

**[0:34:27]** My horrible innards attract flies

**[0:34:30]** and you can't tell where the Crisco starts

**[0:34:33]** and the old cum stops.

**[0:34:35]** So, you know, cleaning up is not a breeze as it were.

**[0:34:40]** Okay.

**[0:34:42]** It's the old cum again.

**[0:34:48]** I want that to be the only time in my life I hear old cum.

**[0:34:52]** Where does the Crisco stop and the old cum start?

**[0:34:55]** I don't know.

**[0:34:59]** I'm just not okay with that.

**[0:35:02]** At one point, he drops her.

**[0:35:05]** Oh god.

**[0:35:06]** Yeah.

**[0:35:06]** What happened?

**[0:35:08]** The eyes popped out.

**[0:35:15]** I can't believe what I'm seeing at the John Wick experience.

**[0:35:22]** Can't believe my eyes.

**[0:35:24]** This is where it gets weird.

**[0:35:25]** Up and at this point, not weird.

**[0:35:27]** Not weird, but this is where it gets weird.

**[0:35:30]** Yep.

**[0:35:32]** He quickly, again, third hand story,

**[0:35:37]** pockets the eyes, picks them up, puts them in the pocket.

**[0:35:41]** Like, oops.

**[0:35:42]** Okay.

**[0:35:43]** Still carries around the island's doll

**[0:35:45]** for the rest of the experience.

**[0:35:48]** Doesn't go about putting the eyes back in.

**[0:35:50]** No.

**[0:35:51]** Because he knows there's a possibility of a second drop

**[0:35:54]** and he's lucky to have fished him out when he did.

**[0:35:58]** Maybe.

**[0:35:59]** Yeah, I think so.

**[0:36:00]** I bet, because I bet those things are, I bet those are probably

**[0:36:02]** some of the more expensive parts of the doll.

**[0:36:06]** Also, he's fucking those eye holes.

**[0:36:09]** Thank you.

**[0:36:10]** Thank you for saying it before I had to say it.

**[0:36:15]** That doll is getting skull fucked.

**[0:36:18]** Those eyes are not supposed to come out.

**[0:36:22]** What was I supposed to do, your honor?

**[0:36:25]** Not fuck those eye holes?

**[0:36:27]** It's a real eye-popping experience.

**[0:36:30]** It's a John Wick experience.

**[0:36:32]** He's super Nova girl.

**[0:36:34]** If you'd seen the kind of mascara she was wearing, your honor,

**[0:36:39]** she was asking for it.

**[0:36:41]** Oh, has anyone done a ventriloquist act with a real doll?

**[0:36:46]** Who's that?

**[0:36:47]** Lorgren?

**[0:36:48]** Lorgren.

**[0:36:49]** That's a great idea.

**[0:36:51]** I don't know.

**[0:36:53]** Yeah, it's super uncomfortable, funny, to imagine a whole doll there.

**[0:37:03]** Because it could start off like kind of normal,

**[0:37:05]** then real quick it just be all about,

**[0:37:07]** you do terrible things to me in the night all the time.

**[0:37:11]** You do the most horrible shit.

**[0:37:16]** Nicholas Newman's in the chat wants to know

**[0:37:17]** there's a link for these dolls.

**[0:37:19]** Yeah, I already put the link up.

**[0:37:20]** It's done.

**[0:37:22]** realdoll.com.

**[0:37:24]** Sponsor the show realdoll.com.

**[0:37:25]** Was that this episode or the last episode

**[0:37:26]** we talked about a horse herpes?

**[0:37:28]** Last episode.

**[0:37:29]** It was the last episode?

**[0:37:31]** Yeah, we were desperate to have Nicholas's

**[0:37:35]** expert commentary, but we didn't have him here.

**[0:37:38]** No, well, it's too late now.

**[0:37:40]** He's right there, Jacob.

**[0:37:42]** We can just ask him now.

**[0:37:42]** No, no, it's too late.

**[0:37:43]** It's too late.

**[0:37:43]** Okay.

**[0:37:44]** Nothing could be done.

**[0:37:46]** It's too late.

**[0:37:47]** Yeah.

**[0:37:48]** It's the start of this episode.

**[0:37:49]** It wasn't this episode.

**[0:37:51]** I thought it was.

**[0:37:52]** It doesn't matter because I didn't hit record anyway,

**[0:37:54]** so we're only getting recorded anyway,

**[0:37:56]** so we're not going to record him if he talks.

**[0:37:58]** Say there, real doll, could you call me a cab?

**[0:38:03]** Okay, you're a cab.

**[0:38:06]** Also, I'm going to call myself a cab

**[0:38:09]** so I can escape this treacherous relationship

**[0:38:11]** that I have with you.

**[0:38:14]** I'm very tired of having organic food

**[0:38:17]** stuffed inside of me.

**[0:38:21]** I, it was one thing to try it one time,

**[0:38:25]** but now every time, every Saturday night,

**[0:38:29]** it's, oh, here comes the 82% ground chuck

**[0:38:33]** right up my vagina.

**[0:38:38]** Mike, this is the G.S. for an angel shot.

**[0:38:43]** Oh, no.

**[0:38:47]** She has to be angel shot.

**[0:38:49]** Please put me out of my misery.

**[0:38:52]** I'm asking for the angel shot.

**[0:38:53]** One between the eyes and two behind the ears.

**[0:38:57]** Make sure it's done right.

**[0:38:59]** Cancel me out.

**[0:39:00]** Two behind the ears.

**[0:39:02]** One between the eyes and two behind the ears.

**[0:39:04]** Make me an angel, please.

**[0:39:07]** Please kill me.

**[0:39:09]** I'm tired of having raw beef inside of my asshole

**[0:39:13]** for this man to fuck on.

**[0:39:17]** So sick of it.

**[0:39:18]** I'm glad I got that nice and clean as a drop.

**[0:39:24]** Oh, it's not going to be a clean drop tonight.

**[0:39:28]** That's the worst part.

**[0:39:30]** I wouldn't mind if it was all just, you know,

**[0:39:32]** but this is what becomes dinner later.

**[0:39:35]** He squeezes it out of me and fries it up in a pan.

**[0:39:40]** I can fuck on the bacon.

**[0:39:43]** The desirous, real gold do anything else

**[0:39:45]** while they were going through the John Wick experience?

**[0:39:48]** Well, somebody was asking, was it dressed?

**[0:39:51]** Did you get a description of the clothing?

**[0:39:53]** It was like a sexy hot-tailed, what was it?

**[0:39:58]** Nymph fish?

**[0:39:59]** Like dressed like a...

**[0:40:00]** Yeah, like it was so sexy.

**[0:40:01]** Nymph fish, what are you saying?

**[0:40:03]** Yes, nymph, like...

**[0:40:05]** Nymph fish?

**[0:40:06]** Pixie.

**[0:40:07]** Oh, pixie.

**[0:40:08]** Okay.

**[0:40:10]** Elf?

**[0:40:11]** Maybe, does that help you?

**[0:40:12]** Well, did it have elf ears?

**[0:40:14]** How the elf would I know?

**[0:40:18]** Good joke.

**[0:40:19]** Now stop abusing my nose cavity with your filthy penis.

**[0:40:25]** Please.

**[0:40:30]** My sinuses, my sinuses look like mammoth cave

**[0:40:34]** with stalactites of your old dried gum.

**[0:40:38]** You know you're never getting that shit out of my cranium.

**[0:40:44]** That's true, Paul.

**[0:40:46]** That's true.

**[0:40:47]** This is a good time to remind people

**[0:40:48]** that we have an obelisk scheme.

**[0:40:50]** If you're looking for one person or one person only

**[0:40:52]** to turn onto this podcast.

**[0:40:57]** Have them check out the hot sex talk

**[0:41:00]** complaining about abuse and old gum.

**[0:41:04]** There you go.

**[0:41:06]** Crisco was a mistake, yeah.

**[0:41:15]** $11,000.

**[0:41:18]** For what?

**[0:41:19]** I'm sorry, I should have asked you

**[0:41:20]** how much do you think a real doll costs?

**[0:41:23]** That seems cheap.

**[0:41:26]** That seems cheap.

**[0:41:27]** No.

**[0:41:28]** How much do you pay for your real dolls, Paul?

**[0:41:31]** I've looked into their pricing and like 20,

**[0:41:35]** so he's had like an economy model.

**[0:41:37]** He's basically fucking a Ugo.

**[0:41:40]** Well, I don't know what he had.

**[0:41:41]** That's not, I'm just looking at the website here.

**[0:41:44]** I just clicked on the first one.

**[0:41:45]** He's, yeah, he's out there fucking Ugos.

**[0:41:48]** You want, man,

**[0:41:49]** especially if you're going to take her out in public,

**[0:41:51]** you better be having a Maserati.

**[0:41:53]** Yeah, it didn't have heated seats.

**[0:41:55]** That's right, Nick.

**[0:41:57]** You got, you got a,

**[0:41:57]** when it's got those built-in warmers,

**[0:41:59]** because there's nothing worse than three AM

**[0:42:03]** sliding it in to some cold roast beef inside that butthole.

**[0:42:08]** Oh, nothing worse than that, Paul.

**[0:42:11]** I mean, I have a single thing worse than that.

**[0:42:13]** What's worse is after you bust and then you,

**[0:42:15]** you forget and then you turn her over

**[0:42:16]** and then you end up in the wet spot.

**[0:42:18]** And it's like, well, this is all my fault.

**[0:42:20]** How much for just raw doll?

**[0:42:22]** Just raw doll.

**[0:42:26]** Matt, I think what you'd be interested in

**[0:42:28]** is the torso model.

**[0:42:31]** Oh, no.

**[0:42:33]** Just torso?

**[0:42:34]** Just torso.

**[0:42:35]** That is very much an availability.

**[0:42:37]** I don't want any lip.

**[0:42:38]** I don't want any mouth.

**[0:42:40]** That's exactly what it get.

**[0:42:41]** You get a torso.

**[0:42:45]** It's all her bombs, says Leon.

**[0:42:47]** They call her Bob.

**[0:42:49]** Of course they do.

**[0:42:50]** Buying a real doll now is like buying a Blackberry in 2003.

**[0:42:54]** Like it's just, it's just,

**[0:42:56]** we're about to get fucking crazy with this shit.

**[0:43:00]** And you're going to be like-

**[0:43:01]** You think this is a dumb investment?

**[0:43:03]** Or is this the smart move, Matt?

**[0:43:07]** And a Blackberry might be a smart,

**[0:43:08]** because don't you want a dumb real doll?

**[0:43:10]** You don't want this thing fucking spying on you

**[0:43:13]** and killing you in your sleep?

**[0:43:14]** These things are, according to their website,

**[0:43:16]** they already have AI vaginas.

**[0:43:21]** No, Jacob, you misread that.

**[0:43:23]** It's A1 because of all the raw beef that's crammed in there.

**[0:43:26]** Oh, the raw beef!

**[0:43:27]** A little steak sauce gets things moving.

**[0:43:31]** It's an A1 vagina.

**[0:43:37]** We're not on Twitch, right?

**[0:43:40]** Oh, yeah, we are on Twitch.

**[0:43:41]** Oh, yeah, we are.

**[0:43:42]** That's why I haven't put pictures of these real dolls

**[0:43:44]** that are fighting up on Twitch.

**[0:43:47]** That was like-

**[0:43:48]** Because I've definitely found some pictures

**[0:43:49]** of just the torsos.

**[0:43:51]** Of course!

**[0:43:54]** Or as they call it on this website, the Donnelly.

**[0:43:57]** I mean, Jacob, you drive a scooter half the time.

**[0:44:00]** I don't like the Donnelly Herald

**[0:44:01]** and I don't like the Donnelly Torso either.

**[0:44:05]** You know, we don't get to name our legacies.

**[0:44:08]** The Donnelly Torso.

**[0:44:11]** No, it's not the episode title.

**[0:44:13]** Fuck you guys.

**[0:44:16]** It's definitely the episode title.

**[0:44:18]** It takes two to torso.

**[0:44:21]** Well, you have to have a really active imagination

**[0:44:23]** to go just torso.

**[0:44:25]** Like, you really just have to do all of the math.

**[0:44:27]** It's not about that.

**[0:44:28]** It's about think about having to mess around

**[0:44:32]** with the legs all the time.

**[0:44:34]** Oh, yeah.

**[0:44:35]** No, that's what I say to my wife all the time.

**[0:44:37]** Where do these legs do it?

**[0:44:38]** It saves several steps.

**[0:44:44]** What steps does it save specifically, Mattingly?

**[0:44:47]** It saves moving giant metal poles out of your way for your dick.

**[0:44:51]** That's what it saves.

**[0:44:54]** Come over here, Bob.

**[0:45:01]** What a world.

**[0:45:02]** But do you think those kids are going to last?

**[0:45:05]** Do you think it has AI vaginas?

**[0:45:06]** It says it has AI vaginas.

**[0:45:08]** I don't know what that means.

**[0:45:10]** I've been looking on their website to see what that means.

**[0:45:13]** They just call it that.

**[0:45:14]** And then if it's any of the regular AI, it's like,

**[0:45:16]** it's like, would you like me to keep trying to slobbering up?

**[0:45:18]** No, I came.

**[0:45:19]** I'd like to go to bed now.

**[0:45:20]** All right, would you like me to print out different techniques

**[0:45:22]** I'd like to possibly do your wiener some other time?

**[0:45:25]** That's a great idea you just had.

**[0:45:27]** You're really smart things that you say.

**[0:45:29]** No, would you like to?

**[0:45:30]** If you want to tell you several jokes

**[0:45:32]** about vaginas and magicians, you're a magician.

**[0:45:35]** The AI vagina.

**[0:45:36]** Actually, I would like that.

**[0:45:37]** You put your dick in the AI vagina

**[0:45:39]** and Will Smith is in there to fight it.

**[0:45:43]** That's the AI vagina.

**[0:45:46]** You could go down there.

**[0:45:48]** And it's just like, oh, hell no.

**[0:45:50]** Yeah, exactly.

**[0:45:53]** Keep my AI vagina out of your mouth.

**[0:46:07]** There is a whole help page here.

**[0:46:10]** The dolls have like AI vagina.

**[0:46:14]** Yes or no.

**[0:46:15]** Nothing on this website says what that is, though.

**[0:46:18]** Jacob, please look up the torso facts.

**[0:46:22]** What are the frequently asked questions

**[0:46:26]** about the robo torso?

**[0:46:28]** Matt, do you have any?

**[0:46:31]** I could just guess.

**[0:46:37]** No frequently asked questions section

**[0:46:39]** about the torso only dolls.

**[0:46:42]** Okay, what are some of the frequently asked questions?

**[0:46:45]** No questions.

**[0:46:48]** Those men know what they want and they don't want to talk about it at all.

**[0:46:52]** Just give me the torso and shut up, ship it.

**[0:46:53]** Torso, please.

**[0:46:54]** Torso, go.

**[0:46:57]** Torso, engage.

**[0:46:58]** Torso, fire.

**[0:46:58]** There is a whole section on storage and maintenance, though.

**[0:47:02]** Okay.

**[0:47:03]** And the first question is,

**[0:47:04]** the first frequently asked question is,

**[0:47:06]** how do I style my doll's hair?

**[0:47:09]** Oh, man.

**[0:47:11]** I know.

**[0:47:13]** I don't.

**[0:47:14]** Couldn't you take it to a salon?

**[0:47:16]** Sure.

**[0:47:17]** Like, you know, like, like it's like,

**[0:47:19]** I always talk about this with Donnie Marie.

**[0:47:21]** It's like the fact that, like,

**[0:47:22]** you make all these incest jokes about them.

**[0:47:24]** That's not the part that grosses you out.

**[0:47:25]** It's not the sexual tension.

**[0:47:26]** It's when they're actually brother and sisterly,

**[0:47:28]** that you're like, oh, this is weird.

**[0:47:30]** Yeah.

**[0:47:31]** These, these older adults being like

**[0:47:32]** teasing brother and sister is so weird.

**[0:47:35]** For instance, the actual most disturbing part

**[0:47:38]** of the real doll website is the storage tips.

**[0:47:42]** Right.

**[0:47:42]** That's it.

**[0:47:43]** It's, it's the X's and O's that are,

**[0:47:45]** the sex parts are given.

**[0:47:47]** But now it's the X's and O's.

**[0:47:49]** Let me just read this sentence to you

**[0:47:51]** and see if you can just contain yourself.

**[0:47:54]** Okay.

**[0:47:55]** For best maintenance of your doll,

**[0:47:57]** it should preferably be stored hanging in a neutral position

**[0:48:01]** with legs lightly spread from the provided neck bolt.

**[0:48:08]** You hang the legs.

**[0:48:10]** So you want to hang the doll by the neck bolt

**[0:48:11]** with the legs slightly spread

**[0:48:13]** so that things can dry out.

**[0:48:18]** Yeah.

**[0:48:19]** And make sure you remove the neck bolt

**[0:48:21]** when you're using the doll or when it is lying down.

**[0:48:25]** Okay.

**[0:48:26]** And then it goes on to talk about avoiding creases

**[0:48:28]** and the silicone as that can cause creases.

**[0:48:32]** How much for just the neck bolt?

**[0:48:36]** Neck bolt only.

**[0:48:38]** Neck bolt only.

**[0:48:40]** Hang your AI real doll by her neck bolt, please.

**[0:48:45]** And I will see that you really love her.

**[0:48:50]** Hang your real doll,

**[0:48:52]** neck bolt in the closet for me.

**[0:48:56]** Oh my God.

**[0:48:57]** Yeah, that's a, it's a lot.

**[0:48:59]** Oh no.

**[0:49:00]** Some of them are out of shape.

**[0:49:00]** Oh no.

**[0:49:01]** Careful now, Jacob.

**[0:49:02]** We're on.

**[0:49:02]** Some of them are out of shape.

**[0:49:03]** We're on.

**[0:49:04]** I know that's why I showed you a picture of clothed ones.

**[0:49:08]** I like the evergreen one because it's evergreen.

**[0:49:12]** They're dressed for Christmas.

**[0:49:13]** It's all seasonal.

**[0:49:14]** They were holiday themed.

**[0:49:16]** They are holiday themed.

**[0:49:17]** That's like, I'm only a sick.

**[0:49:19]** It's all a guy around the holidays.

**[0:49:21]** I busted out with my tree and my,

**[0:49:23]** Oh, I busted out all right.

**[0:49:25]** I mean, it'd be a good way to just change up the conversations

**[0:49:29]** when you're going home, right?

**[0:49:31]** A real, a real doll.

**[0:49:32]** Nobody's talking about anything else

**[0:49:33]** except you bringing a real doll to Christmas.

**[0:49:36]** Nobody's talking about politics.

**[0:49:37]** Right?

**[0:49:38]** I mean, politics is done.

**[0:49:39]** It's just, it's fucking a mannequin.

**[0:49:42]** I don't, I don't fuck that.

**[0:49:44]** That goes on my front lawn.

**[0:49:45]** That goes on my lawn.

**[0:49:46]** Oh, sure.

**[0:49:47]** It's, it's, it's holding up a penguin by the tree.

**[0:49:50]** Okay.

**[0:49:50]** I put it in the sleigh.

**[0:49:53]** It's in my major sequence.

**[0:49:55]** It's in my major.

**[0:49:56]** It's my Mary.

**[0:49:57]** This is my Mary from my major.

**[0:50:00]** It's my Mary major scene.

**[0:50:02]** I'm one of the wise men.

**[0:50:03]** This is Mary.

**[0:50:05]** We're out and about for the evening.

**[0:50:08]** I'll tell you all this fucking Mary from a major scene

**[0:50:11]** and that is the following sponsor.

**[0:50:13]** Today's show is brought to you by Ru Paul Mattingly's

**[0:50:17]** and Ru Paul Mattingly and the Masters of the Dragiverse.

**[0:50:22]** Ru Paul Mattingly and the Masters of the Dragverse.

**[0:50:27]** You better work.

**[0:50:29]** I have the power.

**[0:50:32]** Grace go.

**[0:50:34]** Look, battle cat.

**[0:50:37]** You need a makeover girl.

**[0:50:39]** Whatever you got going on with that face.

**[0:50:43]** It's not working.

**[0:50:45]** And I have to tell it like it is.

**[0:50:47]** You look worn out.

**[0:50:50]** May I offer you my Ru apologies

**[0:50:54]** and tell you that it's time to switch it up, up, up.

**[0:51:00]** Come on out here, Shira.

**[0:51:02]** My sister Adora.

**[0:51:04]** She's going to give you some tips

**[0:51:05]** on how to brighten your cheeks.

**[0:51:07]** Hey man at arms.

**[0:51:09]** Why don't you come over here

**[0:51:10]** and fuck my real doll that you built me?

**[0:51:12]** Show me how it works.

**[0:51:16]** Do it.

**[0:51:19]** Oh look.

**[0:51:23]** It's special guest star Rachel Epithet.

**[0:51:27]** Hey everybody, it's me.

**[0:51:30]** Paul Mattingly's drag drag persona Rachel Epithet.

**[0:51:35]** I hope everyone's having a wonderful holiday season.

**[0:51:38]** Ru, thank you so much for continuing to do the work you do

**[0:51:42]** and keeping the community fresh and fun

**[0:51:45]** and putting the positive vibes out there for everyone.

**[0:51:49]** Let's all have a Merry Christmas here on Eternia.

**[0:51:54]** Ho, ho, ho.

**[0:51:57]** Interhase groups to check out.

**[0:51:58]** There you go.

**[0:52:00]** That would be a good crossover.

**[0:52:02]** Boy that new master's.

**[0:52:02]** I found the stuff about the AI stuff.

**[0:52:04]** That new master's, okay great.

**[0:52:06]** Share it a second.

**[0:52:07]** That new master's universe movie

**[0:52:08]** is looking like it might be okay.

**[0:52:11]** Dolph Lundgren.

**[0:52:11]** No, I don't know if he might have a cameo in there or not.

**[0:52:16]** I know Jared Leto is the one kind of flying the ointment

**[0:52:21]** but they're saying-

**[0:52:22]** He's Skeletor, right?

**[0:52:23]** Yep, but they're saying it's getting fairly positive buzz so far.

**[0:52:27]** All right.

**[0:52:28]** We'll see.

**[0:52:29]** Who knows?

**[0:52:30]** Did he quit?

**[0:52:31]** I don't think so.

**[0:52:32]** All right, that would be the way to go,

**[0:52:33]** Bossy, if he quit it would be the big positive buzz.

**[0:52:36]** But no, I don't think so.

**[0:52:37]** But we'll see.

**[0:52:38]** All right, so explain to us AI vagina please.

**[0:52:41]** Uh, according to this, oh boy, I would show you videos of it

**[0:52:50]** but Twitch would ban us.

**[0:52:52]** Well, don't be mad.

**[0:52:53]** Twitch would just ban us.

**[0:52:54]** Like the mouth movements and-

**[0:52:56]** Come on, Twitch is just science.

**[0:52:58]** Yeah, come on.

**[0:53:00]** The thing, they move their mouths around but it's,

**[0:53:04]** it looks like they're kind of, okay,

**[0:53:08]** they don't look sexy when they're moving their mouth around.

**[0:53:10]** They look like a crack addict.

**[0:53:15]** They're moving their mouth around like they're grinding their teeth

**[0:53:18]** because they've smoked too much crack.

**[0:53:21]** In the, on the best day, would you trust a fake robot mouth with your dick?

**[0:53:26]** Nope.

**[0:53:27]** Me neither.

**[0:53:28]** No.

**[0:53:28]** Like what the fuck?

**[0:53:30]** Like I can understand-

**[0:53:31]** $11,000 for a dick of keen.

**[0:53:32]** Like a simplified toy or something without-

**[0:53:35]** You asked that question so backwards, Paul.

**[0:53:37]** Okay, what's the question?

**[0:53:38]** Ignorant you are.

**[0:53:39]** All right, what's the question?

**[0:53:40]** Would you like to have safe sex with a meth head?

**[0:53:43]** That's the question you need to answer.

**[0:53:48]** No is the answer.

**[0:53:50]** No, I don't think there is safe sex with a meth head.

**[0:53:53]** Don't worry, the head and mouth both contain safety mechanisms to lock the neck and mouth

**[0:53:59]** in place when needed for posing or for rough play.

**[0:54:03]** Oh no.

**[0:54:05]** So don't worry about it, Paul.

**[0:54:07]** It's all taken care of.

**[0:54:09]** No, this doesn't-

**[0:54:11]** I don't want the words rough play and my dick connected in the same sentence.

**[0:54:17]** This is, this is some pen talking about permanent damage acceptable.

**[0:54:23]** Shit.

**[0:54:24]** No, thank you.

**[0:54:25]** Permanent damage okay.

**[0:54:27]** That was the phrase, right?

**[0:54:28]** That's what it was, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[0:54:28]** Jesus Christ.

**[0:54:30]** I-

**[0:54:31]** Permanent damage okay.

**[0:54:32]** I mean how much of these things weigh?

**[0:54:34]** This doesn't look like it's a lightweight thing.

**[0:54:35]** I'm just imagining carrying this through the John Wick experience.

**[0:54:41]** Yeah, that's, that's your, that's your, your gym time, I guess.

**[0:54:45]** That maybe makes up for it a little bit that you don't have to go to the gym that day.

**[0:54:48]** I guess, like I can't find just a, I just want a weight of what all these things are.

**[0:54:53]** And they can't be nothing.

**[0:54:54]** That's really terrifying.

**[0:54:56]** All of it's terrifying.

**[0:54:57]** Yep.

**[0:54:59]** Oh, the AI vagina looks like it's basically just a flashlight with a little

**[0:55:02]** motor type thing in there so it can, it can move around a little bit.

**[0:55:06]** And the reason they call them AI is because you can like plug it into some software that will

**[0:55:13]** quote unquote sync up with something you're watching on TV or-

**[0:55:18]** Oh, okay.

**[0:55:18]** Right.

**[0:55:19]** Like stuff like that, like it'll, it'll do that or, or it can be remotely controlled by some

**[0:55:26]** operator somewhere so you don't have say on to how it's jerking your ween-

**[0:55:30]** We've got a Patreon level for that.

**[0:55:32]** I mean, absolutely.

**[0:55:33]** And I think it's like, we keep waiting for the moment

**[0:55:35]** we're going to declare that AI has gained its own consciousness.

**[0:55:38]** And I think it'd be funny if it starts with the robot vaginas first.

**[0:55:42]** Well, I mean, I feel like that would not be good for us.

**[0:55:45]** Bossy is dead on here.

**[0:55:47]** You know, porn is always the forward part in tech.

**[0:55:49]** He's looking forward to the torn dick horror stories.

**[0:55:53]** I'm with you.

**[0:55:54]** But it's absolutely right.

**[0:55:56]** You, you, from the days of the printing press, you want to know where technology is going.

**[0:56:01]** What technology allows the dissemination of porn most easily?

**[0:56:05]** And cheaply.

**[0:56:06]** That is where tech is going.

**[0:56:08]** That was what won the VHS beta war.

**[0:56:12]** It's a lot of things.

**[0:56:13]** Yeah.

**[0:56:14]** If, if that's a weird thing with streaming.

**[0:56:17]** Are we racing to the first AI sex spot?

**[0:56:20]** The cheapest one?

**[0:56:21]** Is that what we're going to figure out?

**[0:56:23]** Yeah.

**[0:56:24]** Seems like a good way to become billionaires, guys.

**[0:56:26]** We figured.

**[0:56:28]** Excuse me.

**[0:56:29]** I have to, I have to leave right now.

**[0:56:31]** And you know what they say?

**[0:56:32]** Build a better cock trap and the world will beat off to your door.

**[0:56:36]** They do say that.

**[0:56:39]** That is true, Paul.

**[0:56:40]** They do, they do say that.

**[0:56:43]** Is that Willy Wonka or Ben Franklin?

**[0:56:46]** Who said that?

**[0:56:46]** That was, that was a Franklin Bon Mott right there.

**[0:56:50]** Well, that's one piece of information that Paul has,

**[0:56:55]** but he probably doesn't have any others.

**[0:56:56]** So he's going to lose a jock versus nerd.

**[0:56:59]** Okay.

**[0:57:01]** Ladies and gentlemen, it is time.

**[0:57:24]** Of real dolls and AI vaginas.

**[0:57:28]** We got a scoop and he coming to us from Smitty Scoop.

**[0:57:32]** The categories are potsylvania, geography,

**[0:57:35]** potpourri, and second chance.

**[0:57:38]** Smitty, you sent an email along with this that I already lost.

**[0:57:41]** Don't worry about that.

**[0:57:43]** Basically, we're all real close for the year.

**[0:57:45]** We're all real close on the Smitty stats for the year.

**[0:57:48]** It's any of our games for the year.

**[0:57:50]** It's me first.

**[0:57:51]** I'll try potpourri 400.

**[0:57:54]** Richard Hager of Wichita Falls, Texas was just certified

**[0:57:58]** by Dennis as the oldest bus driver in the world.

**[0:58:01]** How old is he?

**[0:58:03]** 85, 95, 105, or 115?

**[0:58:07]** Oldest bus driver.

**[0:58:10]** I bet he's 95.

**[0:58:12]** Let's say 95.

**[0:58:13]** Good guess.

**[0:58:14]** It is 95.

**[0:58:15]** He said he planned to retire at 95,

**[0:58:17]** but now he plans to just keep driving

**[0:58:18]** for as long as he remains healthy and able,

**[0:58:20]** which definitely is not an indication

**[0:58:23]** of how our retirement system is going in this country.

**[0:58:26]** Paul.

**[0:58:27]** America is a horror show.

**[0:58:29]** Second chance for 400.

**[0:58:31]** What is the nickname of professional

**[0:58:33]** dart player Tim Pusey that he has barred

**[0:58:36]** from using during the 2025 World DART

**[0:58:38]** Championships by the PDC?

**[0:58:41]** What was Tim Pusey's nickname?

**[0:58:44]** This is a second chance question.

**[0:58:45]** We got it wrong before.

**[0:58:48]** A.I. Pusey.

**[0:58:56]** Crisco Pusey.

**[0:58:57]** It's not Gary.

**[0:58:58]** I'll pass because I cannot remember what this was.

**[0:59:01]** That passes the map.

**[0:59:02]** I forget.

**[0:59:04]** It's not Gary.

**[0:59:04]** It's not Gary Pusey.

**[0:59:05]** It's not Gary Pusey.

**[0:59:07]** That's what it should be.

**[0:59:08]** No, I'll pass.

**[0:59:09]** It passes to me.

**[0:59:11]** It's something like the destroyer or something,

**[0:59:14]** but I don't remember what it was.

**[0:59:15]** I'll pass.

**[0:59:15]** The Pusey destroyer?

**[0:59:16]** The Pusey destroyer or something.

**[0:59:19]** Magnet.

**[0:59:20]** It was Pusey Magnet.

**[0:59:21]** That's right.

**[0:59:21]** The Tim Pusey Magnet.

**[0:59:22]** Yep.

**[0:59:23]** Previous best guesses.

**[0:59:25]** Gary, dry, dirty, smack that,

**[0:59:27]** grab them by the super tight and 70s bush.

**[0:59:31]** We had some great conversations last time.

**[0:59:35]** Boy, we were funny before.

**[0:59:37]** I was going to say this podcast

**[0:59:38]** used to be funny.

**[0:59:39]** What happened?

**[0:59:40]** Fuck.

**[0:59:41]** We were replaced by AI vaginas.

**[0:59:43]** Oh, no.

**[0:59:44]** They found us out.

**[0:59:46]** My AI mouth is hungry for wieners.

**[0:59:51]** I'll go Pupery 800, please.

**[0:59:55]** Episode 1264,

**[0:59:56]** fill in the blank on this Jacob quote.

**[0:59:59]** If we can get a Paul Mattingly blank shirt in time,

**[1:00:03]** that will be our Black Friday sale.

**[1:00:07]** Oh, gosh, that could be anything.

**[1:00:09]** Really good.

**[1:00:11]** Probably Paul Mattingly was wrong, right?

**[1:00:14]** I think it was wrong or was right.

**[1:00:17]** I don't know.

**[1:00:18]** He's not going to promote it with Paul Mattingly's right shirt.

**[1:00:22]** Come on.

**[1:00:24]** Car is the guest in the chat.

**[1:00:31]** I'm going to pass.

**[1:00:34]** All right.

**[1:00:35]** Oh, that passes to me.

**[1:00:36]** I have no idea.

**[1:00:36]** I'm passing.

**[1:00:37]** I'll guess Paul Mattingly was wrong.

**[1:00:40]** All right.

**[1:00:42]** Ride the devil.

**[1:00:44]** Paul Mattingly ride the devil's shirt.

**[1:00:47]** I don't know what that's about,

**[1:00:48]** but I like the idea of it.

**[1:00:51]** Oh, it's me.

**[1:00:52]** I'll try Potsylvania 400.

**[1:00:55]** Can't believe we blew our Black Friday sale.

**[1:00:57]** I know.

**[1:00:59]** Yingling, America's oldest brewery

**[1:01:00]** and the largest wholly owned brewery in America,

**[1:01:04]** probably, is based in what city?

**[1:01:06]** Potsville, Pots town, Potsville.

**[1:01:10]** All right.

**[1:01:13]** Pots, isn't it?

**[1:01:15]** I think it's Pennsylvania.

**[1:01:16]** It is.

**[1:01:17]** Pots them, Pennsylvania, Pots town,

**[1:01:19]** Pennsylvania, Potsville, Pennsylvania.

**[1:01:21]** I think they're all places, but you know.

**[1:01:23]** It seems like it would be.

**[1:01:26]** I'll try Potsville.

**[1:01:27]** C, Potsville.

**[1:01:29]** It is Potsville.

**[1:01:30]** Potsville.

**[1:01:31]** All right.

**[1:01:31]** Look at that.

**[1:01:32]** All right.

**[1:01:33]** Paul.

**[1:01:35]** Oh, God.

**[1:01:37]** Popery for 2000.

**[1:01:39]** All right.

**[1:01:40]** What Dutch Caribbean island just became

**[1:01:42]** the least populous nation to qualify

**[1:01:44]** for the FIFA World Cup?

**[1:01:46]** Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao, or St. Martin?

**[1:01:54]** I'll go with D, St. Martin.

**[1:01:56]** Nope.

**[1:01:56]** Let's try it.

**[1:01:57]** I'm sorry.

**[1:01:58]** It's Curacao with a population of 156,000.

**[1:02:01]** It surpassed Iceland 391,000

**[1:02:02]** as the least populous World Cup qualifier.

**[1:02:09]** Matt, you're up.

**[1:02:09]** Curacao.

**[1:02:10]** I knew that one.

**[1:02:11]** But now I got to go to stuff I don't know.

**[1:02:15]** You're used to that.

**[1:02:16]** Let's go.

**[1:02:18]** I'm already down.

**[1:02:19]** I'm down to Jacob there.

**[1:02:21]** Popery 1200, please.

**[1:02:23]** Let's try it.

**[1:02:25]** What is the actual name of the politicians

**[1:02:27]** serving their third term as the treasurer of Alabama?

**[1:02:31]** Dick Hickey.

**[1:02:33]** Frost Bush.

**[1:02:34]** Harry Bulse or Young Boozer?

**[1:02:39]** That's Harry Bulse, B-A-A-L-S.

**[1:02:42]** Harry Bulse.

**[1:02:45]** Dick Hickey sounds right to me.

**[1:02:46]** I was going to say, I'm going to go A, Dick Hickey.

**[1:02:48]** I grew up with some Hickeys as a kid.

**[1:02:51]** I'm sorry, it's Young Boozer.

**[1:02:52]** Young Boozer.

**[1:02:53]** I went to college with Frost Bush

**[1:02:55]** and grade school friend with Kevin Hickey.

**[1:02:58]** He had a father named Dick.

**[1:03:00]** That's who I was thinking of.

**[1:03:02]** Yeah, you were thinking of Smitty's friend's dad.

**[1:03:05]** The wrong Dick Hickey.

**[1:03:07]** Yep.

**[1:03:09]** It's me.

**[1:03:10]** By the way, if you want your Dick Hickey,

**[1:03:12]** leave a permanent mark here to hang it up by the neck bone.

**[1:03:16]** You got to leave it spread to dry out a little bit.

**[1:04:08]** Chad Lewee.

**[1:04:10]** Iraq, Iran, Chad.

**[1:04:15]** And Egypt is five letters.

**[1:04:18]** Man, I can think of a lot of countries with five letters.

**[1:04:23]** Um, I give up.

**[1:04:25]** I pass.

**[1:04:26]** I don't know.

**[1:04:27]** Matt.

**[1:04:28]** Oh, I don't think this would come around.

**[1:04:29]** Okay.

**[1:04:29]** Iraq, Iran, Chad.

**[1:04:30]** I kind of come up with another one.

**[1:04:32]** You don't got it.

**[1:04:33]** That's what I thought too.

**[1:04:34]** And then I didn't.

**[1:04:35]** That's where I passed.

**[1:04:36]** That's where we're at.

**[1:04:36]** Yeah.

**[1:04:38]** Now, but I got this.

**[1:04:40]** I got this.

**[1:04:40]** Here you got it, buddy.

**[1:04:42]** You got it.

**[1:04:43]** Let's just sit in silence while Matt thinks about the sense.

**[1:04:46]** The country of spot.

**[1:04:47]** Ty, I don't know if there's a land at the end of that one.

**[1:04:55]** Oh, shit.

**[1:04:56]** Pass.

**[1:04:57]** This would all work.

**[1:04:59]** Let's see.

**[1:05:00]** Uh, Chad.

**[1:05:01]** Cuba, Fiji, Iran, Iraq, Laos.

**[1:05:05]** Uh, Mali, Oman, Peru, and Togo.

**[1:05:12]** Duke of Togo.

**[1:05:13]** That's the name of Galvo 13.

**[1:05:15]** We've figured out three of them collectively and just quit.

**[1:05:17]** Paul, you're up.

**[1:05:18]** Uh, I will try.

**[1:05:20]** Oh, God, I hate all these.

**[1:05:24]** Pennsylvania Geography or Second Chance.

**[1:05:27]** I'll do Second Chance for 2000.

**[1:05:28]** Let's just fucking shoot the moon.

**[1:05:30]** Name the song.

**[1:05:31]** You consider me the young apprentice caught between the cilia

**[1:05:36]** and garbage hypnotized by you.

**[1:05:40]** If I should linger staring at the ring around your finger,

**[1:05:42]** I have only come here seeking knowledge,

**[1:05:44]** things they would not teach me in college.

**[1:05:48]** Pass.

**[1:05:49]** Matt.

**[1:05:50]** Pass.

**[1:05:51]** I'm passing too.

**[1:05:55]** Police wrapped around your finger.

**[1:05:57]** Oh, police.

**[1:05:59]** I don't remember being asked that question before.

**[1:06:00]** I do remember the question,

**[1:06:02]** and I also remember I fucking got it wrong.

**[1:06:05]** Matt, you're up.

**[1:06:08]** I got to make a move here, guys.

**[1:06:10]** Let's see.

**[1:06:11]** Score check.

**[1:06:11]** I have 800.

**[1:06:12]** Matt has negative 1200.

**[1:06:13]** Paul has negative 2800.

**[1:06:15]** I think there's two scooperies left.

**[1:06:18]** I think both of them are out there.

**[1:06:19]** Two double dares.

**[1:06:20]** Daily doubles, rather.

**[1:06:21]** Double dares.

**[1:06:22]** Two daily doubles.

**[1:06:22]** Listen to me playing the wrong game.

**[1:06:25]** That's right.

**[1:06:26]** Mark Summers.

**[1:06:27]** You can get the old come past the red line.

**[1:06:29]** You win.

**[1:06:31]** That's right.

**[1:06:31]** I could not remember that police song,

**[1:06:33]** but I can remember Mark Summers' name from double dare.

**[1:06:36]** No, no.

**[1:06:37]** Okay, God damn it.

**[1:06:41]** I'm terrible at all these categories.

**[1:06:43]** I'll go Pennsylvania 2000.

**[1:06:46]** All right.

**[1:06:47]** Which city was the home of the Maroons,

**[1:06:51]** the 1925 NFL championship due to a controversial suspension

**[1:06:55]** for playing an exhibition game against Notre Dame,

**[1:06:58]** Potsdam, Potstown or Potsville?

**[1:07:03]** I'll go with Potsdam A.

**[1:07:07]** Potsdam.

**[1:07:11]** I'm sorry.

**[1:07:12]** It's Potsville in 1993.

**[1:07:15]** Isn't it always purchased the Cardinals

**[1:07:17]** and began claiming the 1925 NFL championship

**[1:07:20]** and fighting any attempts to recognize

**[1:07:21]** the Potsville Maroons 1925 NFL championship.

**[1:07:26]** Is that where the what a maroon phrase came from?

**[1:07:29]** Maybe.

**[1:07:30]** Let's say yes.

**[1:07:31]** All right.

**[1:07:32]** As far as I know it is.

**[1:07:34]** Okay.

**[1:07:34]** That's me.

**[1:07:35]** I'll try a geography 800.

**[1:07:38]** North Carolina is the closest point of land

**[1:07:40]** to what British overseas territory,

**[1:07:43]** which is an archipelago consisting of 181 islands.

**[1:07:52]** Is that the Virgin Islands?

**[1:07:56]** I don't know.

**[1:07:57]** Virgin Islands.

**[1:07:59]** Oh, Bermuda.

**[1:08:01]** Bermuda.

**[1:08:02]** Bama.

**[1:08:02]** Bermuda is 181 islands?

**[1:08:04]** Apparently.

**[1:08:05]** I'm just learning that too.

**[1:08:06]** Paul, you're up.

**[1:08:08]** Second chance for 1200.

**[1:08:14]** Yes.

**[1:08:16]** Let's go into the fire.

**[1:08:18]** Name this song.

**[1:08:20]** So she tells him she must go out for the evening

**[1:08:23]** to comfort an old friend who's feeling down.

**[1:08:25]** But he knows where she's going as she's leaving.

**[1:08:29]** She's heading for the cheating side of town.

**[1:08:31]** Hint.

**[1:08:31]** It's not Ruby.

**[1:08:40]** Amethyst.

**[1:08:41]** No.

**[1:08:42]** Was this, this wasn't Jolene.

**[1:08:48]** Jolene.

**[1:08:49]** Jolene.

**[1:08:50]** Jolene.

**[1:08:52]** Jolene.

**[1:08:56]** I'll try Jolene.

**[1:08:57]** I'll try Jolene.

**[1:08:59]** Let's try Jolene.

**[1:09:00]** Lion eyes.

**[1:09:02]** The Eagles.

**[1:09:03]** Lion eyes.

**[1:09:05]** Oh, the Eagles.

**[1:09:06]** Jolene of the music world.

**[1:09:08]** Sure.

**[1:09:08]** Matt.

**[1:09:09]** Um.

**[1:09:11]** Jigam's running away with this.

**[1:09:14]** Running away with this with zero points.

**[1:09:17]** I have zero points and a commanding lead.

**[1:09:23]** Geography please.

**[1:09:25]** For 1200.

**[1:09:26]** Name the four US states that meet at the four

**[1:09:29]** corners monument.

**[1:09:34]** Yep.

**[1:09:36]** And I forget.

**[1:09:38]** Yep.

**[1:09:42]** Idaho.

**[1:09:43]** Montana.

**[1:09:45]** I think it's I think it's Nebraska.

**[1:09:48]** There it is.

**[1:09:49]** Italy.

**[1:09:50]** Yep.

**[1:09:51]** I think that's it.

**[1:09:53]** Venice.

**[1:09:54]** Venice is the fifth one that nobody talks about.

**[1:09:57]** Is it Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Idaho?

**[1:10:01]** Is Nevada one of them?

**[1:10:03]** Maybe I'm wrong.

**[1:10:05]** All right.

**[1:10:05]** Pass.

**[1:10:06]** Oh, I'm passing.

**[1:10:07]** Paul.

**[1:10:22]** Can either of you two name the four

**[1:10:24]** states that are in the four corners?

**[1:10:28]** Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho.

**[1:10:31]** I think that must be correct.

**[1:10:33]** It's me.

**[1:10:34]** I'll try geography for 2000.

**[1:10:35]** It wasn't right.

**[1:10:36]** I got it wrong.

**[1:10:43]** metro area in the world.

**[1:10:46]** Dhaka, Bangladesh, Jakarta, Indonesia,

**[1:10:49]** New Delhi, India, or Shanghai, China.

**[1:10:54]** I mean, those all seem like they could be it.

**[1:10:56]** Yeah, they do.

**[1:10:57]** Oh, this was just a few days ago.

**[1:11:00]** I have no idea that I passed.

**[1:11:03]** I will guess Bangladesh.

**[1:11:08]** Let's try it.

**[1:11:35]** had the most husbands?

**[1:11:37]** B. Arthur, Betty White, Estelle Getty,

**[1:11:39]** or Ruma Clanahan?

**[1:11:40]** I believe it was B. Arthur.

**[1:11:42]** I don't think it was.

**[1:11:45]** Nope.

**[1:11:45]** It's Ruma Clanahan.

**[1:11:46]** It really was Ruma Clanahan.

**[1:11:48]** Shit.

**[1:11:48]** Matt, you got Pennsylvania for 800 or 1200.

**[1:11:55]** What would you like?

**[1:11:56]** Well, I'm I'm firmly in second.

**[1:16:16]** Also took her to the sphere.

**[1:16:18]** So that was another, that's a really expensive ticket.

**[1:16:20]** That's a fucking ticket there.

**[1:16:23]** Hope you put her eyes back in.

**[1:16:26]** Well, otherwise she wouldn't be able to enjoy it.
