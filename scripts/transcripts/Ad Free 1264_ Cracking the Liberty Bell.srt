00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:22,740
 hired partner of mercedes uh and for many years uh not many years for now three years

 what what are we what are we doing and why are we doing it

53
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:05,620
 that's the whole thing and yet right so what i'm a part of in mercedes is like why you do

54
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:11,400
 hire a spiegel world is because they make strange decisions right so it's spiegel world but they're

55
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,380
 like hey you know the circus act thing is pretty cool but can you do something totally different

56
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:22,640
 for us we want our mercedes people to feel special their answer was let's build a ski

 line and we're going to build a ski line and we're going to build a ski line and we're going to

61
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:52,620
 they eat it up it's it's incredible ski large we are so jaded yeah ski lodge was one of the best

62
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,600
 things about super freeko yeah right oh and it's still there and it's still it's still rocking it's

63
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,120
 still great yeah there's a hidden there's a hidden ski lodge in super freeko i think there's just a

64
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:08,040
 market to expand on this and just grow it out he just needs to open up ski lodge diners

65
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:15,040
 no ross just needs to make some standout some some ski lodge diners it's the diner part that

66
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:22,440
 he needs a little work on but um why because they don't know how to make food no no the one diner

67
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,840
 they open they turn into a steakhouse so they're not their diner oh no no no this needs to be pizza

68
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,940
 only it needs to go the chucky cheese route you got already you already got the animatronic

69
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:37,380
 abominable snowman you had some other you had some other animatronics if you add a bunch of

70
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,880
 animatronics but half the animatronics are live performers that pop out every now and then and

71
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,520
 freak people out holy crap i was i was you know what i gotta just i need a meeting with ross

72
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,340
 let me get a meeting with ross i need to sit down and we need to talk about this whole

73
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:58,140
 revitalization you are accelerating like an f1 race car right now and i'm telling you to pump

74
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,460
 you know what i'm doing you know what i'm doing what's that i'm riding the devil

75
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:07,720
 that's what i'm doing i was just to say i was worried they might be listening to this but as

76
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:13,100
 soon as you said chucky cheese pizza i'm positive they turned it off bullshit it needs to happen

77
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,780
 that guy who did evil pie said he was gonna do it he never did it because he dropped the fucking

78
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,960
 ball on a billion dollar idea it needs to happen and it needs to be one of those things where you

79
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,160
 don't know is that an animatronic or is that a real person and that's going to be the best thing

80
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,020
 when that thing walks off the stage and freaks children out and scares everybody in the restaurant

81
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:36,820
 where are the children coming from it's going to be a family-friendly restaurant

82
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,600
 i've lost track as to where you think this is happening where is this going

83
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:48,180
 this is worldwide son okay okay okay franchised this is not for the f1 track i got it yeah yeah

84
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,620
 no no no no no no no that was that what you thought i was talking about

85
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:57,060
 yep no i've no i've taken this story all the way behind now this is my whole thing

86
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:02,360
 no no once you ride the devil you go different places very different places

87
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,980
 all right all right ride the devil let's bring it back to the enchantment of this

88
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,500
 current iteration of the ski lodge which has yet to reach its full animatronic potential

89
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,600
 well there's no animatronic so by potential that's what i'm saying yeah

90
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,220
 yeah it has not reached its full animatronic potential

91
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,060
 all those billionaires hang out and chat together anyway isn't he talking with elon

92
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,460
 you know all china's replacing their entire workforce with robots

93
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:36,920
 i don't i don't i don't think that's happening i'll just i i'm i'm doesn't seem like it is very

94
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:42,180
 hopeful and happy that it's not no i don't i know i know for for all the for all the comparisons of

95
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:50,640
 our crazy wily ceos uh there's a gigantic divide when it comes to a gulf a gulf of humanity yes

96
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:58,700
 respect for artists and all that kind of stuff did you see he's such a chode did you see

97
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:07,600
 elon got completely ratioed on uh twitter recently someone i and i was terrible i can't remember the

98
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:15,060
 name of the lady but she called him out and she was like this guy has everything he's got the whole

99
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:20,560
 you know oh god there he is smoking a cigar with all the billionaires um

100
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:27,460
 he quit distracting paul no it's fine uh but he's got all the money in the world

101
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:36,600
 and yet he has no passions he's not interested in literature or film or art he's never even he's

102
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,260
 never even complimented a movie he's never even talked about a movie he likes and he got so

103
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:49,100
 butthurt he started listing movies and like this is a good movie this movie's good oh yeah yeah

104
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,500
 that's terrible he is

105
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:57,520
 such a loser such a loser oh hold on here hold on here we can we can fix this

106
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,320
 let's see here uh yeah let's do this

107
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,740
 elon

108
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:13,540
 don't list movies that you like when people say you don't like movies

109
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:19,040
 that's a bad move that's like listing your black friends it works just as well

110
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,260
 what are you doing it's exactly if only you had black friends it's exactly the kind of move

111
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:33,700
 it's exactly how it read too it came off so hollow and so ridiculous like he started talking about

112
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:40,680
 movies from like 2003 like titanic was a good movie yeah that's exactly like the stuff it was

113
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:49,360
 like what news news broke obviously he's going to become a trillionaire right right right and he was

114
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,480
 like he wrote like i will carry the light of consciousness uh to to other planets into mars

115
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,740
 and beyond or something like that right yeah and someone someone just wrote can you just pay taxes

116
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:06,820
 on it like can you just pay your fair amount of taxes on it yep it was weird it's like if you if

117
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:12,540
 you think you take your trillions which no one singular human should ever have um it is a sickness

118
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:19,220
 having a billion dollars seems like the weirdest craziest thing in in

119
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:26,040
 history having a trillion dollars i i don't even know what that means that's just it is the biggest

120
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,660
 it is the biggest flaw of americans to not properly fathom the wealth gap and what that's

121
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,560
 seen well right oh yeah we should biggest problem we should be i don't understand why we're not in

122
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:42,580
 the streets right now that's that's that's well yeah and it's raining out give me an hour too

123
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:48,760
 give me an hour when it stops raining in an hour i'll go to the streets no problem okay great great

124
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:55,220
 yeah a trillion dollars is meaningless coffee bean scoop it does lose objective reality for

125
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,900
 most human beings we can't fathom it i think we're all human beings i don't think anybody can

126
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:06,780
 and it is anti-capitalist because capitalism is uh money re-entering the the the flow of commerce

127
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:12,080
 and so these are weird dragons hoarding wealth that never gets recycled into the environment

128
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:18,060
 it never gets back it'll never trickle down and you can't i don't want to get into it but uh at

129
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:27,120
 oh uh that reminds me uh and also speaking of hoarding wealth we owe an apology uh as a as a

130
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:34,680
 podcast and as a group to jake paul uh last week we called jake paul a douchebag uh today he announced

131
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:42,260
 that he has just purchased a 364 carat diamond necklace uh ahead of his upcoming fight and it

132
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:48,000
 looks like diamond bullets hanging off of his neck so uh sorry jake paul we called you a douche

133
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:59,200
 i think i said it about logan paul they're both awful they're both monsters paul did you not hear

134
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,840
 what i just said let me tell you about his necklace wait no no no no no no i think of the

135
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,380
 children paul think of the i misheard you gold-plated bullets gold-plated bullets okay

136
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:14,000
 great oh sorry i got so wound up in my anger use that money to save this planet instead of

137
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,660
 worrying about putting it on other planets like that actually is enough money

138
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:24,600
 to probably do a lot for this planet when i was a younger man everybody would everybody could just

139
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:31,100
 have food when i was a younger man and fully locked in with star trek and sci-fi and all that

140
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:38,920
 i really was a proponent of space travel and and i still am to a degree there have been great

141
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,560
 discoveries that we as a species have made through the advancement of space traveling technology

142
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,720
 velcro is just one however

143
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:59,620
 having said that when i became a somewhat older wiser man yeah have you guys uh ever heard uh

144
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:07,160
 gil scott heron's whiteys on the moon yes it's perfect it's perfect uh and that always keeps

145
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,360
 resonating in my head whenever i hear these motherfuckers talking about going to space

146
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,700
 it's like man it's literally because we got way more shit don't know what to do with their money

147
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,380
 like it is too much money because when you have hundreds of millions of dollars

148
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:23,640
 you can afford every single house that you want on the planet you can travel privately to every

149
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,900
 single place on the planet you can afford every single meal that anyone could possibly prepare

150
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:33,720
 on the planet you can afford everything every watch every piece of clothing every car i always

151
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:39,060
 say you don't have to consider money you money becomes uh not a consideration in life yeah it's

152
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:47,820
 crazy the only reason to go higher is strictly insane ego bullshit yeah and to want that insane

153
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,240
 ego bullshit

154
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,460
 and still want to do nothing or barely anything for humans on the planet is just ridiculous

155
00:14:53,460 --> 00:15:01,560
 yeah it's grotesque yeah um all right but you can't accumulate you can't there's no great

156
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:07,780
 fortune without uh some great crime right that's what it comes down to and and also just bitching

157
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:12,960
 about these things and not uh acting on them you know that's just a that's just a waste of our time

158
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,680
 and your time so uh we here at matt maddenley's ice cream social we want to act on this

159
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:26,220
 so here's what i propose i propose that our patreons give each of us one billion dollars

160
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:34,960
 and we're each going to use that billion dollars as we think a billionaire should do you know how

161
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:40,320
 we're going to see how this works out please go to i would even do this podcast if i had

162
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,820
 even a million dollars in my bank account

163
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:47,700
 oh nothing nothing will stop me from wanting to hear the sound of my own voice paul there isn't a

164
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:52,200
 lot of money on the planet you know it's still it would be really fun if i had the if i had like

165
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:57,620
 crazy money i would be setting up uh random live events with us all the time that's okay well that's

166
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:01,920
 the that is what we would do actually yeah that's it's true that actually is we would we would just

167
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,460
 that's the problem all the play all over it's like that's why a lot of these celebrity podcasts are

168
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:11,040
 making that loot and catching on because they have the money to go set up live events all over

200
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:32,020
 a half hour rough cut oh man but we still need to fill in those spots so we need to interview jacob

00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,840
 got brogan and ryer doing some logos for us and we want to make sure all those people get a little

206
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:09,780
 trash in their pocket yeah and then at the end we're gonna we're gonna submit uh the festival

207
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:15,800
 or the film to festivals actual festivals so we we want to take it old school

208
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:21,060
 like we used to do about 25 years ago and and hopefully we can travel around and show it or

209
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:27,940
 maybe we'll end up selling it we'll see what oh it's so exciting yeah it's uh super fun so i'll

210
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:36,280
 post the um the gofundme link so i can figure it out well yeah you're gonna post the gofundme

211
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,340
 link in the chat here so the people on uh on zoom can see it and we will post that along

212
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,320
 with the episode description for this very episode that everybody is listening to

213
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,180
 and of course all over the social medias and everything so yeah go uh go check that out

214
00:20:49,180 --> 00:21:00,140
 this is the part of the show where we listen to jd figure out how to copy and paste it's pretty

215
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:05,200
 great it's solid it's solid material he actually turned his camera off for a second it's pretty

216
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:15,340
 exciting the coolest thing the coolest thing is that uh you know with with any luck this gets

217
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:22,340
 a little traction somewhere and generates a little buzz and then who knows what could happen

218
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:29,020
 with the podcast maybe we could start doing some live shows around the the country tour with the

219
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:37,240
 with the movie maybe even the goal is for two thousand six hundred dollars that's the start

220
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:44,880
 the way that gofundme it gears it up so the the full goal is ten thousand but you get paid out

221
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,380
 before that

222
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:51,940
 got it okay okay it's actually it's way better than like kickstarter or anything especially for

223
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:57,020
 this since we don't have to get randos to find it and be interested in it we can kind of community

224
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,280
 hopefully community uh raise some money for that it's a reasonable it's a reasonable amount of

225
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:07,420
 money to fundraise it's not it's not it's not a astronomical yeah and you know i kind of maxed

226
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:14,480
 out my friend for the production right yeah right if you promise to take the light of consciousness

227
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,240
 to mars and be able to do that i'm not going to do that i'm not going to do that i'm not going to

228
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,320
 beyond. You can ask for a trillion dollars.

229
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:17,920
 Do you know that?

230
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,960
 What would we do with the other

231
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,040
 $999 billion?

232
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,540
 Don't worry

233
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,980
 about that. We got that covered.

234
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,180
 We have a very interesting experiment

235
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,340
 we're going to do. I think a lot of people are going to be very

236
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,540
 interested. I have some plans.

237
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,320
 You know how you can eat sushi off of people

238
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,560
 at fancy restaurants, JD?

239
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,700
 Just like a lot of people.

240
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,920
 Like a lot of people.

241
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,120
 A train track of people with sushi

242
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,760
 on them.

243
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,320
 I'm going to launch my dream, which is

244
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,160
 Spicy Tuna Train to Chicago,

245
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,900
 where we just eat our way.

246
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,820
 I'm on.

247
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,720
 I'm on.

248
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,520
 Hey, hey, we're on a spicy tuna

249
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,560
 train to Chicago.

250
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,560
 The musical rights itself, and those rights

251
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,560
 are just ours afterward. We can't stop

252
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,680
 making money once we do it.

253
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,540
 Can't stop. Won't stop.

254
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:11,480
 But it all starts with this

255
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,300
 GoFundMe.

256
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,040
 Yeah, and we're going to get it

257
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,900
 in front of Netflix, because we have connections

258
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,600
 there, and

259
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,540
 we know people from

260
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,180
 the

261
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:27,560
 De Niro Film Festival

262
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,280
 in Tribeca, in New York.

263
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,640
 Oh, wow.

264
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,080
 Can we ask you, JD, when you go in front of your

265
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,000
 friends, because I know you brought investors

266
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,100
 to see me at the Magic Castle,

267
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,100
 what do you tell them

268
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,040
 when you tell them you want to make a movie

269
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,080
 about us? What do you say to these people?

270
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
 That's very funny

271
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,100
 they bring up. So, those were our producers

272
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,060
 that you met, and they were at

273
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,960
 Scoop Dubs with us, and

274
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,140
 I told them I wanted to

275
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,140
 do this, and he just said, yeah, I'll help you. Whatever you need.

276
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,920
 Let's do it. And I said, okay,

277
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,160
 Matt's going to be in L.A. Let's go take a

278
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,080
 look. And he was hemming and hawing about it.

279
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,120
 He wasn't very interested. I, you know,

280
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,820
 sent him a podcast. They didn't listen to it.

281
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,160
 And then when they saw

282
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,160
 you, when they saw you perform,

283
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,260
 I saw him get excited.

284
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,080
 They're already smart people.

285
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,720
 Yeah. Anyway,

286
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,080
 oh, now I kind of get what you're doing.

287
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,200
 Really?

288
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,900
 Yeah, yeah. He got excited,

289
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,080
 and, you know, he's one of my

290
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,120
 oldest friends in the world, and once I saw him,

291
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,140
 he got up on stage with you doing something,

292
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,140
 and he saw his eyes light up,

293
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,580
 and then I had him.

294
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,840
 So, there you go.

295
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,100
 Matt pulled out the fish, and the light bulb

296
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,020
 turned on. The clown was in that show.

297
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,640
 Matt busted out the clown,

298
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,560
 jump-scared the clown. I think I had a fish

299
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,060
 and a clown in that show. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

300
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,120
 You know me. Production.

301
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,220
 Production, baby. Production, production, production.

302
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,860
 Yeah, but my pitch

303
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,300
 to people about it is, like,

304
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,920
 this is a very unique community

305
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,480
 that I'm just starting to

306
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,500
 find out about, and now

307
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,480
 I've just found out about Adopt-A-Scoop and all the

308
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,400
 stuff they do during the holidays. It's fucking

309
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,560
 amazing. And the amount of

310
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,640
 love and acceptance

311
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,480
 and

312
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,460
 joyfulness that's in this community

313
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,360
 just blew me away, and that's why I asked

314
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:09,920
 to do this.

315
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,320
 If this doc can get made,

316
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,320
 and really get out there, and a lot

317
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,220
 of people can see it, it will be

318
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,080
 doing Matt and Paul and I

319
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,320
 a personal favor on

320
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,280
 a different level than I think anybody has really

321
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,280
 thought about, and that is when we have

322
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,400
 to explain to people who aren't in this

323
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,120
 community what this community

324
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,120
 is like, we can now just

325
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,420
 point at a documentary

326
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,100
 and say, watch this,

327
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,020
 because I don't know how to explain it.

328
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that was the hardest thing.

329
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,320
 People are like, what are you doing? And even the scoops.

330
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,240
 When we were at ScoopFest,

331
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,380
 and get everybody to sign the releases,

332
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,200
 several people were like, I don't know

333
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,280
 what you're doing. What is this? What's this about?

334
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,140
 And then I had to try to explain it,

335
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,320
 that this is about exploring this amazing

336
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,220
 community that's grown organically

337
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,620
 over the past 10, 12 years.

338
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,540
 And they're like, oh, okay, that makes sense.

339
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,540
 Yeah.

340
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,160
 Myra makes a good point in the chat, which is like a scoop

341
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,060
 speeding up outside of ScoopFest, like without

342
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,320
 us, they just all get up together and meet up

343
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,020
 with each other. We love seeing

344
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,260
 players of that, and people

345
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,080
 let us know that they got together. It's like the coolest

346
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,420
 feeling.

347
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:17,060
 Yeah, we got a couple of those stories in our interviews,

348
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,560
 and I was just, like I said,

349
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,340
 the whole community just blows me away.

350
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,940
 Carl Dribelbus, Carl is welcome

351
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,180
 in this community, and he's not welcome in any other community.

352
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,320
 He's not welcome

353
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,260
 to hang out with anyone.

354
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,820
 And there's a tolerance level

355
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,980
 in this community that's higher than anyone

356
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,500
 he's ever worked with, any

357
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,320
 bowling team he's joined,

358
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,300
 any poker club.

359
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,980
 They've all gotten rid of him.

360
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,160
 His family.

361
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,220
 He's still just thriving here.

362
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:54,940
 We should say that J.D.'s plug for the GoFundMe

363
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,040

364

 That's right. It's brought to you by the following sponsor.

366
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,940
 Today's show, no, I'm sorry.

367

 The Hey Scoops documentary

368
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,620

 Boston's Baked Bean Ice Cream.

372
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,720
 Ice Cream. That's right. That's from Florida Man

373
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,000
 in 2024. That's Billy from Boston's

374
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,500
 Baked Bean Ice Cream.

375
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,600
 Hey there. How you doing?

376
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,060
 I'm Billy from Boston. I got Baked Beans

377
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,100
 Ice Creams. You want

378
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,940
 some? Yeah, you would,

379
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,580
 chucklehead. Yeah.

380
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,080
 Go ahead and sample

381
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,540
 a little taste. How's your sister?

382
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,580
 Why don't you let her know I'm looking for, huh?

383
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,020
 Huh? Trying to talk to her.

384
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,840
 I'm trying to talk to your sister. What's going on?

385
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,800
 Huh? Huh? I just came in for ice cream.

386
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,860
 How did you know I had a sister?

387
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,860
 Oh, I can tell by the rings on your neck,

388
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,880
 you jabroni.

389
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:53,020
 Alright,

390
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,660
 well, yeah.

391
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,820
 If I don't have to pay, if I can just get

392
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,800
 ice cream, you fuck my sister, I'm in. Oh, you're gonna pay,

393
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,660
 pal. Yeah, you're gonna pay big time.

394
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,540
 How about them apples?

395
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,560
 Whoa.

396
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,760
 Hey, bro,

397
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,020
 did you get me my ice cream yet? You know what?

398
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,140
 Get back in the car.

399
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,660
 You know what? Bring her over here.

400
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,880
 Hurry up. That's your sister I'm trying to talk

401
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,100
 at. Hey, come here.

402
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,500
 Come here, cute sister. Come here.

403
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,620
 Oh, who are you? Don't worry

404
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,620
 about it. I'm the guy.

405
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,700
 Come on over here and have some of my

406
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,840
 baked blueberries. How mysterious.

407
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,620
 I got

408
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,740
 some mystery baked bean ice cream in the back.

409
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,740
 I can't wait. Oh, you're gonna

410
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,640
 wait. That's my favorite kind of ice cream. Yeah.

411
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,700
 Yeah. Alright, pal. It's on

412
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,520
 the house because I got a date with your sister.

413
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,100
 Now. Alright.

414
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,560
 Thank you, Billy, from the baked bean ice cream company.

415
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,740
 You're welcome.

416
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,520
 How about them apples? I'll get my own ride home,

417
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,000
 Matt. I'll see you later.

418
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,480
 That's right. I'm gonna crack her like the

419
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,760
 Liberty Bell. What do you think?

420
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,320
 What?

421
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,260
 Philly.

422
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,460
 I was just gonna say the

423
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,160
 Liberty Bell is not a Boston reference.

424
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,180
 It's Boston. It's totally Boston.

425
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,060
 I'm gonna

426
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,480
 get her wedded in the tea

427
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,480
 harbor. There we go. How about that?

428
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,220
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

429
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,400
 Boston teapot.

430
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,520
 I'm already halfway there. Yeah, I'm gonna turn

431
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,560
 her into a freaking teapot. Oh, it's the same color

432
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,440
 too. That's right. Get

433
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,780
 ready. I don't want to hear about my sister's

434
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,560
 tea harbor. Oh,

435
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,820
 you don't? No.

436
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,580
 I can tell you already have a bunch. Not since last

437
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,040
 Christmas.

438
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,580
 Well, we all, of course, every Christmas we update

439
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,220
 the family on our tea harbors.

440
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,440
 That's a given. Nobody's talking

441
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,400
 to you anymore, stack of dimes. You need to

442
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,220
 hit the arches.

443
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:51,920
 I don't know.

444
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,480
 No kidding. No kidding.

445
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,320
 My box

446
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,220
 is all over the fucking

447
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,180
 map.

448
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,740
 That was more

449
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,380
 drifting than the Tokyo drift

450
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,100
 on that accent there.

451
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:12,120
 I do not have a Boston accent.

452
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,400
 I mean,

453
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,440
 it was like, we're going out to

454
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,340
 the barbershop. We're gonna

455
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,220
 go get a bar. We're gonna go to the

456
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,380
 barbershop. You think you're better than me?

457
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,280
 You think you're better than me?

458
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,740
 Eh? Eh?

459
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,360
 Boston. Tea

460
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,860
 party. Boston.

461
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,520
 Pack your car. That's

462
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,460
 it. There you go. Pack your car in the

463
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,360
 harbor. Bring your

464
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,220
 sister over here, pencil neck.

465
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,920
 Come over here, stack of dimes.

466
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,880
 Let's go.

467
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,940
 Pack your car.

468
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:48,120
 That last sponsor ran so long, it's

469
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,060
 time for the next sponsor. Oh, jeez.

470
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,180
 Wow.

471
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,160
 Boston represent.

472
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,140
 Boston represent.

473
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,000
 I really brought it home.

474
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,380
 Okay, I have a serious...

475
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,060
 What you need is your Mayor Quimby. You need a

476
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,260
 Mayor Quimby to get through it.

477
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,780
 But they're not from Boston, are they?

478
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,960
 He's Kennedy. He's Massachusetts.

479
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,160
 Does that work? Yeah. Better than what you

480
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,960
 did, yeah. I'll accept it. Oh, my God.

481
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,960
 Well, if I'd have known that, I would have done

482
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,900
 that. All right. All right. Take two.

483
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,540
 Hey, there.

484
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,100
 I got Boston baked bean

485
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,800
 delicious ice cream.

486
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,920
 Go ahead and sample some.

487
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,560
 How about them apples?

488
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,940
 Would you like some? Hey, I'd like

489
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:30,020
 to date your sister. Bring her over

490
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,960
 here. Oh, me?

491
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,060
 Nobody's talking to you anymore, stack of

492
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,660
 dimes. Come over here. I'm gonna

493
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,660
 crack you like the Liberty Bell.

494
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,220
 Come over here.

495
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,080
 Liberty Bell's still out. Liberty Bell's still out.

496
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,220
 Come on over here.

497
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,860
 I'm gonna go under and through you like

498
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,740
 the Great Arch. Like the

499
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,800
 Great Arch. No, that's St. Louis.

500
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,920
 No, come on. I'm sure that was there.

501
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,960
 I'm pretty sure.

502
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,480
 I could be wrong.

503
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,700
 Park your car.

504
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,260
 Park your car.

505
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,720
 Spot on. Spot on.

506
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,960
 Get me some ice cream with baked beans

507
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,480
 in it. Your accent is so authentic.

508
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,640
 I'm so desperate to crack you

509
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,580
 like the Liberty Bell, you freak.

510
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,720
 You little freaky thing, you

511
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,860
 weird little sister

512
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,720
 girl. Come explore

513
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,900
 my Grand Canyon. Yes, just

514
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,620
 like our majestic Grand Canyon.

515
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,800
 One of the wonders of Boston. On the right

516
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,840
 side of the Mississippi. The Grand Canyon.

517
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,540
 One of the wonders of

518
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,880
 the world. Boston's Grand

519
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,680
 Canyon. Oh, look, it's the Mississippi.

520
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,680
 Here in Boston.

521
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,920
 Turns out, it's

522
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,980
 your mom. Your mom is the Grand Canyon

523
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,480
 of Boston, you stack of dimes.

524
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,920
 Yeah. Planes can

525
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,840
 see you when they're flying overhead. They go, hey,

526
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,820
 check it to your left. Look out the

527
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,840
 window, and you might just see the most

528
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,660
 cavernous vajay

529
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,760
 that ever walked.

530
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,800
 You've actually got grad

531
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,100
 students still stuck in you.

532
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,060
 Vaginal

533
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,940
 cavity. I know you do.

534
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,940
 Don't

535
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,000
 lie about it. I'm going to crack

536
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,020
 you like the Liberty Bell.

537
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:10,160
 Oh, good

538
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,840
 news. Twitch just gave us a big upgrade.

539
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
 Oh, no, never mind. They took it away.

540
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,600
 Oh, no.

541
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,800
 Oh, no. We're going to crack them like

542
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,540
 a stack of dimes.

543
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,840
 I love stack

544
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,880
 of dimes. I think that's my favorite insult.

545
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,660
 I think I'm going to just keep using it.

546
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:29,560
 Production meeting.

547
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,540
 Good. Okay. No, I

548
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,640
 have a serious question for

549
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,580
 JD. Ah, okay.

550
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,340
 JD, come on back.

551
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:41,820
 This is good.

552
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,760
 Because we were supposed to put it in the last episode,

553
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,520
 so now we're putting him twice in this episode.

554
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

555
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,900
 Unless he left. Did he leave?

556
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,700
 Oh, there he is. So, JD,

557
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,980
 I am a physical

558
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,060
 media snob.

559
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,740
 Is there a chance that there is a tier

560
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,780
 for production

561
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,760
 of a DVD or

562
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,660
 Blu-ray? There's no

563
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,820
 tiers on a GoFundMe.

564
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,760
 Huh? There are tiers on

565
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,480
 GoFundMes. Aren't there?

566
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,880
 Oh, no. I'm thinking Kickstarter.

567
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,220
 Kickstarter. Sorry, I got confused.

568
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,320
 Paul, I'm in the same boat with you.

569
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,200
 I love physical media. I like buying music

570
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,200
 on vinyl. So, I have

571
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,180
 two goals with this, and one of them

572
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,460
 definitely is to put it to Blu-ray.

573
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,900
 The other one is to get

574
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,520
 your album printed to vinyl.

575
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,380
 Well, that's

576
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,080
 good, because we owe

577
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,440
 like 25 people that.

578
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,040
 We owe people some vinyl copies. We really do.

579
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,780
 That could kill two birds with one stone.

580
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:40,080
 I still feel bad about that. That's like one of the

581
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,720
 only things we've ever kind of...

582
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,420
 Really fucked up. I think it's the only thing that we ever

583
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,180
 missed. Yeah. Yeah. Like, ever fully missed.

584
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,440
 And people have been very kind about it. The company that we were

585
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,480
 going to use to

586
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,400
 make the vinyl no longer is a

587
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,400
 company. Yeah, that's a

588
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,820
 strike against us. Yeah.

589
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:57,380
 It's actually pretty easy to do nowadays.

590
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,360
 There's lots of companies that'll do it

591
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,380
 for you. It really has changed, even

592
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,740
 since we recorded the album.

593
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:05,460
 It's a lot more prevalent, even in just

594
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,540
 a couple years here, yeah.

595
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,600
 We recorded the album

596
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,920
 18 years ago, so yeah.

597
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,460
 I did.

598
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,040
 Oh, that'd be awesome, J.D.

599
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,560
 Sidoni's doing the music for

600
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,720
 the documentary as well.

601
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,140
 So maybe there's...

602
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,040
 Tag that on, make it a soundtrack

603
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,700
 collaboration album, whole big thing.

604
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,120
 Yeah, we'll figure it out.

605
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,940
 Yeah, I would love to do that kind of stuff.

606
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,700
 I do love comic books and stuff like that.

607
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,420
 Yeah, and well, with you mentioning

608
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,320
 there's a four-hour rough cut already,

609
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,100
 are we going to be able to get

610
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,540
 behind-the-scenes deleted footage

611
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,060
 and all that, too? That's what I'd love.

612
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,560
 J.D., I think what Paul's asking for his final...

613
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,780
 Final cut. Can he have...

614
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,760
 Yeah, I do not.

615
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,500
 No, last question.

616
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,960
 Last question. What's the working title?

617
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,240
 Is there a working title?

618
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,460
 Working title right now is just Hey, Scoops the Movie.

619
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,600
 I haven't come up with anything better,

620
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,560
 but I like it, and it kind of...

621
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,000
 It is what it is.

622
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,900
 Yeah, it says everything,

623
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,740
 and it directs people to our website,

624
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,560
 so...

625
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,040
 J.D., here's Paul,

626
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,560
 always thinking about

627
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,300
 shuffling people to their own website.

628
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,820
 J.D., I don't know

629
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,160
 what the fuck to even...

630
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,920
 J.D., how far

631
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,420
 can Paul

632
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,480
 put this cart ahead of the horse

633
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,200
 before you can't see the cart anymore?

634
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:33,700
 Paul is talking about the trilogy now.

635
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,420
 How much is a booth at Comic-Con,

636
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,780
 and what are we giving out?

637
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,820
 Hey, that's a great idea, man.

638
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:41,880
 Yeah.

639
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:48,200
 I'm here for it all.

640
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:53,080
 If we did a booth at Comic-Con,

641
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,280
 you know what we could do, Matt?

642
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,860
 You know what we could do? Seriously?

643
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,780
 We could doctor it up like a stage,

644
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,780
 and we could put on 15-minute improv shows

645
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,640
 every hour, and it would be one of the most

646
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,320
 popular booths in all of Comic-Con-dom.

647
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,420
 There we go.

648
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,600
 A while back, remember, we really were trying to figure out a way to do

649
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,180
 improv shows, bucket shows,

650
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,620
 at Comic-Con. We did look into that.

651
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,560
 It would have been

652
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:15,980
 a good idea.

653
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,280
 There's a rumor that Comic-Con is moving to Vegas, too.

654
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,840
 Yeah, that's a rumor.

655
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,700
 That'll make it easier to do the show,

656
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,100
 for sure.

657
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,220
 It will make it easier.

658
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:28,000
 I think maybe we even need to look into

659
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,960
 PAX or some other

660
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,400
 smaller video game

661
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:32,780
 cons.

662
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,840
 Smaller cons would be the way to go,

663
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,960
 and it would be interesting that we're supplying entertainment

664
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,040
 at a con that doesn't have evening

665
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,240
 entertainment. That would be a smart move.

666
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,200
 That's the way to go.

667
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,360
 That's the way to go.

668
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,180
 One other person I wanted to shout out real quick

669
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,640
 is Wayne Geo,

670
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,500
 who is doing our animation.

671
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,820
 Joe Benazzi.

672
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:56,300
 That's my Boston accent.

673
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,480
 He's done how many movies?

674
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,220
 He's doing an intro to our movie.

675
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,760
 Oh, wow. So cool.

676
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,060
 Yeah, and it's

677
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,780
 fucking hilarious.

678
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:11,080
 He's great. I love his style.

679
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:11,820
 He's so good.

680
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,340
 That's so cool.

681
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:16,200
 That makes me kind of jump a little bit.

682
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,700
 That makes my heart really happy,

683
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,260
 because one of my all-time favorite films

684
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,840
 is Christmas Vacation,

685
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,680
 and that whole intro is animated.

686
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,060
 Yeah, and a lot

687
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,760
 of great films started with animated

688
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,500
 stuff, so that's

689
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,720
 awesome.

690
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,680
 One of the greatest artistic casualties

691
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,920
 in my life is that

692
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,760
 when I stopped wearing overalls

693
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,080
 and started wearing a performance tuxedo,

694
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,920
 I stopped.

695
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,260
 I stopped being a muse to Joe Benazzi.

696
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,820
 I stopped appearing in his cartoons.

697
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,600
 It's good to know that

698
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,920
 at least we can pay him to get back

699
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,640
 on the wagon, so that's good.

700
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,240
 Yeah, it's pretty epic.

701
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,160
 I can't wait to show people.

702
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,100
 It's spectacular.

703
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,460
 Great. Well, that alone

704
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,840
 makes me thrilled, too, that you're

705
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,480
 already pleased with the product

706
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,680
 and excited about how it's going to go

707
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,760
 with the final edit and everything.

708
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,620
 Yeah, that's really fun.

709
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,240
 I'm crowdsourcing this within the

710
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:10,760
 community.

711
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,440
 I'm making sure that they have

712
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,440
 input on this and

713
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,880
 are along for the whole ride.

714
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,020
 It's been an awesome experience.

715
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,460
 I can't wait to finish it and show everybody.

716
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,560
 Well, there you go, guys. We're almost across the finish line

717
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,600
 with the movie, so please help out if you

718
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,360
 can. Even a dollar will probably

719
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,360
 help us get to that goal quicker.

720
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,620
 But not that much. I mean, it won't help that much.

721
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,740
 Nah, yeah. I mean, it'll help.

722
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,600
 It'll help. It won't be nothing.

723
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,980
 It won't help that much.

724
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,900
 Kick it up to two dollars.

725
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,940
 But you're going to take all the time to fill out the form

726
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,480
 for a dollar?

727
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,040
 I will. I will fill it out

728
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,980
 for a dollar. Do ten bucks.

729
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,260
 Yeah. Ten bucks.

730
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,100
 It's on GoFundMe. Go check

731
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,940
 it out. It's HeyScoopsTheMovie.

732
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,660
 The campaign is called Help Finish

733
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,340
 HeyScoopsTheMovie.

734
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,540
 So if you're searching for it, do that.

735
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,900
 Also, the link for it is up on our social media.

736
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,880
 It's up on the episode

737
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,820
 description for this show. Go over there.

738
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,820
 Help it out. It's going to be a really

739
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,820
 interesting project, and I think everybody's

740
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,820
 going to be super interested

741
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,580
 and fascinated.

742
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,660
 in how it turns out. I know I'm going to be.

743
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,760
 It's like, however

744
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,840
 you acquire that dollar, just do that five

745
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,880
 more times before you fill out the form

746
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,860
 is what I'm saying. There you go.

747
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,880
 Just find a way

748
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,960
 to make that dollar five dollars, I think.

749
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,880
 Maybe like a couple of you go

750
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,740
 in, like a couple of you people who are doing

751
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,200
 the dollars, like go in together.

752
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,360
 Like find four friends,

753
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,640
 and all of you go in together on a fiver.

754
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,700
 This is starting to sound like a pyramid

755
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,080
 scheme, Jacob. No, no, no.

756
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,300
 This is a GoFundMe.

757
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,680
 It's a whole different thing. Jacob, if those five people

758
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,760
 just find five more people each, then that'll

759
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,500
 make it much easier. And they find five people, and

760
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,620
 they find five people. Oh, when it comes out of your

761
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,540
 mouth, Paul, I hear it.

762
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,580
 Yep, yep. Especially when he does

763
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,580
 that tone of voice. Boy, that's not the first time

764
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,860
 I've heard that.

765
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:00,720
 It was usually about the pet bird that we had

766
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,240
 as kids.

767
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,260
 What the hell are you talking about?

768
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,560
 When it comes out of your mouth, Paul, I hear it.

769
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,880
 That was the only thing. Otherwise,

770
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,800
 you couldn't hear the bird.

771
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:10,880
 Yeah.

772
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,580
 Yep.

773
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:17,400
 We had no bird

774
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,540
 for long.

775
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,800
 No, we had no bird.

776
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,000
 What? You were being Sylvester.

777
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,120
 Good God, gross.

778
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,020
 I would not, no. I mean,

779
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,540
 they told me it was a swallow, so.

780
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,240
 No, we had no bird.

781
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,840
 We had no bird.

782
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,240
 Why are you yelling at us?

783
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,020
 Because I don't want people thinking I put a bird

784
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,160
 in my mouth for prolonged periods of time.

785
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,920
 As a child. I didn't.

786
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,440
 He did, but he doesn't want you to think that.

787
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,240
 Look, it was for a joke.

788
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,220
 The more you say it, the more

789
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:50,040
 we think you actually probably had a bird in your mouth

790
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,220
 as a kid. I know.

791
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,280
 No one else brought this up.

792
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,380
 Which is now an even better bit.

793
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,040
 Now it's weird, which I love it.

794
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,940
 Because now it's like, did he put a bird

795
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,960
 in his mouth for a long time? Probably.

796
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,120
 I mean, who knows? Also, it was Kentucky.

797
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:04,960
 Right?

798
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,760
 Who can say?

799
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,640
 It'd be like, I'd be the Roger Whitaker.

800
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,780
 Sing, sing, sing

801
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,440
 Kentucky songbird.

802
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,260
 Wing, wing, wing your love to me.

803
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,300
 I spent too much

804
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,380
 time traveling on my own.

805
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,120
 Kentucky songbird, I'm

806
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:22,800
 coming home.

807
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,160
 I put it in my mouth.

808
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,180
 You can't hear it anymore.

809
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:34,160
 You know who else is very excited

810
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,660
 about that Kentucky songbird?

811
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:38,180
 As well as JD's second appearance on this

812
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,980

818
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,820
 Anybody

819
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,820
 interested in feeding this horse?

820
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,980
 I'm about to crack it like the Liberty Bell.

821
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,180
 Go ahead and get yourself some birds

822
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,940
 and stick it in the horse's mouth.

823
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,060
 Two birds in the horse is worth one

824
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,080
 in the bush, which I just cracked

825
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,140
 like the Liberty Bell. Horse

 Horse Bush Crackin'.

828
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,360
 How about them apples, horse?

829
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,460
 You can lead a horse to a bird's

830
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,320
 nest, but you can't make him put a bird in his mouth.

831
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,940
 Enter Hay Scoops at checkout.

832
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,500
 Nest. Yes, and that was the PETA approved

833
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,500
 version of that. Horse nest.

834
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:29,420
 Horse nest. This is a

835
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,340
 horse house.

836
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,780
 That was from Frozen Cusser, by the way.

837
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,040
 Thanks, Frozen Cusser. Good stuff.

838
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,440
 I did not ever put a

839
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,300
 bird in my mouth for prolonged periods of

840
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,080
 time. No one believes you.

841
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,140
 Great. This is what I'm saying. This is my new

842
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,880
 bit. This is my new thing about me

843
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,060
 maybe or maybe not putting a bird in my

844
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,600
 mouth. He definitely did.

845
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,040
 I'm not saying one way or the other

846
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:51,360
 now.

847
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,340
 We were

848
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,260
 backstage for the first

849
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,940
 Hillbill shows. Those baby chicks,

850
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,860
 they would come out kind of wet.

851
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,540
 Oh, yeah.

852
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,100
 I think Paul

853
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,040
 put them in his mouth.

854
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,260
 From my mouth juices.

855
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,000
 Um, I

856
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,240
 you know, what happens is, you

857
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,240
 know, I think we had an episode. I thought we already

858
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,140
 had the episode title, but Paul's

859
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,180
 mouth juices. The thing

860
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:21,320
 is, you know, the birds don't

861
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,220
 realize it because they're in there

862
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,100
 and it's warm and it's nice and dark.

863
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,320
 But the digestion

864
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,740
 process has begun.

865
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:33,320
 That's wave one of the

866
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,200
 digestion process, right?

867
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,840
 The mouth, the mouth juices.

868
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,060
 Yeah, our stone faces aren't because we don't

869
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,020
 understand what you're saying.

870
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,760
 Okay.

871
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,140
 Remember when that one bird

872
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,460
 came out and looked all

873
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,800
 like it was plucked?

874
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,880
 Listen, as someone who is the

875
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,920
 owner of Schmiki and Schmuki, all this bird

876
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,940
 talk is really kind of just just bring. Oh, my

877
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,540
 God. How many more birds has

878
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,580
 escape artist Schmiki

879
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,620
 gotten away with now? Because they

880
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,820
 they're getting out and killing birds at night now, right?

881
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,040
 Well,

882
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,880
 she was at it again last night. I had to

883
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,920
 literally put like a bunch of things in front of the door.

884
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:13,340
 Wait a minute.

885
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,880
 I just saw. Hold on.

886
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,980
 I want to hear this, but

887
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,740
 Nick Newman has just shared

888
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,260
 an astounding fact.

889
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:23,000
 He claims horse saliva

890
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,040
 does not have digestive properties.

891
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,380
 What?

892
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:28,900
 Again, that's why I had to breaking

893
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:29,540
 news this.

894
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:32,740
 So like, how do they

895
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,820
 wait? So they chew, chew, chew.

896
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,980
 So they're just totally chewing. No, no

897
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,020
 additional help from.

898
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,040
 I mean,

899
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,940
 there's stuff inside their inside their gut,

900
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,820
 but it unlike

901
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,100
 with humans, where with humans.

902
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,000
 The digestive

903
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,820
 process begins with the mouth juices.

904
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,780
 All right. Where is where is Newman? See here?

905
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:53,080
 It'd

906
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,120
 be weird if he wasn't

907
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,320
 because he's typed in the chat.

908
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,960
 Right, right.

909
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,680
 It'd be really weird if he's just typing

910
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,000
 rando stuff and just guessed

911
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,660
 on that. He wouldn't have guessed on that.

912
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,900
 Not in a million years. Could you guess about mouth

913
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,780
 juices? He might be at work and not able

914
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,800
 to talk, though. Where did he go?

915
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,440
 Hey, what's going on?

916
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,920
 There he is. Okay.

917
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,840
 Well, how the hell does the horse

918
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,820
 digestive work if they're if they're saliva

919
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,020
 doesn't have any digestive properties?

920
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,260
 Yeah, their saliva has had no enzymes.

921
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,700
 It is. It is just a

922
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,320
 lubricant and

923
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,880
 the digestion doesn't start until their guts.

924
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,360
 Yeah,

925
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,100
 it's just a lubricant.

926
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,640
 That's why they're so dismissive of a lubricant.

927
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,200
 There's just a lubricant.

928
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,120
 That's why they're big old mushy

929
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,120
 snout. It's more cushion for the pushing.

930
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,940
 So when we give medicine,

931
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,100
 we have to be aware of that, that the

932
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,360
 medicine will not

933
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,960
 start. You can't give sublingual

934
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,040
 medication to a horse. It has to get to their

935
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,060
 gut before it can.

936
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,920
 Podcast.

937
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,100
 Okay. Now, now that we

938
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,080
 have you here and with your horse facts, okay,

939
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,120
 we discussed that a wolf

940
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,180
 used someone else's crab trap, right?

941
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,080
 My cats have learned to escape from their

942
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,140
 own cat. Now, in

943
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:10,140
 Sweden, birds have figured out how to

944
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:12,080
 convert litter

945
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,840
 into food. Have you seen this?

946
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,140
 No, no. Litter?

947
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,960
 In Sweden. Like cat litter?

948
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,960
 No, like

949
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,120
 refuse. Just regular trash?

950
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,740
 Yes. So they have

951
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,960
 so they've set up machines

952
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:26,980
 where if you bring

953
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:30,120
 basically garbage to this machine,

954
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,660
 the machine will take it in

955
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:34,520
 and then give out bird seed as a

956
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,760
 thank you. And so

957
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,820
 birds have started cleaning up around

958
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:40,040
 parks in Sweden. Oh, my.

959
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,540
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

960
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,060
 So they're not actually converting.

961
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:46,040
 They're not like, it's not Mr. Fusion type

962
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,960
 science. They're not converting.

963
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,860
 I thought you were, I thought you were saying like

964
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:52,020
 they're learning how to eat cigarette

965
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,880
 butts. No, no, no. That's what I thought.

966
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,180
 And then I thought, man, I'm never

967
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,660
 going to put one of those nicotine

968
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,780
 addicted birds in my mouth again.

969
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:06,140
 No, but the birds collect

970
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:07,500
 trash, put it in a receptacle,

971
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,920
 the receptacle

972
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,440
 once having obtained the trash

973
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,160
 gives out some bird seed

974
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,000
 as a reward for the bird doing it.

975
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,660
 Crows are going to love this.

976
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,880
 It's a startup project in Sweden

977
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,380
 by a company called Corvid Cleaning

978
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:23,640
 and they're training wild

979
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,480
 crows to pick up litter.

980
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,820
 What did I just say?

981
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,720
 And I certainly have not put a crow in my mouth

982
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:30,740
 all the way.

983
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,480
 All the way? All the way.

984
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,660
 So some of the way you have?

985
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,400
 I didn't say that.

986
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,240
 Okay. Seems like the qualifier implies

987
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,340
 that you can't ever know.

988
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:43,100
 You'll never know. Seems like a weird

989
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,740
 thing to bring up. You'll never know.

990
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:47,300
 That's between me and author James

991
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,080
 O'Barr. Yeah.

992
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,140
 Newman, what is the smartest thing

993
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:52,380
 you've ever seen a horse do?

994
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:55,040
 I had a horse. He's a racehorse named

995
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:55,940
 King Sonic.

996
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:59,220
 And if we didn't fill his water

997
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,180
 bucket, like if his

998
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:03,340
 water bucket in the stall got too low,

999
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,100
 he would shit in it.

1000
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,600
 Whoa.

1001
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:09,660
 And I

1002
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,240
 believe he would

1003
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,700
 realize that I was irritated

1004
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,620
 with the shit I had to clean out of this bucket.

1005
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:18,980
 And he'd be like,

1006
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:21,680
 if you don't fill your bucket,

1007
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,580
 you're going to get cleaned.

1008
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:26,040
 And he had a full bucket at all times.

1009
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,540
 But he tried.

1010
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:31,820
 Matt, did you ever have any patrons like that

1011
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:32,700
 when you were a bartender?

1012
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:36,020
 Yes. Holding their empty beer glass,

1013
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:36,860
 if I took too long, they just

1014
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:38,720
 shat in their beer glass and put it up on the thing

1015
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,820
 and be like, oh, do you want to get me

1016
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:41,220
 a beer?

1017
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:46,620
 That's why Matt stopped allowing patrons

1018
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:47,940
 with kilts into the restaurant.

1019
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,680
 I was like, I really got to keep my

1020
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,920
 keep up my laps around this Tierney's bar

1021
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,800
 or else it'll be glasses of poop.

1022
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,800
 I did not get me beer for like

1023
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,240
 three minutes. So here you go,

1024
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,920
 Sonny. You got a pint

1025
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,420
 of Guinness crap.

1026
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,120
 You got a pint of poop?

1027
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,940
 A pint of poo. A pint

1028
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:06,540
 of the old

1029
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:07,720
 hot brown.

1030
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,760
 Enjoy it.

1031
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,980
 We did have a woman who would come into the bar

1032
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,500
 typically on Sunday afternoons

1033
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,920
 and she

1034
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,760
 loved the taste of

1035
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,980
 bass beer.

1036
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,160
 Bass ale?

1037
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,620
 Yeah, bass ale.

1038
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:26,400
 But if she had

1039
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,580
 too much beer,

1040
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:30,760
 she would blow up the

1041
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,500
 restroom, like just

1042
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,480
 destroy it.

1043
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,540
 Yeah.

1044
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:36,200
 Like,

1045
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:38,320
 hover and destroy.

1046
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,380
 Oh, no.

1047
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:42,360
 The hovering is the worst.

1048
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,020
 And just turn the women's bathroom

1049
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:46,180
 into a super

1050
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,120
 fun site. Oh, somebody gave

1051
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,420
 her her fifth bass ale

1052
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,940
 and they didn't realize

1053
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:54,340
 she's about to crack that bathroom

1054
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:55,740
 like the Liberty Bell.

1055
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:58,340
 And because she was

1056
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:59,060
 a tiny... She cracked it!

1057
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:01,420
 She cracked it like the Liberty Bell.

1058
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:03,200
 How about them apples, eh?

1059
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,100
 That is a spot on Boston accent,

1060
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:06,340
 Paul.

1061
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:07,320
 That's right.

1062
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,940
 Look out for the Grand Canyon

1063
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:12,000
 known as your mama's twat.

1064
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,440
 What? That's right.

1065
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,820
 That's a Grand Canyon...

1066
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:17,080
 I'm sorry, are you Scottish?

1067
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,240
 Are you Scottish?

1068
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,360
 I didn't know.

1069
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,020
 I didn't know.

1070
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:27,080
 I don't know.

1071
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:30,100
 Scooping over girls'

1072
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:30,600
 piff here.

1073
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:34,400
 So because

1074
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,100
 she was a petite woman,

1075
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:38,820
 it took us a very long time

1076
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:39,560
 to put two and two together

1077
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:40,360
 that this was happening.

1078
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,520
 Because the Sunday Day crowd

1079
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,620
 didn't attract a lot of women.

1080
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,700
 So therefore, we weren't going to the women's bathroom

1081
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:48,100
 very often in the shift

1082
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,980
 to check things out, right?

1083
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,260
 And it took us... It was Pat,

1084
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:54,720
 my buddy Pat, who finally was figuring out

1085
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,220
 that this woman, if she had a second beer,

1086
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:59,380
 would like shit herself all over.

1087
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:03,940
 The thing...

1088
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:06,360
 So now here's my question to you.

1089
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,700
 To you, Matt. Here's my question to you.

1090
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,500
 So we all have feverish flashbacks, right?

1091
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,840
 Because, you know, someone finishes a beer, you go,

1092
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,680
 you want another one? Whatever.

1093
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,520
 And I used to always make fun of the fact that she would giggle

1094
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,680
 and be like, oh, really? Oh, uh...

1095
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:17,280
 Oh, shoot.

1096
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,340
 And she was like, uh, yes, I suppose.

1097
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,640
 She got really excited about getting that second beer.

1098
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,220
 Because she was playing

1099
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,720
 Russian roulette with her asshole?

1100
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,480
 Yes.

1101
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:31,120
 And I was like, oh my god, that explains why she was so fucking weird

1102
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,440
 every time I offered her a second beer.

1103
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,580
 That's really funny.

1104
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,480
 This is my question to you.

1105
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,040
 Yeah.

1106
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:37,720
 Fucking howitzer back there.

1107
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,420
 In your theorizing. Well, this is what I'm wondering, Jacob.

1108
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:43,680
 Is... What do you guys envision?

1109
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,580
 Are we thinking like

1110
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,260
 a whoopee cushion type

1111
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:48,800
 flapping action?

1112
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,000
 Or are we talking like

1113
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,260
 a hole so tight it's like

1114
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:55,340
 putting your thumb over the end of a garden hose

1115
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:58,120
 thus causing all the crazy...

1116
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,860
 Was she just really

1117
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:01,900
 clenched back there

1118
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,780
 and that was what caused everything going crazy?

1119
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,020
 Or was it all flippity-flappity?

1120
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,220
 No, I think she's too loose.

1121
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,980
 I think your flippity-flappity is right on.

1122
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,440
 She's flippity-flappity. All right.

1123
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,280
 She's flippity-flappity.

1124
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,180
 All right.

1125
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:14,480
 There's no way she's going to make it home, right?

1126
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,360
 Well, I tell you what.

1127
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,220
 I'm going to start peeping on the girls

1128
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,120
 drinking the bass ale at the bars

1129
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,620
 because I got the flippity-flappity going on.

1130
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:23,900
 Because you like that hot brown.

1131
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,060
 I'm down for the flippity-flappity.

1132
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:30,840
 Nobody tell Ann.

1133
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,860
 What?

1134
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:36,260
 She's like, yeah, Paul Mattingly will go to a bar.

1135
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:36,700
 I'm going to go to a bar.

1136
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:43,660
 Any minute now.

1137
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:46,900
 That's really funny, man.

1138
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:47,760
 Yeah.

1139
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,700
 And that really explained her odd behavior.

1140
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:51,560
 Yes.

1141
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:54,500
 Did she ever cop

1142
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,000
 to blowing up the bathroom?

1143
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,680
 Was she subtle enough?

1144
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,700
 Could you smell it on her when she got out?

1145
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,420
 You say it went everywhere.

1146
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:02,840
 She was still pretty clean?

1147
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,820
 She did not come out looking like a dirty gal?

1148
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:06,160
 I think she didn't come out like a...

1149
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,300
 A poop scarecrow?

1150
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:07,560
 Yeah.

1151
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:13,720
 Can you imagine?

1152
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,600
 She came out covered in shit and hay

1153
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,960
 and she's just like,

1154
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,900
 I don't know what happened.

1155
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,680
 I don't know what happened.

1156
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:26,640
 I got attacked by someone dressed up

1157
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,200
 like the Wizard of Oz.

1158
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:33,860
 I believe she would leave after she

1159
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,700
 fucked the bathroom.

1160
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:36,060
 Oh.

1161
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:38,060
 So you couldn't get a real good look.

1162
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:39,660
 Yeah, was it?

1163
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,160
 Did anybody see any...

1164
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,400
 Did she ever, like, trail anything out of the

1165
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,680
 restaurant?

1166
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,360
 Was there ever, like, a...

1167
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,020
 It's not that I don't appreciate your questions, Paul.

1168
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,760
 It's that...

1169
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,660
 He signed an NDA.

1170
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,060
 The answer to all these questions means

1171
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,880
 we would have figured it out was her sooner

1172
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:58,560
 than we did.

1173
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,420
 It took us a while to decipher.

1174
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:02,780
 It doesn't necessarily...

1175
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:05,180
 You wouldn't necessarily have been able to follow the trail.

1176
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:07,460
 Uh, I don't know.

1177
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:09,240
 I mean, if you look at the floor of Tierney's...

1178
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,700
 If you look at the floor of Tierney's Tavern,

1179
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:11,740
 it's on the same floor.

1180
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:13,840
 This is 1938.

1181
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:17,940
 She might have walked backwards to throw you off.

1182
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:20,500
 She might have done some weird, tricky...

1183
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:21,800
 And, like, gestured to things on, like,

1184
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,180
 the shelves and stuff, just pointing.

1185
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:23,820
 Yeah.

1186
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:24,800
 Oh, look at that.

1187
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,200
 As she's leaving.

1188
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,720
 And then suddenly you look down and there's just...

1189
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,940
 She was doing card tricks on her way out

1190
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:33,320
 just so you wouldn't look at her feet.

1191
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:36,040
 There's this thin stream going on.

1192
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,220
 She's going all the way from the bathroom.

1193
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:38,340
 You're like, what the hell?

1194
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:41,980
 No, and then...

1195
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,220
 I've heard of a snail trail, but this is ridiculous.

1196
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:48,120
 So we eventually kept the one-beer rule.

1197
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,880
 She would come in, we'd have a beer,

1198
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,120
 and then we would just ignore her until she left.

1199
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:56,420
 I bet she was relieved in a lot of ways.

1200
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,800
 And then not relieved in some other ways.

1201
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,620
 She was more relieved after a second bath.

1202
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:05,080
 Oh.

1203
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:06,720
 Yeah.

1204
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,880
 More like ass ale.

1205
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,640
 Am I right?

1206
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,540
 Exactly.

1207
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:10,860
 Ass ale.

1208
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:11,800
 Ass bale.

1209
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,960
 Ass bale.

1210
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,260
 Move the B over.

1211
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:20,400
 While we've been talking, I've been doing some internet searches

1212
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,600
 while we've been talking because my Google search history

1213
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,600
 is not weird enough.

1214
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:27,280
 And apparently a lot of people complain about bass

1215
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,820
 making them shit themselves.

1216
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:36,020
 Apparently it's not an uncommon critique of bass ale.

1217
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,460
 What is the diuretic in bass ale?

1218
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:41,020
 Well, all liquor is a bit of a diuretic.

1219
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:43,520
 Oh, really, Professor Jacob?

1220
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,220
 Do tell.

1221
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:49,160
 I just did.

1222
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:53,620
 That's where you're suspicious of Jacob's science and saying

1223
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,580
 all liquor is a sense of dung.

1224
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:56,880
 I just want to know more.

1225
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,020
 Apparently someone...

1226
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:00,400
 I mean, I didn't have to ask him anything.

1227
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,840
 He's just like, right off the cuff, he's like,

1228
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:05,840
 Oh, yes, well, it turns out that all liquor has certain medications

1229
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:07,360
 or properties that...

1230
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,360
 I did not use my Boston accent.

1231
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:15,000
 They often cause the flappity-flappity to go very short and brown.

1232
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,760
 Yeast and gas.

1233
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,760
 Alcohol increases your gut moddily.

1234
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,900
 Things move through you faster.

1235
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:24,800
 I don't know.

1236
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,520
 M-O-T-I-L-I-T-Y.

1237
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:27,140
 Modality.

1238
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:32,340
 M-O-T-I-L-I-T-Y?

1239
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:34,580
 Motility?

1240
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:35,480
 Motility.

1241
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:37,900
 Yeah, motility.

1242
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:38,680
 Yeah, motility, yeah.

1243
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,000
 I guess, sure.

1244
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,020
 Motility.

1245
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:43,220
 Things move through you faster.

1246
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,040
 Your body has less time to absorb water,

1247
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,320
 and that makes looser, quicker bowel movements.

1248
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:49,820
 All right.

1249
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:56,040
 Well, if you're bound up like a cat in a cage, maybe have a bass.

1250
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,740
 They should start branding it that way.

1251
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:01,220
 Why don't they start branding it?

1252
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:03,980
 We can do a whole new Big Mouth Billy Bass.

1253
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,000
 Why is there not Bass Ale next to the...

1254
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:08,680
 Prune juice in the old person's section at the store?

1255
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,420
 Why isn't there?

1256
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:11,580
 Yeah, why isn't there?

1257
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:14,220
 Probably because of liquor laws, but it's stupid.

1258
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:15,220
 Ah, okay.

1259
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:19,040
 Maybe they could put prune juice next to the Bass Ale in the liquor cabinet

1260
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,580
 so people would get the idea.

1261
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,260
 I'm also curious.

1262
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:22,860
 It was black and tans, right?

1263
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:23,860
 Yeah.

1264
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:25,580
 That's where people do half bass.

1265
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:26,620
 That's no way to speak of her.

1266
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:31,020
 Half Guinness, half Bass Ale is called a black and tan.

1267
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:31,960
 Oh, is that right?

1268
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:32,580
 Okay, okay.

1269
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:33,180
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1270
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,120
 I thought for a second you were turning into an ice agent.

1271
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:35,680
 Go ahead.

1272
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:37,460
 Oh, my God.

1273
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:38,440
 Have you heard that song?

1274
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,980
 Yeah.

1275
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:42,640
 Jesse Elms, is that his name?

1276
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:43,840
 Yeah, it's fucking great.

1277
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,420
 I've been following him on TikTok for a minute.

1278
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:47,620
 Really well written.

1279
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:48,500
 On a lot of different socials.

1280
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:51,920
 He has some really cutting songs.

1281
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,740
 I guess his first album just came out.

1282
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:54,560
 He's blowing up.

1283
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:55,720
 Jesse Wells.

1284
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,460
 Oh, good for him.

1285
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:57,180
 Jesse Wells.

1286
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:57,720
 Jesse Wells.

1287
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:58,560
 He's so good.

1288
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,180
 Have you heard any of his stuff?

1289
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:02,100
 Jacob?

1290
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,600
 Yeah, I have.

1291
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,000
 I know him from social media.

1292
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:05,900
 Oh, yeah.

1293
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:06,500
 Folk singer.

1294
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,600
 Really, really strong.

1295
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,460
 No, I didn't know he had an album.

1296
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:11,020
 That's really cool.

1297
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:18,000
 His Join Ice song is South Park level, scathing and well written.

1298
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,740
 I did hear, I heard clips of this.

1299
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:22,140
 This was, it was amazing.

1300
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,280
 Yeah, that's interesting.

1301
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,180
 That's an interesting thing to note, Matt.

1302
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:30,940
 I would be surprised if he doesn't get tapped to put together some sort of musical.

1303
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,860
 Yeah, I mean, yeah.

1304
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,980
 If you say right for South Park, which is not the gift that you think,

1305
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:37,900
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1306
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:39,080
 Put together his own musical.

1307
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,140
 You talk to anyone who's ever.

1308
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:41,020
 Yeah, yeah.

1309
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:43,700
 I just think it's a fun fact for people to know is if you ever listen to anyone who's

1310
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:48,520
 ever been tapped by South Park to be a writer, it is a brutal, crazy ass process to be.

1311
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,100
 Unless you're, unless you're a hater, right?

1312
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:52,660
 He had, he's the only one that had fun with it.

1313
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:53,520
 Yeah, yeah.

1314
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,560
 Yeah.

1315
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,200
 But he'd already made his bones, so he didn't have to sweat it.

1316
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,140
 He was already Bill Hader.

1317
00:59:58,140 --> 00:59:58,360
 Yeah.

1318
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:58,580
 Yeah.

1319
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:03,660
 But yeah, anyhow, sorry.

1320
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,720
 I got distracted because I heard it this morning and I was just like,

1321
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:07,440
 my jaw was on the floor.

1322
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,720
 I was like, good Lord, this song.

1323
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,380
 So a black and tan.

1324
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:12,500
 Yes.

1325
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:15,740
 Do you think that would be a proper diuretic remedy?

1326
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:18,460
 Um, it would, it would slow things down.

1327
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:18,640
 Right.

1328
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,940
 Cause the, uh, I don't think stout has the same effect.

1329
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:30,280
 Oh, oh, so it's like, Oh, no, I'm saying, no, I don't even know what mortality means.

1330
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,920
 So maybe I shouldn't be saying what it's like.

1331
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,020
 Going to Chili's.

1332
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:35,800
 I down a fifth of Pepto-Bismol.

1333
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:37,620
 Before I eat my triple dipper.

1334
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:40,160
 So it all kind of works out in the wash.

1335
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:40,740
 I got you.

1336
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:43,340
 That's why he is a motherfucking professional.

1337
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:49,960
 I mean, yeah, pre-pepto, I call it my Pepto talk.

1338
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:52,620
 I'm giving my system, the Pepto talk, I guess.

1339
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:57,140
 Oh, what I was going to get at is that like, I don't go to bars nearly as often, but I don't even think bad.

1340
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:59,240
 I don't, I don't think bass is still on tap at tyrannies.

1341
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:04,100
 I haven't, what was the last time I've seen bass on tap anywhere is what I was trying to think of.

1342
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:05,820
 Is bass still like a bass?

1343
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:07,200
 It's around very, very often.

1344
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:12,220
 I think, I think it's, I think it's a, I think it's an old, old, I think it's gone the way of the.

1345
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:16,160
 Does it have, does it have fish in it?

1346
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,140
 Fish, fish oil.

1347
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:19,540
 That's what really gets it going.

1348
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:20,140
 It's the fish oil.

1349
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:23,820
 What do they call that?

1350
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:25,200
 What do they call it?

1351
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:29,120
 Omega three and omega six fats and the, uh, and the bass ale.

1352
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,720
 Omega three fatties.

1353
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:35,020
 That was your nickname for that, that crazy shitter later.

1354
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:35,720
 That's the name of this.

1355
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,340
 Oh, here comes omega three fatty.

1356
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:42,380
 If Jacob would put on a few LBs, we could be an omega three fatty.

1357
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:43,860
 Sorry.

1358
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:44,820
 God damn it.

1359
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:45,320
 I'm trying.

1360
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:49,920
 Omega three fatty.

1361
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:50,780
 I had dinner.

1362
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:54,160
 We're the alpha three fatty.

1363
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,280
 Thank you very much.

1364
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,080
 That's right.

1365
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,820
 Who are we kidding?

1366
01:01:57,820 --> 01:01:59,100
 We're the beta three fatties.

1367
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:00,800
 We're the beta three family.

1368
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:05,420
 Speaking of betas, let's do a little jock versus nerd.

01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,680
 Yeah, Josie and the beta three fatties.

 Beta three fatties.

 Time for jock versus nerd.

 Explosion.

1444
01:09:56,200 --> 01:10:07,280

1446
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:16,480
 people in ireland abe froman sausage king of chicago is guilty of truancy but don't worry

1447
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:21,740
 all around swell human being jeffrey jones is on the case so do you know who jeffrey jones is

1448
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:26,180

1449
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:31,740
 matt oh uh so the it's this is all matthew broderick uh the movie is ferris bueller's

1450
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:35,120
 day off and uh year before killing all those people in ireland is matthew broderick when he

1451
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:39,380
 was an actor uh killed a bunch of people in ireland and they basically paid off and covered

1452
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:45,380
 up the case uh he plays he said he lies and says he's abe froman sausage of chicago oh that's his

1453
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:52,200
 alias in that that's right and jeffrey technically i think uh cameron is the one that provides the

1454
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:55,240
 voice for abe froman oh i think you're right

1455

01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:54,840
 i was wondering what was taking you so long on that one because i thought for a minute it was

1501
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:59,380
 talking about soul man because he was melanin challenged oh i was like powder

1502

 i guess that k-packs uh residual money isn't coming in like it used to that idiot here's

1508
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:43,940
 the thing like why should why why get into this at all um uh we love walking on the tightrope baby

1510
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:54,700
 i mean we all hate him that's all i'm saying for lloyd how to pronounce gigawatt

1511
01:16:54,700 --> 01:17:00,180
 just that's the whole question is who the hell taught christopher lloyd how to pronounce gigawatt

1512
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:03,940
 did he not pronounce it correctly in back to the future which is the answer to this question

1513
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:13,660
 gigawatt did he say gigawatt or gigawatt he says gigawatts 1.21 gigawatts well there you go

1514
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:18,240
 i guess that's how you mispronounce it yeah and matt closing out the category and the game 80s

1528
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:39,800
 hear from you we need to hear from you it's part of the whole show it is um i was basically lost

1529
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:43,160
 in like trying to find how i was going to say the kevin spacey thing and not leave a curiosity and

1530
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:47,100
 worse things happening going to a future episode so um uh uh

1531
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:54,600
 on the one hand he was acquitted of everything he was never convicted uh he had one conviction

1532
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:59,920
 in a foreign court that was overturned and on the other hand you're not entitled to be a movie star

1533
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:07,920
 like uh like uh being a working actor is one thing being a star involves affection and you

1534
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:13,040
 can lose affection right and there are many people who've had their career take a downturn

1535
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:17,080
 for less controversial reasons who simply can't be actors anymore

1536
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:24,360
 right so the idea that kevin smith kevin smith kevin spacey let's not mix those two up

1537
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:33,220
 dr freud the idea that kevin spacey is homeless to me just simply says he's not willing to work

1538
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:40,580
 at any other job like you can do other things besides act he's and make money like you're not

1539
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:46,740
 like do something else yeah he's getting what he deserves what a show um yeah yeah

1540
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:56,140
 yeah i'm just i i don't i don't believe that he is destitute or anything like that yeah so i so i'm

1541
01:19:56,140 --> 01:20:01,020
 just i just don't care about the the story at all it also means it also means like did you do

1542
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:06,160
 nothing with your money while you were like making all that money like what are you including just

1543
