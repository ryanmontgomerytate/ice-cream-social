 Johnny do you want to go to an ice cream social? Yeah, I'd love to great. Let's go

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,360
 We had a party at the house last night I stayed up too late

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,560
 I said, were you drinking?

13
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:10,520
 It's time for Matt Mattingly's ice cream social sitting in Las Vegas

14
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:16,300
 It's Matt Donnelly sitting in Pittsburgh PA. That's Paul Mattingly also sitting in Las Vegas. It's me Jacob the audio guy

15
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,460
 We're preaching fun. We sure are yee-haw

16
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:24,560
 Well, I did it guys. I taught my first improv class in a long time

17
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,040
 In a well, I've been teaching other improv classes

18
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,960
 But this is my first structured improv class in a long time where I'm having the same students over and over again

19
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,120
 I got 12. The second woo was for the structure not for the improv class. 12 wonderful students

20
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:45,320
 You got a good structure and I gotta say I'm I'm a little apprehensive because of course at the end of class

21
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,320
 What do you think I did?

22
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,160
 Fart. I obelisked all of them. I gave everybody I gave everybody a chip

23
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:58,960
 So, you know everybody a chip. I'm either gonna have some people coming back being like, oh wow Paul

24
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,720
 Okay, or be like who am I learning from good?

25
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,800
 So anyway, yeah

26
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:17,960
 Exactly, I took the gamble and we'll see but a big thanks again to Justin for getting things cooking again with skit and forgive me

27
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,440
 Yeah, you know, it's it's it's gonna be really good it's a more good stuff happening you haven't figured it out

28
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,880
 Justin Zell's not in it for the money. I don't know. I don't know if you have to figure that out yet

29
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:38,400
 But or if he is he's bad at it. Well, no, and you know what? Well, the other thing is - neither am I I mean

30
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:47,560
 You're not teaching improv to make you know, but it is helping me do less target work, which is great

31
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,160
 That's exactly it. That's exactly it

32
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,720
 Yeah, one less day of

33
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,960
 Working at a target that is precisely it. I have cut back to basically three days a week now and

34
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,360
 It's gonna save my ass cuz oh man. Oh

35
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,560
 Cash grab Mattingly. That's right. That's good

36
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,200
 I don't want you walking around target too much because I don't want that sweet sweet dairy air to fade away

37
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,360
 I mean, it's true the word you got to keep them cakes

38
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,560
 Maybe the words of sir mix a lot ringing my ears every day, especially days like today

39
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,120
 But I'm slurping on a little chocolate milkshake. I know when you're sad bands or sit-ups, but please don't lose that

40
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,000
 But no trust trust this this shelf is only intact. This is here, baby. Yeah

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,480
 Matt Donnelly, you're back on dry land. Yeah, man. Yes. Yeah

42
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,360
 Attend your party, but literally I haven't been home in a month. So it was like oh

43
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,080
 SJ was like I sent Matt and Sarah

44
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,720
 Text about the party. I didn't I didn't hear back from them

45
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,560
 I didn't say anything to her, but I was like that they are not coming

46
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,720
 Back on land they're not coming to our house

47
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:01,760
 Two nights in a row got to be have all four of us home with our children

48
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,620
 Yeah, and then of course, yeah, I was on full soccer dad duties last night

49
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,600
 Which yeah, that's lovely around town or whatever. But yeah, how are the boys?

50
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,680
 Did you notice any changes since you were gone?

51
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,080
 Yes, yeah, they got an employment. Yeah, that's a six seven

52
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:23,440
 Yeah, so I was in the car with my oldest and and

53
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,520
 Somebody goes to school with driving them home and I told it was like, you know

54
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:34,800
 My son now my oldest son now goes to performing arts middle school. So that means I'm probably impromptu games. That's awesome

55
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:41,280
 Totally and so we were comparing because I just went home for what the last thing I did was I did it my improv jam room

56
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,280
 Which I want to talk a lot about on the show. Yeah

57
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,620
 But we were going over improv games and I said, yeah, these are games

58
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,000
 I started playing when I was like 16 17 years old and they started laughing

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,760
 And I said wait 16 17 counts as six seven. Ah

60
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,400
 Did they did they get called out doesn't really like oh, yeah. Yeah, they're laughing. Yeah. Yeah good

61
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,440
 No, no, they're not subtle about it. Like we're driving the car. My kid is like perfect time

62
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,860
 I look at it says six or seven on the on the dad

63
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,600
 Like it's not so it's everywhere. It's everywhere. Yeah. Yeah easiness

64
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,560
 The new South Park is is all it's all of it. Also, they all know that it means nothing. Yeah, right, right

65
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,600
 Yeah, it's just gibberish. This is just you know

66
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,400
 They know that like it just happened to be in a song and then some guy did a little tick-tock and it's all out there

67
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,760
 Yeah, it's just a vaguely annoyed some of their parents. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

68
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,760
 so yeah, but I

69
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,440
 went

70
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,640
 Theotic clumsy they were just laughing at the idea of you being young. Yes, that part is definitely

71
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,800
 Well, I don't think even we were putting together the improv lineup we're like, you know

72
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,960
 I know it's been 27 years. We do this has been 27 years

73
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,560
 We did that I go can we we should stop saying 27 years. It's definitely been 31 years

74
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,580
 That's what's blowing my mind when I'm teaching again like 21 years

75
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,840
 One of my students asked me straight up

76
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:08,880
 I'm like 20 years and I'm like wait, I've been teaching like 22 years and if I've been teaching 22 years, I've been improvising

77
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,540
 Oh my god, no, let's not go down this rabbit hole

78
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,240
 This is no press rabbit hole for any of us to go down

79
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,320
 But this is like what I'm just talking about like as my buddy Pat my buddy Pat

80
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,320
 He's gonna be doing the Tierney's thing with us this Thursday

81
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,800
 I found out that I've been spelling his name wrong for our entire friendship, which was embarrassing

82
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,720
 He was like, I'm pretty sure we talked about this multiple times. I was like I have a

83
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,800
 False memory of you telling me how to spell your name properly where I it's Pat Shepard

84
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,480
 I've been spelling it with the second. I've been fun at Sheppard and

85
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,360
 Okay, I thought for a fact. That's actually what he instructed me to do one time

86
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,960
 He's like like it's like Shep and Hart and I was like great and I literally had a conversation with him

87
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,840
 Like just like three days ago or he was like, nope

88
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,300
 Never said that never starts to do that definitely been all ease on my last name the entire time. You've known me

89
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:02,320
 Was like how do I make up for the fact that I've been spelling you like I can't

90
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,540
 That's like there's no mea culpa. Like we're lifelong friends. Like we are

91
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:15,800
 Retire improv lives and I I think the only thing that you can do here is tell him how to spell your last name

92
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,400
 Incorrectly, yeah, let him spell it correctly the rest of your life

93
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,680
 My braves really racking like possible like big-time solutions because it's so embarrassing

94
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,880
 How do you undo 30 years of mistakes like like it's also like it's the number one bitch behind my back, right?

95
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,960
 If you're like guys need to spell my fucking name, right? We're supposed to be brothers

96
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:40,220
 You know, right like I have no defense for being like if there's any sense of like I am a fucking ogre selfish ogre

97
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,880
 It's like I never learned how to spell. I was better than what I thought you meant though

98
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,160
 I thought you meant you were misspelling Pat. No

99
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,160
 PIT Pat

100
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,320
 And it's not like we're casual friends

101
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:02,520
 No, like possible side effects many press releases many articles many listings of who's playing in the shows

102
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:10,280
 I've put out his name numerous times and shout it to the rafters with incorrect spelling just 30 years. I

103
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:18,360
 I don't think I don't think that you can change it. I think the only way forward is to continue on

104
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,860
 When he was like no, we've definitely conversations about I think well clearly I don't remember I go

105
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,440
 I would I just want to say clearly one. I'm sorry and two

106
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,420
 This wasn't some elaborate trolling that I've been doing up for 30 years. Like I don't

107
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,580
 I know I'm capable of these bits

108
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:39,360
 Oh man side note on the word bit

109
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:46,480
 Fucking so jealous Amy Poehler great podcast and she's in two people about two elaborate bits

110
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,640
 One is the guy Cole Escala who wrote the Oh Mary Mary. Oh, yeah. Yeah

111
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,960
 So they are so fucking funny there. He has a bit where he calls someone and on their voicemail

112
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:04,640
 He leaves a message as if he's talking to someone else's voicemail about the person so he's talking about having to kill the person

113
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,760
 He's leaving a message for to another person

114
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:13,420
 Yeah, so like if I called Paul, I'd be like, what's up, Jacob? Look, it's got to go down Paul's out of hand

115
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:25,320
 Yes, yeah we have to murder Paul so that's a bit he does with all of his friends that he has to murder these

116
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,840
 Colluding with their other friends to murder that person great

117
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,680
 That's pretty I'm so jealous of that bit and then fucking Aziz and Zari

118
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,200
 His bet on Amy Poehler was fantastic

119
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,000
 so he found out Amy Poehler's kids the names of their best friends and

120
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,820
 So when the kids would visit set Aziz and Zari would walk by on the phone

121
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,340
 Pretending to talk to their best friends and ignoring them

122
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,920
 Ha Amy Poehler's children's best friends. So he would not speak to her children

123
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,140
 He would pretend to speak to their friends and it was it's like, you know

124
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:10,400
 Dalton or something. Yeah. Yeah, but it was yeah, they're like, oh, yeah. Hey Dalton. No, I haven't seen Amy Poehler's kids around lately

125
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,940
 Yeah, I don't know where they are. I'm sure they're fine, but I don't know where they are. Let's get together

126
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,000
 Let's say this let's do that. Like he's just like

127
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,400
 And I'm like, oh, that's a really good bit that is a really really good thing

128
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,180
 But yeah, yeah, so

129
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,360
 But yeah, so we got together

130
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,200
 Hilariously at Kevin Smith's smod castle. We did the reunion, right? Yes

131
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,200
 And so I just walk in and I'm just surrounded by Kevin Smith

132
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,960
 Everything right they've decorated everything just a ton of memorabilia. I just saw there's a

133
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:52,080
 He just got the the mall rats poster original art. Yeah, very very recently framed up

134
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:57,660
 That's the Drew Struzan piece who just just passed away passed away a legendary artist Drew Struzan

135
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,080
 Yeah, so he did I mean really it's worth looking up that guy

136
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,640
 He did every movie Oh everything that we grew up with for sure. Yeah, he did. Oh, yeah

137
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:14,600
 Yeah, that is that's something that I've been wanting to get into kind of quietly for a long time as old movie posters

138
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:22,880
 And start collecting those but that is the bar to entry getting into that kind of collection is intense

139
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,540
 Well, if you're getting like because I mean what he bought was the original

140
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,480
 Painted work, right? Yeah

141
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,760
 Right, which is even crazy. Yes, it's like 30 30. I'm not even looking at that kind of stuff

142
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,040
 But yeah, it's even just the original prints though. Oh sure

143
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,680
 in movie house

144
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,400
 Because a lot of those are double printed right so they can be illuminated from the back and that kind of thing a lot

145
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:49,220
 Of more double printed or a lot of them have like multiple things with the with the silver bay. It's all yeah. Yeah

146
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,080
 Yeah, all right. Sorry to completely derail, but yes

147
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,800
 And you're full of all this memorabilia

148
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:01,040
 Even one part there's a the poster with like that's one of those stereoscopic vision posters for you. Oh, yeah

149
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,920
 Yeah, sailboat the schooner. Yeah. Yeah, and so that James had a bob underneath and then Jay talking

150
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,560
 I have a button that was misprinted and has Simon Bob talking with the comic book bubble

151
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,800
 Oh funny. It's one of my like what's one of my like little piece of memorabilia

152
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,600
 I'm keeping for it should be valuable in there. It's a misprint

153
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:26,700
 So it turns out Kevin Smith decided to do a mall rats full cast reunion video

154
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,160
 I mean the movie watching and Q&A with the entire cast on the same exact night as my

155
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,560
 Did you get him a chip that's all I want to know that's all I know I

156
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:47,480
 Know I know if I know if Matt got him a chip or not

157
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,320
 No, this is this is I've already shared on this pot

158
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,000
 I believe some of my friend wrote me like hey, maybe we can get a picture of Kevin Smith, and I said maybe you can

159
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,580
 I'm all for you know forgiveness and sleeping dogs lies like that, but I'm not like about to initiate like hey

160
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,440
 It's me not on that night not on that night, right?

161
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,600
 Hey while you're back together the entire cast of all rights. Do you remember kicking me out of a film?

162
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,960
 I just want you to know that I'm

163
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,420
 By the way, I don't know if you've heard this thing called a podcast, but I have one here, please

164
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:26,240
 You've heard of this thing called a podcast mr. 18 podcasts

165
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,720
 So yeah, there's no in on me

166
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,760
 That you remember kicking me off of a movie 20-something years ago

167
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,480
 The only thing that was funny is that I basically ran right in

168
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,280
 I was crossing the street, and he was rounding the corner

169
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,320
 And then there he was and I literally just stopped dead in the sidewalk and the crosswalk

170
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,000
 Walked backwards and just let I just like I don't even want to be able to

171
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:02,720
 See me it happens to recognize me. I don't want this to happen right here. Yeah, I was like no

172
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,240
 I thought I was gonna be okay if we just happen to run each other it literally happened. I was like nope

173
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,240
 I'd rather just let it

174
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:15,280
 My heart was like just you do your thing tonight, I'll do mine, and we'll just be happy, okay

175
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:21,440
 Let's just get through the rest of our lives man

176
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:27,920
 Worry about this no no we got plenty in our lives. We could just move on

177
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,800
 Nothing is plenty of dirt on top of that hatchet right nothing buries that hatchet plenty

178
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:39,940
 So I'm not saying nothing buries it to the point where it's not embarrassing the next time you have to have a conversation

179
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,200
 Yeah, because the truth is it's a 90% chance. He doesn't remember at all

180
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,720
 You know I mean like this is just a chance. He does not remember whatsoever

181
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,400
 You know and I also have to remember that that film did not become like American Pie

182
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,200
 It's enough to go on to do like I can't it wasn't all rats

183
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,000
 I bring up the movie and people go what and you're like yeah

184
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,720
 So so it's like it's not

185
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,400
 I even you know the more important is that I buried the hatchet with Brian who wrote it and had to

186
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,920
 Suffer you know that whole political situation is look at this movie made

187
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,960
 Right, but even I hopped on one of his Instagram lives

188
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,840
 And it was like he was going over how it just came out on on DVD now

189
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,160
 You can just buy it. Yeah, and then I popped on his Instagram live

190
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,840
 And he's just going over how amazing the cast was and everything was amazing and I was like no

191
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,400
 Maybe I'm not totally over it. Okay. Bye, and I just kind of clicked off the live to be like that's enough

192
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,320
 You know so I've still you know I've still spoken with everyone

193
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:39,720
 In it we've all we've all done everything else with our lives. It's all fine, but I just was like oh god

194
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,320
 What a funny curveball to just have

195
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,600
 You know there's a lot around the block not for improv jam. You know there's a

196
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,680
 bit right but

197
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,840
 We got in there they set up a little stage for us in the movie theater and

198
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,560
 We sold out we sold out the show and it was a house and

199
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,880
 and I

200
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:09,520
 Met holding a grudge. I'm shocked and surprised. I'm doing my best to not be a jersey stereotype all right

201
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,520
 I'm trying to be an evolved person

202
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,640
 You're doing great, buddy. You're doing great

203
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:23,200
 It's only who doesn't hold a grudge the guy who ran improv jam because I left that in a very fiery political way

204
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,360
 You know 20 some odd years ago

205
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:34,000
 Yes 20 something years ago when I wanted to show Kevin Smith what what I took my college money and funded a TV pilot with

206
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,120
 My in-buff group not our in-buff group mine. I left

207
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,640
 my hometown in-buff group started my own in college and took the most inexperienced group and decided they were the ones I wanted to

208
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,840
 Work with and we did a TV pilot with them again that became a real TV show

209
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:54,240
 Maybe I wouldn't be invited back to the region, but again it went on didn't know success like the other like the movie

210
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,360
 Just a bunch of people holding grudges throwing money around and no one's better for it

211
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:08,600
 And in fact like there was like the original cool group of the show and then there was like the class that came right after us

212
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,960
 we're all reunited right because

213
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:19,560
 My buddy Pete never left the the group and so he stayed on and and and bonded with another the crew that came right after us

214
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,400
 So it really was like two classes of the show reuniting

215
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:29,400
 30 years later and I was laughing because someone's like where do these new guys come from and I was like

216
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,140
 Well, they came from the fact that Tom Pat and I quit and started our own group and went up north to Jersey

217
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,800
 so it created a vacuum of

218
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,480
 availability for the cast so

219
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,500
 You're like oh I can answer that question. Yeah hoisted by your own

220
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:53,440
 Exactly. So it was a 14 person cast all of us playing games. We haven't played in years

221
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,720
 I'm the most recent holy shit. That's a lie

222
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,040
 And Jacob you're gonna laugh at this, right?

223
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,120
 So they put together a game and Pete did a good job distributing all the games all the different people. Ah

224
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,720
 And he gave to Jeopardy and he went to Jeopardy and he was like blah blah blah

225
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,960
 He goes in Lance you'll host and Lance made a face and I literally froze. I go I go freeze. Oh Lance

226
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,800
 I go yeah

227
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,440
 Have you was hosting jeopardy your thing when you did the show that was not part of your your cast

228
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,640
 He's not not really I go. Do you know how to host jeopardy?

229
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,080
 And he goes no, I go, okay

230
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,440
 Switch games with me. I will host jeopardy you you do this other game. Yeah

231
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,720
 It's like and I said, I'm really sorry

232
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,520
 I was like I don't want to like step on anyone's toes

233
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,520
 I go but hosting jeopardy is super hard and I just made this mistake. I just made this mistake

234
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:47,440
 I made our audio guy with no improv background host jeopardy and I forgot that the jeopardy host is the hardest job in that game

235
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:53,520
 Right. It is to sell everyone's jokes. You have to repeat and sell everybody's jokes

236
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,080
 And you have to move the show along based on the funniest answer and you have to get a sense of whether someone else

237
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,840
 Might have a funnier answer. It is not you just throw somebody in to do it or whatever. And so I

238
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:13,360
 It's a showrunner more than yes. It's a showrunner more than an imp like now. I know exactly what to do

239
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:20,400
 Do it but like that day I was like, oh y'all want what now? Yes

240
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:27,640
 We got on stage. It was like, oh, it's this. Yes. I see that. Yeah, even when it's the most like it's the most like joke like

241
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:36,480
 Pimping you into making dumb jokes, right? It's it's even harder than 185 or those games. Oh, yeah, and so

242
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,720
 I hopped on that grenade Jacob and I was like, no, I'm hosting. I'm hosting jeopardy how to go

243
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,360
 Oh, it went really well. It went really well

244
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:51,000
 I mean the most thing was that honestly like the thing was that Michael Keefe was the guy who ran improv jam when I was a kid

245
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,440
 he was the funniest person I'd ever seen when I went and saw that show like he was so funny and

246
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,360
 I was steal his bits and do his bits in high school and get attention for it

247
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,880
 and then I finally got in the show and got to perform next to him and

248
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:08,720
 When we all got together, you know, he's he was older than us and and so

249
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,320
 You know, I could but I could see him like he had 14 people. He's bouncing 14 people and I could see that

250
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,640
 He was like not like he was kind of champing up a bit a little bit to be funny

251
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,960
 And he was kind of you know, all right, right?

252
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:27,040
 He was kind of making sure everyone's getting getting fed or whatever. And so when dating game came around I just was like

253
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,760
 He was explaining the three kids. I go. Nope. There's four contestants in this one Mike and you are contestant number four

254
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,920
 And so I threw him in a dating game and then and then also I was up for jeopardy and I turned to Pete

255
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,240
 I go I'm gonna do it again and he's like people up here. I go

256
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,640
 Nope, there'll be four people playing in jeopardy tonight Mike for and you're playing in that one as well

257
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,600
 We're doing this

258
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,480
 Yeah, I

259
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,760
 The only I was really happy for myself was

260
00:20:53,760 --> 00:21:00,440
 That like I because I had departed and even reconciled and departed multiple times on

261
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:09,200
 shaky ground I actually just straight up after after his last game just said by the way everybody like all of us are here and

262
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,160
 All of us went on to different things with our lives over the conference that came from doing this show

263
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:20,040
 Please let's give Mike a proper round of applause for what he's done for everybody here and we got standing ovation in the theater

264
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,760
 I was happy because I I

265
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,600
 Really like I said, I I I was very driven and

266
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:37,560
 Certainly at times very egotistical and I was definitely enough through my own thing and I had my own political battles with that

267
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:42,760
 Of course when you look back, you're like boy, am I just a dumb 18 year old kid in those arguments, right? Yes

268
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,160
 And that show just meant so much to me and I did not

269
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,760
 realize the nostalgia

270
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,880
 Factor I was too busy trying to make sure that we were getting 14 people into a show

271
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,280
 I knew I was pretty experienced compared to some of the other people coming back. I was really trying to make sure

272
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,340
 You were the most practice, you know the most recently practiced. Yeah, and so I was trying to really just kind of make sure

273
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,320
 you know because our shows with Brad and

274
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,720
 Jonathan, I mean that's like keeping up with fucking two amazing Titans, you know

275
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,720
 I certainly felt like very in shape for this reunion, right? Yeah

276
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,840
 I

277
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,880
 Did not give myself like the I did not for a second

278
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,360
 I was like, oh wait, you're going back to the epicenter of your entire creative life

279
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,220
 Do you know what I mean? Like you're going back to where you were 16 17 and you started doing

280
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:40,040
 I'm so young at hip

281
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:45,860
 No, like so like my buddy Tom who had a stroke nine months ago and we were literally just told like check in with his wife

282
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,600
 day up

283
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,120
 like whether he would make it or not whether he'd want to play or not or whatever and

284
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,760
 So

285
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,240
 Tom walked in and my buddy Nick

286
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,400
 Those are the guys that were in this show before I get in those the guys that I looked at be like I want to

287
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,400
 Play on stage with those guys, right?

288
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,700
 He just walked in the first person saw was Nick and I just saw Tom and Nick hug and just seeing those two together

289
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,140
 I literally just started lose it like right there. It was like five o'clock the shows at eight. Oh, you were done

290
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,240
 Yeah, I was like good lord, you know

291
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:21,200
 Yeah, and I just wasn't really all this was like how the hell do we make this 14 person improv show?

292
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,000
 The bunch of people haven't practiced go. Well, that's all that was on my mind

293
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,760
 the entire time going into this this has this has to be good, you know, and

294
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,800
 I was not prepared emotionally to be like nobody you're going back to like day one

295
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,440
 You're going back to like the starter space on the game board

296
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:44,480
 and it was really crazy to just feel those other people playing games and going like that that like I was feeling 17 was like

297
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,920
 Oh, I love this game. I want to play this game, too

298
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:51,320
 You know like I was like I want to all the games like all and I just was like right back to being a 17 year

299
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,480
 old just like love on the show also like this weird thing like

300
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,200
 Mike came from

301
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,480
 sack beater in Orlando

302
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,560
 They start they coach the crowds and they say

303
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:09,280
 But before every scene seen in and the whole crowd goes five four three two one

304
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,040
 Arts that's fun. It is fun

305
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,160
 And none of us took it off on our separate improv endeavors

306
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:22,800
 Like Elvis went off to do other improv endeavors and we never did that so we were all just waiting to be introduced and he coached

307
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,600
 The crowd and doing it and hearing a full theater do the countdown again

308
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:32,600
 We all all 14 of us back 13 of us mics on stage all 13 of us went home

309
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,720
 like we like

310
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,740
 We all just got hit in the stomach with a bowling ball like right off the bat like before we even hit the stage

311
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,200
 It was like this crazy

312
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,000
 nostalgia of it and

313
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,360
 It was awesome

314
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,920
 everybody really

315
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,320
 Impressed me

316
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,960
 Everybody was really held their own and did all the right things to start all the games and the crowd was into it

317
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,200
 There's a lot of people who was their first improv show

318
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:04,400
 Which I was going to see their first improv show. Yes, because it was listed on the Smodcastle newsletter. Oh

319
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,900
 So like half the crowd was nostalgic people

320
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:14,520
 We're just like oh, I want to go see some yeah, and it being fucking 30 years a lot of people brought their kids

321
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,700
 Who were the same age as we were?

322
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:24,080
 Like when we were watching the show a lot of people were showing their kids what they watched when they were their age

323
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,960
 And that was a really big trip

324
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:42,140
 And yeah, it was just it was it was just a blast it was just a crazy night out and yeah

325
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,140
 we did all the old games and

326
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,300
 It was it was it was a crazy nutty

327
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:53,420
 Thing to do. I was really glad we did it. I can't imagine doing it again anytime soon

328
00:25:53,420 --> 00:26:02,440
 And then with that in mind we're only getting older right so like right to wait 30 years to do it is

329
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:09,920
 Crazy, and then you're like, well 10 more years than I'm really weird because there was no way we can do all that shit

330
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,460
 You know even when Mike went up we made him do a motion roller coaster

331
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,040
 and

332
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,160
 That was always like this is the strangest thing about this show is that that was our closer

333
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,040
 Before we did a music we did we did we would close with a song at the very end

334
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:28,820
 But the last game we'd play is emotional roller coaster which basically was a tip of the cap to whoever we thought was

335
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:36,000
 Hot shit right that person got to do all the emotion changing so like our way of ending our show was like now one

336
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,460
 Person gets a show off for you like it's really weird. It's like really weird to look back, so I was like oh

337
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,060
 Mike is gonna change Mike. We'll make Mike change

338
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:52,360
 I'll do the last game and they'll okay and to incorporate everyone else had everyone else called the different emotions

339
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,500
 I just went down the line to every performer, and they and they all change their

340
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,480
 emotions or whatever, but I was like

341
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,060
 We made such a weird show that was oddly popular, and it was not like

342
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,840
 It was not a wholesome

343
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,940
 Improv everyone gets along we're all looking out for each other kind of thing

344
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:14,120
 It was a very looking back on it. We were all like young hungry comedians

345
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:19,860
 It was very competitive it was very much like I I've earned my right to do a motion roller coaster

346
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,240
 Like those things came back into my head

347
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,720
 You know like it's not like a and not a formula that you can just go and recreate

348
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,200
 With a with a different group either it sounds like no I mean this is like I said

349
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,040
 I've had the I've had the a very blessed improv life, right?

350
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,400
 So I've gone off to many other places and seen short form along form shows everywhere

351
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:46,840
 And when I say things like oh, we would close with the motion roller coaster people go like what like that's a starter game

352
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:52,280
 That's like a one. That's that's a first three gamer and most people's repertoire. This is just a silly throwaway game

353
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,480
 But like and I said and I've said this when I came back to them

354
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:01,160
 I go you know every short form show basically becomes a review like it basically becomes a kind of a rehearsed deal

355
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:06,480
 Where you do things with a certain energy you you you you perform it a certain way

356
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:13,300
 And you basically also kind of maybe steal other people's bits and jokes to create like a greatest hits version of this game

357
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:19,800
 Which this is inevitable it's inevitable it happens every theater that was everywhere and no one wants us to admit it

358
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,440
 But basically but that's what right why why those shows basically when you come in you go

359
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,720
 Oh because I love trying to sit in with every group and try to get everyone's vibe

360
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:33,000
 And it was always very interesting to see like what elements of their shows were just like oh

361
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,680
 This is just a piece like even though this is an improv game. This is a set piece that I can't help

362
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,680
 I can't walk onto this I can't help this out

363
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,880
 I have to hands off this piece for this particular group

364
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,720
 They have a thing that they do on this one

365
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,400
 And it's part of what made me hate short form for a long time

366
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:53,060
 It's part of what made me resent it as not improv and and maybe like a long form zealot for a good

367
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:59,400
 You know 15 years after the fact, you know, like it was like I'm doing actual improv and you're doing a review, you know

368
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:06,680
 But as I get older and we learned Paul with our various endeavors in Las Vegas is sometimes putting together review is really fucking hard

369
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:16,660
 Sometimes it can be really not funny at all. Yeah, very easy. It's very easy to fuck up games. Yes

370
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:22,000
 I mean it they're gent. They're, you know generated to help you succeed

371
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:29,280
 But if you don't know the tricks and if you don't know how to intro the fucking thing, right look out

372
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,860
 Mike comes from snack theater. Thanks sectors. We're Jonathan Wayne Brady Nathan Fillion. All those guys came from

373
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:43,540
 A lot of friends that Paul and I have came out of there. And yes, they'll be quicker money like oh when you intro this game

374
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:49,640
 Don't forget this bit, you know, like so we did jeopardy. I forgot that we used human buzzers, right?

375
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:54,140
 So we bring humans up and then Mike literally goes. Oh, don't forget

376
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,120
 We have say before we start the game you put your buzzers down

377
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,560
 And then I go. Oh, I forgot. I totally forgot about that bit and then I said, oh, yeah

378
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:07,880
 All right before we start the game go ahead because just put your buzzers down and they all start insulting the people who came up

379
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,880
 to help them

380
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:16,640
 And it gets a huge laugh and I was like fucking bits man the fucking little show little zings

381
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,200
 It just keep keep things flowing keep the energy high and and it's it's another one of the things

382
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,900
 I've you know again, I love teaching level one because it always keeps me on my toes keeps me

383
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:34,880
 Remembering that it's basics basics basics always and that's just it like just reminding people that it's a show

384
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,560
 Reminding people that they can relax and we know what we're doing even though we don't that's it

385
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,720
 It's that we know we're doing like Jonathan. You're in good hands Jonathan

386
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,320
 Megan does a bit if you put Jonathan charge of writing something down you have to remember that he does this bit and

387
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,560
 And I've only done, you know, however shows with him

388
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,900
 but he he you start you start saying things for Jonathan to write down and

389
00:30:54,900 --> 00:31:00,240
 And then you wait and like the third one you go you get in all this Jonathan and he will go

390
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,700
 Oh, no, I'm just drawing a cat and they'll turn over the pad and show that he's just drawn a cat and written nothing down

391
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:11,040
 Yeah, and that and that bit if you nail it kills feels like if you do it wrong too too soon

392
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,480
 If you forget he was doing the bit, he'll finish it himself

393
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:18,240
 It goes okay, but you have to remember that Jonathan does the bit where if he picks up the bat, he's gonna draw a cat

394
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,000
 And those are the things that make it a review and not a pure show

395
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,240
 But it's the kind of thing that makes an art school like all these guys these guys have a back pop

396
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,240
 They got together. Yeah little stuff

397
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,080
 when we did our

398
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,080
 our show on

399
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,720
 Saturday the teacher show I just grabbed a few pieces like, you know, we're doing puppets

400
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,680
 I'm just you know, the old make sure no one touches the bikini zone

401
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:47,040
 that's just one little thing like that's a little throwaway line, but it just gets a laugh and gets everybody, you know going and

402
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,880
 at the top of

403
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:55,080
 We were doing to start and we did a little 20-minute lot or so long form, you know after an interview

404
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:00,240
 The interview was pretty heavy. And so at the end of the interview, I was like, okay

405
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,160
 So what we're about to do now is a little bit of a long form piece

406
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:07,400
 It's gonna be a little more theatrical more scenic things might come in might go away might come back

407
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,560
 You might see characters return in different times or whatever, but that's what's gonna be a little more theatrical a little more long form

408
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,040
 And it's all intended to be comedic which I've grabbed from you

409
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:22,000
 And then and it just ends it with them like and then they're been the audience laughs cuz they're like, you know

410
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,160
 But it's good to remind them that yeah, we're trying to be funny here, even though we just talked about some really deep shit

411
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:35,600
 Right is I've added to that before I go. I'll pause and go like I go like the whole time

412
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,680
 It's gonna be comedic like the whole time

413
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:50,240
 And I only added that bit because commies gotten dicier as it ever as we've gotten older, you know, that's it gotten different

414
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,080
 Well, we were interviewing this gal and just stuff just kept coming up, you know

415
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,280
 And and she's like, you know just some heavy stuff and and and she's like and I you know

416
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,280
 she's in this meeting and like stuff is getting very

417
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:06,100
 Politically charged and partisan for no good reason and it feels oh boy. And so I'm like and I'm like

418
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,560
 No, I really appreciate you

419
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:14,080
 Telling us that you know human rights are partisan now cuz I wasn't 100% but now I get it

420
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,520
 Okay, this is good. Cuz yeah, because that's what you know

421
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:22,960
 That's what she was dealing with was just these insane things that are happening because it is it's insane times. It's insane times

422
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:32,560
 Cuz like Nick right like his specialty was to bring in political stuff or do a little satire

423
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:38,360
 Uh-huh, and he was saying after the show that he felt weird that he couldn't play the way he normally played because no

424
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:43,320
 Satire is dead baby. Satire is dead. It's just it's just too much to throw in an audience

425
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:49,000
 How can you make fun of this shit? It makes fun of itself. I know it's beyond parody. Yeah

426
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,920
 So yeah. Yeah, I mean

427
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:56,160
 Yeah, just just just a fucking crazy I said, oh so

428
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,840
 One of the games we play is a game called space jump and the way space

429
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,820
 It's kind of a freeze tag ish game except that, you know

430
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:07,840
 One person starts off dancing you call freeze you come and you make a scene based on the way that person's frozen

431
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:14,340
 Two-person scene they keep doing something physical freeze something changes it third person comes in and you go

432
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:17,160
 What typically our show we have five or six people in the ship in the cast

433
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,980
 Six person would come in first and leave first

434
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:25,520
 So you do you do a six person scene and then they find a reason to leave and you go right back to that five person

435
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,520
 scene

436
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,000
 You would keep adding as they come in you tagged out you just nobody tagged out

437
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,160
 You just it just grew more and more it from the freeze. Okay, cool

438
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,760
 So pkpels like we're gonna do a 14-person space jump

439
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,100
 Oh, and I laugh really hard and he like he had like a moment daddy goes, right? I think oh, I'm sorry

440
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,300
 Yes, we're definitely absolutely

441
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:51,040
 I'm already laughing at it. It's great

442
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:57,440
 yeah, I know my hand like this might take a half hour like like this might take up the majority of our things or whatever and

443
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,960
 And it is intended to be comedic and instead everyone everyone may have like they're opening lines all of them

444
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,280
 And so the guys either call or call in response freeze

445
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:16,680
 big laugh on big laugh on the freeze and so it was like lightning fast all the way up to 14 and then it became this

446
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,600
 Hilarious game of trying to remember all of them on the way out. Oh, right

447
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:25,640
 I can that what we're doing. What are we doing? Yeah, everyone's gonna try to be like who's seen is it who's

448
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:34,980
 And it was just and it just paid off huge and it's easy for like 14 and 13 maybe even 12

449
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:39,720
 Yeah, you get down to like 11 10 and then you get like eight and nine. Yeah

450
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:45,920
 They're frozen there were hands up holding a casket and when I see the physicality change

451
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,920
 So they litters like six people staring at each other

452
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,200
 And then one guy finally goes up we drop the casket

453
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,480
 So

454
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:05,800
 Yeah, just so many moments my dad came out check it out. Oh wonderful. Nice. And I said man, it's been a while

455
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,200
 I've worked hard to get in this show. He goes. Oh, yeah, you were terrible when you started

456
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:16,800
 I was like not wrong not wrong

457
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,220
 He literally like betrayed like it was a vivid memory in his mind of me having stage fright the first time I was in the show

458
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,280
 Really? Yeah, and he was like you were like and he posed as me like frozen on the sidelines

459
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,960
 I was like, that's exactly what happened in my first show. I was absolutely

460
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,720
 totally

461
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,720
 stage-fritten

462
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:41,960
 Past tense, but yeah. Yeah, I was I was just

463
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:47,920
 Yeah, it was it was it was a really crazy crazy emotional experience to go for Wow

464
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,640
 You know, who else doesn't know how to say the word frightened. That's the following sponsor

465
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,880
 I like stage-fritten

466
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,400
 Is brought to you by

467
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,280
 Spanx for skanks. Yeah, sorry

468
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,720
 Magic Shell scoop in 2024. That's Spanx for skanks

469
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,520
 Hey, I'm crack hard

470
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,400
 Jessica and I love me some crack. I

471
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,920
 Also love to look fit and tight in my Louboutin's and my hot couture

472
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:29,780
 So after I smoke some crack I throw on some Spanx but not just any Spanx

473
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:37,200
 Spanx for skanks their number one customer is me crack or Jessica and my crack pipe

474
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:43,200
 These skank Spanx are built for skanks like me. They got a crack pipe holder

475
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:48,720
 They got a place where you could put your weed. They got a place where you can pee right in them when you're wearing them

476
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,320
 Nobody see that's right

477
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:57,880
 These things are made for skanks. You can skank these Spanx up like nobody's business and nobody will even know

478
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:06,000
 Meanwhile, I'm walking the red carpet high as fuck and don't nobody blink because I'm wearing skank Spanx

479
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,160
 Everybody thinks I got it all together. I don't the only thing that's holding me together

480
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,960
 He's tight-ass undergarments, but I'm pissing in them and don't nobody know

481
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,720
 So I say that's a win

482
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:26,760
 You take that skank home and you just open it like like like a mattress that was just delivered you slowly get those

483
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,760
 Spanx off

484
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:39,760
 They only last for 12 hours, that's the Spanx can't guarantee 12 hours

485
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,900
 But after that, it's like the fucking

486
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:46,960
 It'll pumpkin your ass real hard

487
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:53,120
 So watch it watch watch your time girls set your watches and shit cuz that stuff will explode

488
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,960
 Enter a scoops of checkout

489
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,920
 The worst part about that is her parents named her crack whore Jessica

490
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,320
 Determinism

491
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,440
 Yeah

492
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:20,160
 Yeah, so I just got back from the doctor got my neck ultrasound good times

493
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:26,880
 Oh boy. Yeah, you got the results of this neck ultrasound. The lady said things are running back

494
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,500
 So it'll be like a week or two and I said well heading out of town now. She's like, well, that's great

495
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:38,520
 So yeah, it'll be like probably two weeks. There's nothing with my neck. That means I can't fly because I'm gonna go fly exactly

496
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,960
 That's the one thing I kind of thought I was like well if I do have any kind of artery problems

497
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,200
 I guess the flights gonna just do a number of whatever who cares

498
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,500
 You're gonna figure it out. I can promise you at 50 feeling the way I do

499
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:55,240
 My blood is not flowing as perfectly as it should be I can say that definitively

500
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,560
 I think it's I don't think there's any major blockages or anything

501
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:04,440
 But but I could I could stick it stand to be better. I'm sure one of our friends came to the house last night

502
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:11,480
 And he had uh, what he said at first was that he nicked his lip shaving and then it was bleeding profusely

503
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,080
 Yeah, I thought that was odd. It turned out. It was the like the the beard clippers

504
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:21,200
 Okay, the clippers like got in there. Yeah, like took a little hunk out of his lip

505
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,520
 So there's like a deep deep deep dig there. Yeah

506
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:31,040
 But it was bleeding for a couple of hours. It was my gosh like

507
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:37,400
 Fusely for it because it was right on his lip. It was right on like the the not above where your mustache is

508
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,280
 But like down on the lip. Yeah. Yeah. So anytime he would

509
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,800
 Smile move his lip and move his mouth at all. You know, just open right back up. Oof

510
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,160
 Yeah, this is this is how we live now

511
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:55,480
 You can remind him that of course the

512
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:00,000
 The area of the mouth and eyes are the first to heal. So there you go

513
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,760
 Mm-hmm

514
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:08,960
 I'm laying down and she she gooed

515
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:15,360
 she put a towel under my neck and everything and then she she gooed me up with the jelly and then she did and then she

516
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:20,720
 Ultrasounded me and I got to hear my heartbeat for the first time on the monitor

517
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,480
 I really felt like I was my own baby. It was really interesting

518
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,120
 Boy

519
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:36,480
 We can hear a heartbeat we've got a heartbeat I could hear whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh, you know that that sound

520
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,440
 Through with the heartbeats. I was like, oh she had to do that eight different times and find it just right out and it

521
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,200
 Was like oh I can hear him. He's in there

522
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:51,080
 It was really interesting to hear my own blood

523
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:59,200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm like all that sweet baby boy he's bleeding inside. He's just a gushing and a swishing

524
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,480
 But from my untrained ear sounded pretty much the same on both sides

525
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:10,520
 So I don't think there was anything. All right. Did they tell you like what they're looking to diagnose? Yes

526
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,980
 They're looking because again because it was isolated to my left eye

527
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:20,960
 right because this is all from a few weeks ago when when they went to an eye exam and they had a

528
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,080
 Moment of they did they saw something they didn't like in your eye and it was

529
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,880
 Bleeding there is retinal hemorrhaging. Yes

530
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:33,960
 So they went and they you know, I went to the eye doc the expert and they checked it out

531
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,400
 I don't have anything going on with the right or I didn't at least

532
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:45,240
 And so but I still have had no vision impairment. No vision changes still ongoing and you still look great

533
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:51,220
 I mean, thank you. Thank you. But the concern was there are you know, the arteries that go back and forth there

534
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:58,280
 They the concern was because it was isolated to one eye that it could be some kind of blockage or some kind of impediment as

535
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,220
 To the going or coming of the blood in that area. So that's what they're flushing out and then and then

536
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,640
 She's like, I'm gonna you know

537
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,760
 Check both sides you got any questions or anything and I was like, well, I mean

538
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:15,680
 I just I know that the focus is on the left because it is only isolated to the left and and and that and that was

539
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:22,360
 Kind of the weird thing. She's like, well, they check both sides in order to kind of get a baseline of what is normal

540
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:25,920
 And then I went all right. Oh, yeah, of course. This is the every

541
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,400
 every day

542
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:35,060
 Medical exam of the the the Joe layman, right you get up. You're like, oh shit that really hurts over here

543
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:40,080
 What the hell and you feel it and then you feel the other side and you're like, oh, that's pretty much the same

544
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,080
 I'll be okay. Yeah, right. That's the

545
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:48,000
 Whole thing you do the symmetrical nature of our bodies. That's what we do. We go. Ooh my knee. What's it?

546
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,520
 Okay, how's this one? No, that's pretty much the same. All right, we can always do like a to be comparative shopping

547
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:59,440
 That's exactly right. Exactly. So that's why as far as I know my liver is fine

548
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,260
 That's one of the tricky ones it's the internal stuff that gets really tricky

549
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:07,800
 External stuff is a little bit easier to diagnose from the self

550
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:13,720
 Quote-unquote, but yeah, that was what but I thought that was he checks his left penis than his right penis. Yeah

551
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,900
 Yeah, well as a Klingon I do have to

552
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:25,320
 Yeah, yes, it is the Echidna but well now that's exactly with you know checking everything

553
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:31,400
 In fact, I think it is Santa Claus who was the very first to practice this

554
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:36,200
 Symmetrical diagnoses. Is that right? Yeah, he makes a list. He checks it twice

555
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:47,280
 Find out if it's an ass if it's an abscess or not. Yeah, Santa Claus is rectal exam

556
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:54,800
 Yeah, that's it. I'll give a shout out to a Sparta Avenue stage who hosted me for two shows

557
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,280
 Friday night before my improv reunion up in Sparta, New Jersey

558
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,320
 I

559
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:05,640
 Sold out the first show and then no one likes to stay out late in Sparta. No

560
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,800
 sidewalks roll up at eight, huh? Yeah

561
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,360
 But no, I didn't know about that out here first crowd

562
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:19,420
 They I think they gave me a standing ovation. All right. Wow, fantastic

563
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:25,160
 And they weren't just leaving. No, they weren't just standing up to leave. It was a legitimate standing ovation

564
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,160
 I didn't say wait guys turn around just do it this way

565
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:34,340
 You didn't you didn't say hey everybody. Let's give it up for children with cancer. Yeah, I blew garbage at them

566
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,720
 Cancer babies, huh?

567
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,720
 Stand up for cancer babies. Thank you. Good night. Oh

568
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:46,040
 Side side note. I was on the cruise ship with this couple

569
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,680
 there there there there there

570
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:55,480
 Big time magicians, but they're now more social media people than magicians, but they're violent and misty night

571
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,320
 Yes, and they also sure they work backstage

572
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:05,760
 With blame when blame comes to town. Oh, okay on Blaine's crew. So I told them that I

573
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:12,560
 Michael Blaine, I was a so you were in the theater Chris angel was there and then we start talking about story and I surprised

574
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,160
 The next day I gave him Chris angel as a question stickers

575
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:20,600
 So I give those out at my shows to any Penn Sunday school listen, they love it

576
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:25,960
 They they asked for an extra one for David. So I gave them. Oh, that's great. Good. Good. Did you give them a chip?

577
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:31,920
 I they are all chipped up. I don't we can obelisk David Blaine. Our life is complete

578
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:41,200
 How funny would it be to have David Blaine come do some crazy death defying shit at scoop fest some year at my show

579
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:47,880
 I say do you listen to podcasts or whatever and I'm jokingly I'm referring to my own and then people feel like I like this

580
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,000
 American life

581
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:56,200
 And then yeah, nobody says that but I have my chips and stickers ready for that when I kick ass my show

582
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,540
 So that's awesome. They do properly chip people. Oh, yeah, baby

583
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:03,920
 Obeliskin, baby. No, no, no, but you know what that and that's that's the best way to do it

584
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,280
 Well, that's good because that way if they get lost and somebody else takes them to the vet

585
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,800
 They'll be able to know that they're yours. Well, but you're also your Matt Donnelly's audience. You're on the road

586
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,800
 You've only got so much

587
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,040
 So much capacity

588
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:24,520
 All your chips at your disposal, so no, I can't literally I'm down to three three pounds of leeway

589
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:34,480
 Got a good life for it and they are often exactly like 49 and like 47 pounds. Oh, yeah between the two of them

590
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,080
 something goes up to 50 on me and I get man, but

591
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,360
 Yeah, I've definitely multiple times been that guy at the airport

592
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:47,160
 He's opening both cases and shoving one jacket from one case into the other. Yeah. Yeah all that stuff. So yeah

593
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,160
 No, do you?

594
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:54,640
 Do you feel a sense of betrayal or maybe this hadn't happened to you at the airport very often?

595
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:02,980
 It's happened to me once or twice where the scale at the airport is obviously calibrated differently than the scale at my house. Yes

596
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:08,800
 I'm not saying one of them is wrong and one of them is right because I don't know but they are different and that is

597
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,600
 The most maddening thing that can happen on those travel days

598
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:15,920
 No, it is and like it's not that it happens like I don't have a scale at home

599
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,480
 I really do just lift it up with my arms and go like this feels about the time where it feels right and I'm actually

600
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:24,560
 Pretty good, right? I don't want to brag but I will lift any of you up and tell you how much you weigh

601
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:31,880
 But tell you if you're over or under 50 pounds. Carnival Parker blood. That's it. Just over under 50. That's it. That's the only task

602
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:37,080
 You're good. You can get that you can get down there. You'll be fine. Oh, you're at least 53

603
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:41,440
 So when I pack the same exact stuff and it also is like 51 pounds at the airport when I'm going out

604
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:47,920
 I'm like, no, I packed this exact same case on the way in and it was 49. You jerk. Yeah

605
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,440
 Yeah

606
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,440
 Okay, that's close enough

607
00:48:54,440 --> 00:49:00,200
 Do my original foolish

608
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:05,240
 Foolish trick but for real just to get a calculator start guessing people's weights

609
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:09,040
 And then when they say this this thing is 53 pounds

610
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:14,520
 I rip open my shirt at 53 pounds on a piece of duct tape on my chest and then I rip it off and hand it to them

611
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:19,240
 Yeah, so wait, what's your question Jacob I

612
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:27,880
 Don't remember great moving on Jacob. Yeah. Yeah curiosity for you. Actually hit me a guy I came out

613
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,120
 I was unloading groceries

614
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:34,800
 I left my trunk open and then I got caught in the backyard talking to my family and then okay a guy knocked on the door

615
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,760
 And and I went I came up I was like, I bet my truck is open still and they open he goes

616
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:43,000
 Hey, why don't you know your trunk is open? I said, oh, thanks. He goes he'd help with your groceries

617
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,480
 No stranger. I do not

618
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,000
 And they goes hey

619
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,680
 We're walking around the neighborhood and we noticed your windows and you beautiful home and we wanted to sell you discount

620
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:59,800
 Discount windows if you're willing to put our sign in your front yard that I was you're willing to do this and I go wait I

621
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,440
 Turn this down all the time. It's probably the fourth time

622
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:09,160
 I've turned the guy down with this effort that my house is a model house, but you did this deal right Jacob. We did

623
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,960
 Yeah, did it work out?

624
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,760
 Was everything good? Yes. Okay. Oh, oh, yes. I was everything. Everything was great

625
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,320
 We saved a lot of money and they took some pictures of the house. It feels scammy

626
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,800
 Yeah, right and I was trying to figure it out because I was like wait

627
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:30,560
 I think Jacob did this and we never got like a bad report after the fact because I think I would have remembered if it

628
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:35,680
 Went south or something, right? No, everything went great. The the bad the bad thing that happened after it was

629
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:40,820
 Right out because it's still you know still cost us a pretty penny to do all of it

630
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:47,880
 But it saved us ended up saving us like three grand maybe maybe thirty five hundred bucks something like that, right? So not nothing, you know

631
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:58,760
 Yes, the the downturn that happened at the end of that story was right after we did that like a few weeks after we did

632
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:05,360
 That kovat shut everything down and most of our income stopped coming in immediately after spending a lot of money on windows

633
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:11,320
 I'm fine not swapping them out. That was us with fake grass

634
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,480
 We like Paul to be like, can you not install the fake grass?

635
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:17,960
 Like you already cut it so you'd save just the installation fee. It is done

636
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:21,740
 I was like when you just have like a mountain of sand on your side of your house

637
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:25,840
 Oh man, I guess go ahead

638
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:33,480
 But so I'm trying to think of what I think I think it might simply be the the con of it is

639
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:40,140
 Simply that Anderson windows are the standard Anderson windows are expensive and if you offer cheap windows

640
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:48,200
 That aren't Anderson and people think they're gonna get shitty windows. And so the discount element just and by complementing your house

641
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:54,520
 You feel flattered and then the idea that you have to hold an advertising thing to save money is like it's like the same

642
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:58,720
 It's like as Paul would say taking the bottle of water for the meeting, right? You don't take the water. They offer you water

643
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,300
 You know, it's like you're creating a currency exchange

644
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:09,560
 Yes, so like I guess like it's simply about like if you want to compete with Anderson and you can buy price

645
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:14,720
 competing by price doesn't work unless you do this bit is the best I can come up with I

646
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:21,120
 Don't yeah, cuz ours were ours weren't Anderson, but they were another big brand. I forget what what it was

647
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:24,860
 But they're they're like two or three brands in in town

648
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:27,680
 No, it's like one of the big ones

649
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:34,440
 That's it that's it they they sell windows and anvils never break

650
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,280
 That's it

651
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,560
 But yeah, so it was like another big brand and so he felt okay with it

652
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:44,640
 He offered me six to seven percent off and then we just laughed at him until he left our yard. He didn't know what

653
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,080
 new windows new windows

654
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:56,760
 I'll say you also go get some new windows and they're gonna pay full price. That's the following spots

655
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,600
 Oh my today's show is brought to you by

656
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,680
 a

657
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:09,740
 Greek yogurt. Yep. That's it Greek yogurt from scoop of Henley in 2022. This show is also brought to you by Greek yogurt

658
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:23,800
 There's a bowl

659
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,240
 And her hey scoops to check out I

660
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:35,860
 Didn't just shit it I

661
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:42,960
 Put it in a bowl

662
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,600
 It makes a lot of good points not only it makes a good point good point

663
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:54,900
 Jesus in the chat is pointing out that it's it's

664
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:59,800
 interesting that they did take some money off of our windows to

665
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:04,140
 Pay for advertising and now I can't tell you the brand name of the windows

666
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:12,380
 Also why we thought it was a con is that your yard gets no

667
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:20,440
 Visible there's no foot traffic. There's no traffic traffic that goes by your house. You live very you live very lonely

668
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:26,400
 The the sign thing wasn't the big deal for for ours. No the big deal for ours was the pictures

669
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,960
 Yeah, yeah pictures on the website. Yeah, yeah, that makes more sense because we have because we have a weird-looking house

670
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:36,880
 That was that I think that was also why they liked our house was because it's different looking for a Vegas house

671
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,760
 Yeah, it looks like a little cocaine compound. That's a cartel

672
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:48,840
 That's precisely what it looks like. That's what everyone everyone comes to the the barbecue thinks that someone might just break out a machine gun to

673
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:52,940
 Mow everybody down. Yeah, it's a fair concern. It's a fair concern

674
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:55,720
 you've almost got like a

675
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,480
 conversation den

676
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,480
 conversation pit designed for the

677
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,640
 Living room. Oh, yeah

678
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:11,760
 I'm so I am doing the second show at the Sparta Avenue stage of its part of Jersey one of the theater community

679
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,120
 run by awesome people

680
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:18,940
 And also this is the late-night one sparsely attended

681
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,200
 Yes

682
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,200
 The sparsely attended one and is they boost that is by reaching out to their friends

683
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,760
 Of course is the local magic community surrounding that so my

684
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:32,120
 Magician to regular human ratio in my second shows a little off sure

685
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:36,860
 And this is the things like magicians just don't you know as much as they want even the most respectful magician

686
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:40,560
 It's just hard to be a regular audience member when you're doing magic, right?

687
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:45,200
 So people who just don't want to do certain they give me look like you don't want to use me for this kind of

688
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,340
 Kind of thing when I'm trying to get people from the audience. I use a lot of volunteers on my show. Yeah

689
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:53,880
 This one guy was kind of like I busted his balls a little bit and he was a very chatty person

690
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,680
 and then

691
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:02,520
 So for when I have a small amount of crowds, I don't get new people, you know for for straight-ish Jack

692
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:06,880
 He's the same folks over and over I just go to the two guys that have stood out the most right?

693
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,320
 Okay, like yeah, it's basically like I can't I can't constantly get two other guys kind of thing

694
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:15,140
 And so I just call by name they get up quickly to get on the show faster

695
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,680
 and so

696
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:22,240
 I bring a guy up who I've been messing with a little bit throughout the show and he'd been messing me back a little bit

697
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:26,880
 But I go to raise the curtain and he covers my face and this is a bit that comes up

698
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,800
 Oftentimes with drunk dudes on cruise ships, right?

699
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:34,300
 I'm trying to do my finale and I do the joke where they raise the curtain too high to get them to lower it

700
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:40,140
 I talk over it and then some people think it's funny just to keep covering my face and I let that laugh happen

701
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:44,580
 And then I try to move on with the trick and then they keep doing it and then I point out to them

702
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:50,560
 Hey, this bit's getting diminishing returns. Does he have people laughed at it now? They're not just just letting you know

703
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,920
 You're not doing the bit. Let me go. It was a fine bit

704
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:59,340
 It was fine bit a second ago and this guy won't stop doing the bit won't stop trying to say funny things won't stop

705
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:03,680
 Trying to upstage me through the entire thing. It basically kicks the all of my jokes right in the dick

706
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,320
 Yeah, I can't

707
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:13,400
 Can't get it. So it ends fine. The show ends fine. I still short. I still get out. It's still surprising produced beers blah blah blah

708
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,240
 and the show's over and

709
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,640
 then

710
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:23,880
 he comes right up to me after the show some signing posters right there and hitting on ships possibly and

711
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:30,840
 After this motherfucker, right and he goes he goes. Hey just want to say I've really enjoyed your show

712
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:34,460
 I've been a professional magician for the last 34 years. The fuck you have no

713
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:40,220
 Fuck you have you've been a professional cocksucker. You've been a professional piece of shit

714
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:44,520
 My head just goes that just can't be true. No

715
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:49,480
 No can't be the information you're asking you're asking when his last paid gig was

716
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:54,200
 People paid you to perform magic

717
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,560
 The other magicians who helped me exactly

718
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:02,760
 Pack up or like that was really weird. He was that was weird of him to do what he did to you

719
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,800
 Yeah, I agree

720
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:12,580
 Especially if he's coming to be a magician what a fucking asshole and then on top of that because you know

721
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:18,840
 The way the guy introduced me it felt weird just go right into like whatever and so I started talking about how I became a

722
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:22,200
 Magician to the second crowd. I was trying to know what's it up front

723
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,640
 So I was trying to like endear them and to be like, hey sure we're hanging out

724
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:29,500
 So I just told my story learning how to pen dare me learn magic and all that other stuff

725
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,500
 And then I went into my show

726
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:34,360
 I'll do that if I feel like an audience is like super cagey

727
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:40,460
 I'll just tell my actual story becoming a magician to be like we're we're we're cool try to change the temperature in the room

728
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:46,600
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I guess that compelled him to like then he wanted to tell me his entire life story as well

729
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,760
 Oh

730
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,760
 This is great. And then I'm trying to get chips and stickers to two people

731
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,920
 I recognize from coming to my show multiple times. Oh, yeah

732
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,020
 And he almost seems like annoyed where like he gets through a part of his thing

733
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:00,600
 I was like, oh cool

734
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:04,600
 And I went like I just let me just get this thing real quick and he seemed like annoyed that I wasn't like hearing him

735
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:07,040
 Tell me no, you can't

736
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:13,520
 I'm fine with coming up to you and telling you a story. I'm fine with saying I'm a magician as well

737
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:20,760
 I'm fine with all this you don't get to be annoyed when the group of people that you're doing the thing with is still a group

738
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:25,040
 Of people exactly exactly nothing has changed here

739
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:31,000
 Jeff lumis and Chad says that he has to be your apprentice Jeff in a way. He was asking me to become his apprentice

740
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:38,520
 Basically was saying like and what did you say? I heard your story and just like you know, I'm way more experienced than you

741
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:47,280
 You'll probably notice how well I handled you on stage that's just a little taste of what I can do

742
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:52,960
 Yeah, I know you saw me fucking destroying on there during your fit taking your bit

743
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,480
 Yes, I saw that you destroy my show

744
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:05,240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was I it was that was the that was the strangest part of it for sure

745
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:09,960
 Yeah, did you see chaotic clumsy's line? That's what is that in the future?

746
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:13,280
 Tell me it's bigger tits to be that irritating

747
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:24,800
 I am gonna steal that. Yes. Yeah, it's pretty fucking good. Pretty fucking pretty big though. Is there pretty big?

748
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:29,000
 So you say he was justified yeah

749
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:37,640
 Yeah, that was that was really really really strange, I'm sorry you had to go through that shit no no no

750
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:44,880
 I mean I overall had a fantastic night. It was so bright and it was yeah, you know, even even though the audience was a little

751
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:49,820
 Different, you know for the second show obviously if you do a show that's sold out and you're saying ovation

752
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:53,800
 The second show is not gonna check all the same boxes. Exactly. Oh, yeah

753
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:58,800
 Yeah, but you've got that one in your pocket rather than coming off a bad show trying to get the energy back up again

754
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,940
 And it basically like I'm recording both shows

755
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:08,040
 So it's usually it's I'm finding that the moments that I find most awkward for my shows are making the best reels on my social media

756
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:14,800
 So I was like, well, this is taped and I'm sure there's more bits to come out of it this way

757
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:21,200
 I bet I bet the clip of him upstaging me with the bid is gonna make a fine clip for the social media

758
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:27,680
 But it was uh, yeah, so I just wanted a second show just like great another show. Let's just do it

759
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,240
 But it's super fun super fun

760
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:38,840
 Yeah, that was just the only thing would you say that you're I don't know roughly eight months away from your family have been worth it

761
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:43,800
 It feels like it it feels like eight months anything more than two is just yeah

762
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:48,400
 Everything feels a little weird at home. When SJ said last night she was she was like, oh, yeah

763
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:53,600
 I texted Matt and Sarah about coming over I hadn't heard from him yet and that I was like, oh Matt has

764
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:58,200
 You I don't know if you know this Matt has been gone since scoop fest

765
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:02,520
 Yeah, and also choosing what the scoop us doesn't count as me really being a home either, right?

766
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:05,200
 Right, you know, like I don't really see anybody

767
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:11,600
 In the fam, so it was really in there being a really weird thing. So yeah extra week is shit. Yeah

768
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:14,220
 Yeah, yeah, kids are all grown up. They

769
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:17,780
 There was like there was like a crisis

770
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:23,560
 Like my kids soccer team while I was gone that I wasn't there for that was annoying. Oh

771
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:27,040
 Like

772
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:29,400
 My youngest kids soccer team

773
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:34,000
 They don't like they they always keep a certain core group players that always get new players every year

774
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:41,320
 Okay, and my kid soccer coach is not like, you know, basically as teams get you know

775
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:45,840
 Move on and say together or whatever some coaches basically recruit, you know

776
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:51,000
 Basically, oh sure kids hop over to the other team and yeah, my kids coach does not do that

777
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,400
 He just takes takes the random

778
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:58,520
 Allotment like yeah, I believe that's actually fair to the league, right?

779
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:02,120
 And probably the the healthier way to go about it as well

780
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:09,680
 Right. So but what ends up happening is that we end up getting kids who aren't quite in demand for any other team, right?

781
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,720
 And they're not in demand not because they may be bad

782
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:18,120
 But that sometimes they're not in demand because they don't like trilla. They just don't they don't sure they're not reliable

783
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,120
 don't make they're not reliable and

784
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:22,160
 so

785
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:30,560
 Basically my whole season my youngest has been playing with like either one man down or just enough to play the whole game with no subs

786
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:34,000
 Tire season that's hard

787
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:42,880
 Babies had a forfeit a game while I was gone and so it's been a bummer to not be there

788
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:46,280
 For if you had been there for that one

789
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:50,520
 Would they have let you suit up and and head out on the field to be the last player that they needed?

790
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:53,280
 I mean, I have my cleats, you know, I have my shin guards

791
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:57,880
 And I have a forged birth certificate saying that I am ten years old

792
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:03,240
 Well, they just march it on out

793
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,520
 I don't know if that kids tenure we need to see a birth certificate. You know what?

794
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:12,600
 Let him play. Don't worry. Do not worry about it

795
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:16,120
 Your kid can't outrun that guy

796
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:21,500
 You'll be surprised to know Matt that currently what you just talked about cleats

797
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:28,400
 Shin guards and a forged birth certificate stating your ten years old are also required to work in a bodega now in America

798
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,360
 Not gonna work for you

799
01:04:35,360 --> 01:05:00,600
 We got an obelisk coming to us today from the upside down under scoop

800
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:06,560
 This is the one where you have the the pyramid of all the different prices the questions start at two hundred dollars

801
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:11,480
 They go all the way up to five thousand dollars. We have double downs. We have steals

802
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:16,000
 We have super steals where we also steal the other person's money and it's a 50/50 thing

803
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,200
 If you miss a question you lose control of the board and that's how the game works

804
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:28,560
 The $200 questions coming to me first and the question is about famous dick famous dick. I'm not gonna double down

805
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:31,860
 I'm betting nobody's gonna steal. So, let's see what the question is

806
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:35,200
 Ron Jeremy was also known as

807
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:42,240
 Be the hedgehog see the horse or D the whale

808
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:46,060
 D the whale is a great porn name

809
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:49,160
 My name is D the whale D the way

810
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:57,140
 I would say the hedgehog. He was the hedgehog. Absolutely. Yeah

811
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,700
 He's been just he's just bad bad bad. Is he in jail? Now? Did he die? I

812
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:05,780
 Believe he's in jail. I don't think he's dead

813
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:10,480
 Okay. Oh, yeah, he's he's been bad. He got bad. I

814
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:15,120
 Got worse just he was bad from the jump. He got worse time went on sure and

815
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:20,280
 Man, his his version of Miley Cyrus is wrecking ball is still fantastic though

816
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:26,240
 I don't know hurt it separating art from artists there. No, that's right. No problem because wrecking ball is just beautiful

817
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:31,000
 We can do that. Yeah, I'd see famous tits famous tits. Anybody want to steal?

818
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:36,720
 I mean the category feel great about but it's too early in the game to steal. This is one that you know a lot about

819
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,720
 I'm glad it's a low dollar question

820
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:44,840
 This set of famous tits are held in place allegedly by a 40 double D bra

821
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:49,920

 It's back to me outside it. Well, yeah comes back to you Paul stole it and got it wrong. So it just comes right on back

874
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,120
 Oh

875
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:28,120
 With harvest not far away for us down under hours a day on average

876
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:36,040
 Do I sit in the tractor doing my thing? Well 24 12 10 or 15 doing my thing is definitely masturbating

877
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:42,100
 Right, and then these numbers must be minutes or second or a refractory period afterwards

878
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:51,360
 Let's see here I have no idea so let's go 50/50 on this one. All right

879
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:57,420
 That got rid of 12 and 10. So you got a 24 or D 15

880
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:02,200
 Well, he's not 24 hours

881
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:10,420
 Average 24 hours a day. It's harvest time to start messing for a few months

882
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:25,800
 Try 15 D 15 and the 50/50 answer has never worked better

883
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:29,280
 Here gathering my molars at harvest time

884
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:39,480
 Holy shit $1,600 question Matt has 3,200. I have 600 and Paul has zero

885

886
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:49,800

887
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,800
 I'll try a regular old steel. All right

888
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:57,800
 Protects my points it does this church doesn't officially have cult status

889
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:04,000
 But it is the starting point for a few cult leaders like David Koresh and George spate

890
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:10,000
 Scientology Catholic Church Seventh-day Adventist Church or Church of Latter-day Saints

891
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:18,560
 I mean, I feel like we could just say the Catholic Church is the root of all of it

892
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:27,200
 But I believe this is seven. Yeah. Yeah. I mean the Catholic Church doesn't have cool compounds. That's true. That's true

893
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,800
 They have one is I mean the Vatican they have one cool compound

894
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,080

895
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,880
 Yeah, allegedly

896
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:43,880
 We all just stopped and thought about the different jokes we could make and we all decided to just move on that's

897
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:47,080
 Like no, no, no

898
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:50,760
 I thought of at least four and I did and I'm passed on all of them

899
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:55,780
 But here's my offer once again or many running people the Catholic Church fucks a lot of kids that I don't know

900
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:59,640
 Why that's not if not a bigger deal for again sticking on this earth

901
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:04,560
 it is one of those things that I will I will put my stake in the ground on that and I will speak about it because

902
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:10,720
 It is infuriating to me and it has affected my life directly in a lot of negative ways. Fuck the Catholic Church forever. Yeah

903
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:16,160
 Famous farms famous farms. Anybody want to do anything stealing?

904
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:19,480

905

 This Australian station just a big farm shares a surname name with a famous Aussie movie star

907
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:37,880
 Is it crow station Jackman station Robbie station or Kidman station on that tractor? I'm doing Jackman station. Yeah

920
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:48,900

926
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:28,120
 From Paul's mistake logic dictates tits Creek, but boy does titty bong sound Australian is anything I've ever heard my really does man

927
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:33,280
 That's what I was going for is titty bong boobs head and boobs head also feels Australian to me

928
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,960
 Yeah, but titty bong like isn't bill a bong a

929
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,080

 Yes, so titty bong

931
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:45,840
 Also that that could be mistaken for the universal greeting of the junkie ons

932
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:53,080
 Bah we've grown our weep nitty bong. I was gonna say that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's the universal greeting

933
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:57,920
 Yeah, I've done other things. Yeah, I'm just stalling for something to type the right answer in the chat

934
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:07,040
 I'll go I know it's gonna be wrong, but I can't help it. I have to have to put all of my

935
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:13,480
 Might behind titty bong. I just wanted to do that all the eggs going into the titty bong basket. Yeah

936
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:16,080
 I would have got that right

937
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,600

938
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,640

940
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:36,160

941
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:42,320
 Oh a Don Poseidon be Taco Bell Hospital see Bonnie's ball hospice

 Those are all

944
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,360
 Polarizing episode my guess would be A or C

945
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:56,720
 Let's see either Don Poseidon or Bonnie's ball hospice

946
01:17:56,720 --> 01:18:03,640
 But I mean Taco Bell Hospital is that's the that's the gnarly one that has all of the it's got a lot of gross

947
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:08,400

948
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:11,120
