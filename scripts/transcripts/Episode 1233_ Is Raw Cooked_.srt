00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,500
 Well hello there, I am so happy that you're here because I'm going to thank the ice cream truck drivers.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:17,500
 Thank you so much ice cream truck drivers. I don't have a new list yet, it's a new month, but we're going to thank each and every one of you this month by name.

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,500
 So right now I'd like to thank every single person out there who is an ice cream truck driver.

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:29,000
 What is an ice cream truck driver? I'm glad you asked. These are the folks that deliver that fucking ice cream straight to your fucking ear holes.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 If you want to be an ice cream truck driver, and I hope you do, head over to preachingfun.com.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 The lice you crave can be extracted with a comb.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social?

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Yeah, I'd love to.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Great, let's go.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 C-O-M-B coo?

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 No, C-O-M-B coo.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Yeah.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Are you voting there, Paul?

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Just like my mom used to say.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 That comedian has a bit about language, but I can't remember it.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Gallagher, bitchin'.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 It's time for Matt Mattingly's ice cream social. Sitting somewhere, that's Matt Donnelly. Sitting in Pittsburgh, that's Paul Mattingly.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Check out the audio guy, I'm sitting in Las Vegas.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 We're preachingfun.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 That's the one that goes into the bomb, right? Boom and bomb.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like a little flip card thing.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Boom.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Yeah.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Man, I know he became a crazy, crazy twit, but I loved me some Gallagher when I was younger, man.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Oh, I loved Gallagher.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Yeah.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Back in the video store days, that was it. You wanted to watch a comedian, you ran into Gallagher movies.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 I got really lucky later on running comedy clubs in Las Vegas. I got to work several, like a two or three weeks, all total, with Gallagher as one of the headlining comedians.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 And man, the conversations in the green room when Gallagher is on are really pretty great.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 When he's not there to hear what people are saying about him?

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 No, no, no. When he's in there. I'm saying when he's in the green room, when he's back there like holding court and having the conversations, the crazy, like the batshit crazy shit that gets talked about is spectacular.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 He really lost it towards the end there, and he developed a rep in Vegas for being a kind of like crazy ass lunatic.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 He was trying to like come up with his own version of like a slot machine or whatever, and he was going to pitch a version of gambling, and he was a really, really angry, bitter guy.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 But just stand up, man.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 And also like, while he was angry and bitter, also stayed super interesting.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Like he was angry and bitter, but he had his shit together.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 He was a compelling person, yeah, yeah.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 And like, as we all know, just from I think watching three minutes of any version of Gallagher stand up, he sees the world differently than most people.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Yeah, yeah.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 And hearing from those people is always just fascinating.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 And of course, yeah, we think we've done this a bunch of times, but he taught his brother his act, then he tried to stop his brother from doing his act, his brother said, no, I'm going to keep doing it.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 He sued his brother.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Gallagher's manager took the brother's side and left Gallagher.

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Yes.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 That's really the most insulting part.

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And the brother got the right to perform as Gallagher too.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 I think there's nothing worse than thinking like, I could franchise this, finding out you're right, and then you want to be like, no, wait, don't do it, right?

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Hold on.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 No.

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Yeah, when that genie's out of the bottle, forget it.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 If anything, you just should have doubled down and gotten more apprentices, right?

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Yeah.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Right.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 He should have gotten Gallagher three, Gallagher four.

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Yeah, yeah.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Release Gallagher four.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Fire!

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 That.

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Also, none of the others should have looked anything like him.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Gallaguy.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 They never should have acknowledged it.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Well, they could all have just all you got to do is put on one of them duffer hats with a long wig.

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Done.

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 That's right.

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Matt's halfway there.

68
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 I'll do it.

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 I keep switching careers.

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 I should start doing Gallagher's routines.

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Just add a wig to one of your hats, Matt.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 I will.

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 I will.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 I will.

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 I've always said that when I cut my hair off at some day, that I'll just all attach it to the hat and just keep it around every now and then.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 And I've sincerely thought about that, and it just seems like so much work to add it to my hat.

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Yeah, if you're not having it done professionally.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 That just seems like a lot of genuine work.

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Also.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Sewing pieces of hair onto a hat.

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 You're going to select one hat that you're going to be stuck with for life.

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 You've got to sew it into a Velcro type mechanism so that it can be attached to multiple hats.

83
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 You don't make a bad point there.

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 It's a fairly good point.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 My vision has always been that I would just walk out with the hat on and then take the hat off, and it would just be the, "Oh, Jacob doesn't have any hair."

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 That's kind of fun.

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Of course, when I picture it, I picture myself being like egghead, completely bald as well.

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 I can tell you, Paul, I'm completely impressed by the Velcro thing.

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 I was thinking of just honing up for hair for each hat that you had.

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 Oh, my God.

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Are you crazy?

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 I know.

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Who has the money for that?

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Actual human hair?

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Rockefeller Donnelly over here.

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 You just saved imaginary Jacob, bald Jacob, hundreds and hundreds of dollars.

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Yes, at least.

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Yeah.

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Oh, that's right.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Jeff Loomis makes a good point in the chat.

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Tapeface tried to do the franchising thing, and it really did not work well for Tapeface at all.

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 But he didn't do it.

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 He was being very surreptitious about it.

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 But so was Gallagher.

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 I think that Tapeface did exactly what Gallagher did.

106
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 I think he just didn't get away with it, and he did it in a different time.

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Yeah, a time without social media where you can't just go, "Hey, that's not the real Gallagher."

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Yeah.

109
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 I don't know.

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 Tapeface, we actually would probably get Tapeface to come on.

111
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 I probably could, yeah.

112
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 The problem is when he started more, I think it was like Fringe Festival stuff,

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 he started more theatrically as the boy with tape on his face.

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Yes.

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 He considered it more of like a show than, I think the problem was that he did "America's Got Talent"

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 and then became a singular character in that moment and changed it from the boy with tape on his face to Tapeface,

117
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 and then still, in his mind, saw it theatrically.

118
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 And so he could have an understudy or whatever.

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Yeah, it seemed like, from what I heard, it seemed like he thought he was looking at it

120
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 as though he were putting an understudy into a show, not that he was doing anything nefarious.

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Right.

122
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 I mean, I'm all for it.

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 I would love to have that kind of problem.

124
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 We'll have him on and we'll talk about it.

125
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 I would love to have that kind of problem.

126
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Yeah, yeah.

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 It's going to be awkward next week when Jacob comes on and you guys don't recognize him.

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Not me, me.

129
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Paul, could you imagine trying to sell people right now?

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 You're like, don't worry.

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 I handpicked this person to train them to be funny like me.

132
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 To just have a substitute me?

133
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Hand chosen.

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 I mean, there's more than a handful of podcasters who could probably do it.

136
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 No, but this is exactly what we're talking about.

137
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Like, it's not, this is an A to A analogy.

138
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Right.

139
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Sure.

140
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 But they're just simply not personally invested in someone else who's capable.

141
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Agreed.

142
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Yeah, it is a weird thing.

143
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 It is a weird time for all of life on earth and the parasocial relationships, which are

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 the only things keeping us going day to day.

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Let's see.

146
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 So if we wanted to build a new Paul, obviously, you know, it would have to involve small,

147
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 small barky dogs.

148
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Mostly peanut butter.

149
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Mostly peanut butter.

150
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Raisins to taste.

151
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 That's your base.

152
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Raisins to taste.

153
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Raisins to taste.

154
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Always.

155
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 The Ludmilla sunrise.

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Yup.

157
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Black t-shirts.

158
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 MLK says having tape vision of the podcast like ventriloquism on the radio, right?

159
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Grow up, MLK.

160
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Grow up.

161
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Ventriloquism.

162
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 And yes.

163
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Those were the days, right?

164
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 To be a radio ventriloquist?

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Oh my God.

166
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 What a dream.

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 What a dream that would have been.

168
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Oh.

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Hey, Bert.

170
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 How you doing today?

171
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Oh, I'd be great if your hand wasn't up my ass.

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Oh, Bert, you crazy so-and-so.

173
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 But you don't even have to do that.

174
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 You're the crazy one.

175
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 He doesn't even see that.

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Like you don't even have to do that.

177
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 I can't believe you have the audio right there to play that authentic clip from the old

178
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 days.

179
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 I can't believe you just played that.

180
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 I know.

181
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Gold.

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Yeah.

183
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Mortimer's nerd was a real perv.

184
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 What are you gonna do?

185
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 ML Kennedy, thank you in the chat, says that my mouth was not moving.

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 If anybody listening asks, that was legitimate just, what do you call it, throwing my voice.

187
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Yeah.

188
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Yeah.

189
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 That's right.

190
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 That's right.

191
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 MarbleTulipScoopy says he could learn to love Paul number two.

192
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 I watched the special the other day.

193
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 There's a special somewhere.

194
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 I forget where, but it's on the Astroworld festival, the Travis Scott Astroworld festival

195
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 that he did several times.

196
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Where lots of people got hurt.

197
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Lots of people got hurt.

198
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 The crowd rushed stage.

199
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 There were multiple people that were kind of in charge of the safety of the festivals

200
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 and nobody, a lot of people didn't do their jobs.

201
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Were there some deaths?

202
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 I believe there were some deaths, like crushing deaths and that kind of thing.

203
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 At one point, according to the special, there were four active CPRs going on.

204
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Four people were actively receiving chest compressions and everything.

205
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 Whoa.

206
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 And that did not stop the show.

207
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Oh, CountryScoop, thank you in the chat, says that 10 people ended up dying in there.

208
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Goodness.

209
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 This is from when?

210
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Travis Scott's thing.

211
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 This was several years ago.

212
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Yeah, he used to do the festival every year at Astroworld to give back to Houston, where

213
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 he's from.

214
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 And I was watching this thing and I'm watching, a lot of it was lack of communication.

215
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 A lot of it was not telling Travis Scott on stage that things were going on.

216
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Arguably, he was told and I don't know.

217
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 There were a lot of things going on.

218
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 There were large parts though of this documentary where I was watching horrible things happen

219
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 with all these thousands of people there in Astroworld and running around like crazy people.

220
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 And I was just looking at this going like, "Holy shit, this could happen to us.

221
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Holy shit."

222
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 We could just accidentally make something huge like this and then it just totally gets

223
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 out of control.

224
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 And all of us look at it at the end going like, "I'm so sorry."

225
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Again, these are the problems you want.

226
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Paul and I are big enough that just the two of us falling over could crush 10 to 12 people.

227
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Sure.

228
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Yeah, it's true.

229
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 It's true.

230
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 All right.

231
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Scoopfest stampede.

232
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 No.

233
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 We shouldn't cross off the trampling.

234
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 No.

235
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 The trampling.

236
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Jake, are you having second thoughts about putting this steel cage around every side

237
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 of the stage this year for Scoopfest?

238
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Oh, if anything, I'm more on board with it.

239
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 It's going to really...

240
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 It's going to be the chicken wire from Blues Brothers.

241
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Oh my god.

242
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 It's going to be the Chicken wire from Blues Brothers.

243
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 It's going to be the Chicken wire from Blues Brothers.

244
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 It's going to be the Chicken wire from Blues Brothers.

245
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 It's going to be the Chicken wire from Blues Brothers.

246
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 It's going to be the Chicken wire from Blues Brothers.

247
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 It's going to be the Chicken wire from Blues Brothers.

248
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:16,600
 It's going to be the Chicken wire from Blues Brothers.

249
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
 Oh my god.

250
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
 That is the best.

251
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,600
 That scene.

252
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
 Good lord.

253
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
 That makes me laugh so much.

254
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
 They just keep throwing beer.

255
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
 Just throwing beer bottles.

256
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
 Smash.

257
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
 God damn.

258
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,600
 So funny.

259
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,600
 And it's great too.

260
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,840
 I'm going to ruin this scene for people who watch Blues Brothers right now.

261
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,800
 But if you watch it, you can just watch all of the sugar glass bottles explode as soon

262
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
 as they hit.

263
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,120
 Like the thin little chicken wire.

264
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,720
 But they still get all over everybody.

265
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,720
 It's still a mess.

266
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,720
 Yeah.

267
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,720
 We have both kinds.

268
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
 Country and Western.

269
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,720
 That's true.

270
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,720
 It's true.

271
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,720
 Oh man.

272
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,720
 Raw Hyde.

273
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,560
 I watched a little bit of Monday Night Raw a couple of weeks ago, Paul.

274
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,560
 Take him home.

275
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,560
 Before we go, I really do think the Loser Leaves Town match we've set up for two people

276
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,040
 with the name I want to scoop, baby, we should really think twice about it now.

277
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,480
 What's going to create, it's going to create some real friction.

278
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,480
 Let's go.

279
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
 Stampede.

280
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,480
 Go ahead.

281
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,680
 There will be crushing deaths, but in the good way.

282
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,680
 Yeah.

283
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,680
 Careful what you ask for.

284
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,120
 Have you watched any Monday Night Raw, Paul?

285
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,320
 Here's the thing.

286
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,560
 I listen to podcasts about wrestling.

287
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,720
 I haven't watched a wrestling match in probably two years.

288
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,160
 Now that it's on Netflix, I keep getting ads for it popping up on Netflix.

289
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
 Really excited.

290
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,160
 Go ahead and watch one.

291
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
 Yeah.

292
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,160
 The other day, I'm home by myself.

293
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,160
 I'm perusing.

294
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,400
 I'm looking for an option to watch without SJ around because we watch a lot of things

295
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
 together.

296
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,840
 I have to do the math of like, what is she not going to be mad at me for watching without

297
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,840
 her around?

298
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,840
 Right.

299
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,880
 Wrestling definitely won't be mad at me about that.

300
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,880
 Good math.

301
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,880
 Yeah.

302
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,280
 I turned it on for a little while.

303
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,360
 It seems to me, I haven't watched wrestling in I don't know how many years.

304
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,360
 Decades.

305
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,360
 Multiple decades.

306
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,360
 Long time.

307
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,360
 Long time.

308
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,360
 Yeah, long time.

309
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,880
 It seemed to me, and tell me if I'm wrong or not, it seemed to me that there was a lot

310
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:18,360
 more talking than there used to be and that the talking is much more contrived than I

311
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,360
 remember it.

312
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,360
 Yes.

313
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,360
 Now, is that me?

314
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,280
 Am I right or is that just me, child versus adult, looking at this?

315
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,280
 No, you're right.

316
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,800
 If you saw the South Park from a couple years back, they really nailed it where it's more

317
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,600
 about a theatrical thing than anything else.

318
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,040
 The wrestling is secondary at this point, which is so silly.

319
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,400
 Yeah, it's funny that you mentioned this.

320
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:50,480
 Just today, I deleted a couple of my wrestling podcasts because I'm like, this is just-

321
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,920
 Oh, you're falling off.

322
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,960
 Well, I mean, yeah.

323
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,960
 Yeah.

324
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
 Because-

325
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,960
 Tariffs?

326
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,960
 Oh, sorry.

327
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,600
 Triple H was in the White House just a couple days ago.

328
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,240
 Oh, is that right?

329
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,240
 In the White House.

330
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,520
 Oh, right, because what's her name, McMahon?

331
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,520
 I mean, she's been there.

332
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,520
 It's like the secretary of something.

333
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,880
 She's not, you know, she's not really directly connected to the company.

334
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
 Education, that's it.

335
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,880
 Sure, sure.

336
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,000
 She's not really directly connected to the company anymore, legacy-wise, for sure.

337
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 But to have Triple H-

338
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,600
 Well, because Vince is out, right?

339
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,600
 Yeah.

340
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
 Well, so they say.

341
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
 Who knows, man?

342
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,600
 But they might be, yeah, yeah.

343
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,600
 Like, I don't want to.

344
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
 Who fucking knows?

345
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
 Go ahead, McMahon.

346
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
 He was at a big party.

347
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,840
 I was at a party with Vince and he was making me pee on someone just the other night.

348
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,840
 Yeah?

349
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,840
 Okay.

350
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,840
 Well, maybe he's on his comeback tour.

351
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,840
 Yeah.

352
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,000
 I keep telling you not to invite Vince McMahon to your pee on people parties, Matt.

353
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 No.

354
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,240
 Because it turns into a shit on people party.

355
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,480
 It does.

356
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,480
 That's the problem.

357
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,280
 Matt, you have to put Visqueen down.

358
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,600
 You're going to ruin your Fardwood floors.

359
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,920
 This is so hard.

360
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,040
 My wife knows I'm hanging out with them when Visqueen gets delivered to my front door on

361
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,040
 Amazon.

362
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,040
 Yeah.

363
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:11,360
 But I just, I think for my own sense of self, I'm just like, like, okay.

364
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,840
 It's really been these last two months, shit's gotten kind of sketched for me.

365
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:24,640
 Again, and I'm only just listening to stuff and hearing, you know, watching a few little

366
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,480
 things on YouTube and whatnot, recaps, things like that.

367
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:35,960
 And I don't know if you're familiar, oh wait, ML Kennedy's saying Linda McMahon just got

368
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,800
 hacked at an interview.

369
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,520
 Someone got into the audio when she was talking about Department of Education stuff and somebody

370
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,600
 played the clown song.

371
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,600
 Hilarious.

372
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,120
 Oh, the entry of the gladiators at that, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, yeah, yeah,

373
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,120
 yeah.

374
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,120
 Wow.

375
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,120
 That's amazing, ML Kennedy.

376
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,120
 That's fantastic.

377
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,120
 Yeah.

378
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,520
 Because that's how she sounds and that's how the whole country sounds at this point.

379
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,520
 Right.

380
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:04,400
 But yeah, you know, they do this, it's become an annual thing now.

381
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:14,520
 They have a big to-do, the crown jewel that they do over in Dubai, you know, in Saudi

382
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:24,000
 Arabia and that, you know, that's already kind of questionable on a political note.

383
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:32,040
 But the thing is, CM Punk, when he was out of the WWE for a while, for years, he was

384
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:39,960
 giving those wrestlers unlimited shit, like he wrote a tweet that said, "Go suck a blood-soaked

385
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,880
 dick out in Saudi Arabia, you asshole."

386
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,980
 Yeah, right, right, right, right.

387
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,280
 So he was like coming for their throats over this, you know.

388
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,360
 He's giving people shit, but also, CM Punk, I think you should talk to somebody.

389
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,360
 Well, you know.

390
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,360
 Jesus Christ, man.

391
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:02,960
 It looked like he was taking a stand, but just last month, guess who's headlining Crown

392
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
 Jewel?

393
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,840
 Ah, got it.

394
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,800
 And then, you know, I watch Bachamania all the time, which is really funny.

395
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:18,160
 And they did the old clip of Krusty the Clown where it's like, "I'm so sorry.

396
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,560
 They backed up a Brink's truck to my house.

397
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,560
 I'm not made of stone."

398
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:29,800
 You know, it's like, of course, of course, money talks, right?

399
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:37,200
 But that's, it's endemic of everything going on in the whole world.

400
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:47,160
 And the fact that these players from this, you know, wrestling corporation are becoming

401
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,280
 statesmen?

402
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,840
 They're becoming statesmen.

403
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:58,680
 That's -- Glenn Jacobs is a governor, or a mayor, I don't know.

404
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,080
 It's just, it's too much for me.

405
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,880
 Why was I going to say Jesse "The Body" Ventura?

406
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,960
 I mean, he was the governor of Minnesota for a long time.

407
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,280
 Yeah, it's just kind of, it's just a little too much at this point for me.

408
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,280
 I don't know.

409
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,520
 I just -- And Abe Lincoln was the president.

410
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,520
 Yeah.

411
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520
 He wrestled.

412
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,520
 He did.

413
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,520
 He was a boxer, I think.

414
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,520
 Yeah.

415
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,520
 Maybe he was a wrestler.

416
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,520
 I think he was a wrestler.

417
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,520
 Yeah.

418
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,640
 The weird thing, though, on Raw, not having anything to do with any of all those things,

419
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,800
 was the cameras.

420
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:33,720
 They did, they do so much camera work now, and they switch back -- you know, I mean,

421
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,000
 they always switch back and forth between different shots and everything during the

422
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,680
 wrestling matches.

423
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:43,280
 Now they switch back and forth between different shots, and the camera speeds on the different

424
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,280
 cameras are different.

425
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,920
 Like the frame rate is different on different cameras, or something like that.

426
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,760
 I'm not exactly sure what they're doing, but that's what it looked like to me.

427
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:59,160
 And so they would move it, and all of a sudden, it would look like the two wrestlers in the

428
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:04,120
 ring were moving faster than they were just a second before, and then they'd switch back.

429
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,760
 And it was -- whatever it was, it was definitely on purpose.

430
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,760
 Yeah.

431
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,800
 It definitely seemed to be something that they were trying to do to kind of add to the

432
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,800
 action.

433
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,800
 Uh-huh.

434
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
 It was so odd.

435
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,280
 Was it throwing you?

436
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,320
 It was throwing me a little bit.

437
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,040
 I was kind of hoping that you had heard something about it, if they had said something about

438
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,120
 it publicly or something.

439
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,120
 I haven't.

440
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,120
 Maybe not.

441
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:32,060
 But of that is that they have professional camera crews now.

442
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,560
 Oh, sure.

443
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,440
 They've had some of their old camera crew -- well, no, it's a huge step up.

444
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,080
 Because after the departure of Vince -- Oh, did they have their own people before?

445
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,240
 They had Mr. Kevin Dunn.

446
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,720
 Kevin Dunn had been there for a millennia, and they finally got rid of him.

447
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,280
 And now all of a sudden, the production value has gone sky high.

448
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,920
 They got these guys from ESPN.

449
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,160
 The guys putting together the NFL best-of stuff and all that kind of thing.

450
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,760
 So they got some real high production value going forward right now.

451
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,360
 It was a good-looking product for the most part.

452
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,360
 That's what I mean.

453
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,360
 That's what I mean.

454
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,480
 And the video wall in the back, it was a good-looking product.

455
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,320
 No, they have the production -- Also, John Cena, I guess, is retiring.

456
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,320
 Yes.

457
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:20,080
 And him going through -- he's on a retirement tour or something, I guess.

458
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,840
 Yeah, these are his last year matches.

459
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:27,520
 A pro wrestler going through and playing their greatest hits for an audience is so goddamn

460
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,520
 funny.

461
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,520
 Yeah.

462
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,320
 And well, it's a weird thing that they've done with him because he went heel, you know.

463
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,320
 Okay.

464
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
 No, I don't.

465
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,280
 He'd never turned heel his entire career.

466
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,160
 Oh, so he's a bad guy now.

467
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,160
 Yeah.

468
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,320
 But now he's starting to regret it.

469
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
 It's weird.

470
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
 Like he is shoot regretting it.

471
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,720
 Like he really is sad that he did it, kind of, I think, because he never did it.

472
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,160
 So that's kind of crazy.

473
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,160
 Yeah, it's something else.

474
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,920
 What did you just say before that about Cena and, I don't know, I can't remember.

475
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,160
 Oh, just watching him do his retirement tour was interesting.

476
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
 Yeah.

477
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,680
 It's something else.

478
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,680
 I don't know.

479
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:13,120
 I just -- I'll tell you who was really excited about seeing Cena 2, though, coming out next

480
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,120
 year.

481
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,720
 And that's going to be the following sponsor.

482
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,260
 Today's show, Matt and Miley's Ice Cream and Social, is brought to you by -- I'm sorry

483
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,260
 for the delay.

484
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,480
 I just got some Disque Queen delivered to my front door.

485
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,480
 Oh.

486
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,480
 Ooh!

487
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,600
 Matt's having a party.

488
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,960
 Shoeless Joe's Bottomless Crocs.

489
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,960
 That's from Anonymous in 2024.

490
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,960
 Shoeless Joe's Bottomless Crocs.

491
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,620
 Hey, it's Shoeless Joe here for the Bottomless Crocs.

492
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,720
 You may be asking yourself, how can I get Bottomless Crocs?

493
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,720
 Well, it's simple.

494
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,520
 All you have to do is buy them from me, Shoeless Joe.

495
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,680
 I have crocs with no sole.

496
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
 That's right.

497
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,880
 Just the top of the croc.

498
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,240
 You slip it on just like a normal croc.

499
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,420
 Most people think you're wearing a croc, but no, no.

500
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,160
 You are wearing a croc with no sole.

501
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,520
 You're walking around essentially barefoot.

502
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,520
 Now, that in a lot of places is gauche.

503
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,080
 We don't want to come across as gauche, do we?

504
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,080
 No.

505
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,080
 No.

506
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,080
 So, buy the topper.

507
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,160
 Buy the croc topper.

508
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,440
 Put it on top of your foot.

509
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,280
 No one will ever be the wiser that you are just ill-billed in it.

510
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,860
 Go gauche, go broke.

511
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,120
 That's what I say.

512
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,120
 It's true.

513
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
 Go gauche, go broke.

514
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
 There's a lot of places.

515
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
 He says it all the time.

516
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,560
 I mean, many of you have probably gone into a convenience store and noticed the little

517
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,560
 sign.

518
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,400
 No shirt, no shoes, no service.

519
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,560
 Yeah.

520
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:35,840
 These crocs let you skip that line, as it were, and go ahead and walk on in there proudly.

521
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:44,040
 Even though you're technically barefoot, you have the clam shell of the croc on top of

522
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,120
 your foot, disguising your naked soul.

523
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,120
 Hi.

524
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,480
 I was here.

525
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,160
 I'm hoping to have sex with one of your slutty crocodiles.

526
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,480
 Oh, okay.

527
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,480
 Come into the back room.

528
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,480
 Yeah.

529
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,480
 Bottomless crocs.

530
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,080
 Enter Hasecoops to check out.

531
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,080
 Yeah.

532
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,080
 That's what really makes the money.

533
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,920
 Well, that naked soul turn was actually really poetic and beautiful, buddy.

534
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,200
 That was a little too highbrow for the camera.

535
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,200
 Oh, you like that?

536
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,200
 Yeah.

537
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
 That was actually kind of poetic.

538
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,200
 But Poet didn't know it.

539
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
 Yeah.

540
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,640
 You see, Matt recognized that it had gotten a little highbrow for the show and he commented

541
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,640
 on it.

542
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,240
 I just made a joke about having sex with a crocodile who was bottomless.

543
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,600
 I think we both did the right thing.

544
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,360
 This is where we live, right, guys?

545
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,240
 It's the same thing I used to talk about with Absinthe.

546
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,560
 It's everything from the profane to the sublime.

547
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,140
 We like to cover all bases.

548
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,000
 We can get esoteric when we want to, but we can also tell you-

549
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 We should steal that line.

550
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 They're not using it.

551
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,600
 They didn't take your-

552
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,580
 They never used that because it was my line.

553
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:54,800
 They should have used it, everything from the profane to the sublime.

554
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,320
 Believe me, someone who has given them a line, they will take it and use it.

555
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,320
 They should.

556
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,320
 We'll use it.

557
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,760
 Matt Madden is ice cream social.

558
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,640
 Profane to the sublime, get on board with our new fucking slogan.

559
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,640
 Will you get it?

560
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,640
 I'm on.

561
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,640
 I'm on.

562
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,640
 You know what?

563
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,640
 You bring up the no shoes, no shirt, no service, I don't see those signs like it needs to be

564
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,640
 everywhere.

565
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,640
 As much?

566
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,640
 Maybe they're done?

567
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,640
 Maybe it's over?

568
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,680
 No, I meant did that culture war win?

569
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,960
 Do we now know we got to wear shoes into the 7-Eleven?

570
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:39,680
 Or has footwear gone to the point where it's like, well, technically a toe ring is footwear?

571
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:46,320
 I think everybody is more aware that every business can just kick you out for any reason

572
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,320
 that they want to now.

573
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,520
 That's true.

574
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,560
 If you come into a restaurant, or maybe not a restaurant, but like a 7-Eleven barefoot

575
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:00,760
 and you're not being a jerk, they'll probably just serve you and you can leave.

576
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,440
 I have memories as a kid like going back and forth to the beach because I grew up on the

577
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,880
 Jersey Shore, pinkies out in my county.

578
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,720
 How come that's never come up before?

579
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:16,360
 When my chauffeur would take us to the beach, no, my dad would take us to the beach.

580
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:22,280
 We would go to 7-Eleven on the way home or something like that, and I would run in barefoot

581
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,280
 and feel like fun.

582
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,240
 I was in the store doing whatever.

583
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,920
 My kids, I really think the answer is Crocs, like not anything but the fact that we've

584
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,920
 made...

585
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,920
 A very simple shoe.

586
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,560
 A flip-flop was easy, too.

587
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,440
 A flip-flop was easy, too, but I don't really ever see any proper flip-flops.

588
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,480
 I'll see it in a proper sandal, more like an executive sandal style for a lady.

589
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,840
 I don't want to offend anybody, but I feel like people who wear flip-flops, that's what

590
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,840
 they wear.

591
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,560
 How dare you?

592
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:05,600
 How fucking dare you use this platform to disparage people on that level.

593
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,800
 I occasionally wear a flip-flop, but rarely.

594
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,800
 But anyhow.

595
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,880
 For the most part, honestly, I just wear it when we have a churn.

596
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,360
 I just wear it to the churn.

597
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,600
 I just wear flip-flops to the churn.

598
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,440
 Guys, I'm wrapping up my magic invention.

599
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,480
 You guys want to get into it?

600
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,080
 It's pretty exciting stuff.

601
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,200
 A magic invention?

602
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,200
 Convention.

603
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,480
 Oh, you're at a convention right now?

604
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:41,040
 Well, I'm at my house right now, but Magic Live is happening at the Orleans Casino.

605
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,720
 They always dry run Scoopfest by doing a convention.

606
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
 That's right.

607
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
 Right.

608
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
 They always ride ahead of us, right?

609
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:52,480
 Yeah, they do this convention for 5,000 people to see how it's going to go, and then everything's

610
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,560
 road tested for us to bring in our hundreds of people.

611
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,560
 That's right.

612
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:01,800
 Well, I mean, we can't help it that we have the better, more elite convention.

613
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,800
 That's true.

614
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
 That's just how it is, man.

615
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,800
 It's true.

616
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,160
 I was involved in this convention.

617
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,160
 No.

618
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,160
 Handsap's got a flip-flop.

619
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
 Look out.

620
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,160
 I've offended Handsap.

621
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,160
 There you go.

622
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,160
 Handsap.

623
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
 Oh.

624
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,160
 Sorry, Handsap.

625
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,200
 No, you didn't realize that was a real bomb.

626
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,200
 What do they call them?

627
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,200
 Chooklas?

628
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,520
 I wonder if there's another word people want to...

629
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,520
 No.

630
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,520
 Chooklas.

631
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,520
 The thing you're talking about.

632
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
 We all know what you're trying to say.

633
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,520
 Chooklas.

634
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,520
 Yeah, yeah.

635
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,520
 They call them choncolas.

636
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,520
 Yeah, yeah.

637
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,520
 Choncolas.

638
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,640
 Well, you know, people get really good at throwing those fucking things.

639
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,640
 What?

640
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,440
 You don't know about that.

641
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,520
 I mean, people get good at throwing things that they throw.

642
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,880
 No, but I mean, no, no, no.

643
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,880
 There is a...

644
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,160
 No, no, no.

645
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:56,040
 Nolan Ryan started as a chocolist thrower.

646
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,040
 There is...

647
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,160
 I believe it's pronounced chikulas, Matt.

648
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,600
 Scupacabras saying Spanish grandmas.

649
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,920
 Again, not to stereotype, not to get anybody upset, but there are lots of videos...

650
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,920
 Too late.

651
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:13,920
 Lots of videos of elderly women taking off a flip-flop and fucking dead-ass nailing people

652
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,000
 in the head with it, just whoa.

653
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,040
 I never had family members that would throw things.

654
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,560
 I would have family members that would have taken off a flip-flop and just smacked you

655
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,560
 with it.

656
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,560
 That part, too.

657
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:32,200
 I think we had throwers.

658
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,400
 Spanish grandmas make a great name for a bowling team, just so we're clear.

659
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,960
 It does.

660
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,840
 Jeff Loomis, welcome to the part of the podcast where Paul introduces an obscure fact and

661
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,040
 then acts borderline offended that no one else has heard of it.

662
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,040
 It's not no one else.

663
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,240
 Lots of people are saying it.

664
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,240
 Lots of people are saying it.

665
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,240
 Lots of people are saying it.

666
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,240
 Listen to this guy.

667
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,840
 But your introduction to that fact was terrible.

668
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,200
 You didn't know the word and then you gave us no other word.

669
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,320
 I said chukula and I know it's wrong.

670
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,960
 And then it was annoying that we didn't know it.

671
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,960
 Okay.

672
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,960
 Whatever.

673
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:17,160
 Anyway, Basi says the flip-flops are a weapon of grannies.

674
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,160
 They're in the peninsula.

675
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,160
 So there you go.

676
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,160
 Oh, there you go.

677
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:26,000
 I just I'm saying there is a a sect of older ladies who have become very adept at flinging

678
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 their footwear.

679
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,680
 Jacob, hit the production meeting music.

680
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:37,520
 Oh, it's gone.

681
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,200
 It's another button that I don't have on this pad.

682
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,200
 Where the fuck?

683
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,640
 This podcast is falling apart.

684
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,480
 I know you're telling me.

685
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,480
 Production meeting.

686
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
 Okay.

687
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,200
 If we're going to read a comment from the chat, we have to read the comment from the

688
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:58,360
 chat because for the listener at home, when you go, oh, yeah, so so yeah, like that's

689
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:03,160
 not a good right way to incorporate the chat into the podcast.

690
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,240
 We've all been doing it.

691
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,680
 So that's why I'm calling it out on a production meeting.

692
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:12,920
 So if you're going to acknowledge the chat, fully acknowledge and fully read the chat

693
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,560
 and then that's a good note.

694
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,280
 And then we do it because otherwise I think people listening at home are going fucking

695
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,280
 nuts.

696
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,280
 Okay.

697
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,280
 All right.

698
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,280
 Production meeting over.

699
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:28,520
 That's the machine, the machine.

700
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,420
 Where the fuck is my production meeting?

701
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,320
 It's just a machine now.

702
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,320
 If we had a churn, this would never have happened.

703
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,440
 We would know where their production meeting was.

704
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,520
 It's true, it's true.

705
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,200
 Possibly true.

706
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,120
 It is possibly true.

707
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:53,200
 So I was asked to host a show this year at magic live.

708
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,200
 Yeah.

709
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
 Oh, that's right.

710
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,280
 Yeah.

711
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:04,360
 And it became very clear very quickly that it was a mistake for all involved.

712
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,320
 Who did it become very clear to very quickly?

713
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,400
 No, no.

714
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,480
 So here's the thing.

715
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,040
 They always have a big showcase show and a big and a close up showcase.

716
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,040
 Right.

717
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,800
 And they always experiment with a third show.

718
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:24,280
 And then the experimental third show is it medium, medium pace magic?

719
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,280
 Is that what it is?

720
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,280
 It is.

721
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,280
 Yeah.

722
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,160
 It is magic that starts like really far away, but finishes very up close.

723
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:37,960
 Like you run progressive magic.

724
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:43,120
 Think of a card and then you run towards them and smack them in the face with a card.

725
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,120
 Oh, God.

726
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:57,800
 The most painful card to get hit with the bottom of his fucking flip flop.

727
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:04,160
 So originally, the show is going to have no no host and it was called the Experimental

728
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,520
 Theater Concepts Show.

729
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,520
 Yes.

730
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,520
 OK.

731
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,520
 Huh?

732
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,520
 Who's not?

733
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,680
 Everybody just I know everyone in the chest just rolls off the tongue.

734
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,680
 Why?

735
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,680
 Why couldn't I go?

736
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,680
 I wish I was there.

737
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,680
 I know.

738
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,680
 I know.

739
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,680
 I know.

740
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
 But the Experimental Theater Concepts Show.

741
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:26,520
 Meaning you have to do like an avant-garde or you need a trick?

742
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,520
 Yes.

743
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,520
 Yeah.

744
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:32,960
 You have to experiment with the presentation of magic in some way.

745
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,960
 I don't want to.

746
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,120
 I don't want to steal your thunder here.

747
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:45,960
 But when I think experimental and avant-garde magic trick, my first thought is Rudy Coby.

748
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,320
 Oh, yeah.

749
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:52,840
 I mean, Rudy was around and Rudy was certainly someone who Rudy Coby is certainly someone

750
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:57,520
 who pushed the boundaries of magic and pushed magic in different directions.

751
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,520
 And theatrically, too.

752
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,520
 Yes.

753
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,640
 If you're going to make it about theatrics, his whole thing was theatrics.

754
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,640
 Yeah.

755
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,640
 No.

756
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,160
 I remember Rudy Coby, a lot of his stuff is on YouTube.

757
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,480
 If you go look at his stuff.

758
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,320
 Lab man is his alter ego.

759
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,320
 Yeah.

760
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,560
 Lab man is the bit.

761
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,880
 And you really don't see too much like it.

762
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:23,560
 And actually that style of what he's doing is part of like an older vaudeville thing.

763
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,560
 Yes.

764
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,120
 But he made it so that it was completely felt modern and unique in its time.

765
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,120
 It was.

766
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,240
 It is great.

767
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,240
 It's very, very cool stuff that he does.

768
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,240
 Yeah.

769
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,240
 He has a lot of legs.

770
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,240
 That's fine.

771
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,240
 Yeah.

772
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,240
 I said it's fine.

773
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,720
 It's perfectly good.

774
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:48,720
 So initially I was approached it was actually when I did my run at the Magic Castle, one

775
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:55,240
 of the people who ran the one of the people who runs the festival, my friend, Nick Lang,

776
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,840
 said, you know, hey, this show is going to be so experimental.

777
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:03,200
 We're thinking about having, you know, kind of a host to kind of keep it all together

778
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,400
 and have fun with it.

779
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:13,680
 And the pitches are like, I'd be able to have fun doing like these different bits or whatever.

780
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,840
 And it's the biggest, it's the biggest magic convention in North America.

781
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,840
 Right.

782
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:22,000
 It's a, you know, it's a, it's a, you know, obviously I'm going to say yes to the opportunity

783
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,480
 no matter what it was.

784
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,480
 Right.

785
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,480
 You've got to jump on it.

786
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,480
 Yeah.

787
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,360
 And when I showed up for rehearsal, like the bits were so avant-garde that I was like,

788
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:38,480
 if I'm trying to do like wacky bits in between, I, this isn't going to go well.

789
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:46,080
 So the routines were just too out there to be made fun of or they were too, they were

790
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:51,160
 too, uh, yeah, they were, they were taking such a big swing that if I tried to make a

791
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,320
 joke about it, it might look like I'm making fun of it.

792
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,320
 Yes.

793
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,000
 Was it like the end of my crock bit where I threw you off by being poetic and you were

794
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,920
 like, Oh God, that was amazing.

795
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,720
 The way he moved that light across the stage without touching it.

796
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,040
 I can't make fun of that.

797
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,880
 Well, like when, yeah, even as that crock commercial, like I was like, why is this tear

798
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,720
 running down the side of my face?

799
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:17,880
 You know, um, so example, like, uh, uh, I'll just go through the, the things that there,

800
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:23,440
 that there were, uh, like one, uh, guy did like a completely AI thing where he sat down

801
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,800
 in the chair and a screen popped up and did a complete AI head.

802
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,840
 It was like Max Hedrum from the nineties, uh, but I didn't want to make a Max Hedrum

803
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,560
 joke to make fun of it.

804
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,240
 Both did not date myself.

805
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:43,120
 And uh, I guess while you're looking at Rudy Kobe's magic specials, go ahead and look at

806
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,120
 Max Hedrum.

807
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,800
 We're in the same time period.

808
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:54,000
 That frewer everybody, Max Hedrum, catch the wave.

809
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 Coke.

810
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 Yeah.

811
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 Yeah.

812
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,560
 And then, uh, um, so, uh, you know, another guy did a trick where he was talking, but

813
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,360
 then all of a sudden he does this trick backwards and does the whole thing backwards.

814
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:12,160
 Um, and then another guy had a thing where everyone put on headphones, but it was like

815
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,520
 more of like a theatrical piece.

816
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,360
 And so you were not to be in the room and so they're supposed to make the room feel

817
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,360
 empty.

818
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,840
 And this was like, it was, yeah.

819
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:26,600
 And so all of us was very, I basically said that we've created a show that's very ketamine

820
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,600
 friendly.

821
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:33,720
 That's what I was saying to my friends when I was like, what's the show like?

822
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,360
 And I was like, it's very ketamine is the vibe.

823
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,840
 Watched a show while sitting in a k-hole.

824
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:48,340
 And so, uh, bringing a wacky improv comic, uh, was, was maybe not, not the best pairing

825
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:56,080
 for, for, for, no, especially like also like when it's like, you know, experimentation

826
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:02,480
 and technology stuff, uh, no, no, the funny thing is that we, I pitched an idea for this

827
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,480
 show.

828
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:09,280
 I try to get into the show as an entertainer, uh, and they were like, that's too out there.

829
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,160
 Actually I was, we were told it was not out there enough.

830
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,080
 So I, cause I did this, you know, I did the, uh, I'm going to be at the magic castle again,

831
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:23,680
 August 20th to 24th, once again with my buddy, uh, Nick Paul and, uh, we did an improv bit

832
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,820
 where we, where we, where we did magic, but took made it like a genre roller coaster of

833
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,820
 a magic trick.

834
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,820
 That's a fun.

835
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,820
 Yeah.

836
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,160
 It's, it's on my Instagram somewhere.

837
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:40,520
 And um, so, uh, we pitched different versions of using improv games for magic.

838
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:45,360
 So like we were going to do a card step routine, having the audience members be our arms, or

839
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:50,440
 we would be the arms of audience members and do the trick and we're going to do an illusion

840
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,480
 to it, to the song of anyone's choosing that could go through Spotify on one of our phones

841
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,400
 and choose any song they wanted.

842
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,560
 And we were going to, you know, explore doing an illusion twice to two totally different

843
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,280
 pieces of music.

844
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:09,360
 Um, and that was considered not different, not different enough.

845
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:13,120
 Now when I just described those pieces I described, you can see that like, yes, I believe we were

846
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,440
 below the theatrical bar of what they were looking for.

847
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,720
 Uh, but energy wise, they could have used it, I think they could have used it just for

848
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,880
 a little, just a little pep in the room.

849
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,360
 Little pep, little kick up.

850
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,360
 Yep, yep, yep.

851
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,120
 And I had to like stall in between, but I wasn't going to do magic tricks in between

852
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,920
 because the show was showcasing experimental magic.

853
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:41,280
 So it wouldn't be good for them to do like road tested material in between to stall.

854
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,340
 Did you err on the side of Cirque du Soleil?

855
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:51,840
 Did you like wheel in a baby on a giant screen and be like, "I'm the lonely baby who's sad"?

856
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,680
 Paul, were you there?

857
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,680
 Paul were you there?

858
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,680
 That's exactly what I did.

859
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,160
 That's what happened.

860
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,520
 I mean that Zarkana stuff's got to be laying around somewhere.

861
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:11,400
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, just laying around waiting for somebody that wants to print money.

862
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,400
 Print money?

863
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,400
 That's it.

864
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,080
 Print Monopoly money.

865
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,080
 That's right.

866
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,920
 That you can only spend at the Cosmopolitan buffet.

867
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,120
 Zarkana and run, they're both just sitting around waiting on somebody to pick those up

868
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,640
 and just run with them.

869
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:30,160
 Everything from the profane to the sublime.

870
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,160
 Now what was your solution, man?

871
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:38,280
 Jeff in the chat mentions that if you can go see A Good Magician at the Magic Castle, it

872
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,280
 is an awesome time.

873
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,120
 All right, but you should also go August 20th to the 24th anyway.

874
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,640
 Oh, I didn't read Jeff's whole thing.

875
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,680
 He said if you can go see Matt at the Magic Castle, it's an awesome time.

876
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,680
 I messed up, I didn't read his whole post again.

877
00:40:53,680 --> 00:41:02,320
 I'll tell you who also is going to go see Matt at the Magic Castle, and that's the following

878
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,320
 sponsor.

879
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:09,000
 Today's show is brought to you by Stinky Pants.

880
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,840
 Pants for babies.

881
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,840
 That's right.

882
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,840
 Stinky Pants.

883
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,880
 Pants for babies.

884
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:18,200
 That's from Dead Lazlo in 2024.

885
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:26,160
 Boo boo wah wah, boo boo wah wah, boo boo wah wah, I got a duty.

886
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:32,560
 Boo boo wah wah, boo boo wah wah, boo boo wah wah, I got a duty.

887
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,560
 Hi.

888
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:41,320
 I'm a big dumb baby, and I poop my duties all in my pants.

889
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:46,440
 And I hate it because everyone says, "Hey, big dumb baby who smells like duties, what's

890
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,760
 wrong with you?"

891
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,560
 And I'm like, because I'm still pooping in my pants with my duties.

892
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,160
 But turns out there's a solution.

893
00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:00,360
 All I need is these poopy pants for babies that come pre-pooped, and the poop smells

894
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,560
 like bananas, so it's not bad.

895
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:08,680
 So now I'm not big dumb baby who smells like poop, I'm big dumb baby who smells like a

896
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,880
 pants full of bananas.

897
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,280
 And nobody knows any better, but don't ever take me on a field trip to the zoo or I'll

898
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,680
 get ate up by the gorillas.

899
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,760
 Oh God, I'm in the cage.

900
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,920
 He got me.

901
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,040
 No, they shot him.

902
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,800
 They shot him dead.

903
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,800
 I didn't mean for this to happen.

904
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:36,040
 Poop, poop, poopy, poopy pants that smell like bananas, don't go to the zoo.

905
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,440
 Enter HeyScoops at checkout.

906
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,880
 Again, I was just laughing along with you, Paul, and then you made a Harambe reference

907
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,120
 in tears, flowing down my face.

908
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:52,920
 Okay, we learned the last episode that if Paul's too gross and fast forwards the commercial-

909
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,920
 That's right.

910
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,320
 Do we think she fast forwarded that commercial or not?

911
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,840
 Do you think you can tow the lawn?

912
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,840
 I think she probably listened to that one.

913
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,160
 It didn't get too gross.

914
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:09,080
 Are you now that you know that fact, does it affect the way you make commercials?

915
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,160
 No, not at all.

916
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,120
 I'm not censoring myself for that woman.

917
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:18,220
 No, 20 years of uncensored bullshit from me.

918
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,220
 She knows what's up.

919
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:23,440
 No, but she also did say, because I talked to her about it the other day, she said, it's

920
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,500
 not every commercial, just some of them.

921
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,200
 There you go.

922
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,200
 What a temp.

923
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,280
 Always in your corner.

924
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,440
 She went over by any of the Chinese bridge arguments we had for your backyard.

925
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,440
 Oh, good question.

926
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:44,560
 I don't know that she's listened to that episode yet, because we got to talk about maybe doing

927
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:51,160
 it and having the water flow of flowers underneath, but she could be swayed.

928
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,800
 I think she can be swayed.

929
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:59,600
 I was contacted by one Ryar Appledorn, who is apparently in the middle of constructing

930
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:05,200
 a Chinese bridge for his own yard, and with that same kind of flowery solution, I think,

931
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,440
 so I said, hey, let's talk.

932
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:14,120
 He's already offered to build me a Chinese bridge, so we've got to see how it works and

933
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,000
 see what we do there.

934
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,280
 Maybe in a year or two, we can make that happen.

935
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,320
 Not this summer.

936
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,320
 Always hire Ryar.

937
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,480
 You can't go wrong, hire Ryar.

938
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:30,000
 I'll tell you, Ryar was a fantastic co-pilot with me and the dogs to get me all the way

939
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,280
 across the country.

940
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,020
 That was a very good thing that I had.

941
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,960
 Didn't spill anything in the car or anything.

942
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,480
 Look, look, that's me.

943
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,760
 That's my issues coming out.

944
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,160
 That's my weird, what do you want me to call those?

945
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,160
 Yeah, no shit.

946
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:55,240
 I've been working on new tricks and I thought Ryar was so wrapped up with Brushwood that

947
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:59,800
 I did not hire initially to make a prop for me, and I had another company make a prop

948
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,960
 for me and it did not accomplish what I needed it to accomplish.

949
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,120
 Mistake.

950
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:16,440
 I headed over to Ryar and a little bit jaded, I just was like, this company tried X, Y and

951
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,440
 Z and said it wouldn't work.

952
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,440
 I think that's bullshit.

953
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,760
 I bet you could do it or whatever.

954
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,120
 And he came back to me basically going, "No, the problems that the company said with the

955
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:28,720
 prop are correct, but I've invented this new way to do it."

956
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:35,840
 So Ryar came up with a totally new proprietary technology way to do the trick I want to do.

957
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,840
 Amazing.

958
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,200
 I'm being cagey about the trick, not because I give a shit about that, only that I might

959
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,600
 perform it at ScoopFest.

960
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,120
 So I'm being cagey because I don't want to give it away.

961
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:49,400
 Well, you should be cagey too, because you guys can patent those things at some point.

962
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,720
 Oh, good idea.

963
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,720
 Good idea.

964
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,720
 Right?

965
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,720
 Yeah.

966
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,480
 I mean, I don't know exactly how all that works with the Magic community.

967
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,480
 It's hard to lock stuff down.

968
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,200
 Nobody does.

969
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,720
 It's always very low key.

970
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,720
 It's honor system, right?

971
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,720
 Yeah.

972
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,720
 People get along all the time.

973
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,720
 No one ever fights about it ever.

974
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:09,000
 That's the way it works in the Magic community.

975
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,200
 Magic and variety have that in common.

976
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,640
 Nobody's ever upset with anybody for stealing anything.

977
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,580
 Nobody accuses anybody of theft.

978
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:19,600
 Nobody is to say they've made it their own.

979
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,640
 It never happens in the Magic world.

980
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:26,480
 Oh, and if you just want to get really mad about it, listen to burlesque people complain

981
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,480
 about it.

982
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,680
 Oh, I can't imagine, right?

983
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,080
 Listening to burlesque people complain about people stealing bits is...

984
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:38,240
 I mean, listening to Magic people do it, listening to variety people do it, it's already insane

985
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,240
 and annoying.

986
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,240
 Let me tell you, honey.

987
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,520
 When people do it, you're like, what are you actually talking about?

988
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:49,960
 35 years ago, I was the first to reveal my left tit immediately as soon as the curtain

989
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,280
 came up.

990
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,280
 And those motherfucking bitches stole it and ran with it.

991
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,040
 They call it the pirate eye.

992
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,040
 That's right.

993
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:07,880
 I had the first pirate eye move, left tit specifically, and that fucking dungaree wearing whore took

994
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,560
 that fucking bit from me.

995
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,560
 Dungaree?

996
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,560
 Yes.

997
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,480
 That ragamuffin dungaree wearing?

998
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,480
 That's right.

999
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:25,320
 This was 35 years ago when ladies didn't do such pantaloons.

1000
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,320
 Interhase scoops at checkout?

1001
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:31,000
 I don't know.

1002
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 There was decorum.

1003
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 Decorum.

1004
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,320
 There was fucking rules, there were rules.

1005
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,520
 I was the worst one that put castles on my kneecaps.

1006
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:52,240
 Dirty knees, look at these we called them.

1007
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,560
 Dungaree wearing whore is a scoop fest t-shirt, right?

1008
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:01,480
 Well, Brogan's always in the chat here.

1009
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,680
 Actually Brogan, you're in Las Vegas right now, aren't you?

1010
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,640
 Do you want to unmute?

1011
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,480
 Yes, I am.

1012
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,960
 Because you're at a Star Trek convention?

1013
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,960
 Yes.

1014
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:20,900
 Because you're here to see, was it Dave Davies, Dan Davis?

1015
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,880
 I'm here to see Daniel Davis.

1016
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:23,880
 Daniel Davis.

1017
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:24,880
 Yeah.

1018
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,880
 From The Nanny.

1019
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,880
 So he was in The Nanny?

1020
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:29,880
 The guy from The Nanny?

1021
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:30,880
 Yeah.

1022
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,200
 I ran into JoBeth last night at the bar.

1023
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,200
 Oh God.

1024
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,440
 And you were talking about, because we had you on and we were talking about how Daniel

1025
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,640
 Davis was going to be at the Star Trek convention, that's why you were going.

1026
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,400
 So you're trying to get Paul to go with Daniel Davis going to be there.

1027
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,080
 I did not understand the reference obviously in any capacity whatsoever.

1028
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:55,920
 But it turns out that Daniel Davis is not primarily a Star Trek person, not a Star Trek

1029
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,320
 personality person, and in fact he himself, the actor, was debating whether or not to

1030
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:07,200
 attend the Star Trek convention because they're not that big of a character on there and they

1031
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,840
 have a large acting resume outside the Star Trek universe.

1032
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,280
 He's a Broadway star, yeah.

1033
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,900
 He's a Broadway star.

1034
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:23,120
 And then I understand Chris the Microscope bought a cameo for you from Daniel Davis,

1035
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,840
 is that right?

1036
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,880
 That's correct.

1037
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,600
 Okay.

1038
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:32,520
 And then the result of that cameo was Daniel Davis saying, "I was on the fence about doing

1039
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,720
 the convention, but now I've done this cameo for you and you're going to the convention,

1040
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,720
 I'll do the convention."

1041
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,720
 Is that right?

1042
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:38,720
 Oh wow.

1043
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:45,960
 Brogan, while you're here, just because you brought it up privately and a topic that's

1044
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:50,120
 come up on the pod, you've actually, you have come to the United States now three times

1045
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:59,280
 or two times, twice this year.

1046
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:06,320
 Have you encountered any hassle or fracas coming to the country?

1047
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,740
 We've had scoops from other countries say they don't want to come to Scoop Fest because

1048
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:12,920
 they're worried about things they've posted on social media, that kind of stuff, and there

1049
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,580
 are stories that's happened.

1050
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:20,620
 So I guess broadly then, have you experienced a difference in travel because you've come

1051
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,440
 here many times?

1052
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,440
 No.

1053
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,680
 I mean, don't get me wrong, it was genuinely terrifying the first time, and even the second

1054
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:36,040
 time because I flew a different airline this time, and I usually go from Edinburgh to London

1055
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,040
 to Vegas.

1056
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,280
 So Vegas is usually my first hit into the States.

1057
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,160
 This time I went from Edinburgh to New York to Vegas.

1058
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,320
 So passing through customs was at New York.

1059
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,280
 I have not had any problems.

1060
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,360
 No one has asked for my phone.

1061
00:50:54,360 --> 00:51:00,840
 No one bothered at all, although I will say I got global entry, 100% do that because I

1062
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:05,700
 got to New York and they went to the little kiosk, took my picture.

1063
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:09,440
 The guy looked at me and went, "Go through."

1064
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,380
 It did not stop me whatsoever.

1065
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:15,240
 Nobody asks you a goddamn thing.

1066
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:20,740
 That is genuinely more interaction than I usually have with anyone when I'm doing global

1067
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:22,840
 entry coming back in.

1068
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,760
 Into the country, like I said, from your Portugal stuff.

1069
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:31,000
 Yeah, like last week I came back in, like that was more interaction, what you just described

1070
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,320
 was more interaction than I had with anybody coming back in.

1071
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,720
 We came back in through Philadelphia.

1072
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,720
 Global entry.

1073
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,720
 Yeah, yeah.

1074
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:41,280
 Now, Paul, I don't know if they could hear the bunnies on that one.

1075
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,080
 Now, I was...

1076
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,080
 Global entry.

1077
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:52,800
 When I was partying with Vince McMahon, global entry was very different.

1078
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,800
 Global entry.

1079
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,200
 Gobble, gobble, global entry.

1080
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:05,320
 But yeah, like nobody asks to see your phone and don't get me wrong, I am very white and

1081
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:13,960
 I look like I'm 12 years old, so I look very non-threatening and because I am just a paranoid...

1082
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:18,520
 Wait, you bring up your race, I don't think anything race-based has happened with this

1083
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,520
 administration.

1084
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,520
 Oh boy.

1085
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,520
 Really?

1086
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,520
 I don't think anybody said anything about that.

1087
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,520
 Oh boy.

1088
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:29,520
 I'm only mentioning it because I burn in the Vegas sun, but whatever, if you want to bring

1089
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,080
 it racist, Matt, okay, whatever.

1090
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:36,600
 Brogan was sunburned from sitting under the lights on the plane.

1091
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:40,680
 That was a joke, that's true.

1092
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:44,560
 Yeah, I was just curious, you know, whatever.

1093
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,560
 That's all fine.

1094
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:50,400
 I'm so excited my accent is getting a bit thick, so I think...

1095
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,680
 What accent is that you're talking about?

1096
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,680
 What do you mean?

1097
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,680
 Shut the fuck up and let me get to my point, Paul.

1098
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:56,680
 There's no accent at all.

1099
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,680
 Brogan, switch over to full Gaelic any second.

1100
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,460
 I've not detected the slightest change in your demeanor.

1101
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:06,080
 Wait, you're both from Kazakhstan?

1102
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:09,320
 That's right, Kazakhstan represent.

1103
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,360
 Engines to full, I cannot hold her together, Captain.

1104
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:15,720
 I'm at the table grabbing the bill first.

1105
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:27,440
 Oh, oh, I cannot restrain myself here at the table going for my credit card, as it will.

1106
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,840
 Brogan ordered a pot tea.

1107
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,720
 Oh, we just let him go.

1108
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,720
 We just wait until he stops, don't we?

1109
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,720
 That's right.

1110
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,040
 You wind me up and I just go.

1111
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,160
 I just go.

1112
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,640
 He wears himself out eventually.

1113
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,640
 At the table.

1114
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:45,240
 You want to fuck my crocodile.

1115
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:49,840
 It's really more of like a comedy tantrum, if anything, you know, you have to kind of

1116
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:50,840
 let it...

1117
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:58,200
 It's really a 50-year comedy tantrum, that's my fucking biography.

1118
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,200
 God damn right.

1119
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,200
 Let's do some scoop mail.

1120
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,200
 Message for you, sir.

1121
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:09,080
 We got a scoop mail from Sarah Boyle.

1122
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:13,440
 We got a physical scoop mail and I'm going to read you this letter that came with it.

1123
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,780
 Yes, Matt Donnelly.

1124
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:16,600
 She's right up there, I'm pointing to her.

1125
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:20,800
 Oh, I thought you were just like waving.

1126
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,800
 Let's see.

1127
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:27,000
 This got left at my house.

1128
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,440
 I walked out of my front door and this was on my doorstep.

1129
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:35,040
 I felt so creepy doing it, like I felt really intensely creepy, but I was like, I'm not

1130
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,440
 going to pay to ship this.

1131
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,160
 You live like three miles from me, like I could walk to your house with it.

1132
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,720
 And so I was just like, I know where you live.

1133
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,720
 As long as you're not wearing like a FedEx uniform, it's all good.

1134
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,680
 You know, I don't know.

1135
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,680
 I think we're fine.

1136
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,840
 I think everything's fine.

1137
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,760
 I mean everybody that's coming to the whiskey barbecue knows where Jacob lives.

1138
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,760
 That's right.

1139
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:58,760
 Yeah.

1140
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,480
 I have made my house somewhat public information and yeah, so somebody-

1141
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,700
 People don't just drop off at each other's houses anymore.

1142
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,720
 It's not like the 80s when you could just be at somebody's house.

1143
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,760
 Well, you also didn't knock on the door.

1144
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,760
 You just left the box outside.

1145
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,760
 No, I didn't.

1146
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,760
 No, I didn't.

1147
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,760
 I just-

1148
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:14,760
 I think everything was fine.

1149
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:21,400
 So dear denizens- That hideous house you're trying to convince me to buy.

1150
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:27,120
 I don't think anybody should buy that house that doesn't want to spend another $150,000

1151
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,120
 on it.

1152
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,120
 No, no, no.

1153
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,120
 They're asking way too much.

1154
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:34,640
 But Steve and I literally like genuinely are considering buying a house that's in a different

1155
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:39,600
 cul-de-sac on Jacob's street if they drop the price a little.

1156
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:46,280
 And I'm like, "Is it weird to move into his neighborhood?"

1157
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,400
 You wouldn't be the weirdest people in the neighborhood.

1158
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,400
 That is definitely true.

1159
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,960
 I've met a couple of your neighbors.

1160
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,120
 You wouldn't win that battle.

1161
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,120
 So there is that.

1162
00:55:55,120 --> 00:56:01,600
 Dear denizens of Eventually A New Churn, BatScoop and I recently got back from 10 days of puffing

1163
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:05,760
 watching in the, what is it say, Westman?

1164
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,140
 Westman Islands, yeah.

1165
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,720
 The Westman Islands in Iceland.

1166
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,520
 Oh, that's great.

1167
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,440
 Upon our return, there was a package of very- It was 55 degrees Fahrenheit the whole time

1168
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:19,560
 we were there and it was 100 degrees Fahrenheit here and I was just like, "I could- That's

1169
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,560
 like half.

1170
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,560
 -do this for a couple of weeks.

1171
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:22,560
 Yeah.

1172
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,560
 Yeah.

1173
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,460
 Let's see.

1174
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:30,360
 Upon our return, there was a package of very silly Bloodsport merch.

1175
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,360
 Like the movie?

1176
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,360
 Yes.

1177
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,360
 Like the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie?

1178
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,360
 Great.

1179
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,360
 Have you not looked in the box?

1180
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,360
 No, I haven't.

1181
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,360
 Let's see.

1182
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,360
 You had pre-ordered a while back.

1183
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:47,000
 I'm going to drop this box off of stuff at Jacob's house and try not to be super creepy

1184
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,880
 about it.

1185
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:54,120
 No, the letter is the only part of this that I've really dug into because when I found

1186
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:59,600
 a random box on my front porch, I opened it to see who had left it.

1187
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,480
 It has- Well, I mean, it has my address on the side because it's still in the shipping

1188
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,480
 box.

1189
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,480
 Oh, yeah.

1190
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:09,760
 But I broke physical scoop mails if any do on it just so you would know what it was for.

1191
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,040
 So that's why I opened it.

1192
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,200
 I didn't explore any of the more- any of the outside.

1193
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,240
 I was fine with everything.

1194
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,640
 This was all good.

1195
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,120
 There is a- what is that?

1196
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,880
 Oh, a Koumete duffel bag.

1197
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,520
 Oh, that's great.

1198
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:28,240
 For each of you and an Icelandic booze sampler for Matt and Jacob, some coffee, a couple

1199
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:35,160
 of spare fancy Icelander travel bags- Iceland Air, the airline.

1200
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,540
 Oh, Iceland Air travel bags.

1201
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:44,760
 And a while ago, Jacob and I discussed the random deal and told-

1202
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,000
 Sorry, my handwriting is really bad.

1203
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
 Oh, dead and co shirt.

1204
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
 There we go.

1205
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
 Yeah.

1206
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,360
 The random dead and co shirt that someone bought me that might be good for SJ.

1207
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:53,360
 Oh, yeah.

1208
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,800
 I pulled that out of the box and gave that to SJ.

1209
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,680
 She says, "Thank you very much.

1210
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,840
 Enjoy your no holds barred tiny- I didn't go to the show.

1211
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,520
 And so they were like, "Here's a t-shirt from this show you didn't go to of a band that

1212
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,520
 you don't care about."

1213
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,040
 And I was like, "Why?

1214
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,880
 Why did you spend money on this?"

1215
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,740
 See you next month for ScoopFest.

1216
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:11,740
 You lied about that part.

1217
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:14,280
 I saw you today on this Zoom call.

1218
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:19,280
 I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to be in one of the Zoom calls, so I didn't-

1219
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,280
 Ah.

1220
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,380
 Well, there you go.

1221
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:23,800
 Thank you very much, Sarah Boyle.

1222
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,800
 Thank you for dropping off some physical Scoop mail at the old house here.

1223
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:28,800
 Koumete bag.

1224
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,800
 I can't wait.

1225
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:30,800
 Koumete bag.

1226
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,800
 Oh, yeah.

1227
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:32,800
 Yeah, they say Koumete on them.

1228
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,800
 That's fucking A.

1229
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,800
 Yes!

1230
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:35,800
 Oh, man.

1231
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,800
 That's awesome.

1232
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,080
 You don't see it very well.

1233
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,080
 Your background filter is-

1234
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,080
 I don't.

1235
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,080
 Hold on.

1236
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,080
 I'm turning off my background filter.

1237
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,080
 It's still cool.

1238
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,080
 Yeah.

1239
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,080
 Koumete.

1240
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,080
 Koumete.

1241
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:51,520
 Just a pile of dead bodies behind Jacob when he turns off-

1242
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,520
 It's true.

1243
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,520
 Oh, man.

1244
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,520
 And Jacob can just intercept that copy if he doesn't like it.

1245
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,520
 Is it a backpack?

1246
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,520
 No, he's always complaining about not sending him a copy.

1247
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,520
 They're duffels.

1248
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:01,520
 Oh, man.

1249
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,520
 That's amazing.

1250
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,200
 That's a nice duffel, too.

1251
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:11,440
 You can use them in the airport and not set them on the ground in the bathroom, right?

1252
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,600
 Amen to that.

1253
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,600
 That's right.

1254
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:22,560
 Everybody's getting to see my real background now because I just have mirrors behind me,

1255
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:23,560
 which is why I keep-

1256
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,560
 It looks good.

1257
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,360
 It makes everything look bigger.

1258
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,760
 That's true.

1259
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:37,620
 Let's do a little Chalk vs. a Nerd.

1260
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:48,760
 Ladies and gentlemen, it is time.

1261
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:59,080
 Time for Chalk vs. Nerd.

1262
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:02,280
 It's time for the explosion of Koumete duffel bags.

1263
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:03,280
 Kaboom.

1264
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:07,080
 We've got a scooperty coming out today from HeyScoopGetOffMyLawn.

1265
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,080
 Hello, all.

1266
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:13,840
 I'm answering Jacob's call for some trivia with a scooperty and an obelisk, two for one.

1267
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:16,640
 Oh, that's a great point.

1268
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:21,720
 Some of you do send multiple scooperties and obelisks all at the same time, which is fantastic.

1269
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:22,880
 I love when you do that.

1270
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,740
 Do me a favor just to help my organization out.

1271
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,120
 Send them in two different emails.

1272
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:33,040
 Do one email per game, and that just makes it easier for me to keep up with everything.

1273
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,440
 But this is fantastic, and thank you so much for doing this.

1274
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,240
 Let's see.

1275
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,240
 Two for one.

1276
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:44,640
 I have been out of commission for a while, explaining my absence from making these things.

1277
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:48,920
 So first, a PSA, don't get shingles.

1278
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:49,920
 Just don't do it, people.

1279
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:53,240
 Let me tell you, that's the fucking truth.

1280
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,680
 I've had it twice.

1281
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:00,000
 My job has me lots of different places all the time, so there's no telling how this happened,

1282
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,360
 but I had chicken pox as a kid, and now here we are.

1283
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:06,680
 I'm past the worst of it, but dealing with the nerve damage where it infected over my

1284
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:13,560
 mouth later, I got it on my face, my mouth, and in my inner and outer ear, including my

1285
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:17,160
 eardrum, 10 out of 10 do not recommend.

1286
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,000
 Oh my God, I am so sorry.

1287
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,040
 That happened to a friend of mine with his eyes.

1288
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:30,400
 He got it on the backs of his eyes, and now if he walks outside on an overcast, cloudy

1289
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,680
 day, he still has to wear sunglasses.

1290
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:36,920
 His eyes, as a result, are extraordinarily light sensitive.

1291
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:42,520
 I know in today's America, this may be an unpopular opinion, but do get the damn vaccinations

1292
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:43,520
 for shingles.

1293
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,460
 I got it the day I turned 50.

1294
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:50,600
 I'm under 50 and never really thought much about it, but this got my wife to immediately

1295
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,360
 go and get her first shot.

1296
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:55,840
 It picks a nerve branch and screws it up when you get it.

1297
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:02,800
 I caught mine in the first 48 hours and likely shorted the worst of it and still can't survive

1298
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,760
 without nerve blockers yet.

1299
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,320
 Just very fortunate it wasn't in my eye.

1300
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,400
 There you go.

1301
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,400
 I guess there's that.

1302
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,500
 Anyway, here's an obelisk and a scooperty.

1303
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:14,440
 Enjoy it more than the shooting pain, tingling, and hot and cold feelings that I randomly

1304
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,560
 get all the time in my face.

1305
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,560
 That's Chris.

1306
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:20,520
 Hey, Scoop, get off my lawn.

1307
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,360
 So let's see here.

1308
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:26,840
 We have a scooperty coming to us from Hey, Scoop, get off my lawn.

1309
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:31,120
 I am stalling while I share it with everybody else so they can see it over here and we've

1310
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,720
 already played that.

1311
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:36,680
 Never mind.

1312
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:37,680
 Let's see.

1313
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,880
 So this is why I need multiple emails.

1314
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:47,280
 Let's see if we've already played this obelisk as well.

1315
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,480
 Yeah we have.

1316
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:54,120
 But we didn't have the full read through of the email, so that's good.

1317
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,120
 We had not had the full read through of the email.

1318
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,120
 That is true.

1319
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,120
 Yeah.

1320
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,120
 Give me one second.

1321
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:03,760
 I'm going to find us a different one from neck pubes.

1322
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:07,040
 Hey folks, I'm a proud patron and wish I could contribute more.

1323
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:11,080
 I just want to say to the people that aren't patron members, there is a lot you're missing

1324
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,640
 out on and it's worth a few extra bucks a month to have it.

1325
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:16,920
 The way I look at it, I can do gig economy work for about $20 an hour.

1326
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:21,720
 I listen to podcast while I do that, $10 can get me over 30 minutes of content so it pays

1327
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:22,720
 for itself.

1328
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:27,360
 A question I have for the churn, does it help your numbers if we download the episodes from

1329
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,360
 a different app than Patreon?

1330
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:33,160
 I've picked auto download on three separate apps in case it does.

1331
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,240
 Anyway, love you guys.

1332
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,240
 Keep it real.

1333
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,240
 Neck pubes.

1334
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,480
 And here is a scooperty that we're going to look at in just a second to make sure that

1335
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,000
 we haven't already played it.

1336
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,920
 But yes, good question neck pubes.

1337
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,600
 Yeah, I think it.

1338
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,760
 I mean the more the merrier, right?

1339
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:51,360
 If you set us to download on any app, it's going to help us out.

1340
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:58,160
 So when in doubt, set this show to download and it will be groovy.

1341
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,640
 And I have found a scooperty that we haven't played yet.

1342
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,680
 Let me just play the little production meeting.

1343
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:03,680
 Great.

1344
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:06,680
 That's that's the machine.

1345
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:11,560
 The categories are the first, the most, the last and the least.

1346
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,080
 Paul, you're up first.

1347
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:14,800
 What you want?

1348
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:18,840
 I will take the last for 400.

1349
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:30,720
 Which of these three car brands was the last to produce cars, Oldsmobile, Pontiac or Saturn?

1350
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:34,480
 So this means this question is asking who produced a car?

1351
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,880
 Who went out of business last?

1352
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,040
 Who went out of business last?

1353
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,600
 OK, that's what I was looking for.

1354
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:43,560
 Yeah.

1355
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,600
 I think it's Oldsmobile.

1356
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:46,600
 Let's try it.

1357
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:52,020
 Pontiac was 2010, Saturn was 2009, Oldsmobile was 2004.

1358
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:56,360
 If you're keeping track, that means that Paul got it as wrong as he possibly could have.

1359
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,360
 That's right.

1360
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,560
 I got it backwards wrong.

1361
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:00,560
 Let's see here.

1362
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:03,280
 I'm just going to mute that person who is not muted.

1363
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,280
 Great.

1364
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,280
 Moving on.

1365
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,840
 Matt Donnelly, what would you like?

1366
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:13,960
 I would like to take the first, since I'm the second one going.

1367
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:15,760
 The first for 400.

1368
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:20,560
 Which of these platforms was released first, Twitter, TikTok or YouTube?

1369
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,800
 Oh, man.

1370
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:27,080
 I'll go with YouTube.

1371
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:30,440
 YouTube is correct.

1372
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:36,480
 Twitter was 2006, TikTok was 2016, YouTube was 2005.

1373
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,120
 Well done, Matt Donnelly.

1374
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:40,880
 I'll try the most for 400.

1375
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,760
 Which of these sports leagues have the most teams named after birds?

1376
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:48,800
 Oh, the NFL, the MLB or the NBA.

1377
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,240
 All right.

1378
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,240
 Bird time.

1379
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,040
 I think we've had a version of this question before.

1380
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,840
 I'm pretty sure we have.

1381
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:59,920
 I don't think it's Major League Baseball.

1382
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,240
 I'm just going to kick them right out.

1383
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:06,200
 Oh, I think that's the one that it is, Jacob.

1384
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:12,900
 This is where Paul does his subtle hints to help.

1385
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:15,520
 I can't think of any bird named teams in baseball.

1386
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:16,520
 In baseball?

1387
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:17,520
 The Blue Jays?

1388
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:18,520
 The Orioles?

1389
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:19,520
 The Cardinals?

1390
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,520
 Okay.

1391
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:24,280
 Other than those three though, I can't think of any bird teams in Major League Baseball.

1392
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,440
 The Reds.

1393
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,480
 The Reds are birds?

1394
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:29,480
 The New York Jets.

1395
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:30,480
 The Nickerbockers.

1396
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:31,480
 The Raptors.

1397
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:35,560
 Those are just pants.

1398
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:38,800
 Don't tell me the Raptors aren't birds because dinosaurs are birds.

1399
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,800
 Okay.

1400
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:40,800
 I'll give you dinosaurs.

1401
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:41,800
 The Wizards?

1402
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:57,960
 The NBA has the Hawks, the Pelicans, the Raptors, the NFL has the Cardinals, the Eagles.

1403
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:58,960
 Maybe it is baseball.

1404
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,460
 I think it is, but I can't remember.

1405
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:01,460
 They got three.

1406
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:02,460
 Yeah.

1407
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:04,520
 Is there another one in the NFL that I'm not thinking of?

1408
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,040
 We got the Cardinals and the Eagles.

1409
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:07,040
 The Ravens.

1410
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,040
 The Ravens.

1411
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,180
 So that's three for NFL.

1412
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:10,660
 The Murderbirds?

1413
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:11,660
 The Murderbirds.

1414
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:12,660
 The Hawks?

1415
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:14,840
 Is there a Hawk team?

1416
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:15,840
 Yeah.

1417
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:16,840
 That's NBA.

1418
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:17,840
 Atlanta Hawks.

1419
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:21,240
 The NBA has the Pelicans, the Hawks.

1420
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:22,240
 Shit.

1421
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:30,160
 I've got three for baseball and three for football.

1422
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,840
 I got to be missing one in there somewhere.

1423
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:32,840
 I'm going to say football.

1424
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:33,840
 I'll say the NFL.

1425
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:36,480
 It is the NFL.

1426
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:37,480
 Five.

1427
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,480
 Major League Baseball has three.

1428
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:39,480
 So we named all of those.

1429
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,600
 Oh, and NBA has two.

1430
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,600
 Three.

1431
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,600
 If you chubby the Raptors.

1432
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:44,600
 Yeah.

1433
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,600
 Which we do.

1434
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,600
 We're Raptors.

1435
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:47,600
 Paul.

1436
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:48,600
 Seahawks.

1437
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:49,600
 Seahawks.

1438
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:52,600
 Oh, that's another good one.

1439
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,600
 Oh yeah.

1440
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:54,600
 They're the Osprey.

1441
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,640
 I think that's the bird that the Seahawk refers to.

1442
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:57,640
 I'll take.

1443
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:58,640
 So that's four.

1444
01:07:58,640 --> 01:07:59,640
 Who's that?

1445
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:00,640
 I'll take the last again.

1446
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:01,640
 The Dolphins.

1447
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:02,640
 That's it.

1448
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,640
 The Dolphins.

1449
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:04,640
 The Dolphins.

1450
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:05,640
 Chicken of the sea.

1451
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:06,640
 Yep.

1452
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:07,640
 Daily double.

1453
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:08,640
 Losing.

1454
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:13,760
 Which of these NFL players was the last to retire?

1455
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:19,680
 John Elway, Emmett Smith or Deon Sanders.

1456
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:20,680
 Emmett Smith.

1457
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,680
 Emmett Smith is correct.

1458
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:26,120
 Retired in 2004.

1459
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,280
 Sanders retired in '01.

1460
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,440
 Elway retired in '99.

1461
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:30,440
 Yeah.

1462
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,440
 Matt.

1463
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:36,040
 I will do the last for 1200.

1464
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:37,580
 The last.

1465
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:40,080
 Which Stooge was the first to die?

1466
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,080
 Last.

1467
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:42,080
 Larry Fine.

1468
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,080
 Last did I.

1469
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,080
 Sorry.

1470
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,080
 Larry Fine.

1471
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,080
 Moe Howard.

1472
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,080
 Curly Howard.

1473
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,080
 Pass.

1474
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,080
 Shit.

1475
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,680
 That's me.

1476
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:51,680
 I think Larry.

1477
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:52,680
 Oh wait.

1478
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:53,680
 Did Larry die?

1479
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:54,680
 No.

1480
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:55,680
 I think Moe died earlier.

1481
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:56,680
 Stooge to die.

1482
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:57,680
 The first is Stooge to die.

1483
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:58,680
 I think Moe died earlier.

1484
01:08:58,680 --> 01:08:59,680
 I think Curly.

1485
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:03,560
 I'm going to say Curly.

1486
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:04,560
 The last.

1487
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,560
 Shit.

1488
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:06,560
 It was.

1489
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:07,620
 God damn it.

1490
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:09,240
 It was Larry.

1491
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,880
 It was Larry and I knew that too and I was still thinking the first.

1492
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:12,880
 God damn it.

1493
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,400
 He was living in the Hollywood retirement home.

1494
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:16,400
 It's true.

1495
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,000
 He was the last of the Stooges to die.

1496
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
 Yeah.

1497
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,400
 He famously lived in that Hollywood retirement home.

1498
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:21,400
 That's right.

1499
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:22,400
 Oh, that's me.

1500
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:26,520
 I guess I'll do the last for 2000 since I just lost all those points.

1501
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:35,240
 It's a Tom Bergeron has lots of stories about as a kid, he wrote letters to Larry Fine and

1502
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:39,320
 Moe Howard and actually becoming like pen pals and talk to them and stuff.

1503
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:42,280
 We'll call them on the phone and stuff too.

1504
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:43,280
 Yeah.

1505
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,280
 Oh nice.

1506
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:47,320
 Which retail chain was the last to close its final location?

1507
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:51,400
 Kmart, Sears, or Toys R Us?

1508
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:54,600
 That's a tough one.

1509
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,840
 I think there's still some Sears aren't there?

1510
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,200
 I think Sears is gone.

1511
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,200
 Is it?

1512
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,200
 I think so.

1513
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:07,120
 I kind of think Kmart was the last to close up.

1514
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,120
 I don't know.

1515
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:12,160
 Because I think Toys R Us, when Toys R Us closed, like they shut all of those down pretty

1516
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:13,160
 quick.

1517
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,160
 Yeah.

1518
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:16,420
 And I think it was very similar with Sears.

1519
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:19,040
 I'm going to say Kmart.

1520
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:22,000
 It is Kmart, October 24.

1521
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
 Jesus Christ.

1522
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
 Whoa.

1523
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,760
 Sears, 22.

1524
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:26,920
 And Toys R Us, 21.

1525
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,840
 I didn't even realize Sears was gone.

1526
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:31,280
 Yeah, Sears has been gone for a little bit.

1527
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,280
 That's crazy.

1528
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:35,760
 That's because you never bought Craftsman tools.

1529
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:38,000
 But I used to just go to Sears all the time.

1530
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,840
 I don't know what to tell you.

1531
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:41,840
 Paul.

1532
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:42,840
 All right.

1533
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:45,920
 It's gone, buddy.

1534
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,680
 The most, please.

1535
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:49,320
 The most for 800.

1536
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:56,600
 Which of these pies sells the most in the USA, apple, pecan, or pumpkin?

1537
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,760
 I mean, we say it's as American as apple pie.

1538
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,120
 I say that all the time.

1539
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:06,720
 But I got to believe pecan and pumpkin got a hotter business.

1540
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:09,280
 I'm going to go pumpkin.

1541
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,280
 Okay.

1542
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:11,280
 It's apple.

1543
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:12,280
 Ass.

1544
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,760
 29% of all pie sales.

1545
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,160
 Pumpkin number two, 23%.

1546
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:18,680
 Pecan coming up at the end, 9%.

1547
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:21,720
 I got to tell you, you people are missing out on some pecan pie.

1548
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:24,000
 I got October brain going on.

1549
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
 Yeah, you do.

1550
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
 I'm already in spooky season.

1551
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:33,880
 As soon as we flip to August, I'm like, "Ooh, ghosts and shit."

1552
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:36,040
 The last for 400.

1553
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:37,240
 The least, I mean.

1554
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:38,240
 The least for 400.

1555
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:39,240
 Daily double.

1556
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:40,240
 Yes, let's go.

1557
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:43,320
 This is where I strike.

1558
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:46,760
 Which of these three states has the least religious affiliation?

1559
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:49,960
 Vermont, New Hampshire, or Washington?

1560
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,600
 New Hampshire.

1561
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,000
 New Hampshire?

1562
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
 It's Vermont.

1563
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,840
 Only 63% of citizens claim religious affiliation.

1564
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:03,520
 New Hampshire is 64, and Washington, 68.

1565
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:04,520
 Those heathens.

1566
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,520
 You were close.

1567
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,520
 Those dirty.

1568
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:07,520
 Those heathens.

1569
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,520
 Those Vermont heathens.

1570
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:10,920
 Those syrup-chugging heathens.

1571
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,520
 I'll try the least for 800.

1572
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:14,080
 Syrup-chugging heathens.

1573
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:18,320
 Which of these states has the least trees per square mile?

1574
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:24,280
 North Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska.

1575
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:28,160
 I mean, here's the thing.

1576
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:35,440
 I'm going to say Nebraska, and I'm going to tell you why, because they got all that farmland.

1577
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,440
 They got so much farm there.

1578
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,960
 Same thing with Iowa, though.

1579
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:39,960
 I agree.

1580
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:40,960
 I agree.

1581
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:41,960
 But I'm going to go with Nebraska.

1582
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:45,200
 I feel like they've got more farmland per capita than Iowa does.

1583
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:46,720
 Maybe I'm wrong.

1584
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:47,720
 Nope.

1585
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:49,240
 I'm just wrong all around.

1586
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:52,680
 It's North Dakota.

1587
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:54,640
 North Dakota was the correct answer.

1588
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,200
 I was just out.

1589
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:57,200
 Paul?

1590
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:01,120
 I will take the most for 2,000.

1591
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,120
 Oh.

1592
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,940
 Which of these celebrities is the tallest?

1593
01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:09,520
 Alfred Hitchcock, Eminem, or Bob Villa?

1594
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,880
 Hitchcock.

1595
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:11,880
 Joke's on you.

1596
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:15,160
 I just had a party with Hitchcock, Eminem, and Bob Villa the other day.

1597
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:16,240
 Same height.

1598
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:17,240
 Same height precisely.

1599
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:19,440
 Bob Villa was the tallest.

1600
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:23,840
 5'9", Hitchcock, 5'7", Eminem, 5'8".

1601
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,400
 Man.

1602
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:28,040
 Burned by Bob Villa again.

1603
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,240
 How's that feel, Paul?

1604
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:32,200
 Will it never end?

1605
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,440
 Matt?

1606
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:37,840
 The most, 1,200, please.

1607
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:43,440
 Which of the countries read the most in a week per capita, Denmark, India, or the United

1608
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,440
 States?

1609
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:45,440
 No.

1610
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,440
 Oh, sorry.

1611
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,280
 United States right out.

1612
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:49,280
 No.

1613
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,280
 Yeah.

1614
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:55,400
 Is it Denmark, the one where they do the Christmas Eve, give each other a book, and you go hide

1615
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,440
 and read it all night?

1616
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:58,440
 Yeah.

1617
01:13:58,440 --> 01:13:59,440
 Sure.

1618
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:00,440
 Yeah.

1619
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,680
 And then if you catch, if they find you in your reading spot, you have to hit them with

1620
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:04,680
 a sandal.

1621
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:05,680
 Right.

1622
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:06,680
 Yeah.

1623
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:07,680
 That's the tradition.

1624
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:08,680
 I'll pass.

1625
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:12,360
 Hit them with a sandal.

1626
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:16,240
 Passes to me, countries read, I'll guess India.

1627
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,240
 India.

1628
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:18,240
 Let's try India.

1629
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:19,240
 They got a lot of people.

1630
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:21,040
 I know that's not per capita, but whatever.

1631
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,040
 India is the right answer.

1632
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:26,120
 10 hours, 42 minutes, Denmark is still higher than the U.S.

1633
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,120
 Well, yes.

1634
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,120
 Yeah.

1635
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:30,760
 So you were correct about who had the least, Matt.

1636
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:31,760
 Great.

1637
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:32,760
 Yeah.

1638
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:33,760
 It's me.

1639
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,160
 I'll try the least for 1,200.

1640
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:38,960
 Which of these states has the least domestic pigs?

1641
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,800
 Now, wait a minute.

1642
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:50,400
 Does that mean the lowest amount of domestic pigs or the amount of pigs that are not well

1643
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,400
 domesticated?

1644
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,400
 I think it's the second one.

1645
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:56,400
 I think it's how many, which of them have the least domesticated pigs?

1646
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,640
 I like to wipe my ass on the couch.

1647
01:14:58,640 --> 01:14:59,640
 Exactly.

1648
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:00,640
 I'm not very domesticated.

1649
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:01,640
 Rhode Island, Maine or Delaware.

1650
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:04,320
 I'm the least domesticated pig you'll meet.

1651
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:11,280
 I mean, Rhode Island just has to be a trick answer there, right?

1652
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:12,280
 Who knows?

1653
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:13,280
 Who can say it with this game?

1654
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:16,200
 Rhode Island is my little state, so you want me to pick Rhode Island because they don't

1655
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:19,040
 have the least domestic pigs because they're so small anyway.

1656
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,560
 Well, I'm not going to do it.

1657
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:24,120
 I am going to say Delaware.

1658
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:27,120
 So go fuck yourself.

1659
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,920
 Delaware is the correct answer.

1660
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:32,920
 Oh, I just gamed your game, only 300,000.

1661
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:34,560
 Now what do they mean by domestic pigs?

1662
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:35,560
 Pigs are far?

1663
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:37,000
 You know everything that I do, Paul.

1664
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
 It's your turn.

1665
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,960
 I'll go with the least.

1666
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:44,160
 For 2,000.

1667
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:47,960
 Which of these states has the least human limbs per capita?

1668
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:52,640
 Hint, it has the most amputees, Indiana, South Dakota or Louisiana.

1669
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:57,800
 Oh, by the way, there is a player who is signed to an NFL team right now who has six fingers

1670
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:05,400
 on one hand, making the average amount of fingers that an NFL player has more than five.

1671
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:09,480
 Wow, which is exciting.

1672
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:14,760
 Jason Pierre-Paul, who only has nine fingers because he blew one of them off, I think in

1673
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:18,440
 a fireworks accident, he's not currently in the NFL.

1674
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:22,280
 So the fact that there is one player with 11 fingers and everybody else has 10, the

1675
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:25,000
 average is above 10 now, which is wonderful.

1676
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
 Wow.

1677
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,440
 What do you think, Paul, Louisiana, Indiana or South Dakota?

1678
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,080
 Indiana, please.

1679
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:35,080
 Indiana has the least limbs.

1680
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,560
 I'm sorry.

1681
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:37,560
 It's Louisiana.

1682
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:40,520
 I have no data for any other states.

1683
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,640
 It's just something that Louisiana is proud of.

1684
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,640
 Well, they don't call it the big easy to lose your hands in for nothing.

1685
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:47,640
 That's right.

1686
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:48,640
 That's right.

1687
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:49,640
 That is the full name.

1688
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:50,640
 Yeah.

1689
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,640
 Matt, you got the first for 800, 1200 or 2,000.

1690
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,160
 What are the scores right now?

1691
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,960
 You have zero points.

1692
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:55,960
 Perfect.

1693
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:56,960
 I have 2,800 points.

1694
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:57,960
 I am in the lead.

1695
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:01,920
 Paul is in a distant third place with negative 4,400.

1696
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:04,040
 So it's anyone's game.

1697
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,040
 Anyone's game.

1698
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,040
 Except Paul.

1699
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:09,200
 I'll go with the first for 2,000.

1700
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,920
 All right.

1701
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:13,720
 Which of these three movies came out first?

1702
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:17,240
 Lethal Weapon, RoboCop, Princess Bride.

1703
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:20,320
 Oh man.

1704
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:24,080
 I'm right back in like grade school for all of these.

1705
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,080
 Yeah.

1706
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:29,760
 I remember begging to see RoboCop with my older brothers.

1707
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:30,760
 Okay.

1708
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:38,760
 Because it was because then Princess Bride, I definitely watched it in grade school like

1709
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:41,800
 that was that was okay to watch in the school movie.

1710
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:46,320
 All right, man.

1711
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:49,000
 I don't these all feel like the same time.

1712
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,480
 I got nothing.

1713
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:52,480
 I'm gonna pass.

1714
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:57,420
 I passed the me shit.

1715
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:06,560
 Princess Bride is 80s RoboCop is also 80s, but Lethal Weapon is 80s.

1716
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,240
 You've cracked the code, son.

1717
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,680
 So you see how I'm doing my math out loud.

1718
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:16,360
 I am aware of your mathematicals.

1719
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:17,760
 I think it's RoboCop.

1720
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,680
 I think RoboCop was early 80s.

1721
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:22,640
 I think Princess Bride is later feels right to me.

1722
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:25,680
 I'm not sure when Lethal Weapon is but I would guess like mid to late 80s.

1723
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:28,200
 I'm gonna say RoboCop.

1724
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,200
 It's Lethal Weapon.

1725
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:30,200
 Oh shit.

1726
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,200
 I was wrong about all.

1727
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,200
 Oh god damn it.

1728
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,200
 This is one of these.

1729
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:36,880
 They were all 1987.

1730
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:41,320
 Lethal Weapon was March RoboCop was July Princess Bride was October.

1731
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:42,320
 Wow.

1732
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,320
 They were close.

1733
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:44,540
 I right on the head.

1734
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:51,040
 Can you imagine a year where we had those three movies in the same year?

1735
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:52,040
 1987.

1736
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:54,840
 Yes, but like that's easy.

1737
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,960
 Just imagine 1987.

1738
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,680
 I just didn't know nothing like that happens now.

1739
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:00,680
 I don't know.

1740
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:01,680
 I don't know.

1741
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:02,680
 Let's see.

1742
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:03,680
 I'll try the first.

1743
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:04,680
 Oh, let's see.

1744
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:05,680
 Where am I here?

1745
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:08,560
 I have 800 points now.

1746
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,520
 So 800 is enough to get me there.

1747
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:15,600
 The first for 800 among these three countries which was the first to learn about the good

1748
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:23,640
 news of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, Ireland, Poland, India.

1749
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:24,640
 Let's see.

1750
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:28,120
 Brogan did you hear about Jesus before Poland or India did?

1751
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:33,520
 Fuck you Jacob.

1752
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:39,600
 Brogan the self-hating Irishman.

1753
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,040
 Who was the first to hear about it?

1754
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,200
 Poland, India or Ireland?

1755
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,560
 I mean Ireland is right there.

1756
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:54,080
 It's very close to several countries that really dug on Jesus Christ.

1757
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:56,600
 He got rid of them snakes.

1758
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:57,600
 That's right.

1759
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,600
 India.

1760
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,800
 I know we got to India.

1761
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:01,800
 I don't fucking know.

1762
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:02,880
 Paul, I'm passing.

1763
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,880
 I'll guess Ireland.

1764
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:05,880
 Let's try it.

1765
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:06,880
 It's India.

1766
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:07,880
 52 AD.

1767
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,560
 Ireland was 431 AD.

1768
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,800
 Poland was 966 AD.

1769
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,680
 Poland held out for a long time.

1770
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:18,160
 Paul closing out the category and the game the first for 1200.

1771
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,600
 Here I go.

1772
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:23,280
 Which of these three candy bars were released first?

1773
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:27,480
 Baby Ruth, Three Musketeers or the Milky Way?

1774
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:29,920
 Here's my math.

1775
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:34,520
 Nougat is a scheme.

1776
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:40,400
 Why is it that all of Paul's math involves nougat?

1777
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:43,240
 It's like they call it the nougat math.

1778
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:46,960
 I don't understand the nougat math with these kids today.

1779
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:52,200
 I'm going to go with Baby Ruth.

1780
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:53,200
 Okay.

1781
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,200
 Let's see it.

1782
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,200
 It is Baby Ruth 1921.

1783
01:20:56,200 --> 01:21:03,200
 Milky Way was 1923, Three Musketeers 1932.

1784
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:10,000
 Paul got that question absolutely right, which pushes him all the way up to third place with

1785
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,320
 negative 4,000 points.

1786
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:14,240
 Matt's in second place with a big old goose egg.

1787
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,320
 That's zero points.

1788
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:20,840
 And I'm in first place with an impressive score of 800.

1789
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:22,760
 We crushed it.

1790
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:26,880
 We tow that scooperty up from the flow on up.

1791
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:28,400
 Thank you so much, neck pubes.

1792
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:32,800
 If you want to send us a scooperty or a price of Skrite Jock versus Nerd or an Obelisk Jock

1793
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:38,880
 versus Nerd, or just send us some scoop mail over there, head over to HayScoops.com right

1794
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:39,880
 there on the homepage.

1795
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:40,880
 You can send us some scoop mail.

1796
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,480
 You can do all those things, HayScoops.com.

1797
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:44,480
 Do it now.

1798
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:49,560
 We're running low on scooperties, Jock versus Nerds, all the Jock versus Nerds.

1799
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:51,080
 We're just running a little low on them.

1800
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:55,320
 Head over there and do that little thing.

1801
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:56,320
 Thank you so much if you do.

1802
01:21:56,320 --> 01:22:00,000
 I want to thank all the scoops who got to join us today on today's Zoom call.

1803
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,400
 I want to thank all the people who are watching us on Twitch.

1804
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:09,320
 And I want to thank all the people who support us over, oh no, it's an invasion.

1805
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:10,600
 What's happening?

1806
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:11,600
 We've been invaded.

1807
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:12,600
 What?

1808
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,640
 Look who's on the Zoom.

1809
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:15,640
 It's Brian Brushwood.

1810
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:16,640
 Oh my God.

1811
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:17,720
 I thought there was maybe somebody else.

1812
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:19,440
 I was really confused there for a second.

1813
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:20,440
 I'm sorry.

1814
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:23,080
 I'm taking client meetings here.

1815
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:25,480
 What can I help you guys with?

1816
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:31,400
 I'm drawing charts and graphs and by God, how do you Zoom people do this?

1817
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:33,280
 You just Zoom all day.

1818
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:37,520
 It's not casting, but only one person's listening and then you don't get to run ads on it after

1819
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:38,520
 the fact.

1820
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:42,240
 That, doing the classes, the worst thing we've ever done.

1821
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:43,400
 You know what I got now?

1822
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:44,400
 Clients.

1823
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,640
 You know what I'm wearing right now?

1824
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:48,240
 A fucking white collared shirt.

1825
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:50,680
 The fuck is wrong with this world?

1826
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:51,680
 Sellout.

1827
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:52,680
 Yeah.

1828
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:53,680
 I'm working on it.

1829
01:22:53,680 --> 01:23:01,840
 You know, it's even worse is you're about to get your ass handed to you at scoop fest

1830
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,040
 when we do the trivia battle.

1831
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:05,880
 So it's even harder day than you thought.

1832
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,440
 Hang your head in shame.

1833
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:15,280
 That is 100% the truth and everyone knows this.

1834
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:19,560
 Also I can't help but notice the room that Brian is sitting in.

1835
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:20,560
 Brian is in my house.

1836
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:23,560
 Brian is on the other end of my house right now.

1837
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:30,160
 Which only makes me a bigger asshole for missing the bulk of the program because I'm sitting

1838
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:36,360
 here like, oh yes, and this and well, the time we did it on the podcast, we did it like

1839
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,360
 ah.

1840
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:43,720
 Even more while you're racking up dick points, Brian, you were at the Orleans and did not

1841
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:44,720
 text me.

1842
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:45,720
 Yeah.

1843
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:46,720
 You know what?

1844
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:53,920
 I was too busy getting cornered by Michael Webber smirking his face off because he has

1845
01:23:53,920 --> 01:24:00,000
 thoughts about because he's the fucking magic police and he's got opinions of what is good

1846
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
 to teach people.

1847
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
 Yes.

1848
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
 Sorry.

1849
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,480
 I didn't text.

1850
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:14,000
 I was waiting for this moment, but client meetings pushed it.

1851
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:19,200
 I was working in my backyard yesterday and Brian gets back from doing all of the things

1852
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,900
 that Brian is doing in town.

1853
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:26,320
 He walks into the backyard in slacks and a button down shirt and I didn't know what to

1854
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,320
 do with myself.

1855
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:33,000
 Well, first of all, SJ yelped and I made a joke, I'm like, I'm just here to check the

1856
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
 meter.

1857
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:41,280
 But the strangest thing happened because I walked in and obviously a lot of landscaping

1858
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:46,240
 was happening, a bunch of garden stuff and I see Jacob is edging the lawn and then I

1859
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:52,160
 look over, I talked to SJ and then my eye drifts down to a patch of Astro turf.

1860
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:58,000
 And then I follow the Astro turf over and I see the feet that Jacob is standing on,

1861
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:03,820
 on the Astro turf and I golden retriever my head a little bit as I try to consider why

1862
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:05,800
 is he edging the Astro turf?

1863
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:10,680
 And then I realized that's not an edger, he's pressure washing and we had a delightful conversation

1864
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,360
 about pressure washers.

1865
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:13,360
 We did.

1866
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,360
 We did.

1867
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:17,960
 I had just gotten through pressure washing several tons of rock when when Brian came

1868
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:20,120
 outside.

1869
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:24,200
 Brian because we I won't announce it on air but off air remind me to tell you that two

1870
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:28,840
 very high profile people got kicked out of magic life for wearing fake badges just to

1871
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:33,920
 go into the dealer's room.

1872
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:34,920
 That's okay.

1873
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:38,880
 I actually really that I'll tell you what, man, this is one of those things where it's

1874
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:43,980
 like if you become a high enough profile person, you better get legit because I used to I used

1875
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:48,740
 to be a hacker, pirater and stuff swimming on all the pirate days.

1876
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:52,600
 And then I started hosting a show with Tom Barrett called Cord Killers about how to watch

1877
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:55,720
 what you want when you want on streaming services.

1878
01:25:55,720 --> 01:26:01,640
 And I realized how long how long until somebody rings the hypocrite bell on this.

1879
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:05,120
 And so I had I had to give up all of that unsavory behavior.

1880
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,120
 Yeah.

1881
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:07,120
 Yeah.

1882
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:13,860
 I mean, these guys should have done the same and if not, you heard it here first, Penn

1883
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:23,560
 and Teller kicked out of magic life, apparently they were recognized, actually, magic dragon

1884
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:28,600
 kicked out of magic live with his fake badge and magic suit in a bit to make it totally

1885
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:29,600
 hypocritical.

1886
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:35,680
 Well, one pen has no interest in going and tell her actually usually gets a VIP access

1887
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:41,760
 to the to the room before anyone else goes to just to walk Teller in and walk him around.

1888
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,240
 They do the same thing Copperfield and Blaine.

1889
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:45,240
 I met David.

1890
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:46,640
 I met David Blaine this year.

1891
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:47,800
 Oh, that's nice.

1892
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:49,880
 Met is a strong word.

1893
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:53,600
 I greeted David Blaine this year.

1894
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:59,280
 But yeah, anyhow, super fun, Brian, so glad that this is the only way we're seeing each

1895
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:00,280
 other while you're in.

1896
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:03,120
 No, I'm going to be here all week.

1897
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:07,680
 I insist that we meet up in person in fact, as a matter of fact, I'm going to go as soon

1898
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:08,680
 as we're done here.

1899
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:11,240
 I'm going to go to the Orleans, but I guess you won't be around.

1900
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:13,640
 I won't.

1901
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:18,960
 My festival is over.

1902
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:21,680
 My convention is complete.

1903
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:25,560
 So there are on the on the Las Vegas strip billboards all over the place.

1904
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:30,400
 There's all of these new ads being run about reporting cybercrime.

1905
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:35,720
 There's all these things there's like a Terminator cowboy on these electronic billboards like

1906
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:40,880
 if you know of someone committing cybercrime, scan this QR code and report them.

1907
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:45,160
 And we're standing outside last night looking at these billboards trying to figure it out

1908
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:47,320
 and why these billboards were there.

1909
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:50,800
 And then I finally realized, wait, DEF CON is happening this week.

1910
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:51,800
 Yep.

1911
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:55,560
 And I was like, Brian is staying in my house because DEF CON is happening this week.

1912
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:57,060
 I should know this.

1913
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:58,800
 That QR code is suspicious because of that.

1914
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:01,100
 I was about to say, right?

1915
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:02,400
 Talk about a honey pot there.

1916
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:06,840
 I will not be scanning any QR codes this week.

1917
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:11,920
 I would not be engaging my Wi-Fi anytime this week if you're anywhere around that.

1918
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:12,920
 Sorry.

1919
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:16,200

 You invented it, Jacob.

1955
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,160
 I'm surprised you can't remember it.

1956
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:35,360
 Well, you know, it's so much joy and positivity that goes into creating those QR codes, those

 custom codes for our discount people over there at the Orleans.

1958

 SCFI, I don't know what the I is.

1972
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:18,520
 It's for September.

1973
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:19,520
 Oh, September.

1974
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:20,520
 That makes sense.

01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:22,520
 Yeah.

1977
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:23,520
