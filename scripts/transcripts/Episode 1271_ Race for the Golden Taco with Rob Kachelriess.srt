1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Oh

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,840
 Hello there, I didn't see you there, but I'm so happy you're here

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,640
 I would like to thank the ice cream truck drivers. Thank you so much ice cream truck drivers

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,900
 I'm recording this episode in the past, so I don't have a new list yet

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,520
 But thank you to each and every ice cream truck driver out there who knows by the time this goes out

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,960
 I might have added the ice cream truck driver names in

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,280
 Knows anything anymore. I think we should maybe do that for these day. Yeah, we're gonna try and do that

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:33,960
 We're never gonna try and do that if you want to be an ice cream truck driver, and I hope you do preaching fun dot coms

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,500
 We can go preaching fun.com head over there sign up to be an ice cream truck driver, and who knows the life you save

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,080
 Maybe your own

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:51,960
 Here's a program hey Johnny. Do you want to go to an ice cream social? Yeah? I'd love to great

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,240
 Let's go appear guys, and I'm sweaty. I'm fresh for my kids Christmas

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:08,760
 70s out there is it oh, it's it's obviously too warm

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:15,800
 It's time for that Maddly's ice cream social sitting over there a sweaty pool of his own mess

15
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,200
 That's Matt Donnelly singing Pittsburgh. It's automatically in Vegas. It's me Jacob the audio guy. We're preaching fun

16
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,320
 Yeah, this is week

17
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:29,280
 Three for me where we've had snow and I can't go out

18
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,800
 It's fucking freezing cold, and I can't go out and clean up the backyard from the dog poop and with four dogs

19
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,720
 Pooping all the time. It's a lot of dog poop

20
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:45,160
 And so when I go out to do anything in the yard like change up bird seed or anything that Anne needs me to do

21
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,800
 So I try to stay the hell out of the backyard when there's nothing but dog poop, and it's freezing

22
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:55,680
 I have to come back in and spend another ten minutes cleaning my shoes off from all the skank that gets on my shoes

23
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,440
 I'm trying super careful. I try to dodge it like landmines. I can't miss it

24
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:05,600
 If you have there's an amount of dog poop in your backyard that it is impossible for you to walk around it

25
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:13,000
 It's close because they like that area that leads right up to always one spot. It's kind of makes more kind of a zone

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. No the entirety of my backyard is not filled with dog shit

27
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:23,560
 I'm like, holy Jesus man. How often are you cleaning? I'm cleaning every week, but this is two weeks in a row

28
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,000
 I haven't been able to so right. It's a lot. It's a backup, but it's also frozen

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,280
 So what are you gonna do? I got to invest in some new fucking boots

30
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,320
 But yeah here I am start a business of frozen dog poop pickup for other people's houses

31
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,720
 Gross. Yeah. No, thanks. Did I tell you guys actually had a couple kids come by?

32
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,680
 Back when we got our first like three inch hit and they just rang the doorbell. Hey, can we clean your driveway off?

33
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,240
 Yeah, I'll give you a three inch hit right now. They said can we clean your driveway off for a little bit of money?

34
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,440
 I said hey house 20 bucks. They're like, let's get it. Let's do it and they did it and it saved my fucking hole

35
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,760
 It's like this is amazing. This is the

36
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,660
 America I'm telling you this is what it's all about. But here I am

37
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:11,320
 Freezing my took us off and then I read Vegas is having record high temperatures. Oh record highs

38
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,600
 Yes, so while you're in the middle of a triple volt

39
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,400
 polar vortex yes is

40
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:24,120
 Which is a very rare event, but it's caused all of the Arctic atmosphere to moot descend upon your your town

41
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,080
 Descend upon rural, Pennsylvania. We are slowly building an El Nino over here

42
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,960
 Which is creating warming temperatures and bringing them over here to create one of the most warm and dry

43
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,860
 Decembers in Vegas history. Yeah, it's the combo you want. Yeah

44
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:49,300
 So this this Saturday love it dry El Nino or El Nino. I forget which one creates it warm El Nino

45
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,180
 Versus the polar vortex the battle for the century

46
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,360
 Let's go

47
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:03,680
 Warm and dry was actually the original name of Matt Mattingly and it is the primary designation for the kind of sex robot

48
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,420
 You want that is, you know, the first and foremost is it warm and dry?

49
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,120
 just torso and

50
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,140
 Torso warm and dry torso by Matt. I

51
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:22,320
 Just I just got back from my kids Christmas concert, and I say concert because basically say my air quotes

52
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,040
 yes, because this is a music program and

53
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,800
 a couple things one is that this year out of nowhere someone started a

54
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,460
 Cheerleading program at the school to teach kids how to cheer. I

55
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,480
 Thought you're gonna during the showcase. There was some kind of weird

56
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:47,160
 We're sitting there. Go music. Go music go music. I don't know

57
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:54,040
 So that's it. So they never have had a cheerleading program before no, no, no, but it's important to teach

58
00:04:54,040 --> 00:05:00,220
 Coeds first through fifth grade. I believe it was all girls in it. I did not see a boy in it

59
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,720
 They were gonna they were gonna make it coed, but they decided that Matt's son would be too good

60
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:13,520
 Another thing as soon as they say they didn't want to well Keillor's the kid cheer captain now, right? I mean that's that's cool

61
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,760
 He was going up on you Paul Keillor's growing up on you, buddy

62
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,120
 He's not in that school anymore. Keillor's gonna come back and be the coach. He's in a different school

63
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:30,960
 Yeah, oh no, baby's baby's getting old I got it wrong as that yeah La Nina not El Nino

64
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,280
 Yeah, is that a

65
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,200
 Directional wind declination. What's the difference? I'll give you a directional wind

66
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:49,000
 Is a Madonna title, right? Yeah, it's like El Nino. Yeah

67
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,280
 and so before

68
00:05:52,280 --> 00:06:00,880
 Before the concert was to begin we had to do 15 minutes of just watching them do cheers for cheering sake

69
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,560
 Do cheering was it at least Christmas theme cheers? Nope

70
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:17,360
 You just watched children just go like yo be aggressive be

71
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,320
 Aggressive. Yes

72
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:25,140
 Like just watch that for 15 minutes. I would categorize this as like a sneak attack, right? Like the parents are gathered

73
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,200
 Yeah, no one knows about this truly program of audience

74
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:35,300
 This is a violation of the Geneva Convention and then I'm like, but I got you guys all hyped up right? I mean

75
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:44,300
 Sweaty right I said I spent walk 25 minutes home. I was so pumped. I

76
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,760
 Think this thing is working

77
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:53,280
 Yeah, no, you're right. You're right. Cuz basically once once that bumped the concert time. I was like, well now

78
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,280
 I'm not gonna make ice cream social on time

79
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,640
 I was like basically I waited the one part that I knew my kid had

80
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,560
 Watched it and was like snuck out the back and then great was like I'm gonna walk home so that my wife can see

81
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,560
 The whole thing. Uh-huh

82
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,080
 It took me a really long time to figure out that your text said that you were that you had to ditch your wife

83
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,280
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it didn't say you had to ditch your wife. It said he had to I know I

84
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,120
 Know that was it. That's yeah

85
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,640
 That's why I'm so happy for your wife. And that's why I put exclamation points because he said you had to dick Sarah

86
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,640
 Oh my goodness

87
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:33,600
 Sorry, I'm running late getting back the concert ran long I had dick Sarah we understand me right there

88
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,600
 Context clues, but it's still very funny

89
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,960
 Yeah, I even put a capital D on there look at that

90
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:52,120
 You put a capital D on that all the marriage is anything like mine when that happens it's capital D that kind of day I

91
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,960
 Mean we're getting close to the holidays so we're due, but we'll see

92
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:08,880
 Is your birthday that's fucking great. Yes, so

93
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,500
 Who am I kidding everyone goes over the holidays we can't but

94
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,760
 But

95
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:24,760
 So then they go to this this music program right where they they sing some songs, but then they also do this thing

96
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:30,600
 This is like some innovation. They had a few years ago and what happens is they do like a creative writing

97
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,560
 storytelling time you

98
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:44,440
 So then they select like three or four, I guess I don't know ten just it felt like it felt like a million

99
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,520
 But I stayed for four

100
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,720
 These stories that the kids have written together

101
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:57,920
 There are Christmas themed stories and all the instruments on stage instead of creating songs for the Christmas concert

102
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,880
 creates sound effects for the

103
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,520
 Oh, that's the worst

104
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:13,160
 Terrible, I'm watching some avant-garde children's foley exercise. Do they intentionally add lots of sound effects to the stories?

105
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:21,280
 See I did this as a little kid I think I've told you guys this before my dad wrote a program on our Atari 400

106
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,480
 That was sound effects

107
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,460
 Okay, and you can play all kinds of different sound effects through the program

108
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:31,680
 Yeah, and so I recorded myself a story about mr. T and Lee majors going to space

109
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:39,120
 Yes, and I used all those sound effects as a young aspiring radio guy and Foley artist myself

110
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,400
 Well, don't get me wrong. I loved doing Foley stuff too, and I liked doing it with friends as well

111
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,620
 I don't think it should be done for

112
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,400
 200 parrots

113
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,080
 But I'm sure the comedy and timing of it was just spot-on

114
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:05,320
 And I don't know if maybe seven demos is worth the idea of showing off this Foley expertise

115
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:13,680
 Down to one or two of the best ones and then present those seven different stories

116
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,220
 Yeah, well, they did more how long a story I did I did they're like five minutes six minutes

117
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:28,200
 What yes, that's not no you do a story by cheer a story that a cheer a story than a cheer break it up

118
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,200
 Figure it out. Nope

119
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:38,280
 Three Christmas songs and seven stories. That's what you get here Christmas songs. What were the Christmas songs negotiation went worse than Ukraine in Russia

120
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:45,360
 Well, it's okay Israel's gonna pay for it. That's right, huh?

121
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,840
 Yeah, what were the Christmas? Oh, well first like Oh Christmas tree

122
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:58,620
 Okay, Christmas tree wasn't owned honing ball. I have issues with Oh Hanukkah Oh Hanukkah

123
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:04,080
 Let's light the menorah that song wait at what they do a version of Christmas tree. That's Oh Hanukkah

124
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,040
 There's another song called like Oh Hanukkah Hanukkah. We'd like the menorah

125
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,400
 Hanukkah you guys don't even know the song I'm talking about. No, no, okay

126
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,020
 I think this is a children's school song that has that has come up to

127
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,220
 Include everybody it's abominable. I

128
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,520
 mean like the snowman it is like it seems like it was in inspired by someone like

129
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,100
 fever fever chopping wood

130
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,920
 It was like the melody they came up with for it was like chop chop chop chop chop chop chop. No

131
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,740
 And and I guess it's like the first songs that was like a first included but like everyone Christian schools

132
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,740
 Like I guess we have to sing Hanukkah songs

133
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:43,240
 And they've included this about it. Leanne can stop and chat. Yes. This is about Israel

134
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:53,640
 Listen you can't say that the Jewish people run show business and then also put out that terrible song. You can't have it both ways

135
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:59,840
 Either you're in charge of everyone's beautiful music career. You can come up with a better melody then

136
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:07,320
 Than that there there are there are other beautiful Hanukkah. They just don't want Mariah Carey running away with all the publishing rights

137
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:13,160
 But yeah, so

138
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,640
 It's it's it's it's a terrible song and they sing it or I guess yell it or shout it

139
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,640
 It doesn't there's no way to unshout it. It's just shouting

140
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,480
 It's and do they play instruments to where the kids just sing it they play instruments, too

141
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,680
 Okay, that makes it worse. It does make it worse and yeah

142
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,200
 And and like it might as well like be done to like like the Ramones like they might as well have like a punk drummer

143
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,440
 just driving they don't do like klezmer and and

144
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:44,800
 Juice harp and all that kind of thing. They have every instrument out there Paul. I don't know if they're all done in a way

145
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
 That makes it satisfying to the year

146
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:55,360
 Authentically Jewish in nature of these there's marimbas and chimes and wood instruments and all kinds of stuff out there. It's a couple laptops

147
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,080
 Try to get all Beastie Boys on it

148
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,880
 Laptops going on

149
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:08,200
 They're running tape. He got straight-up DJs DJs on the wheels of steel the ones and twos. Yep

150
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,480
 but I

151
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,860
 Was like what kind of avant-garde artsy shit am I watching?

 There is nothing that makes me want to have kids less than than children's musical events. Oh, I

 That's probably fine. No, I don't think it is. Well, I got sick

193
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:16,440
 Yesterday I went into work. I I got up and I wasn't I wasn't feeling good in the evening

194
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:21,880
 and then I wasn't feeling good in the morning and I pushed myself to go on and head to work and

195
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,080
 I drove to the end of our

196
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:33,120
 Neighborhood and I paused for like 20 seconds and I almost just turned the car around because I was feeling so crappy and I was

197
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,400
 Like no just go to work. Just do it

198
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,360
 And I did it and then I was there for about 45 minutes and I started really feeling terrible

199
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,960
 Like I was gonna pass out getting like cold sweats. I don't know. What was the food poisoning or something? I don't know

200
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,560
 But I went I told him I gotta I gotta get out of here so I

201
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,800
 Left yesterday and today

202
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:00,800
 I stayed home today just to make sure I could get some rest and feel better and I do feel better

203
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:06,440
 So no, it wasn't an Aldi hot dog this time Mike. So anyway yet

204
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:13,960
 Yeah, I was like all the hot dogs chase any germs away. I was just beat and I needed a break

205
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,080
 I've been doing just a lot. It's been busy

206
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,880
 But Jeff Loomis in the chat is saying that you do look tired. I and and yeah, Jeff is right

207
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:29,160
 Paul honestly looks like shit. He's sitting there and he just looks terrible

208
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,660
 You should have seen me yesterday. I really did look I looked the site

209
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:41,560
 I'm feeling a little bit better now, which is good. So it's got a two more days and then I can take a little break

210
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,960
 I didn't want to say Haggard, but now that you brought it up

211
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,480
 Call me Merle cuz I'm Haggard

212
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:56,600
 That's a joke that everybody gets and dead Lazlo says I'm just sick of work I could sympathize and it's true

213
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,520
 I am fucking sick of work

214
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,520
 Work is awful

00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:07,180
 Especially worst time right here. You're in the height. You're in the height of it's it's crazy right now. Yeah, it's really crazy. But

216
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:15,340
 Yeah, I just needed a fucking break. Oh, I need to go to the sweat house. That's right Leon. Well last night I

217
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:21,040
 Was invited to City Cast Las Vegas is just a social

218
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:27,760
 Community gathering nice. Oh, how nice and so they invited us out to a place called the crush pad

219
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:35,700
 It's a gathering of podcasters. Just podcast listeners. Just just members. Oh members sponsoring members

220
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:40,560
 And and so we were out of the crush pad and

221
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:47,080
 The wine bar the wine bar and it was a delightful little wine bar met the owners

222
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,800
 they had a tastings of

223
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,720
 Four wines that were exquisite

224
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,640
 Okay, and then I was laughing because I

225
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:03,400
 also ordered a little a little prosciutto appetizer and then I went ahead and got myself a

226
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,240
 Glass of their they have a chilled red house

227
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,800
 wine

228
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,600
 Nice and I was like, yeah, let's do that

229
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,800
 And then the person in front of me ordered two glasses of wine and I got two raffle tickets

230
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:22,280
 And then the person told me gave me their what gave me my wine and then walked away and I said

231
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:29,360
 The fuck yeah, I said, excuse me. Do I get a raffle ticket and she did even like oh

232
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,120
 You ordered the house

233
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,560
 Wine so no. Oh

234
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,520
 and I

235
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,140
 Laughed what do you have to order to get a raffle to I have to really?

236
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:47,360
 Was like I saved a few bucks by going with the house and then it's like when I give you a fucking tote bag

237
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:57,780
 Don't you feel stupid after four bucks next time you cheapskate, huh? Yeah, it's Christmas season. Don't be a Scrooge get some good wine

238
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,160
 Yeah

239
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,800
 Then I laughed and then the person who ordered the wine said I didn't know

240
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,220
 The rule so I didn't mean to walk you into that trap

241
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:13,780
 So I said, okay and then out of guilt she's like never mind you can have but you can have a raffle

242
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:19,120
 And she gave me the raffle ticket

243
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,800
 And I'm talking to my friend there is

244
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,280
 You know, we're so we're the social addicts. So the guy who walked me into that trap we joked and we

245
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,160
 Set down with them. We had a little wine him and his wife two doctors in town and

246
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,200
 And I said if I win this raffle, I I obviously will will refuse to take it

247
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,680
 I will I will I'll yield it back to the story. I didn't qualify properly for it. I

248
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:50,920
 Can't I can't possibly everyone know like any cheapskate can win one of those

249
00:21:50,920 --> 00:22:00,400
 What is that a coffee mug give me that give me that outrageous this is for people who won a good

250
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,240
 Good cabernet. I'm sorry, sir. This is for customers not freeloaders

251
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:17,680
 But I did I met the I also had another awkward interaction there I was there and I looked at this woman

252
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:25,620
 Well, that's awkward and I looked at her name tag and I was like I said you'd look familiar and she goes shit

253
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,120
 She got me like a weird look. She's like

254
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,280
 What like what and I was like, I don't know. I was like basically like do you want to help me out here?

255
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,280
 Kind of like do I familiar to you?

256
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:41,880
 There's the regular dance of do I look familiar do it and she goes you're probably gonna say I look like a singer

257
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,380
 I go. Oh, well, okay

258
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:53,860
 I work in town, you know showbiz maybe maybe maybe she's cross paths and she goes yeah

259
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,860
 No, I'm not that singer

260
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,320
 And then like went away like half annoyed

261
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,920
 And I

262
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:11,560
 What a weirdy and I said like she went away is half of a Domino's advertisement from the 80s

263
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:16,420
 The person next to me. I was like I didn't even bring up the singer part. She did

264
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:19,960
 I only said yes to the singing part because I thought we were trying to figure out how we knew each other

265
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,960
 I thought you were helping me out

266
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:28,120
 He's like no, you just think every black woman's a singer go fuck yourself. You racist is basically what happened there

267
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,320
 That's what it was. Yeah, so we did not hit it off. That was I

268
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:39,220
 One strike on the socializing for the for the for the city cast Vegas outing there. Oh

269
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:46,080
 That's and that is too bad because that is the person that we brought in today to interview for this. Hello. Hello miss

270
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,560
 So you you met Matt Donnelly last night. Did you? Oh, no

271
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,800
 Yes

272
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,860
 And and you did not care for your interaction with Matt Donnelly

273
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,480
 Hey, are we actually recording on this? Oh, we're recording right now, buddy

274
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,240
 Okay, let's do this. I'm here. Am I sounding okay on this?

275
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,360
 Beaming that's Rob. We're doing it. We're in the middle of a bit, but Rob Rob is here. Hey

276
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:15,400
 Rob, I was just talking about being a city cast Las Vegas social gathering last night. We're already rolling

277
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,560
 I know I could sense the excitement in your voice

278
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,800
 Recalls the big event. That's what that was. I

279
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,480
 Will say I'm gonna burn you guys right now

280
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,600
 You guys handed out conversation starters last night to people as they walked in

281
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:35,200
 We sure did and I am laughing because I have inside information on your company that you guys are allowed to be a little

282
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,820
 Political, but you're not supposed to be like a politically leaning podcast organization, right?

283
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:46,200
 We get feedback every now and then from upper management as well as the audience

284
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:52,860
 What I like to say is city cast is for everyone if you love Las Vegas or love to trash Las Vegas either way

285
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,320
 We have a home for you. Great officially. Welcome Rob from city cast Las Vegas. Thank you

286
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:04,240
 And hey Las Vegas newsletter editor and I appear occasionally on the podcast

287
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,400
 Yeah, just to clarify absolutely great job on both your newsletter is outstanding. I think you did an amazing newsletter

288
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:17,200
 I think some of my favorite things that you guys make the Nevada Independent and the Las Vegas Review Journal look like

289
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,840
 You might as well just light dog poop on fire and ring their doorbells. You're embarrassing them. You are embarrassing them

290
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,440
 Well, we link to them sometimes. Yeah, we got we got a tip ahead to them

291
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,560
 you know, we just kind of like to collect what everyone's talking about add a little bit of our own stew to the mix and

292
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:37,400
 or mix to the stew your way, but it's we slide into your inbox at 6 a.m

293
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,480
 every morning and give you a quick look at what's going on in Vegas. So here is the

294
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:47,620
 Everyone loves Las Vegas icebreaker. You guys hated me when I came with a party last night. Okay, great

295
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,860
 What's should we should we have the conversation based on this card now?

296
00:25:53,160 --> 00:26:00,360
 This card says what's your ethical responsibility as a citizen when you believe your country is acting immorally. That's your casual

297
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:07,440
 Icebreaker for me to just talk to any citizen of Las Vegas

298
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,560
 That is a little few people

299
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,640
 That's a literal icebreaker

300
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,360
 Has to switch out today. Ah

301
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:23,120
 Some did yes, I don't want to talk about nature Rob. This doesn't have to be a God chosen journalism moment, but this has David Figgler written

302
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,600
 All over it. This is Figgler all over it. I

303
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,040
 Think it was more like we have what we call a membership team

304
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:36,040
 Helps us organize these events because it was for city cast neighbors. That's our membership group. That's right

305
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:41,320
 And you know, we were kind of worried, you know, cuz some of these people, you know, they want to get out and about they want

306
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,800
 To meet new people so we don't want it to be, you know awkward

307
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,800
 So sometimes, you know, we had a couple games out like you know and stuff

308
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:53,800
 But nobody even had to open them because everyone was naturally organically making conversation and mingling

309
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:59,720
 so it's true the icebreaker card was part of that and I think a few people used it but not everybody did but it's a

310
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:04,160
 Good way just to welcome people and get them thinking about something straight off the bat. It was it was a

311
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:09,000
 It was a landmine and the people that I met but yeah, we moved on anyway

312
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,680
 So you did get some Intel and asked the question to it. I did I did I did fitting off with the with two doctors

313
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,460
 Let's let Daniel and Christine. I think

314
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,840
 Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, they're doctors and

315
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,280
 I'll vouch for them. Yeah. Yeah, and they did it

316
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:28,880
 There I just say yes, I mean if we're not for your newsletter Rob

317
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,140
 I wouldn't know things like the Taco Bell ultra run which is coming up in a couple of weeks here

318
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,880
 Actually, it's coming up Saturday Saturday. Oh, it's the Saturday. All right

319
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:49,280
 Where people run from Summerlin to Henderson and stop by seven Taco Bells and have to eat a Taco Bell menu item at each

320
00:27:49,280 --> 00:28:00,960
 One of the things we do at City Cast Vegas is we do events we compile events and it's kind of like a guide to

321
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,000
 The week and I was coming across this thing called the Taco Bell ultra marathon

322
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,920
 I'm like that looks boring some another marathon sponsored by some

323
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,200
 Corporate entity and then I looked at it and this isn't sponsored by anybody at all. This isn't

324
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:22,320
 Roots thing that a person came up with who was in an organization here locally called

325
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:29,240
 I believe the Las Vegas slow runners. So, you know, there are people who want to be out and about but it's kind of like all skills and

326
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:35,760
 Let all skill levels welcome and the whole idea is you start at a Taco Bell in

327
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:41,720
 Summerlin you end up at a Taco Bell in Henderson and you stop at five others along the way

328
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,560
 This is more than 30 miles. This is why I didn't feel this was a real event

329
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,240
 I'm like, yeah like this is a joke for people who don't know

330
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,640
 Henderson and Summerlin are on opposite sides of the city of Las Vegas

331
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,880
 They are they are two just neighborhoods basically on the east and west sides of the city

332
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,200
 It's not even easy to run between the two takes a while. Yes. Oh

333
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:07,160
 Driving between the two is a nightmare running between the two full of Taco Bell seems like a hellscape

334
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:13,320
 Right. So there's there's some guide guidelines and even experienced runners. I did talk to someone involved

335
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,160
 So I knew this was legit and they're like, you know, I'm a runner myself

336
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:22,040
 This will probably take me like eight hours some people may be five some people may be longer

337
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:26,160
 But also I think some of the participants might just do like two or three Taco Bells

338
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,320
 I think the real serious ones are the ones who are like doing the whole thing

339
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,160
 I'm a Taco Bell 5k guy. I'm not a Taco Bell

340
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:37,740
 I can I think run from one to the other and then call it a day

341
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,320
 But you have to eat something different at each Taco Bell

342
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,760
 Wow can't repeat and then you have to eat the whole menu item

343
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,800
 Yes, and you can't run with it. You have to finish it and then go

344
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,960
 You can't just eat like a bite of a taco and then head out. You got to eat the whole taco

345
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:57,520
 Exactly. And I'm also there's a 15-minute penalty added to your time if you throw up

346
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,140
 This is a real rule. That's fine. There is a 15-minute in this race

347
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:09,400
 There is a 15-minute penalty for that in life. There is a much bigger penalty for it if you don't throw up though

348
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,360
 If it wants to come out let it come out

349
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:19,400
 And again just to let you guys know city cast is legit

350
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:24,220
 I reached out to the slow runners and the person's person's personal

351
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:28,240
 Instagram page trying to get them on today's podcast and could not reach them

352
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,720
 But you got you got the interview you got that you got the facts there

353
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,200
 Yeah, so I ended up talking to someone who's actually making the official t-shirts

354
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:42,480
 So if you go on their website, they have an official t-shirt for this unofficial Taco Bell event. Holy smokes

355
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,760
 One of the Taco Bells is right on the corner from my house

356
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,520
 You should just go and hang I know I was like

357
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:52,160
 One of those tables like cups of water maybe there was water

358
00:30:52,160 --> 00:31:00,460
 That'd be a bucket ready for anyone who's ready to you wouldn't bring water 15 minutes. I have 15 minute penalty buckets waiting for them

359
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,840
 Little cups of Baja Blast. That's what you got to have

360
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:09,160
 Last bonus you can there's two bonuses

361
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,800
 One is you can add Diablo sauce to everything and do a Diablo sauce shooter at the end

362
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,120
 Oh, I think it's just drinking a packet fine

363
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:22,360
 Fine, and the second one is you have to commit to drinking at least two liters of Baja Blast. Oh

364
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,680
 over the seven locations

365
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:33,440
 So what's that equate to like four larges or something like that? It's about two liters. It's about half a dozen

366
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:40,520
 Vomits six. Oh, this was invented by someone who loves Taco Bell and hates running. There's no no, you know, this actually

367
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:46,320
 Happened in a couple other cities. Apparently this is an annual tradition in Denver

368
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,720
 I think they're the first ones to come up with it and just a few weeks ago. There was one in the DC area

369
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,240
 Yeah, just by coincidence the CEO of CityCast David Plotz

370
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,760
 He saw my story sent me a note and said his son ran in the DC version

371
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,760
 And complete it October. I

372
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,360
 believe it was late November

373
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,440
 Okay. Okay, great. Maybe Denver was October. Maybe I don't know the website I found it says

374
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:19,900
 50 kilometers nine Taco Bell meals across DC. Well, yeah, it's insane even worse than the

375
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,320
 Yeah

376
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:28,660
 Seven miles while stopping at nine Taco Bells

377
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:35,240
 That makes me want to do that and

378
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,880
 The idea is you wear costumes and kind of have fun with it. Sure. And it's all a trust system, right? Yeah

379
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,240
 And you went over and taco at the end if you're first. Oh, oh

380
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,120
 Come on

381
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:52,160
 Burying the league being a golden taco winner is pretty great

382
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,760
 Yeah, great

383
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:59,360
 That goes right on the intro to everything I do after that, you know

384
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,960
 No matter what I'm doing

385
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,400
 That should be on front page in the RJ golden taco winner is

386
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:13,880
 All right, and I don't know what it is I asked my contact who is part of this

387
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,680
 Who's making the shirts and I said, what is the golden taco? And she said I don't know

388
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,060
 So it's a little bit of a surprise for whoever gets it. All right

389
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:26,240
 Rob I gave you I gave you 12 hours

390
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,960
 I gave you 12 hours notice on the spot to do a year and hours of sleep

391
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,400
 Yeah, exactly

392
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:39,240
 And he does last night. I challenged you to come on here and I wanted the top three

393
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,000
 underreported Vegas stories for 2025

394
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,340
 Yes, now when I asked you that just pop in your head right away or did you was it hard to come up with?

395
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:53,880
 No, cuz you also gave me the option for the five overall news stories of the year

396
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,980
 Yes, and I said well three sounds easier than five

397
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,480
 And I think my first option will make you grow and you'll be like you didn't put much into this

398
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,800
 But I want us to think about I want I want us to think about the the year

399
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,560
 So far looking back. It's been a it's one of those years. It kind of feels like two years

400
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,580
 It doesn't really feel like all this was one year lots been going on

401
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:27,520
 But what do we remember as the first do you guys remember what the first big news story of the year is from?

402
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,160
 January of 2025

403
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,280
 Yes

404
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,760
 No, no, I don't remember what the first news story of December I guess this election shit

405
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,760
 Are we talking just Vegas maybe somewhat indirectly just Vegas, right?

406
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:50,720
 Just Vegas. Yes. Yeah, I'm thinking from now. I'm on the outside in PA now getting still

407
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:57,120
 I still have lots of feeds coming up. My first thought goes to the boring company increasing their

408
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,440
 presence

409
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,820
 They Elon Musk tunnel company. Yeah

410
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,920
 Okay, any any other?

411
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,320
 Guesses I guess there was a bunch of protests stage in January, right?

412
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,960
 And we we have a bad we have a bad record with how we handle protests. Are we there?

413
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:18,360
 There's always a protest about something every day this story. I'm gonna give you a hint. Okay, so was explosive

414
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:26,360
 Explosive explosive news story. Oh was this the the the Tesla truck that blew up at Trump's tower

415
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,940
 That's right happened. People forget this it happened on January 1st. Oh my god five New Year's Day

416
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:39,880
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah, this was the Tesla cyber truck that the guy blew up like in the valet parking area of the of the Trump Tower

417
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,880
 We're in Vegas and he was in it, right?

418
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,720
 Yeah

419
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,520
 he

420
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,280
 Blew up along with the Tesla. Yeah, he drove to be clear. He wasn't he didn't blow it up by accident

421
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,200
 He meant to blow it up. Yes. Yeah, this was an act of terrorism. This was an attack. Yeah. Yeah

422
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,600
 Yeah, it wasn't like, you know the accelerator like right, you know

423
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:08,880
 I don't think they have those in Tesla's anyway, but yeah, so this guy drove from Colorado Springs rented the Tesla and

424
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,480
 You know, he came pulled up. I'm learning right now that it was a rental

425
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:21,900
 This is what you get from CityCast that's right details, yeah, I mean you're not gonna blow up your own

426
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,160
 You know replacing the batteries

427
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,020
 So if you do survive, you know, you want to yeah that explains why somebody else's car

428
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:37,840
 My my rates at budget and hurts went up last year that explains it. I think this had something to do with it

429
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,720
 Yes, he used Turo. You know what Turo? Oh, yes

430
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:48,000
 You are oh, it's sort of like I don't know. It's kind of like almost we thought about getting into this when it was brand new

431
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,900
 It's the uber of rentals. I think yeah

432
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:56,840
 Yeah, you can like sort of like your car, right? Yeah, it's a car sharing that actually does make it more fucked up because everyone running

433
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,920
 A Turo usually owns like one or two cars for Turo

434
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,600
 You know, it's basically like how we all can run our own rental car company

435
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,200
 So that means if people used to do this with the condos

436
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:10,340
 Yeah, so this means that person really did blow up someone else's like really that was a really expensive hundred thousand dollar

437
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:14,760
 Tesla Cybertruck, it's kind of it's kind of like an extra fu, you know

438
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,440
 I'm gonna ruin this guy's car

439
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,040
 But yeah pulled up to the Portico share the valet and you know what?

440
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,920
 I think is kind of under reported about this story is yeah got a lot of attention at the time

441
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:32,160
 But you know when the person responsible dies, you know, you don't really get to follow up on motives

442
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,400
 You don't really get to follow up on you know, what was behind this right and you know, there was sort of I mean the guy

443
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,400
 had a history in the Special Forces with the US Army and

444
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,520
 You know, there were sort of like questions over his political leanings

445
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,440
 And if that had something to do with it or if he's just having

446
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:54,160
 You know a bad time in life and is coping with this and maybe had some mental health issues

447
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,040
 Sure, but the fact that you know, this is happening at the Trump Tower

448
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,680
 which

449
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,560
 you know coming right after a very contentious election and

450
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:10,600
 The Trump presidency was there some drama around that I miss that yeah, you may have heard

451
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:17,000
 This president again, so I have not been following the news closely. Yeah, so

452
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:24,760
 You know, but it's also makes you think about how easily it is for kind of what could be considered an act of terrorism to take place

453
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:30,520
 At a Las Vegas landmark, right? I mean pull up into a valet. So you kind of wonder about okay

454
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:37,840
 What's happening since then to account for this kind of stuff to catch people before they take this kind of action and how do you increase security?

455
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,080
 Remember there was that crash that happened in front of Planet Hollywood a few years back

456
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:50,200
 Yeah, and and now because of that because they ran into tourists walking on the sidewalk now you have the you know

457
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,560
 The pillars the ballasts, I believe yeah

458
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,720
 They're concrete ballasts that are along along the sidewalk blocking off the the sidewalks from the road now

459
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:03,360
 Because then the crash referred to is over. Yeah. Oh, yeah, they're everywhere now and they and they came up quick

460
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,800
 They grew out of the sidewalks

461
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,800
 Right, we gave birth and planted the seed and a screw. That's the company. I should have started the ballast company

462
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,400
 I would have made a fortune. Yeah, I think especially in this town

463
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,760
 So I mean Vegas is always looking at ways to improve security

464
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:26,880
 Chat is yelling at us bollards. Yeah bollards not ballast ballast at the bottom of a boat bollards are the things on the side of the road

465
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,620
 Yeah, it's not like my business is words or anything

466
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:35,360
 We'll edit this in post right these microphones are decorative. Yeah

467
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:42,280
 So I thought that's a somewhat under-reported story mainly because it's been forgotten. Yeah, you're right

468
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,720
 I totally haven't thought about that forever and it happened in my own backyard and

469
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,680
 I didn't connect it to all of the bollards that are around

470
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:59,520
 Here or ballasts or ballasts or ballads for the people's standing in front of building singing to make sure you don't crash

471
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,200
 Your car they just sing slow songs

472
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,840
 She's not that singer I don't know

473
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:13,160
 No, I have so I have a second story that the second story kind of follows a similar theme

474
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,800
 we're gonna kind of go and flow between one story and another but

475
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,520
 Have you noticed anything about Metro police this year? I

476
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:27,400
 Mean, they're super nice and polite and don't give out a bunch of fuck you tickets. Oh

477
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,000
 Wait, no, I'm wrong

478
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,560
 They've handled I think they've handled the arrest of some of our friends very well

479
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,400
 You know people have you had to bail out people? No, we're good friends with Jimmy Sonina who had that terrible

480
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,820
 There you have protest. Yeah, you got arrested for some nonsense. Yeah, right

481
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:51,640
 So, you know the one thing I've noticed about Metro this year, which has gotten some attention

482
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:56,920
 I think it needs to get a little more attention. Okay, the way this fleet is expanding

483
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,160
 Just the technology they're using

484
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,200
 I think you may have seen the hoopla over their big

485
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:10,620
 Cybertruck speaking of which cyber truck patrol fleet. Yeah, some guy gave him a bunch of cyber trucks

486
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:14,880
 Yeah, and how much do you think those fleet of cyber trucks cost? Oh

487
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:21,300
 Oh gosh, I I bet with the retrofitting and stuff that they're doing to the cyber trucks

488
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:25,640
 They've got to be $200,000 a piece where they got to have bulletproof

489
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,560
 stuff in them and all that kind of 200,000

490
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,400
 Elon Musk tried to

491
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:38,160
 Speaking of things that we forgot about remember when Elon Musk debuted the cyber trucks and threw a big steel

492
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:43,200
 Ball-bearing at the back windows to show off the bulletproof glass and it wasn't bulletproof glass

493
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,080
 So he just broke them on stage at the unveiling. I do remember that they just went. Oh well

494
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:52,520
 Yeah, they're like oops and they did it again on a different window. That one also wasn't bulletproof

495
00:41:52,520 --> 00:42:01,560
 Ten of those. Yeah, that's the ones for us. So some guy bought a bunch of Tesla cyber trucks for Las Vegas Metro Police

496
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:09,000
 Ten or fifteen of them. This was nearly three million dollar donation from a tech investor

497
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,760
 Ben Horowitz who is

498
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,040
 with a venture capital firm

499
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:22,120
 Anderson Horowitz, so good guy and yeah, but this isn't the first time he's donated to Metro

500
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,080
 do you

501
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:31,000
 Do you remember the other forgotten story this year of remember the guy who set Tesla cars on fire?

502
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,560
 Yes at the dealership

503
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,640
 Yes, yes, which was like a protest

504
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:42,680
 Right and he was caught but Metro said, you know, we wouldn't have caught him without some of this new technology

505
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:47,360
 We have specifically license plate readers that are now throughout the city

506
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,320
 And there's a back there's about a hundred and eighty of them

507
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:55,260
 Oh, it's at least at the time that we did the story and those cost about six million

508
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:58,360
 And who do you think paid for those this guy Horowitz?

509
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:03,240
 Yeah, Wow, so this is not get a lot of speeding tickets

510
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:13,200
 Mr. Horowitz person well now correct me if I'm wrong Rob, but are not the very legality of those devices still in contention

511
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:20,000
 You I mean you can definitely make from a privacy privacy violation

512
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,640
 I mean, do you want to be tracked? You know your whereabouts going because that's how they were I'll answer. No

513
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:33,800
 Okay, that's the question interesting interesting. Yeah, but the way they sort of get around this is I believe they make the donation to

514
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:41,000
 Sort of like a third-party like fraternal order of police type of thing and then it kind of goes through that way

515
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,040
 You know if this guy was really in some kind of legal trouble

516
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,520
 What would happen right you're donating millions and millions to make?

517
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,480
 You know Metro police

518
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,760
 in theory more successful more like a an army unit, but

519
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:04,040
 You know what happens if you commit some major felony commit? I'm not saying this guy's a bad guy at all

520
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:09,840
 Maybe he's a great guy. No, but you know there it works in some protection. It is weird. You know makes you it makes you pause

521
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,960
 Yeah, is there any other?

522
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:20,040
 Motive like in other words like just just just spitballing. I mean I like I like why would a guy spend over 10 million dollars to

523
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:26,340
 Quote-unquote make the city safer, but basically to give Tesla trucks and surveillance equipment to one city

524
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:34,760
 Like what what's it? I don't understand any time. There's a side for him anytime. There's a data collection element

525
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,600
 That can be monetized, so he's not doing this out of the goodness of his heart

526
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,160
 There is money to be made with that license plate data. That's what I'm asking right. I don't know exactly

527
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:52,440
 I don't know exactly what or is it even probably you could probably know you can probably figure out a way to measure like cars

528
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:59,760
 Mileage and all that kind of thing there their MPH or MPG, you know ratings and things like that

529
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,420
 What is the ascent of your armpits have to do with anything Paul?

530
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:07,560
 I don't know I always have something to do with it balance for a man, but made for a lady

531
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:15,560
 No, it's all it's all crazy. I saw a tick-tock recently where someone was talking about this very thing

532
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:20,440
 And it's not about the billionaires accumulating all this wealth at the end of the day

533
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:25,400
 Yes, that's kind of a sickness and a weird symptom of it all but the accumulation of the wealth is

534
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:31,120
 Secondary to their end goal, which is becoming above the rules of normal society

535
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:38,080
 Right and how better to become above the rules of normal society than by purchasing the people who enforce the rules of normal society

536
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:46,160
 I mean this literally is like like Batman comic-villain level. It is right frightening where you're like

537
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:53,200
 Oh, I just did a Google search on this guy. Apparently he's opening a new nightclub in Las Vegas. It's called Horowitz Island

538
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:59,320
 And apparently the police are just not paying any attention to it at all. Okay good

539
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:06,160
 The big the big the big innovation of the nightclub is that you don't get carted at the door. That's right

540
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:12,320
 Technology that allows you to not be carted at the door. Basically a teen club

541
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:17,680
 The teens seem awfully old to be hanging out there

542
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,680
 Allegedly

543
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:28,820
 I'm sure is a great guy, but it's not just cyber trucks. It's not just the license plate readers

544
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:34,600
 There's also a fleet of drones now. Oh, no that mr. Horowitz says the drones kill me

545
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:41,640
 Well, the the one day maybe yeah. Yeah, it's true. That that's such a weird thing. Oh

546
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:48,600
 And if you look at it, you know, if you just kind of who's our governor right now Joe Lombardo

547
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:54,760
 Yeah, and what did he used to be? So, I mean chief of police getting your influence

548
00:46:54,760 --> 00:47:00,960
 Where you can you know, it could be very valuable depending where people end up in public office. Yeah. Yeah, I

549
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,320
 But that you're right. This is next level bizarreness

550
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:12,240
 I had no idea it was just one person footing the bill in a donation role to create this kind of

551
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,200
 militaristic

552
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,200
 approach to policing is

553
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:23,840
 The are the cops at least flexing on safety. Are they flexing on any kind of statistics to back up any of this?

554
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:29,040
 Cause I'd be more afraid they're flexing on people he'd or if it's the

555
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,720
 Right. Well the sheriff right now is

556
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:41,360
 You know running for reelection he's saying murders are down I believe but these are all stats you can count them how you like

557
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:45,840
 but you know what happens if there's a greater for example ice presence in Las Vegas and

558
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,360
 We are experiencing right now

559
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:55,600
 Right and but it could get really bad in theory like some other cities and what happens when the governor gets involved or the sheriff gets

560
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:59,360
 Involved and now you start mixing politics with influence

561
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,600
 and how

562
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:08,040
 Much to resist this kind of stuff or get involved in it. It just raises a lot of questions and hypotheticals. It's not great

563
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:12,280
 It's not it's not a good look. It's it's the what's what's the the thing?

564
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:19,440
 You want you we want to avoid the the appearance of impropriety and this this certainly does not avoid that appearance

565
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,360
 That's what I'm trying whether there is that's what there is any impropriety or not. This looks shady as fuck

566
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:28,240
 That's what I'm poking at Jacob is like, of course hearing this you make you go like yikes, right?

567
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:32,460
 but like our what is the counter and that's I mean, that's what's actually I've been fascinated by a

568
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:38,120
 lot of these terrible things that are happening in the country is that that doesn't even even seem to be a

569
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:45,440
 Quote-unquote company line that people are hiding under anymore. People just say like, yep. It's terrible. We love it. We love terrible shit

570
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,600
 Like I don't I don't if you're not doing anything wrong you shouldn't be worried about it

571
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:56,920
 So, yeah this guy is someone in chat saying that he invests in in in in

572
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:03,200
 Flock safety the I guess that's the company that tracks license. Yes, that's the license plate gotcha

573
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:07,720
 so the racer slash reader slash so he is he's getting data to

574
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,440
 sell

575
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,800
 This that's it. Yeah, he's like we get we get to be his demo city. Although in Vegas

576
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,680
 We're so many cars without a license plate. You're gonna lose a chunk of data

577
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,680
 We just stepped up the thing about to call people out on that

578
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:31,640
 Rob is the one who reported that let me know that was working there. The tattletale line is working. Mm-hmm

579
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:37,540
 Have you ever you weren't working working? I don't know. It's generating more tax revenue for the state

580
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:40,560
 Gary Rob, that's what I want city cast to crack

581
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:47,160
 I want you to do either an article or a podcast with just tattletailers what they get out of it why they're doing it

582
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:56,020
 Have you have you encountered anyone who's called in anyone on the line like like a guide on how to narc

583
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:01,520
 Yeah, like no. No, I want to hear from the narcs. I want to hear from the well

584
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:06,480
 My favorite narc is that you can report on people who have smog issues with their car

585
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:12,240
 There's an actual program Matt what's your license plate up

586
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,280
 Corolla smog out of this well

587
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:22,520
 Can't tell me those guys working in the smog shacks aren't just as soon as somebody fails and heads off on their day

588
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,020
 They're not jumping on the horn and oh, yeah, I got a tip

589
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:31,200
 I don't think they get like a cash reward. Oh, well, then maybe they're not doing

590
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:38,000
 Your neighbor it was like aluminum cans like you get ten cents. It's like it's a really nominal fee

591
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,040
 golden taco

592
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:48,640
 So, I guess we're just at the beginning of what this means Rob, right?

593
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:54,320
 We don't know what this actually is going to entail. We haven't seen police drones in action yet. Have we?

594
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:00,760
 I think they're more of like a glorified delivery service right now where they are at different stations

595
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:06,480
 And then they can kind of go and maybe scope out an area before the actual officers arrive

596
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,920
 Oh, well, it's kind of a monitoring thing. All right

597
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:15,600
 The I I just picture I believe three four of them coming up to me while I'm on my walk at night

598
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:19,240
 Just shooting lasers at me is what I'm picturing. Yeah. Well, it's coming next

599
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:23,600
 To be unveiled at CES and truly if you're making

600
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:31,040
 Drones for metro services the way you're gonna sell more of those drones is to have the predator style three laser

601
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:35,280
 Dots that you can project on people while they're on their late-night walks

602
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:41,300
 Yes, the sign of you will you will sell a fuck ton of those drones to all of these police departments

603
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,520
 If you just put those three lasers on it. Yeah

604
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:47,440
 Was that all three was that was that -

605
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:52,160
 That was - I know they kind of run together and probably feel like one big story

606
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:57,920
 But let's go with what we all want to talk about Elon Musk Tesla Tunnels boring company

607
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,880
 We've talked about it a lot at CityCast in some way

608
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:05,480
 It's kind of our lane, but we've teamed up with ProPublica twice now

609
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:09,440
 Wow, and I'll tell you ProPublica ProPublica does not mess around that

610
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:15,320
 They are very serious and diligent about what they do a big shout out to David Figgler our host

611
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:22,680
 Yes, and lawyer not our lawyer but a lawyer who really is curious about this stuff really digs deep into it and finds the

612
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:28,640
 Things that not a lot of other people find out about so you are right. This is definitely under reported

613
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,920
 I don't think people are talking about this at all on a national level and

614
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,880
 This company is running a muck like a bad

615
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:42,680
 Like action TV show where someone has no regard for the law and just keeps ignoring. Oh, it's fine

616
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:46,640
 It's really like yeah commit violations now deal with it later

617
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,680
 They've had warnings. They've had

618
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:57,000
 But in the latest, I mean we reported I believe it was like over a thousand since they started and then

619
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:05,080
 Or excuse me over a hundred thousand dollars in fines from Nevada OSHA for some safety violations

620
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,080
 And that was last year

621
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:10,440
 This year we were reporting that

622
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:19,360
 Kind of think of what it well it did illegal dumping was one of them they were yes, they were yeah, so kind of by where

623
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:25,480
 Historic commercial center is I was put historic in front of that's a very kind way to

624
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:34,120
 Branding I spent so many years in that spot in historic commercial center. Yes. Yes in the historic onyx theater

625
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:38,880
 The historic

626
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,000
 Hawks syringe syringe is historic

627
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,320
 Green door

628
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,240
 For me

629
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,600
 History is made at Hawks gym

630
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:58,840
 But you can have that to be your new slogan by the way you'd have that for free history is made at Hawks gym

631
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:04,880
 I mean it is historic and how many clothing optional all-male 24-hour gyms are there in this country?

632
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,960
 But I'm sorry, let's stay focused here Rob

633
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,360
 Let's stay let's stay underground with these tests

634
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:19,400
 so now we reported there was

635
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:26,120
 almost 800 environmental regulations over the last two years alone and these were sort of for like

636
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:35,640
 Digging without approval and releasing untreated water into like city streets which go back into our water system, right?

637
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:41,760
 And there was a case where would you mean like untreated waste water from their machines and things like that?

638
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:47,480
 Like right water water that they've been using not just water that they found underground somewhere and they're dumping it like

639
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:53,280
 It's not like they just found a pocket of water like they're bringing all this water in

640
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:58,120
 Diluting chemicals and yeah, they're doing all this stuff within the just dump it in the street, right?

641
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,740
 And you do go underground you come across water and that kind of thing

642
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:03,440
 but you know, there's also waste from just use right and

643
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:08,480
 You know, they just seem to be drilling full speed ahead and worrying about

644
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,200
 the repercussions later

645
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,200
 There's some questions about transparency

646
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:20,700
 We had a congresswoman Dina Titus on our podcast at City Cast and she said she wants to see

647
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:29,440
 Governor Lombardo just open up the transparency of the meetings that are taking place with state officials and the boring company

648
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:34,360
 Because they're sort of allegations that they're kind of getting some preferential treatment as far as you know

649
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:42,200
 Covering this stuff up and not being so transparent about it and kind of giving them some more chances than another company might get

650
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,200
 But you know, there's been agreements

651
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,400
 There's been allegations of the agreements being broken and just fines left and right

652
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,840
 But this is a company that has a lot of money at their disposal

653
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:57,560
 Elon Musk is on pace if not already to become the world's first trillionaire. He has money to burn and

654
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,960
 couldn't have a nicer guy

655
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:04,120
 This all is for something that

656
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:08,280
 I know your insider Intel said we shouldn't be as

657
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:16,280
 Impinionated but I think the boring company the boring tunnel and the boring company and what they're doing under Vegas is an incredibly stupid

658
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:20,680
 Public transportation. Yes. Yes. The end goal is not

659
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:23,480
 It doesn't justify the means at all

660
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:29,040
 Like who cares taking traffic above ground and putting it underground the same exact tunnels

661
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:33,120
 Could have been a subway or some kind of large-scale people mover

662
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,600
 why

663
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:42,960
 In the name of technology, we're just putting taxis underground putting Disneyland style conveyor belts underground

664
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:48,280
 Where people could just walk down there and then stand on the conveyor belt would have made more sense than this

665
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:53,360
 I would have taken that over this. Yes, you know just by the way, I'll still take that over this

666
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:58,200
 If somebody has the conveyor belt technology that they want to put in those tunnels today. I'm fine with

667
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:01,320
 I just sold that company to make bollards

668
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:05,200
 If somebody could really

669
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,920
 Short what's there with the monorail system?

670
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,000
 If only they could expand on the monorail system

671
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,200
 But that monomaniac it's gonna get completely demolished at a certain point Monterey right because there's no

672
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,240
 You don't have the replacement parts for the monorail. So now it's outdated

673
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:26,480
 So once it does bite the dust, we were we're stuck with it and can't fix it. Yeah, so maybe we'll have like Tesla's driving themselves

674
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:40,440
 Tesla does have like a subway car train type of thing that operates in Europe somewhere. I believe I saw this story

675
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:45,200
 I'm like wait, they actually can do this too. Why aren't they doing that here in Vegas?

676
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:49,920
 And now their latest idea is well, what if we take the Tesla's?

677
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:56,440
 Underground put them above ground and now they can go to the airport for five bucks and we're like, okay

678
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:01,920
 That sounds great. That sounds like a taxi with a super discount price. Mm-hmm. That's not new tech

679
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:09,520
 Yeah, Tesla operates a battery-powered shuttle train the giga train in Germany for its gigafactory in Berlin

680
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:14,920
 Yeah, providing where's our train? Yeah, that's just like this just makes a lot of sense. Yeah

681
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:22,080
 I said exactly that was exactly what uber did bitch. Where's my giga train is where I'm pumping it out. We are

682
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:31,000
 Uber came in with a problem with saying no. Yeah, and sometimes we should say no and say hey

683
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,160
 How about what you're doing in Germany? Let's do that. Yeah for sure

684
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,480
 Was there any?

685
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:44,640
 Understanding of what that big green goopy pile of gunk was there was that weird mystery lake that they yes speaking of

686
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,800
 Discharged water. Yeah

687
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,760
 Yeah there I mean

688
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:53,600
 It's funny because I think so much of the attention was how security handled that story

689
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:59,180
 So at their new station that they're building at the old firefly song if you remember that place on paradise

690
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:04,580
 I so their latest arm top is heading out. It's heading out towards

691
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:12,820
 UNLV so, you know, it's kind of gonna give some accessibility to like the sphere area and all that but there's

692
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:17,960
 construction happening and there's a little kind of pool of greenish water out there and

693
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:21,160
 When a local station, I believe that was the CBS

694
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:27,800
 KLAS affiliate here try to take some video of it what you're allowed to do from the sidewalk. They

695
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:34,400
 Security shooed them away tried to cover it up. So, you know, if there's nothing wrong with that you would think well

696
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:39,820
 Why are you trying to do that? I'm not gonna totally jump to conclusions and just go with the headline

697
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:44,640
 Yes, it's a little weird and suspect but you know, it's up to them to explain what this is

698
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,640
 And from what I've seen so far, they really haven't

699
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:57,920
 Green pool of sludge in the middle of the city is I heard on that video that they made them delete was

700
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:02,280
 Four turtles eating pizza and fighting each other get out of here

701
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:07,880
 Right out of the they were using taekwondo. I think taekwondo turtles

702
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:13,760
 All this in the name of having 12 cars drive you from one hotel to another underground

703
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:18,940
 I know I would like Metro to take their drones and fly above this pool of green water. Yes, exactly

704
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:24,880
 Let's go Lombardo fire them up. I'm a little visit. Yeah, the giga train in Germany carries 500 people per trip

705
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:30,840
 Just saying it's a lot more than four. Jesus. Yeah, that sounds convenient. Doesn't it? Yeah, it really does

706
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:36,960
 Mm-hmm. If only somebody had come up with the idea to put a train car underground like a a sub

707
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:44,200
 Train way. Tell me they couldn't refit the monorail. They could refit the monorail make it work

708
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:49,240
 Yeah, that's my vote. No glory in it. No ego in it Paul. There's no ego in it

709
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:53,640
 Look at the giga train on the monorail tracks and expand it. Yeah, just bring it done

710
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,920
 Yeah, bring it to where it needs to go Rob

711
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:00,280

724
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:02,160
 It really was a special order the cheap stuff. And if you did you didn't get a raffle ticket. Yeah

725
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:06,560
 All right, and we did give away four bottles. There was a raffle. There you go

726
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:11,840
 I left for it though. The raffle was up. I couldn't in good conscience win the raffle. So, you know, no, no

727
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:15,680
 Yeah, I think that's the number that went unanswered. You might have missed your chance. Oh

728
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:22,360
 All right, well, uh, we're gonna move on to our trivia portion of our show Rob

 Ultramarathon the only place where you get the runs

 Runs get you the runs get you

736
01:02:54,800 --> 01:03:00,040
 Holy shit. I can't wait for Matt's reporting from that Taco Bell by his house

737
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,120
 I

738
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:11,200
 Will be I'm just picturing like a bunch of young Matt Donnelly's with the with the horse heads on

739
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:16,440
 The whole thing it does it reeks of the idiot around that I did when I was younger for sure. Yeah

740
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:24,580
 It's gonna be great you guys want to a little Jack vs. Nerd. Yes. Yeah, let's do it

741
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,320
 I'm on the hunt for balls

742
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:42,560
 The hunt for balls

743
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:51,200
 We're gonna scoop it today from Eric Dittleman friend of the show. Hey Jacob, you're gonna want to read these category descriptions

744
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:55,760
 The first one is

745
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:01,480
 A-n-a-p-o-d-o-t-o-n-s, which Eric sent a

746
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:05,320
 Pronunciation guide here and

747
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:09,440
 Paddittons and a paddittons

748
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:15,000
 These are idioms where the second half is often unsaid or assumed. I will give you the second half

 1,800 for the win Paul is in second and third place. I suppose with 600 that's from Eric Dittleman

912
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:02,480
 Thank you Dittleman. If you want to send us a scooper II just like Dittleman or

913
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:08,560
 Price is right jock versus nerd or an obelisk jock versus nerd head over to preaching fun com preaching fun commas

914
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:14,220
 We can go to sign up for all those things and make another. Sorry. I'm jumping around. Hey scoops comm

915
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:17,440
 That's where you can go to do that. My wife just walked in and distracted me

916
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:27,120
 Make a scooper II. I was feeling really proud of having those four colleges until I saw the list of like a thousand

917
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:30,280
 There are a lot of colleges in that area

918
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:36,400
 As soon as it said general surrounding area, I was like, oh my yeah

919
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:43,400
 But good job Dittleman. That was a really well-written scooper II. That was excellent. Yeah, I'm surprised it was as good as it was

920
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:46,960
 I want to thank Bob from the city cast from popping on here

921
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:52,280
 Yes, thank you so much. Yeah, check out city cast check out the the podcast check out the newsletter

923
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:58,580
 It always fills me with a certain

924
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:04,560
 Respect and dread when actual other real podcasters join us on the show

925
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:09,800
 People get callbacks from the talk people that run the Taco Bell

926
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:15,160
 I feel like I feel like oh we've made it we're part of the club and also we don't belong here

927
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:21,400
 Well, then you hear Matt talk about how he reached out to multiple other people to get different angles on the story and nobody got

928
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,400
 Back to everybody got back to me

929
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000

 It's just really great and it's nice to see it this time around the holidays

948
01:21:12,820 --> 01:21:16,120
 I I see scoops on on social media and online

949
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:20,600
 Helping each other out as the holidays hit and the holidays are tough

950
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:27,360
 And so seeing our community rallying around other people in the community and really helping each other out

951
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:33,160
 Just because they are listeners to the same stupid podcast out there. That's how they met and

952
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:39,760
 Now they're really doing hard work for each other and making the world a better place. And so good job scoops

953
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:45,440
 I guess good job us, but we didn't really do anything but start talking into microphone catalyst at best

954
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:48,560
