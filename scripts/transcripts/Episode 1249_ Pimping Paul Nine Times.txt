 It's time for Matt and Mattingly's ice cream social sitting in Pittsburgh
 Pennsylvania that's Paul Mattingly. Sitting at sea it's Matt Donnelly sitting in
 Las Vegas the bad-ass me jacking the audio guy. We're preaching fun.
 I'm doing wonderful I'm out on the the seas outside of Canada. I said last week
 that I was gonna go to st. John Newfoundland and I was so excited. Turns
 out Canada's wicked wicked crazy with st. John's so it turns out it was st. John's
 New Brunswick and not St. John's Newfoundland. They're lousy with St. John's. Now I already have an
 affection for St. John and the Virgin Islands plus St. John's Newfoundland that I
 wasn't about to get off the boat for this St. New St. John. I was like I don't have room in my
 heart for a third St. John's. You have plenty of St. John's in your life you
 don't need more. Do any of these locations go by St. John's? Because that's a
 real thing you know. What going from St. John's to St. John's? Yeah well it's a
 there you remember Airwolf right? Of course I remember Airwolf. So Stringfellow
 Hawk yeah he was always looking for his brother
 St. John and that is a shortened way of saying St. John. So there were kids that
 were named St. John I just wondered if they ever if that ever applies to like
 cities. I'll open my porthole and ask. Okay. Anyone go by St. John? I'm just kidding my
 porthole over looks out into a wall. A wall in the boat? Yeah. My porthole looks out
 into the vast six feet away is a wall. That's what I. Oh you're just docked
 right now. No no no no. Oh no it's an internal porthole. It's an internal porthole. Oh my god. It is a glory porthole. I mean he might be docking
 right now as well. Oh yikes docking in a glory porthole. That's cameras from the
 waste up so we have no idea. We never will know. Are you ever gonna be on boats
 with Pipe to Plain again soon? I don't know. I'm on there they're joining the
 boat the ship that I'm on right now next week. Okay so ships in the night.
 We would have crossed paths on the day. Yeah. Like them getting on the way. Me
 getting off except that I am and now I have to get off early. Right. Here's the
 thing so I'm on the ship for four days and that's because originally they wanted
 me here for the week but the week started at Scoopfest and I said I can't
 do it I gotta go to Scoopfest. Right. Then I got this offer for Virgin Voyages to
 join Virgin and that was a two-week gig so I want to say yes to that and basically
 saying told by agent I will I will let go of this gig if it means you know if I
 have to just just to still do Virgin. Right. Yeah. And that would give me days
 off after Scoopfest. Would that be nice? So I was like there's no way they're
 gonna agree just to have me on this ship for four days but they're just going to
 just truncate the front and back end of the week and they did. Now you have
 discovered the true infinite money glitch that is cruise ship lines apparently.
 What also meant that means that I knew that I was getting on a performing like
 those I was doing shows. Right. And so was it when you got on? Yeah. I didn't do
 two shows that night. Wow. And then two shows the next night. Holy shit dude. How did that
 go? Luckily you were nice and rested. So yeah. So at Scoopfest I had the already
 had this hard task of it that I've never go away for three weeks and I'm away for
 three weeks and then on top of the three weeks I'm gone for on cruise ships I
 have two shows in Sparta New Jersey on October 16th and the Improv Jam reunion
 on October 18th. October 17th is the Sparta shows and so I had to pack for
 magic shows for all of those things plus materials you know I could go you know I
 go through materials things like that and and and so I was already pretty
 nerve-wracked plus I did magic at Scoopfest which means I had to bring stuff
 to Scoopfest so I had to bring it I had to perform and bring it home or whatever
 so the only chance I had to really pack with sanity was in the dinner break
 between daytime Scoopfest and nighttime Scoopfest. On Saturday. Yeah. Right. Which
 was a two-hour break and it was like a true two-hour break because we finished
 up right before the break started in the daytime session until we actually had
 about two hours between the daytime session and the jog versus nerd ball. And
 during Ice Cream Social I was getting notifications on my phone from Air
 Canada. Right. And I was like that's weird I mean I'm flying tomorrow but I can
 check in sure whatever. And they were and they were inappropriate messages right
 they were like dick pics and a lot of stuff. They were showing me that. They're
 basically saying no there was they were showing me mine and they're saying if
 you don't respond to these text messages we're putting these on the internet. So
 you didn't respond. And now they're out. Holy Mike Johnson!
 I don't know. Paul. Air Canada. Okay. I'd gotten an email like a week before
 whatever and I saw that they were shifting the time of my flight to like a
 half hour earlier and I said okay great. What I didn't realize was that they also
 shifted it to a day earlier. A day earlier than a half hour earlier. God damn! 24 hours and a half hour earlier. Yeah and this is Air Canada not not not my cruise
 booker right. Yeah right. The ticket was booked and then the airline moved it's the thing well they
 moved. Oh it's Air Canada so the times are metric. That explains it. That
 explains that explains the disconnect. It goes by how long it takes ice to melt.
 That's how they that's you know ancient ancient Phoenicians had sundials. Most
 things in Canada are based on how long it takes ice to melt. That's right. So I
 just spend the dinner break rescheduling my travel frantically just on the
 emergency line lines because suddenly I was not on the flight that I'm supposed
 to be on. Right. And and I should have been on there like the whole that's the
 whole thing and so I could. You know how to take the reservation but you don't
 know how to hold the reservation. And I so I basically had to come back to the
 jack-versus-nerd ball without knowing what I was doing the next day and then
 at the end of the costume parade I got an email saying that I had to be on a
 flight at a 6 a.m. flight so I had to be at the airport at 445 in the morning.
 That is some bullshit. Bullshit. And then because it was a last-minute flight it
 wasn't direct so I had to take three flights to get to Canada. Holy fuck man.
 So I was three flights total of 15 hours by the time I got to my hotel. They let you
 sit on the wing. And then I had to sleep and get up right away and just get to the
 ship. And it was like go to the ship there's a guy on a bike who just goes
 Matt Donnelly he goes yeah he goes forgive me it's my day off and he's just
 dressed in like head-to-toe and beautiful biker riding bike outdoor gear.
 Right. And I was like. Forgive it. Stranger? Yeah. But they're waiting for you get in
 there. And I was like oh I said I can't have gotten here any faster than me
 meeting my driver on time and my driver getting me out of time. I don't know what
 I could have done. Yeah. Step on it. What do you mean they're waiting for me what yeah.
 There's an extra C note in it for you if you get me there in time for my show.
 I get around to the port and the port because we have no record of you being here.
 I was literally just told two minutes ago and a hundred feet ago that you were
 waiting for me inside. Yeah. Apparently not that guy. So finally a guy from business
 comes out and basically reprimands someone at the dock for looking up my
 thing improperly. And then that person being very defensive and I was listening
 to a very snippy conversation. Guys guys guys could you please have this
 uncomfortable conversation after I get on to the boat. I would like to get on
 to the boat. You guys could have this conversation for as long as you want
 after I'm gone. And so this is like normal little gangway that goes right up
 to the fourth deck. Yeah. And then there's a zigzaggy gangway really long
 gangway that goes up to the seventh deck. And the person from Princess
 gestures me to the zigzaggy gangway that goes up three stories and I have two
 giant banks and my my backpack and bags and I was like are you sure I can't go up
 the little one yeah. Yeah. But there's like no that's where most of the guests
 are getting off to go into it's a Saint Joe to Halifax. And so I go to move like
 all my stuff and there's a guy you know working for the cruise like an eager
 young young guy English out of first language goes can I help you with that. I
 was like boy can you. You sure can. And he takes me up but I'm in a crew cabin not in a
 guest cabin. Yeah. And so we get on the ship and I was like showing him my room
 number and he's trying to get me to this the seventh deck where the crew for the
 regular cabins. Right. I'm trying to explain to him no no I'm in a crew
 cabin. Yeah. So he's stopping as he stops like a janitor and they and they speak
 Spanish to each other and the janitor's like no follow me. And I go through this
 ornate path where all said I'm like outside of the ship on this weird deck
 area where I'm like I don't know if this is supposed to be here then boom I'm
 into a crew area and then into finally into my cabin. And the good news is my
 cabin is 50 feet from the theater. Oh that's nice. Oh that's that's big. That's
 big. Yeah. Yeah. So I get all my stuff from the theater I'm back in the thing
 and then I realize I should go get like a cup of coffee or something to eat or
 something and I am walking aimlessly in the crew area. Please someone give me
 coffee. Try to find your way out. Yeah. No one no one showed me how to get out to the
 regular ship. Yeah. And so I see two guys and I'm like I'm just trying to get to
 like the I don't know regular part of the ship or like where the passengers go or
 whatever and they go who are you are you supposed to be back here what are you
 doing and I was like oh no. You've done it now. There is a there is a hard line
 like I said when we were doing second city tours we had a very fortunate
 situation where we had passes that were literally crew and passenger status.
 Right. We had both so we could we could go anywhere but yeah if you haven't been
 designated they get snippy. Yeah. But they they they figured it all out. Did you do
 a little quick bit of table side. Honestly or did they harpoon you. I straight up
 just I straight up just walked away. I walked up to another floor. I'm good. And
 then I went up there. You just left them arguing about who you might be. I was
 like I don't want to I don't want to do this. And now that's awesome. That's
 awesome. You know what I can find it on my own. You guys have a good day. Never
 mind. Yeah. So yeah it was it was it was it was a it was a big adventure to get
 here and then just do two shows right away and they went really well. Good. I
 was like I was like this could get this could have gone a lot better if I had if
 I was able to sleep. Yeah. Those shows were all right. Imagine if I had slept. So
 listener Chris Lowry is on the the he listens to the show and he and his wife
 book book travel for people. Yeah. Go with Lisa.com that's where they help set
 up people want to see me on the ship and stuff. And so Lisa his wife is on on the
 ship and I met her before. She's come to my Elton shows. They offered to take me
 out to dinner at the beautiful Crown Grill. Nice. On my on the second night I
 was on board and then they were telling me about how they ran into people who
 saw my show on St. John. I was like oh I don't think they're gonna tell me a
 story where they complimented me. She was like yeah one guy was like yeah it
 wasn't really for me a mind reader guy or whatever and I was like why are you
 telling me the story? Yeah. What the hell? Oh that's gonna make this next story super awkward then
 because I just saw several people that hated your show. I understand. I'm not
 for everyone. As I said as I said at Scoopfest you know you know you're not
 for everyone but as soon as you hear it it's devastating. They were also very
 critical about my outfit that I was wearing at the time. It really hurt. But
 they talked about how they basically said like oh we're going to the and
 basically the Crown Grill but they said the other name for another ship's
 steakhouse. Yeah. Cagney's I think it was called. Okay. And so then that so I go oh
 so they were coming here to this thing tonight that's what they told you they
 invited you to dinner to join them here and I go yeah so they're here yeah and I
 go like oh okay and we look around or whatever we don't see them. Just now
 getting back to my room from getting coffee for this episode I end up taking
 an elevator and two guys are like oh you're the mind bender guy and I go yeah
 yeah we saw your show the other night. I go yeah and then nothing.
 Yeah okay and then we saw the whole thing we saw all of it and then the
 awkward silence the guy goes I think we saw you the night at Cagney's you're
 having dinner with Lisa and I go oh my god it's them. It's the guys they were
 talking to. It's the eyes not for me. It's not for me guy. Amazing. I'm face to
 face with two guys who definitely did not enjoy my show. Fucking shit. That's
 great. And it was like a tea like a bet like a murder she wrote mystery novel
 where like I had the key I had the key that they they named the steakhouse the
 wrong steakhouse and it's the only thing they could have said to clue you in. This
 is confirmed but they did not enjoy my show. Yeah. We saw your show the other
 night. It was a show. There were chairs and everything. Hey Eureka is making a
 great point in the chat here. She's saying Matt is upset that Noah
 compliments his show but when he runs into audience members he doesn't
 compliment them either and that's a really good point. Yeah. I have to go
 back and tell those guys nice hats. Nice hats assholes. We have to do that. Oh you
 guys were great at Cagney's the other night. I saw you order that steak. Amazing
 work. Yeah well Eureka I'm not upset that no one compliments my show. I'm thrown
 off when people insist on telling me a story that someone did not enjoy my show.
 That is weird man. That's weird. I have no problem hearing nothing. That's
 different. That's different. Is that what is that where your brain goes after you've
 booked people on thousands of travel experiences is that you just get to like
 oh yeah well you know a lot of people just hate you and they don't really. Yes.
 I mean people definitely get into that state of mind of like none of this
 matters to me so why would it matter to you. Right. Yes. Right. That's the
 energy of like we're just shooting the breeze I just know this I know that. Yeah.
 These guys hated your show but it like in their mind she's sitting there
 thinking like oh Matt has done this show so many times. Well surely people have
 disliked the show before. It can't bother him it's just water off a duck's
 back like who cares. We're being harsh too. It wasn't that he hated it just wasn't for
 him. Oh no no he actually sent me a message as well. I have that to read in school mail. He did. He hated it.
 The way the story actually goes is that the subtext of the stories is told to me
 is basically didn't didn't believe I was an actual mind reader. Oh really. Well in that case I've got good news for them. They were they were right. So this is
 Simon Cowell's cousin. I should make no claims during my show that I am like I
 set the premise of the trip but I do I do know I basically like all of my stuff
 as if I'm doing any mind reading bits it's all comedic. Right. Like I get the
 results correct but I all I'm trying to do is make sure it's funny along the
 way and that's the it is the weird it's the weird thing I imagine but you it's
 a you can't deny it if someone goes like I don't think you really do that you're
 like that's right that's correct and so if you're upset with me for even towing
 the line for claiming to have superpowers I could if that upsets you I
 get it like I can't do anything about it. It's it's it's it's the deal. Right. All
 right I did it Jacob. Nailed it. I said Orica's name correctly on air. Oh nice. Oh
 I am impressed. I know I noted that I have never heard I'd never heard the
 pronunciation correct and I was like oh it's Orica. Yeah yeah took me 12 years and
 and herself in my abracadabra to get it right but that's what happened. Finally
 got it. Oh man Jacob you're gonna ask me for a sponsor and I can't access my
 phone so I'm gonna go over to a webpage and open it up there. Oh nice. Well while
 you're doing that we'll just we'll just talk a little bit about scoop fest here
 we just had our big scoop fest. It was amazing. It was fantastic. We are all
 almost recovered and by all I mean like fucking everybody I imagine. I mean I
 don't buddy. Yeah everybody got beat. I didn't get COVID this time. Well there's
 that. That I know of. Yeah but also like legit like I felt like everyone not just
 us I felt like the attendees were like Jesus by the end of it. Yeah well
 actually I was having a conversation with Ryre the night of the loadout
 because we even commented during the during the show during the scoop fest
 podcast that the energy kind of like went weird in the room for a while and
 we and we were kind of chatting about that and the energy of the of the whole
 thing and it really seems like everyone came to scoop fest as you know in a way
 that you would expect which is a relief you know they're coming to scoop fest as
 this as a big energy relief thing and especially by the end of it everyone was
 kind of like sitting in that lull. Yeah I don't know it was it was a it was an
 interesting it was an interesting thing. Yeah I think I think so I think I think
 this I really you know we talked about this on a few episodes back but like I
 that is it is a crazy time yeah and I think and I think during Penn Sunday
 School live like Penn really hung a lantern on it in terms of talking to his
 children yeah you guys don't know but this actually is incredibly unusual
 right and like what's happening is impossible yeah and so you know none of
 this that is happening can happen it's none it's all impossible but it's
 happening anyway yeah yeah yeah and the show's also 12 years old or whatever 11
 years old and so are indeed our we've all gotten older we're older and so is
 everyone else maybe the evening festivities started 7 and not 8 wrap up
 around 7 I don't know I don't know about all that we're all gonna go to the
 sizzler and have dinner around 4 no I mean like something to spearheads the
 the the nighttime programming and stuff I was like panicking trying to add stuff
 and then by the time it all went down I was like oh I put a lot of stuff up here
 oh yeah we need we need I did have I did maybe over program some some of some
 nights there was activities no lulls though that's for sure no I mean to go
 in order a bucket show crushed so fun yeah big thanks to Brenna, Mark, Robert, Mark
 that was fantastic that's again and like I had so many scoops coming up and saying
 it was the first time they'd seen a bucket show and I was like well hope you
 like that one because it's never gonna get any better that was actively telling
 people to not come back to future bucket shows because that one was that was to
 be the best one I don't know if I went quite that far but I just said that is
 the best it's close yeah as close if you came to see both those shows shit I
 don't know man I know it's tell you that's great we're doing we're doing one
 of Tunis Tavern like real soon it's like October 23rd let's oh we're gonna crush
 that one we already sold some tickets for it let's not know we're gonna crush
 that one because that one was already planned that one was a was a carve out
 and Paul statement never see another one unless you've already planned to see no
 it was just it'll be better it was just really it's just one of those things too
 again and even like I was doing that interview for the documentary and I
 recounted our first meeting Matt and how you had friends in the audience that
 night after we'd done our show and they asked you how long we've been working
 together yes it's just well it's just one of those things it just kind of
 remind me again it's like we had two brand new people who we hadn't played
 with and forever don't play with regularly and it was like you know forget
 it I had never I had never coached Brenna's impromptu team yeah or one with
 Brenna yeah I just knew we just we vibrate Brenna obviously his podcast
 co-hosts and friends and stuff and she always said like oh we should all just
 shook around some time everybody it's a cold runner and everybody hey wave to
 all scoops she's got to go pick up our giz from the grandparents so she's she's
 running across the state to go grab the doggy yeah yes yeah rainbow bright shirt
 represent me be safe sweetheart holler if you need anything I love you
 too did you guys have a favorite part of scoop fest no I mean so many as well as
 I was trying to zip through an order because the next day was the barbecue
 right and Jacob you cooked barbecue pulled pork and yeah my god dude you
 fucking crushed that too oh it was so good I really wish I could have got more
 of that pork but I I didn't get enough but it was good yeah the food Alex
 Bartman made fresh pizzas for everybody oh yeah - the pizza was great yep the
 food was the food was all was all solid SJ made SJ's famous mac and cheese that
 shit was great - yeah so we all we all pitched in a little bit this year
 instead of doing any we didn't or last year we cooked the main stuff and then
 ordered the sides and this year we said now fuck it we're not ordering anything
 yeah we're doing it all it was really good and it was it was nuts it was nuts
 for you guys to pull off all the stuff you pulled off yeah it was windy it was
 the only thing we didn't account for was wind I remember driving a day and it
 rained for like two minutes I was like rain we have not we have no backup plan
 for rain dead if it rains I had a germ of a plan but it wasn't a good plan it
 was not a good plan at all yeah yeah yeah I mean scuba nova girl in the chat
 is saying everyone cram into Jacob's house that was gonna be plan B yeah yeah
 yeah I feel like we were definitely just gonna get to plan B well as funny as it
 was it was still pretty hot and the Sun was pretty blazy and you know you had
 that shade wall everybody just rammed up against the shade wall yeah and then I
 got really red to the point where scoops were like are you okay I had to let them
 know that that's just what the Mattingly jeans do I just get real red looking I'm
 fine I didn't I didn't burn like you can see I don't have a sunburn at all but I
 just I got really red I look like I'm gonna explode when I'm mowing the lawn
 out here like if I come inside just be at and hands it's like oh my god you're a
 lobster I'm like it's just what I do my body just it gets that's you know that's
 how I'm getting the heat out it comes to the front but yeah I do I radiate
 exactly a pine of plane played the barbecue they were fantastic that was
 the that was the biggest swing I did I pulled for this one was that my friends
 from Ireland were all off they weren't they weren't obligated to be on ships so
 I said if you're available let's get you in here and so they I flew them in from
 Ireland to be here is their first time in Vegas and they just were absolutely
 blown away by the exhausted and I had to write them a note being like you know
 it's very common that people love Las Vegas and also think three days is
 plenty right oh yeah and that was the case for them they were definitely like
 just wiped at the end sure but they yeah they crushed it at Jacob's house and
 they're they're just that I love those guys so much and they're so charming and
 they're such they're great at what they do and it's they've such different
 personalities and they all find a way to really shine and it's really funny and I
 like them and so yeah they I was I was very emotional watching them play in
 Jacob's backyard yeah it was great it was a very scary deal for me we were
 supposed to have you you're talking about the wind we were supposed to have
 another entertainer at the at the barbecue but the wind kept Michael Doe
 from being able to juggle at the barbecue right so much no it's Parkinson's yes
 and he asked it he said yes to doing school first before he knew he had it
 right because obligation and then he has to juggle you know 500 throws every day
 to make sure he can keep movement in his body and be able to do what he does for
 a living while he fights this vicious disease and then it's fucking windy as
 hell yeah it's windy we might not go and I said oh you can't you don't want to go
 he goes well I can do it the show will be funny but there will be no juggling in
 it and then he said no successful juggling throwing but not not catching
 okay let's let's let's just call it so I was aggravated too because it was like
 it was perfect all afternoon and then like 20 minutes before Godot was was
 set to go up that's when the wind kicked up yeah like it was it was and then like
 half an hour later it was it was back to being like there was a light breeze but
 it was fine after that still but yeah it was crazy it was crazy for a minute yeah
 yeah oh and then but he still was phenomenal yeah one then he did the
 variety show yeah yeah yeah so then that night we surprised the audience with a
 reuniting of two characters in a clown shortly after the very recent breakup of
 the podcast to do a podcast battle Jimmy Sonina dressed in full clown regalia he
 did was delightfully ironic because in their Cirque show it's Johnny and RJ
 have to wear a lot of makeup and Jimmy doesn't and so it's very funny for Jimmy
 coming full makeup while they were there goes and we had delightful trivia
 battle hosted by Mikey for between between us and they won yep they did
 spoiler alert because we're gonna put those in our patreon feed like always
 and so that was really fun then while I was doing my shows at the Magic Castle a
 month ago someone on my special like touring company feed on my abracadabra
 babble which is a whatsapp thread right I share my my all my all my adventures
 and someone said why aren't you and Nick doing scoop fest and I literally just
 turned to him backstage like good point Nick what are you doing this dates like

 that we did the Magic Castle at scoop fest which is so fun because in our set
 I get to do an illusion with Nick that he normally does with his wife and I
 love doing this bit it was great the whole thing was great that whole that
 whole show was really really good so you make you make an excellent magic
 assistant Matt this is this is a running gag right that was really funny that bit
 was funny Alex Ramone had a bit in his show where he has someone called
 misdirection and then his regular show he used to show girl as misdirection and
 we did the Magic Castle I came out as misdirection and the foolers tour I came
 out as misdirection and telling me to just improvise and dance and pretend I'm
 a showgirl is not a tall not a tall ask for me in any way no I I will I will fake
 dance until the Sun comes up and basically it's also me going like I have

 and Emily when they're playing Gary I don't know how to like tell people what
 you're gonna see right now because you're like I guess she's a juggler but
 like not really a juggling show like it's just this beautiful piece she does
 called the book of love and I know this because she ran into this with it's now
 it's now part of the party over at Las Vegas at the cosmopolitan right and same
 thing where she said like hey you know I can do this bit in the show and I heard
 she told me you know I hope I'm not betraying any confidences but she said
 that they were a little like what I don't know or whatever and she basically
 was like just let me do it yeah yeah because like whenever she does she did
 that she was part of like the magic live one year she had the whole bit of magic
 live and got like standing ovations for it it's like it's not I'm yeah it's just
 this beautiful really cool beautiful art piece you get some of the audience and
 does this whole arc of love with these juggling comedy bits and it's just
 beautiful that's funny and it's and she's just a brilliant person it's funny

 next on its own and it just it it flows and it works yeah and they're both they

 audio from that recording after that terrible incident yeah we should not have
 aired that that was tragic yeah well that's what you get for recording
 commercials on ring cameras it's very on tour but sometimes every now and then
 you get a home invasion in a whole damn it we're just trying to do some ads here
 every now and then you get a home invasion what you're gonna do so on to
 day two technically day three and also technically day one yes yeah how this
 keeps happening to us how we get tired of these things yeah is the variety show
 and this year was the most like frogs in a wheelbarrow year ever you know for
 those expression but they're trying to keep frogs in a wheelbarrow they keep
 hopping out you know we try to get new people in and and and still honor if
 other people want to come back and do it and you know there are people that were
 on board up until like days before bailing out there are people who want to
 do it but then like took jobs a month ago that left town like and it just was
 like I just kept watching the thing and at one point I was texting Jacob like
 days beforehand being like I'm really in my head about this right this year's
 variety show and I was coming up with like backup plans of maybe doing
 violin prob with Maeve Kennedy from the trio how funny like I was like really
 like what's happening and then some things just fall in our lap like Stapes
 was still in town just around or what JD was like you know Stapes is down I was
 like oh right we got Stapes that was great days before Harrison Greenbaum
 calls me up as is hey I'm gonna happen to be at the Rio this week are you in
 town I was like well that scoop vest and of course Harrison was like yeah down no
 problem yeah so good he was goddamn that was so good it's like really happy about
 it and someone I've been trying to get through for years to do it because we we
 have a lot of friends in the burlesque community and like to go a little
 burlesque and we're Vegas we could throw in a little a little a little fun
 burlesque although we our cabin is always like hey as weird as you want to
 be oh yeah like whatever shits like been too weird for other burlesque shows do
 it do it here yeah go oh like I mean jumping ahead hazel performed and hazel
 and I spoke a month or so earlier and she was like I I could do just like a
 classic burlesque thing and and just come out and be pretty and and have
 pretty costumes and fans and everything I was like that's great people will love
 it I'm sure if you do it you can also do your weird stuff yeah the weird the
 weird stuff will play and she came out on stilts just like a giant tree yeah
 she was a hint from Lord of the Rings and she was tree beard a sexy stripping
 in the Lord of the Rings beard it was amazing two tiny hobbit dolls that she
 made kiss and make out with each other and they stripped - yep and but I finally
 we've tried in the past with our friend Nick Byler came by who does this really
 incredible act in absent and he's just and he's also in disco studies the the
 host they're extremely talented fascinating guy yes he does this really
 we did this really weird thing in the show hot trashed or the pandemic where
 he tries to make a banana daiquiri while trying to still hit a triangle on the
 notes during this one song it's this conflict between trying to make the
 daiquiri and at the triangle all while he's wearing just a banana a skirt made
 of actual bananas right and it was great to have some equal representation from
 the male side of the burlesque world and then I had Jonas Wilburton and I forgot
 that I was also burlesque a bit yeah yeah but he was a very funny John John
 McEnroe uh-huh where he has the audience hit him with tennis balls and so he does
 a seer wheel which you know those of you in the circus world are familiar but
 those you may not be it's a big giant steer steel wheel it looks like a giant
 hula hoop a steel ring that he is able to manipulate and swirl around and this
 was a steel ring with a radius of about what six and a half feet or not radio
 yeah what's the thing across the circle whatever that distance is radius right
 yeah this was the smallest stage he'd ever perform this yeah we only gave him
 eight feet of space he had done it on a on a nine-footer I think maybe mm-hmm he
 he had kept next to me like there's a version I can do without the wheel I
 said then let's do that and he goes well just send me the dimensions anyway and I
 said the dimensions and he goes oh that's pretty small I go then don't do
 the wheel just do the other part and he goes okay well I'll bring the wheel just
 in case and I go okay and then he sends me we load in and I see it's a carpet
 and stage which is again not ideal for zero it's carpeted so if you don't want
 to do the wheel do not do the wheel and yes all right I probably won't but I'll
 bring it just in case yeah and then not only was it carpeted but it had ent
 leaves and leftover banana daiquiri all over it tomato juice yes it had tomato
 seeds banana juice and fucking leaves so I would I had been sketching stuff away
 with my foot the whole time because I knew that wheel was coming trying to
 make sure that was oh yeah but we all were we were all like try to clean the
 stage as much as possible I told him afterwards I said that was fucking brave
 dude and it was amazing but it was it was also really really funny and really
 really awesome one coming up on in November he's doing a show over at the
 Vegas Theatre Company so we're gonna have him on as a guest oh great great
 great great yeah yeah but yeah Brenna did in more another goblin burlesque
 Stephen Roberts came by crush to do a stand-up yeah that's not a not a show
 without Stephen yeah and without personal highlight for me was Michael
 Gudeau yeah yeah and seeing Mike do it seem like you don't do it it was so good
 it was so funny and holy fuck yeah we talked about it at the at the con but
 uh you forget we're friends with Michael Gudeau we hang out we chat with Michael
 Gudeau we all forget that you get Michael Gudeau on stage and he's a
 goddamn killer I mean it's just what he's gonna get on stage and just do it
 it's crazy to me too I was lucky enough to go see him with the Lance Burton show
 way back in the day right and this is when I was first working with second
 city as a full-time second city and a class act that Lance Burton is he called
 me out in the show had me stand up and wave to the people cuz nice cuz Lance
 Burton knows how to be a fucking entertainer yeah you know we help each
 other we talk each other up right that's what it's about and that that had that
 moment has stuck with me and just like the fact that Michael Gudeau and Mac
 King both specifically came out to watch us do the bucket show I got I put it up
 on our Facebook and whatnot Mac tweeted about it because he loves come see us
 which is just so amazing to me cuz he's one of my heroes too we have we have
 fucking strip performer royalty at this fucking thing yeah like real deal you
 can't get any higher on the totem pole how many shows did he say he'd done it
 was 19 years 19 years thousands and thousands yeah I mean it's nuts and I
 just forget like he just gets the audience right in that pocket and as soon
 as soon as they're there you're like oh I forgot it's just cruises yeah from
 here like it just he just is so funny and there's so many gags and he just
 nails them and it just was like oh god it was great he really you really that
 was the second time I was very emotional at scoop fest was was that right there
 was really awesome it's a big moment it's a big moment I again I'm just I'm
 just honored that that not to say that Harrison's ice stacking prediction via
 9/11 theme didn't really I loved that too my brother was involved in that trick
 and that made it even more special for me it's only it's only appropriate
 because your brother was involved in the in the real day too right involved
 involved is a big way to say helped out with building seven but I mean you know
 you sure you say what you want to say involved masterminded I know he won't
 take credit for the master minding of it but that's only because he's modest
 then we had our mouth finger bottle competition oh yes oh my gosh it gets
 better every year I so all through scoop fest I make it a point so we you know
 our room there at the Orleans our big our big convention room there at the
 Orleans it's right off of the main hall in their convention space there's other
 conventions going on while we're there there was some religious thing going on
 on one side of us there was a family reunion going on on the other side of
 us so I made it a point to as much as possible keep those main doors open
 but no no no figure but I'll just during the whole goddamn thing it is it is
 entertaining for me to watch people walk past those doors it's the reason that I
 keep them open I love watching you watching watching people look in and be
 like oh I do it every year I love it during my there was a crowd of people at
 the doors with just pure confused look it was great at one point I went to you
 know use the facilities and I was in a bathroom stall in the men's room and I
 heard two guys talking go like yeah they're not really checking any badges
 over there that whatever that scoop thing is going over there and then the
 other goes yeah but like what the hell's going on over there one guy's like we
 could just go in there they're not gonna stop us and the other guys like yeah but
 should we do I want to do that dare I dare I let my freak flag fly what I'm
 trying to put an obelisk I believe inside of me I don't know how they were
 gonna do it that makes me laugh they're not checking badges like you wouldn't
 know like you wouldn't stick out like a sore fucking thumb if you weren't a
 scoop or if you weren't at least down to clown this year our mystery our mystery
 gift was a fez yeah where you could bejeweled so we had a bejeweling
 station you could you could you could which was a stroke of genius by the way
 that bejeweling station was that worked out well that goes that I mean easier
 than that goes up Michael Osroth is basically our director of scoop fest at
 this point he really is he did a fantastic job with these these turned out
 awesome he kicks everything uphill for us well we tried it well we all pull our
 hair out trying to pull off school fest and and acts as a wonderful ambassador he
 and Laurie in the party room to help really initiate and introduce other
 scoops to each other in the party room really gets the conversations going and
 that that vibe carries on the show itself we were running in the new tariff shit
 we were running all kinds of stuff yeah and I we really wanted pink robes to
 continue the robe theme to figure out the Neapolitan effect we had vanilla now
 we have a strawberry and and and then what's coming next chocolate robes I
 said get warm and some experience pain I do an idea to mess with it okay but but
 I don't remember the game of the idea of Fes but then Fes is like I think it was
 me it might have been you I mean we could look through that we could look
 through the text but I think it was me I'm not taking I know it wasn't me so
 that's I'll give you full credit okay it was me it was it was you or it was you
 or Michael yeah me and Michael I think but Mike but again so many times were
 like oh because of this is getting expensive because of this we can't do it
 or whatever and else fraud just kept after it yeah to make sure that we had
 everything we wanted to deliver to the scoops the way we wanted yeah I have
 ideas and Michael actually makes them happen
 it's yeah exactly ideas yeah those of you guys listening just just picture
 casino floor and a bunch of people in pink robes and maroon fezzes with a big
 not a cult on the back we're going in and out of the casino right and it is
 the best site it is the funniest thing to walk into it's just so funny it's so
 good it's just great so yeah and during all this yeah I think I think we'd figure
 it out we had a documentary crew running around during all this yes
 capturing all this madness yeah yeah it was just really really great and yeah a
 supernova girl in Chad saying the group photo never happened yeah I just want to
 note an entire documentary happened so just just yeah there's gonna be there's
 gonna be like clear we really didn't cover it yeah I mean if you really want
 to get technical like hundreds of thousands of group photos happened as
 the documentary goes on we also we did we did a group photo with the at the
 ball too at the job we did we did we did do that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we
 usually do one earlier in the in the event yeah but yeah we did one at the
 ball this year yeah I have great news I just got a text message I'm being
 offered it's not even it's not even asking me to to respond to it and to
 apply for it I'm being offered a new job right now it's only gonna take 60 to 90
 minutes a week some weeks at most 60 minutes a day 250 dollars no they're
 willing to pay me up to $3,000 a week get out of here yeah you have to murder

 position that's nice and no experience necessary so they're gonna give me
 three thousand dollars a week and they don't even care that I don't know what
 the gig is I it feels too good to be true but it must be yeah this is I mean
 it is a hard time to be looking for work right now and yeah this shit happens to
 us and we're not even looking for work right you know what I mean like fucking
 every day it's fucking nuts I feel so bad yes oh yeah in the chat a wall scoop
 says even if they crash scoop fest what would you have done if they were
 enjoying themselves and not being disruptive excellent point and the
 answer to that is probably nothing well that's why I just commented I said exactly
 we just try to obelisk him yeah we give him some poker chips and say please
 download our shit that's what I do all day long man
 get it out chips and hey check us out yeah yeah it was nuts it was nuts
 now figure but whole oh those are things that we had a confessional booth set up
 oh I know our separate repeat I am excited to hear those I haven't heard
 anything I don't know and one of our old friends was a Piper was behind there
 helping out and I said are you having she was there and also you haven't
 functions oh I'm having a blast because it is so great to be in the room where
 I'm not the weirdest person in the room oh and I said like think of it - yeah by
 my beautiful beautifully said and I was like that's exactly what I want people
 feel like yeah they come to the best you know it's like that's exactly it's all
 about letting your freak flag fly man yeah we don't give a shit it's like you
 know yeah yeah we're welcome very welcoming community yeah look at that
 we're up to 40 participants that's a new record for the chat guys we're doing it
 that's growing what else was it scoop fest we had the mouth finger butthole
 tournament we had all of the quizzes with Mikey oh which yeah yes oh yeah he
 outdid himself again this year oh uh we should say on the show too several
 people asked about it at scoop fest people saw some medical attendance
 checking out Mikey at one point that was just a it was a very minor thing no big
 deal everybody is perfectly fine it was the casino being a little overly
 cautious just having their people check check Mikey out after a little slip and
 fall that we checked on him he was okay yeah everybody's good they were they
 were everybody was healthy and happy oh then we had oh Celestia thank you
 scuba cabra in the chat for reminding me Celestia was there doing caricatures
 yes jock versus third ball whole every time I walked over to see what she had
 done for for a new group of people over there it was more disgusting and more
 wonderful well anything I will say my brother was like oh we should get a we
 should get a caricature and so I did play my scoop card and got cut sees in
 line to do a dare you I know but it was you know I see my brother maybe twice a
 year if I'm lucky in person so it was really nice to actually get a moment to
 come to have this and we've got a year we have to get Celestia to do one of the
 three of us yes yes we should well I mean shit she'll do that hard to go sit
 for that anytime you know what maybe we can have her do that during the zoom
 because we're having her on soon we can do that because I'd love to I'd love to
 get one and put out put it up in the new chart well we'll talk we'll talk to her
 about that when we have her on next and see if she can just watch us during a
 zoom if that would be enough for her to get us I'm sure it would would work yeah
 so she was incredible like and also I had a personal highlight with the
 Pollywood Squares that fucking tell us about Pollywood Square what happened
 there so I was a little worried because of the board I was kind of like all this
 work into this fucking thing and if this doesn't go well it's gonna be the worst
 but then Ryar summed it up. Last year at SkooFest I was like the only note I have was
 not enough Paul was not enough Paul that was my whole thing and so like like we did a
 lot of stuff a lot of things but Paul you know was not I basically was like
 Paul is funny we're trying to get him involved we were trying to get you to
 host a little bit of the trivia battles and so the adjustments we made was let's
 let's take on everybody in trivia so that it's right it's it's Paul and us
 against everybody instead of having two podcasts face each other right and then
 my brain was like oh Hollywood Squares but everyone's Paul that's Paul's
 characters all of Paul's characters and I we reach out big there's a way to do
 with technology but I go no no I want a physical clunky awkward big square yes
 where we have to move squares around Paul and I of course turned to Ryar
 Appledorn to be like you you know what I'm talking about you know what this
 means so Ryar Appledorn made the biggest clunkiest Hollywood Squares board that
 could even fit through the door right with hangable X's and O's it was like
 nine feet what was it was like nine feet by nine feet it was huge yeah yeah and and that
 was the the thing Ryar and and Mike were bringing it out and Ryar said they
 couldn't hardly fit it through the door right and it started off well they
 couldn't fit it through the door that's why they had to come through the a
 different area from backstage on stage it started to crumple and bend and fuck
 up and the moment it started to just fall apart Ryar was just like oh this is
 gonna be perfect and he was right he was right the stupidity of it all just
 added just layers of dumb and it just oh it was so good it was down you were you
 were Paul Lind Johnny Australia yeah Truman Capote which is a new one in the
 day Mumra Mumra my favorite Paul Stanley vampire Bill Cosby
 barrel child barrel child yeah oh man and it was we were just asking trivia
 questions and making Paul's characters answer all of them Paul just came
 buckled right into the format of knowing how to play Hollywood Squares and I
 watched a lot as a kid yeah yeah and it was hysterical it was so fun it's really
 good I was like and I was like you were like I would know I was like this is I
 as soon as it came in my head I was like hit it's in and it was floating is like
 I could we could do this multiple times like I was like if anything short I was
 like do another round with more care even one point Jake was like well if
 it's good and I was like no this is good I don't know why there was doubting I
 don't know why there was doubting this pimping Paul nine times is exactly what
 the show needs and at the end Paul was almost guilty about how well I went he
 said so it felt a little self-indulgent and I was like you're festival it's true
 yeah yeah we're at a festival of you talking about that's all good we're at a
 festival about you yeah and we are celebrating a show that has your name in
 the title it was it's it's possibly a little self-indulgent in some way the
 whole thing is self-indulgent right now on the list right with mouth finger
 butthole it is now just a it's just on the list yeah yeah it's like that could
 be done at churnouts too yeah yeah well now we've got an idea for it for for
 zoom too I've got an idea for it for on camera oh hell yeah yeah yeah mini
 version that Paul can just stick his head through that sounds fucking
 fantastic it's gonna be great that is good good good it was fucking hot shit
 and it made me laugh too so that was great yeah I'll tell you what else Paul
 is gonna stick his head through and that's the following sponsor pizza for
 your hands that's right no more chewing with that pesky mouth of yours now
 there's pizza for hands hello I'm Reginald Felicity Guinevere and I have
 invented pizza mittens that's right pizza mittens cooked fresh every day
 made to order slathered in the finest of pasta sauces and mozzarella cheese the
 mittens are then placed on your hand piping hot and it's like the old Edward
 40 hands days remember those days remember being an Edward 40 hands do
 you ever have friends do that to you and when 40 hands they would take a cold 40
 of alcohol and they would duct tape the 40 to your hand and then you had to
 drink the 40 because it was so cold to drink the 40 quickly to stop all the
 cold really fast is a similar thing but with pizza as mittens and so the pizza
 comes on it's pretty hot so you got to eat the pizza very quickly to get the
 heat off your hands but then the heat goes in your mouth and you burn your
 mouth but it's still really good it's still really really good yes yes yes
 yes and her haste groups to check out pizza mittens
 so then what else what else was oh Gabrielle Lester just destroyed she
 just crushed Gabrielle yeah so fun and that was Carrie's mom who was up there
 with her I believe she's just known as mama scoop now yeah so so for those of
 you who don't know I hope I'm not putting anybody on blast here but Carrie
 brought her sister and her mother which is great and I think her sister spent
 more time than she thought she would hanging out with some of the events her
 mom certainly did her mom wasn't sure she was gonna enjoy it at all clearly
 she did oh by the end of it her mom was in yeah and I thought even by the end of
 it halfway through it mom was in I believe this was on Friday they got the
 hard news that their brother had suffered a stroke mmm oh jeez yes and so
 that yeah mom was upset sister's upset or Carrie's upset they're all fucking you
 know it's rough because it's in fees in Florida right what can you do
 luckily scoopfest acted as a distraction and by the end of the event his health
 had improved he was doing much better of course still you know not an ideal
 situation but things are going better and yeah yeah yeah so I think not only
 did it like it helped as a distraction and everything but yeah it was really
 cool seeing mom scoop find out what this community is all about and kind of just
 get with it it's pretty crazy the shenanigans that is involved in this
 community yeah yeah but yeah Gabrielle was was great and then we brought back
 the pie the plane people to play for everybody to play for all the people not
 just the barbecue and of course that culminated with sweet Caroline we finally
 got to combine the the two bits the one the one that we knew yelling fucking
 whore in between the bits and then again a great time to be looking out of the
 front door of the convention hall and watching the people walking by oh I bet
 I bet did they lose their fucking minds I bet those oh pure confusion it's
 wonderful and then adding in I don't believe you you're making it up and so
 we finally got both bits combined into sweet Caroline yeah and while we were
 shouting it Phil just turned the Fionn and said what is happening right now
 right who knows they know they were confused but they loved it right I mean
 they they just yeah well here's the funniest thing okay so one of the things
 that happened behind the scenes was you know they say we'll take requests and we
 hadn't take a break to do Hollywood Squares and so in the break people
 come up to me give me different songs you know one of things that what's it
 called Princess of the City or whatever that's not the famous Irish song is by
 the Pogues oh it's a what's it called a New York City fairy tale or something
 like that yeah fairy tale of New York that's what it's called very very New
 York it's a traditionally Chris it's a Christmas song but it's it's crazy it's
 about the deterioration of this long-term relationship these two people
 that grow to hate each other and yeah it's real it's a beautiful song but it
 isn't originally traditionally a Christmas song they're just cracking up
 going like I guess we'll just play it even though it's a Christmas song Merry
 Christmas yeah and then another song someone came up to Fionn and again just
 like you know time and culture and everything else he's the he plays the
 flute in the band and someone came to feel it was like oh would you play like
 the orange flute of blah blah blah or whatever I don't know the name of the
 song no that was it and film just dead face was like ah maybe I don't know if
 we know that one and in this face is that it is a song about the English like
 conquering the Irish like the orange flute is about like the orange like yeah
 it's like you were not playing that it's like when I first when I first start
 when I was first sitting there at the barbecue watching I was like I wonder if
 they'll do like the the Outlander theme and I was like that's Scotland you
 dumb I didn't say anything but I was like the Outlander theme that would be
 and I went that's fucking Scotland you don't even doubt shut your fucking yeah
 people who are from Scotland do not want to be told they're from Ireland and vice
 versa and vice versa it's very key thing I don't know why anyone would do it yeah
 very crazy Ozzy no I'm not gonna I'm not gonna touch that so there we go and they
 never played long distance no they didn't play long distance we didn't ask
 we didn't ask them to learn long distance that's okay I'm sure they know
 it I'm sure I'm sure they've just picked it up by just hearing it on the radio on
 the international radio stations all the time so that being like I can't believe
 somebody's ass that's great basically get any other situation we would just be
 entirely offended but it was like let's just let it go I'm sure it was just an
 earnest request and not a lot of behind it not realizing what it meant and yeah
 yeah that's amazing that's amazing orange flute that's it the old orange flute
 oh yeah yeah this is just this is about this is the story of the Irish version
 of Benedict Arnold basically betraying the Irish to the English yes so now so
 now it's not a song that they play all the time is it but it but is it a
 traditional Irish song and not it it recounts a terrible time for the Irish
 but it is the one that I'm finding here is by the Dubliners and it was done in
 19 it was released in 1965 so that would be that would seem to say it well it is a
 traditional Irish song but just of a very sensitive topic yeah it'd be a
 different thing we've gotten out of the knowledge that I have okay I have is
 entirely based on reading these lyrics here and that's it I love that they did
 a wild Rover because when I used to sing at the bar at Star Trek the experience
 when I was doing I'd do a Klingon opera occasionally we would get some Irishmen
 in who and we'd swap songs it was great and they did Wild Rover and I learned
 Wild Rover yeah and so I knew Wild Rover and then but I knew a call for Wild
 Rover it's an offensive call I don't know they were ready for it I don't know
 if they've ever heard it but it's you know that I've played the Wild Rover for
 many a year and I don't know this but then he goes and it's no name never
 right up your ass no never her no more will I play the Wild Rover no never no
 more so but that I learned that from other Irishman so it is a legit call
 response move for that song but yeah that was great they played that one too
 yeah yeah they were just it was great and I sent them to they got to go to
 Mystere while they were here oh fantastic did they get to do a backstage tour - no
 they had to get back and play the show at least they got to see it that's cool
 I said I sent it to Piff Piff the next day so you'd see Piff show the next day
 yeah next day Penn Sunday School live if you it's coming out this week just just
 check it out Penn coming back from England fighting a nasty nasty cult yeah
 tough it out for scoop fest of him telling a story about Piff Piff is there
 so Piff comes out from backstage and surprises the audience very funny Jets
 it's Piff the magic dragon and he's got a steel chair I got to do my if
 impression spot-on yeah oh yeah yeah I could oh said and there's a really good
 it was a really really fine episode of Penn Sunday School especially all things
 considered Penn's health but it was it was great yeah then Piff stayed by he
 broke down his appearance on foolish with Hondro that was funny that's the
 funniest thing is that you know Penn want people I know if Penn was sticking
 around Penn can stick around cuz he was sick you want to know if Hondro's gonna
 call in the Hondro wasn't available to call in sent a small video but I was
 like I was there I'll help or whatever and I just should know better by now the
 Piff the magic dragon is always ten steps ahead of everyone got it has
 already planned everything yeah and so I tried to you'll hear if we play that it
 will play it on those feet or not I'm not sure I don't think it's maybe it's
 good audio that video but I try to help early and then there's a point where I
 just realized I should just shut up he's got it he's got it yeah yeah and and he
 just it just did a very funny presentation of all of breaking down his
 this is disastrous appearance it was a disaster it was it was funny to watch
 live yeah I mean it really is it's up there with your cutting the tip of your
 finger off at that performance that you did I mean it's the same kind of thing
 yeah yeah and Piff had a perfect sense of humor about it it was great oh sure
 yes and Hondro will probably develop a sense of humor about it one day well I
 mean he was good enough to leave a message that was nice yes their trivia
 battle with great night our epic battle continues yes you're now to what to know
 in our last battles against great that it's pretty impressive if you don't
 have the other battles that we've had against great night we are two and oh
 against great night I'm telling you ever since Ryre made that badass fucking belt
 that's ours baby that championship now we've got something to fight for yep
 yep and we and might I say I'm pretty sure I put us over the line with
 blueberry hill that's right you say yes you sang us into victory last year was
 because the movie was one that I had actually seen before the terrible movie
 was one that I had actually seen before this year Paul Golden pipes Mattingly
 blueberry hill there it is and the ice cream social live you'll hear it that's
 the episode that just went up and so that's there and so we go to the jock
 versus nerd ball for baby probably the one of the best years ever it was a
 solid jock versus nerd year the foolers were there unbelievable including math
 the mind noodler it Michael else Roth dressing up like Jessica Jane Peterson
 from head to toe from the foolers tour was really something else
 only weirdly accurate outfit we're the accurate great well for a minute I
 thought she was here I thought that was her I was JJ got tall what the hell yeah
 it was pretty great yeah turn to Michael's thing I got a set of photo to
 JJ and he even going I hope she's not offended by anything I've done here and
 I said are you kidding me she is what Jessica Jane I found these shoes on the
 strip Peterson offended by yeah I mean if you put on Vegas stray shoes get the
 fuck out nothing nothing can faze you you're beyond the human capacity for
 phasor at that point I can't fathom that process I'm still thinking about that
 from last go fast clearly I am she's not you she's not of this earth I don't know
 why you're yelling at me about it Paul I just said Jessica Jane got something

 for a minute now right like we got yeah stuff there's there's there's these
 really nice social baseball jerseys and I was like whoa oh those were great yeah

 written on yeah that was great that informative lemmy was really good too
 yeah oh man yeah so good it was facts from like some of the facts were like
 from the scoop fest is so funny right yeah so many so many anyways yeah so it
 was just a beautiful beautiful event crazy great did everyone come out yeah we
 can't do this without our community it's just incredible and fingers crossed for
 where the documentary goes thank you all for participating in that oh thank you
 our safety cones we could not do it without our safety no jeez that's the
 whole thing man oh yeah my lobster club barista guy was there oh yeah yeah yeah
 yeah so fun so fun we look as true country scoop we learned that Krypton is
 the eighth most common gas in the atmosphere and that was one of
 informative Lemmy's cards mm-hmm amazing yeah and by learned that I mean
 Mikey told us that and we all took it as truth and none of us have done any
 further research I believe Mikey 100% Oh me too clearly Mikey yeah yeah I'm fine
 with this I'm just narrating but it was great and then had a wonderful time over
 at McMullin's McMullin's actually worked out this time this was a good
 good yeah I think did you guys like a revamp or whatever like their staff was
 on points did you see that does the staff had a scoop hat on they somebody got
 what got one of the waiters a scoop hat or they got I don't know how they got it
 but they had a scoop hat on yeah while they were serving on on Friday night I
 was a country scoop in the chat gave him gave that to other bartender oh yeah he
 was oh man and he wore that for for at least the rest of scoop fest he was well
 done countries days that was really really kind of you it was incredible and
 and and like always the scoops treat everybody really great tip-heavy bought
 me food bought me drinks it was great up just so oh and if anybody wondered if
 the Irish trio pint of plain went to McMullin's and tried Irish nachos yes
 yes and they loved them oh my god yeah I said I said I was afraid to even show
 you this whether you think it was like offensive to you or whatever and they go
 well there's nothing like that in Ireland but boy this should be this is
 really good they're really blown away particularly by the nacho beef the beef
 that goes on the Irish nachos right and it sounded like an Irish stew beef the
 corned beef with the nacho beef yeah no wasn't corned beef it just the regular
 regular ground beef okay they're spiced ground beef yeah oh but the way they
 make it at the at the McMullin's they're like this tastes like Irish like stew
 beef this doesn't taste like nacho beef and they were like flipping out about it
 that's cool devoured two plates of Irish nachos blown away yes victory it was
 super that was it was my favorite but I sent them a picture with them in front of
 the plate I said my four favorite Irishmen it was the three of them in a
 plate of Irish my favorite Irishmen and my three friends from Ireland the
 country's time again it's the same beef they use in their shepherd's pie there
 yes and this is why it's like it's like it's actually why I like I like that we
 do every year and a half for a variety of reasons one is right now to give us
 breathing room to not think about the next one oh to like that extra six
 months ago our lives change enough that different people come into our lives to
 bring to scoop fest yes you know we get to include different people in it and so
 that's like really always kind of exciting to do and and and also we lose
 track of how many we've done so it makes them all very special because I'm like I
 don't know how many like how many businesses I'm like I have no idea I
 don't know and how awesome I think it was was it you Matt or Jacob one of you
 two what me came up with the thought of selling 2027 scoop fest
 I don't think that should be said on air but yeah I hear your buddy and I
 appreciate it okay they're not for sale right now so no no no no no I'm not
 saying that I'm gonna be an edit yeah yeah but yeah yeah it's all good yeah
 that's fine all right well we'll say it out loud now people at scoop fest were
 able to buy super early bird tickets for the next event yeah yeah yeah but that
 just I was one to say with that was that it just to me speaks so highly of people
 trusting us and then being enthused about this event yeah that's not even
 announced yet well the people basically okay the people that come year after year
 after year and I really wanted to reward them yes we're doing that yeah and so we
 wanted we wanted to give people a special discounted early bird even though
 we haven't figured out where it's gonna be there's no the time frame of where
 it's gonna be we know it's gonna be a year from late April early May inside
 the actual specific dates yeah we've got a window yeah and and so basically if
 you were willing to roll with the punches we want to reward people who
 come year after year and so we give you a special a special ticket so they're
 there each everyone else and we'll get everybody else we'll get early bird
 tickets out and at some point in the in the future as well once yeah once we
 figure more of our ducks out exactly yes yeah yeah we usually announce it about a
 year out yeah yeah I'm trying to put anybody on blast but do you understand
 it to the listener this could not be the best news do you understand why I was
 trying to not do it no okay is not everyone had the opportunities to do it
 well people who are listening to the show weren't all at the show right all
 right no it's great but and we will we did we did discount for the people there
 we'll do a different early bird discount for everyone when we get the the tickets
 up to yes yeah we're gonna take care of everybody as much as it could be a bit
 of a sticking point for some of our international scoops as I'm seeing Bozzi
 right now but that's not our doing per se yeah yeah yeah well I mean we did vote
 for him twice some people three times good Lord but yeah yeah it's gonna be
 great we're looking forward to the next one do we have any kind of trivia or
 something lined up now we have we have talked everybody's ears off at this
