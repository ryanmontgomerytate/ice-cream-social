17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 I'm not anywhere until August 20th to 24th. I'll be in the Magic Castle.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Nice. And then, uh, then someone went to, like, give me a weekend at a Magic Club.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 And I looked at September, October, November, December, and I was like, uh, I can come in January.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Oh, you're booked. I am booked. That's wonderful.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Yes, it is good. It is good. No complaints. No complaints.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Now, uh, you're home for a little bit then for like a week or two. Yes.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 And, uh, are the boys still out of school right now? Right. As the last week, they start school August 11th.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Okay, so you're finally putting your boys in school. Yeah, the homeschooling thing turned out to be, you know, it's for some people.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Uh, but yeah, yeah, no, I get you. But it turns out if I'm on a cruise ship, you know, virtual learning from me on a cruise ship is not really the best way to.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Oh, can you imagine any of us just homeschooling in general? Just homeschooling anyone's children.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Look, we went through the pandemic. So every parent has a taste of what they'd be like as a home school teacher. Right. No matter what.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Um, and, uh, part of it was a little, I mean, as it was daunting for all of us, it was exciting at some point.

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Like at one point we were like on our own for a couple of weeks while the schools figured out what they were doing.

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 We were like diving in at home, trying to figure out ways to like do cool stuff like anything our kids were curious about.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Turns out there's a YouTube documentary on something or the other. That's true. Whatever.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 So we did for a little while have like, uh, we're going to watch an educational documentary a day. Um, we did work on their stuff.

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Um, the strange thing was that in the panic of and maybe other parents relate in the panic of, uh, schools getting their shit together, originally they just put together work packets for the parents to do at home.

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Right. I remember that. And then they switched to giving everyone a computer and doing virtual classrooms with the teachers and the classrooms and the virtual classrooms with a kindergartener and a first grader were useless.

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Yeah.

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 And the work packet stuff was awesome. Like I actually liked when they were just handing us different work packets to do at home.

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Yeah, you can teach from that. Sure.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 It was really, it was really great. And so I basically was like, I remember like a month into like the, the, the, the virtual classrooms and watching my kids just like, like, you know, when like kids are so bored, they're like crying with boredom.

39
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Like they're just like, yeah, being with boredom. Like I was just like, I see that happen automatically every now and then too.

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 No, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not immune. I was like, I wish we were just working on the packet stuff, but I guess for people who actually had to like work, work and not just cry and hope that entertainment wasn't over as a thing.

41
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Those people were more, more grateful for the virtual classrooms.

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 That's probably true. Yeah. Yeah.

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Are you guys up on the descendants? You guys up on all the zombies movies on all the Disney, on the Disney channel?

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 I am not. The descendants are doing zombies right now?

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 There's two franchises in the Disney world. One is called Descendants and one is called Zombies.

46
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Zombies is like the B franchise. Descendants, like last year I went to the kids Halloween parade and I was like, why is everybody wearing dressed as, as like, as like, is everyone dressed like Deadpool?

47
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 And turns out, no, no, they're all dressed as this character Red from Descendants.

48
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Yeah.

49
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And here's the thing, my, my, my oldest kid didn't get in either one of them. My youngest got into the zombies thing.

50
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 But then Kimmy Gatewood, Apple sister. Yes. Got hired to direct the latest descendants movie.

51
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Oh, wow. And then all of the Disney, right? So then all of a sudden there's these concerts with all the people from zombies and descendants doing live concerts across the nation.

52
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 And so Kimmy got everybody backstage passes. So all the Apple, all the Apple children went to the concert and then went backstage and met everyone who's in Descendants and Zombies.

53
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 And the side effect of that is that it is way into it. Now all my kids listen to in the car, like everywhere. It's like we're driving Arizona and back and driving them all to, you know, their soccer and drums and also their stuff or kids houses.

54
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 I am just listening constantly to Disney music and it is driving insane.

55
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Who is read a descendant of because they're all descendant from like famous heroes and villains of this. Yes. And it's hysterical because in the show they'll be like, and my dad, you know, you know, Maui or whatever.

56
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 They go and everybody acts shocked when they find out a kid is related. Like basically the show is just a parallel of like like a Beverly Hills grammar school where like everybody just finds out that their parents work in show business one place or the other.

57
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 So like every single character is a child of a major Disney character and they all have a wink to what there is. And so read is the child of the queen of hearts.

58
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Ah, so okay. A bad person.

59
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Most of them are. It's mostly the children of villains. Yeah. But are they good children.

60
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Yes, they go through their own adventures where they figure out whether they're going to be good or evil. So it's runaways. That's cool. Yeah, but Disney owns Marvel now. So that's totally fine.

61
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Yeah, yeah. No, I mean, I'm fine with it. I will not have you disparage the originality of them.

62
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Hey, rehashing all of them. I don't know if Brian has a writing credit on descendants. He may that be great. Who are the runaways children of of all kinds of Marvel villains.

63
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Yeah. Yeah, but they're like mid tier villains that you don't necessarily know that much about.

64
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 But I like I like that your point is that it is even more unoriginal feeling that it was already feeling.

65
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Don't worry, Matt. It's already not that good.

66
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 They're like we have two options. We can either pretend to zap them and make them go back in time to children or we can say that they're children of the property we already own.

67
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 Yes, Cupernova girl in the chat is saying I never watch runaways. I never watch runaways either. I read it. I can't speak to the quality. Oh, no, I can't speak to the quality of the show.

68
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 I'm not please up motherfuckers. Take a moment to puff on that pipe.

69
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 You intellectual. I've not heard the best things about the film adaptation.

70
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 I prefer to see it happen in the eye of my mind. No, honestly. Yeah. No, no. I mean, it's a graphic novel.

71
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 I don't have those kinds of abilities, Jacob. I can't just read books. I need picture books. Come on. Yeah, I read it.

72
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 But the thing is like it's it's Disney, right? So they have like these crazy, you know, music and, you know, everything's a musical and that kind of stuff.

73
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 And it's all really well produced music like some of them are catchy, which the snag is that it's all sung through the throats of very precocious children.

74
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 So like it's all like these really super like it could be like rap or R&B or like all these things that like a very popular music. And then it's just like tiny children singing it.

75
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 And you're like, it's weird. Yeah, it's kids bop. And it really kind of makes me I'm like, is this a good thing or a bad thing? Do you guys listen to kids bop?

76
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Did you go through a kids bop phase when I was younger now? No, I mean, with the kid with your kids.

77
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 No, this is the part of like the things like I like I said, like my kids were born just after Frozen was popular and I was like so glad to not be listening to that on repeat.

78
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 And, you know, Moana didn't catch on as feverishly as as that. No. And then my kids got into like real music.

79
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 So they always used to switch from basically real music into like just YouTube YouTubers YouTube music where they just sing about video games. And some of that was pretty good. And some of that's just strange to me.

80
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 But they go back and forth. Is Hill still in his Gigi Allen phase? Because I know he was way into that.

81
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Wait, who was the drummer that you had to like wear raincoats and stuff to perform with him? Because he was so disgusting.

82
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Keith Moon, because he was always crazy with Ginger Baker. He was dangerous. Oh, no, no, I don't know. I don't know.

83
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 No, never. Anyway, anyway, whatever he did. He did all kinds of gross stuff on stage, too. You know, he'll used to in the car used to fall asleep to Iron Man. That was the way to get him to fall asleep was that he would just chill to Iron Man and the Sabbath Iron Man.

84
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, you know, and then we went and saw MJ the musical over the summer. And so Michael Jackson music was dominating our household, which obviously gives me mixed emotions apparent. But the music is catchy. The music is well made.

85
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 And so now I'm stuck in Disney produced weird music land. Would you prefer the Disney or Michael Jackson? Well, I would have let me say I would not have liked someone getting a backstage pass for my children to meet Michael Jackson.

86
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 So let's just say let's start there. Oh, interesting. Interesting. Okay. Okay. We're different people.

87
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 All right. No, my only my only hope for the coming out of this phase that my my my oldest is still in school of rock. And so he is learning different rock songs on drums and he has a concert coming up. I'm hoping that that music will take over the car soon.

88
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 That's what I'm hoping. Probably will. There you go. Yeah, probably. What's his favorite music to play?

89
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Do you have a favorite song to play or anything? Yeah. I mean, like he plays like like Red Hot Chili Peppers Weezer.

90
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 I'm trying to think what else they go through over there. Yeah, he plays it. He plays a bunch of different stuff. You want to destroy my sweater. No.

91
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Weezer, man. Yeah, I would love it if your son just started singing Weezer randomly all the time around me.

92
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 That would be so confusing, but so delightful. When they first dropped, I had a class that I had to go to, but at the record store down in Louisville, they were putting on a show in Louisville.

93
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Three dollars right when the Blue Album first hit. And I was like, oh, I really wanted to go, but I didn't really know much about him. And I had like, like I said, I had some other little responsibility. But boy, if I could go back in time, I would tell me to go see Weezer for three dollars.

94
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Yeah. So one thing we didn't get into last episode.

95
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 And but I was debating whether to share it or not. But it was a low point for me. I was when I was hosting Magic Live. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I basically we finished one of our shows and I said, I'm going to I have to go to the bathroom, but I'm going to go downstairs because I don't want to hear what people think of the show in the bathroom across from the venue.

96
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 No. Okay. But you're already overthinking this. And also, like, take a walk. Like, get away. Like, go. Okay. There you go. I was like, I'm going to go to the bathroom. What's the rule? What's the rule? Just get out of the magic blocks.

97
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 What? I don't know. Oh, my my rule was always next county. Next county. Yeah. You couldn't say anything about the show or about the venue or the personnel until you got to the next county over. Yeah. If you're on the road, that's a good that's good rule.

98
00:13:45,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Right. There is like some there is like some universally acknowledged, like five blocks, 10 blocks, something like that. Even then, that always scares me because I because I go into a restaurant. I'll go. I'm the guy that goes into the restaurant like 20 miles away and goes like, Holy shit. That venue was terrible. And then I hear from the next table over like, oh, you were at that venue. I do the tickets for that. Exactly. Yeah. Well, I want to hear the reactions to the show and reactions to people hearing me pee as well.

99
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 So I'm fighting it. I'm fighting a UTI and I'm just it's just a lot of like, oh, did someone bring a bean filled horse cock into this bathroom? All I hear is plops and drops. Good God. You know, you should drink some cranberry juice. Yeah, man. Clear that shit up. That's disgusting. Look, everyone's leaving the chat.

100
00:14:38,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 That did it. That did it. Madness beans. So I I go downstairs and I finish peeing in the toilet. This is after the show is done. After this one. Yeah, so one more to go. So I'm like, oh, I'm on a break. Okay.

101
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 And a guy just goes like, oh, you should say now they can get into the magic circle. There you have a closing joke for your show. Okay, I go. I go. No, it's like I'm already so so to catch people up. I was hosting a show that the show was having any mixed reactions. Some people love that some people hated it. And I was not necessarily like a good fit, I thought for the show. And so I just felt awkward hosting it. And so right.

102
00:15:31,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 But it was a big magic invention. And it was a big deal to be asked. And so I am just trying to process those feelings. But I'm but I'm five of six shows and and I'm just like, I just want to part of me just wants to be over already. Right? Yeah. And so to catch people up from the last one, you said the the show was more out there than you were really expecting it to be and probably more out there than maybe anybody was really expecting it to be I spent a lot of it to be out there. But it was a, they all had kind of like a chill and cerebral vibe.

103
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,820
 cerebral vibe to it. That's what I wasn't expecting. It was tough coming out to try

104
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:11,280
 to be the funny, funny comedian. Nobody wanted a wacky host in between these bits. Right.

105
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:17,560
 And that's all I'm good for guys. Yeah. And again, like I don't even want to blame circumstances.

106
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,060
 I thought I also was doing just an okay job myself. Like just me personally, I just thought

107
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:26,580
 I could have been doing a better job than I was doing. Right. And so it was a bit of

108
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:31,680
 an uphill battle though from the start. Yeah. And so I literally like have no patience.

109
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:40,320
 I go like, I go what? And he goes, no, you say you have a joke for the end of the show

110
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,520
 where you say now you get in the magic circle. And I go, I don't understand that joke. That's

111
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,840
 not a joke. I just looked at him point blank. I was like, I don't understand that joke.

112
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,440
 Simply not a joke. And he goes, the last guy was doing a very comedic version of a cups

113
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,800
 and balls routine. And so, uh, and he goes to get into the magic circle in England. Uh,

114
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,280
 it's the big organization in England. Right. You have to audition with the cups and balls.

115
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,960
 You can't get into the magic circle unless you can do cups and balls. Okay. I consider

116
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:15,800
 myself, uh, somewhat in the magic world, blah, blah, blah, whatever. Yes. I've never heard

117
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:21,520
 that before in my life. I fucking baseball right now. This guy's onto it. Here's how

118
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:28,360
 you deliver it, man. Fine. All right. That last routine was awesome. Now you can get

119
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:34,200
 into the magic circle in England because as we all know, get into the magic circle in

120
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:42,280
 England, you have to present the cup and balls trick. Good night. That's a perfect topper.

121
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:49,640
 It's kind of like my clothes and joke. Yeah. That was my last joke. Everyone has my closer.

122
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:59,960
 So then he said, okay, I'll use that joke like that. Yeah. So I felt bad at being addicted

123
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:07,200
 to this socially awkward person. It's a magic convention. I should have more empathy. Everybody

124
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,600
 there is socially on that. You're too close to the flame right now. You don't remember

125
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:20,000
 how magicians need to be ostracized, but this is just, he's got a point. This is just the

126
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:28,120
 prelude. This is not the story. Well, I love it. This prelude. I do love when, uh, civilians

127
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,560
 catch you in your blank face. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. When I'm like, Matt, we'll go into like

128
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,800
 that, that moment where it's like, he just can't talk to you for a minute. Just give

129
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,260
 him a minute now. And then when people go up and talk to him, it's just, it makes me

130
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:46,160
 laugh every time because my comedy entertainer self is the shell I've put over this bitter

131
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,680
 asshole who was growing up, growing up without comedy was an angry bully jerk. And so it

132
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:57,640
 was only through comedy that I found a way to be palatable in this universe. And so sometimes

133
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:03,160
 I go back to that kid that would just wants your lunch money if you talk to me and I have

134
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:14,160
 to walk away and I have to recalibrate. Oh man. I just need a second. I need a second.

135
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,920
 I know who I am right now and you won't like me. I'm aware. It's not that I'm unaware.

136
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:27,880
 I am aware. That's why I'm taking this walk. Yeah. Yeah. But a closing joke behind them

137
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:34,160
 is some guy, he's like aggressively drying his hands with paper towels and he's wearing

138
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:43,520
 like a drippy t-shirt. He does not look like a magic attendee. What's that? Like he's,

139
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,160
 he is like a skinny person and he's wearing like a large t-shirt that is like hanging off

140
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:56,080
 him is like very, he's very much draped and not wearing the shirt. And he's, uh, it's,

141
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:03,960
 it's, he's a Vegas local. So he looks a little, his outfit is not bespoke. No. And he says,

142
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,680
 he says, uh, you know, as funny as most people don't even know where the suits of the carts

143
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:17,440
 come from. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh my goodness sakes. You're right. That is funny. That's

144
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,760
 it. That's it. Boy. That right there. That's a joke. Finish it out like that. That's my

145
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,080
 joke. One last funny thing folks. A lot of people don't even know where the suits of

146
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:34,760
 the cards come from. And so I ignore him. Now you can join the magic circle. You ignored

147
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:41,040
 him. Good for you. And I try to walk out and he stays over my shoulder. Oh shit. He's following

148
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,760
 you, telling you the story of the, of the suits. And he goes one more time. It's cause

149
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:50,880
 most people don't know where the suits of the cards come from. Now I will tell you in

150
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:58,100
 this moment, my brain is going through multiple things and I, I literally go like, Oh, I literally

151
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:04,120
 go in my mind. Oh no. Is there religious connotations to the suits of the cards? Cause that's the

152
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,880
 way this guy is aping me. I was like, this is not, he's not trying to fun fact me. No,

153
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:17,720
 he's trying to set you up for a Bible. He is giving you what circa 1994 PIF, the magic

154
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:24,700
 dragon routines. He's about to bust out Christian card magic. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The three silks

155
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:31,600
 are the father, son, and the Holy ghost. Look at this glass of filthy water. You would never

156
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,360
 drink this glass of filthy water, but you bring in the Holy spirit with the cross cleaned

157
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:42,760
 up and notice I'm still not going to drink still not drinking it. Yeah. Yeah. It's still

158
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:49,920
 horribly poisonous. It's just clear now. So again, I'm in a mood and I don't want to be.

159
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:58,040
 Yeah. So I stopped dead in my tracks and turned to him and I go, go ahead, hit me. I go ahead

160
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:04,120
 and he recoils an offense that I've said, go ahead. Cause I basically, I don't want

161
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:12,040
 to say I'm curious as I'm not right. Yeah. It's like, you know exactly how curious you

162
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,480
 are. You and Google could provide me the same information right now. And I want to talk

163
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:23,540
 to one of you. Um, you and Google can both provide me the same information that I don't

164
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:28,520
 care about. He goes, Oh, well, I didn't realize, you know, you're going to be so sour about

165
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,440
 it. I don't know if we have to get into it or whatever. We're in the fucking bathroom

166
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:39,160
 man. And I go, well then we don't. And so he huffs ahead of me and turns right out of

167
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:45,360
 the bathroom. All right. Yeah. So I go left and for people who've been to scoop vest or

168
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,440
 in the Orleans before knows that this bathroom is right outside the Keno station. When you

169
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,960
 walk into the Orleans thing, I know what you're talking about now. So it turns out my man

170
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,960
 is just a Keno player. So even though he went right, he just circles back and just weaves

171
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:05,560
 back through the chairs towards me and is mouthing off about me out loud as he parades

172
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:10,140
 through the Keno chairs. I was just going to tell this guy about the different suits

173
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,400
 of the cards and where they come from. He doesn't want to hear about it though. I don't

174
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,200
 know what his problem is. I was going to tell him about the hearts of the diamonds of the

175
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,960
 spades of the clubs. And people don't know about the frogs. That was the fifth suit for

176
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,040
 a while, but I was going to tell him all about that stuff. He didn't want to hear it though.

177
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:29,240
 I guess I'm going to play Keno. Bingo. Shit. Wrong game. I'm throwing off my game now.

178
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:36,360
 I mean, 90%. Yes, Jacob. Yes. Exactly what's happening. And I don't know why I stopped.

179
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:42,880
 I don't know why I should just kept walking. Oh buddy. Oh, but I stopped and go like, what

180
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,340
 is your problem, man? And he goes, my problem. What is your problem? You're the one being

181
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:52,600
 a jerk. I go, Oh, cause you're being nice. Is that what it is? I'm a jerk while you're

182
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,160
 being a very nice person. You just want to tell me your fun facts. Tell me your fun facts.

183
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,840
 He goes, no man, I don't need to do that. Whatever man. And then he goes, he goes, no,

184
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,080
 you can go off. You go off. Do your thing, man. And he goes, uh, I'll see you at the

185
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:15,560
 throne. Ah, it was religious. And so I go, wow. I go, what? And he goes, nothing, man.

186
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:20,800
 I go, no, what did you just say? What was the statement you just made? And he goes,

187
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,080
 no, nothing. I go, no, you said something about a throne. What did you just say? And

188
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,860
 he said, I'll see you at the throne. It means that we are done with the life that the Lord

189
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:35,360
 gave us. We meet at the throne to figure out how we spent our lives. Nothing better. You

190
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,720
 and I specifically meet at the throne. Nothing better than a heartfelt evangelical moment

191
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:48,200
 from a degenerate gambling piece of shit in Las Vegas. That's what I said. I go, I go,

192
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:58,560
 that's you being nice. And he goes, yeah, I go, really? And then I step right into space.

193
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,600
 And I go, so when you and your friends part ways, you guys go see at the throne and you

194
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,960
 high five and you walk away. Everyone just says see you at the throne when they get in

195
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,520
 their car and drive away. Everyone just say, see you at the throne all the time. I go,

196
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,760
 are you just being a condescending dickhead? Yeah. And they see you when you die is what

197
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,000
 he's saying. That's what he's saying. I'll meet you when you're dead fucker. I'll see

198
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,440
 you when you're on your way to hell. I'll see you from heaven. Yep. I'll be in the throne

199
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,600
 sitting on daddy Jesus's fat lap. And while Leon thought that the throne was a gay bathroom

200
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,680
 thing, Leon, uh, it would have been better. A gay bathroom thing would have been, would

201
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:41,340
 have been a great surprise here. I actually, yes, correct. I would have actually been much

202
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:48,120
 happier if he was like, I'll see you when you take a shit. Like that's right. I'm going

203
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:53,640
 to follow you to the bathroom. Everyone's gotta go sometime and just respect it. Elvis was

204
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,800
 the king. I saw you eating that protein bar earlier. Yeah, it's good coming in. It's rough

205
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:05,760
 coming out. Oh, and I was like, there's a little voice, a voice, a same, a same voice

206
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,360
 in my head. It was like, why are you still here? What are you writing? What are we doing?

207
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:15,840
 I was like, if you get kicked out of the Orleans for arguing with a crazy from the Orleans

208
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,120
 for this, Matt, I am going to be angry with you. One. I was like, it would be the only

209
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,600
 thing people were talking about a magic live is that the host of the show got kicked out

210
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:32,440
 for fighting a crack head religious person. And then, and then the scoop fest is at the

211
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:41,000
 Orleans, so I can't get banned from the Orleans. Right. I need you to not get 86 from the Orleans.

212
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,400
 And so I did walk away. Finally. No, dead last one. That last one in the chat says scoop

213
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,040
 fest live from the Orleans parking lot. When they 86 you can't be in the parking lot either.

214
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:58,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's got to be from like the Chevron. Yeah, across the street. In view

215
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,320
 of the Orleans scoop fest. Twenty twenty five. We really have to pull our our weight with

216
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:12,240
 a fucking McDermott McMillan's. Yeah. McMillan's. Oh, yeah. We'd have to be like, please, McMillan's,

217
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:25,400
 please. The alcohol free Irish bar. You know who else is as successful as an alcohol free

218
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:38,280
 Irish bar? That's the following sponsor. The show is brought to you by customs scrotal

219
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:43,760
 implants. That's right. From Scoop of Henny or Scoop of Henley. Sorry. Scoop of Henley

220

 balls. That's right. Yes. Come on in. Come on in. We've got nothing but food, rides and

223
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:22,560
 shows dedicated to false testicles. Yep. We have the Ball Buster, our number one roller

224
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:29,880
 coaster in the nation, an 800 foot drop with no seats. So you rattle your taint right against

225
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:37,440
 the floor of the car. Ow. You're going to need some of our famous fake balls after that.

226
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:49,480
 We also have Jimmy Yum Yum's big old buckets of balls that serves nothing but Prairie oysters.

227
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:55,040
 That's right. Go to Jimmy Yum Yum's and get yourself a big old pack of Prairie oysters

228
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:03,000
 with our patented ball free sauce. That's right. It's ball free because there's no balls in

229
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,600
 it or are there? We don't know. We don't even know what Jimmy Yum Yum's is selling, honestly.

230
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:19,320
 I brought this guy in. He told me he had Prairie oysters. I took him at his word. It's on you

231
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:27,880
 and Jimmy Yum Yum to sort it out. And don't miss the cavalcade of stars performing in

232
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:37,680
 Testes one, two, three on our big commemorative stage in the Hall of Presidents. That's right.

233
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:45,100
 We talk about all the president's testicular problems from FDR's folded boys that he couldn't

234
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:50,880
 ever access because he was constantly sitting down to Abe Lincoln's ring of ding dingers

235
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:58,160
 that swung like the Liberty Bell itself. All the president's testes, coming out swinging.

236
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:05,040
 That's right. That's what it's called, coming out swinging. The show is called coming out

237
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:13,360
 swinging. And then the finale, which everyone loves, Gravity Wins. That's the finale song,

238
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:20,800
 Gravity Wins. It's nothing but saggers. But guess what, everybody? That's what this ball

239
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:27,360
 park is all about. This ball park is dedicated to fake balls. So when gravity does finally

240
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:33,480
 defeat your testicular sac, you can come here and get what we're really famous for, which

241
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,840
 is ball replacement surgery. Get your fakes in there.

242
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,360
 As someone who got ball replacement surgery, I can't tell you how fun it is, honestly.

243
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:48,960
 I have my fake tiny balls and I put a bell around my scrotum. And now whenever I play

244
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,480
 with myself, people think I'm collecting money for the Salvation Army.

245
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,520
 And you might be. There's no way to tell.

246
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:03,840
 When I got my ball replacement surgery, I had them replace it with those clicky clacky

247
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,680
 things that are on desks in people's offices, you know, where like the one ball flies in

248
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,040
 and it hits the other balls and then the one ball flies off the other way. That's what

249
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,960
 I got them to replace mine with. It's great. When I walk along, I just go click clack,

250
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,960
 click clack.

251
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,280
 There's all kinds of wild, wacky ball replacement stuff. You can get those kinds that you put

252
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:28,240
 on your truck. You can get truck nuts put on yourself. Why the fuck not? Who cares anymore?

253
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,240
 Just go nuts.

254
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,920
 Go nuts. It's our company's slogan.

255
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,960
 That's our slogan. Go nuts.

256
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,240
 Oh, man. I want to scoop baby just trying to get out of his seat. And he's got a real

257
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,960
 gamer chair, man. He's got a real comfortable gamer chair. Oh, yeah. Oh, look, there we

258
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:57,680
 go. There they are. What are you holding? Oh, proper sack. He's dangling his fake balls.

259
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:04,680
 Yes. I couldn't remember. I need to. Can Jacob to the Internet, if you wouldn't mind? Could

260
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:13,160
 you check out? There is a name for when dogs get neutered. They have fake balls you can

261
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:17,520
 implant on your dog so they don't feel so emasculated. All right. I think are they called

262
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:24,320
 like nudicles or something like that or or nexticles or fake stickles? There's some.

263
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:33,280
 Is it nutrient neuter calls? That's it. Neuter calls is when they get neutered, neutered

264
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,800
 calls. I think that's that's the new name of this podcast is neuter calls, neuter calls.

265
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:43,160
 They're called these nuts. You're right. Newticles. Yeah. Newt in the U.T.I.C.L.E.S. All right.

266
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,160
 Newticles. That was the one I was searching for. But I was like, it can't just be newticles.

267
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,920
 But I guess it is newticles. I guess it is. All right. Yeah, that's all. What was the

268
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:56,720
 story you want to get into before we got on air? Oh, well, so for those of you who may

269
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:04,000
 not know, America is in steep decline and it's being helped when it's being helped along

270
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:12,120
 by a bunch of Gestapo bastards called ICE. And unfortunately, you guys know how many

271
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:18,160
 times I have lamented the options that we have here in beautiful Allison Park, P.A.

272
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:24,000
 for eating. That's right. At least 12. Right. So one of the places that Ann and I have frequented

273
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,440
 over the years has been a Mexican restaurant, Emiliano's. They have a couple of locations

274
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:38,200
 around this area. And it is one of our favorite spots to go to. We've been like probably 40

275
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:46,560
 times, I would imagine. Yeah, we go there fairly frequently as far as stuff goes. Their

276
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:57,840
 owner was in Florida, I believe was Florida, was away. She was overseeing her son's graduation

277
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:06,040
 and gets an emergency phone call that there's an ICE raid at the restaurant and comes back

278
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:14,040
 to people missing. There are there's video of they just ransacked the restaurant like

279
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:18,960
 there are ceiling tiles all fucked up. They started a small fire in the kitchen. There's

280
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,800
 just shit all over the floors. It's it's insane. It looks like it looks like somebody came

281
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:31,320
 in and robbed the place, which essentially they did. And it just feels so deeply wrong

282
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:39,840
 and illegal that I'm just beside myself thinking that these are government authorized agents

283
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:48,080
 acting supposedly in the name of the people of of Pennsylvania. It's just fucking sick.

284
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:56,200
 And it's so frustrating that we basically just have anyone who's in this country that

285
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,020
 wasn't you know, anyone, anyone who's in this country that wasn't born here is considered

286
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:05,140
 a criminal at this point, even if they have paperwork and stuff. And even if they're trying

287
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:14,240
 to get things done properly, and they're being there's a there's a naivete, I guess a ignorance

288
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:23,360
 of basically like how much we rely on illegal immigrants in this country. We do. Yeah, yeah,

289
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:28,920
 we have been relying on people who have snuck into this country for many, many facets of

290
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:35,020
 our economy for a very long time, for generations. And, yeah, the majority of them are not criminals

291
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:42,880
 besides that one aspect we just discussed of sneaking in here. And and yeah, the it's

292
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,480
 just it's it's just not. But even that like the criminality behind that, like what we

293
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:55,240
 you know, when we've discussed this before, like asylum seekers, which until the person

294
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:01,300
 who runs the government didn't understand the difference between asylum and insane asylum

295
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:06,920
 got into power. Because that's what he honestly thought that was his insane thing. He thought

296
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:12,920
 asylum seekers were people who were from insane asylums. He doesn't understand what the term

297
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:19,940
 asylum means. Anyway, that's a whole nother kettle of fish. But it's just, it's just so

298
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:29,300
 fucking crazy. And illegal or not. You know, quote unquote, illegal or not. This is fish

299
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:37,080
 in a barrel type shit. There is no actual seeking down these, you know, drug runners

300
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:44,660
 or, you know. No, this is this is this is where this is where this is where the Democrats

301
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:51,700
 have fucked it all up to. Of course, we don't want drugs or or or more drugs or or violent

302
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:56,040
 criminals or any of that in our country. Oh, yeah, I don't want violent criminals in our

303
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:02,180
 country. Nobody does. Nobody wants nobody wants that. But but but you want is a way

304
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:07,820
 for the government to step up and figure out who is those people. And you don't do that

305
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:12,780
 by ripping families apart that have been here for for for decades. No, you know, multiple

306
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:17,580
 generation families attack. Yeah, if your first line of attack is the Home Depot parking

307
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:26,140
 lot and Mexican restaurants, you ain't going after shit. You that's just it's just a stupid

308
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:31,660
 as fucking thing. Right. And I my only hope is that we get this turned around somehow

309
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:35,380
 and that there are any legitimate courts left to fix this. Well, you know, who's stepped

310
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:42,500
 up to to to to to help this situation? Who is helping? We we need a hero. We do. Dean

311
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:50,600
 Cain, Dean Cain. Right. Right. Superman has stepped in. The 90s Superman has announced

312
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:56,340
 that he is joining ICE. Yep. As if the show Master of Illusion on the CW couldn't get

313
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:04,580
 any grosser. Well, he's outdone himself for the Superman curse. Like he's clearly the

314
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:09,740
 worst example of the Superman curse. Yeah. What is the Superman curse? Notoriously that

315
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:15,620
 the people who have portrayed Superman have had very rough ways to go of it in their later

316
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:22,340
 life. Yeah. Who was it? The first guy was fine. George Reeves. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no,

317
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:26,820
 no, no, no. Happened to him. He's yeah, you're right. He was fine. That's a fellow with some

318
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:31,020
 good old horse sense right there. No, they're all they all they all have tragic things.

319
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:36,660
 But this is the worst. This is clearly the worst. This is fucked up. Christopher Reeves

320
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:40,460
 just hoofing it through life. But it is like this is like like I don't understand like

321
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:49,100
 here, like the way ice is operating to go like, oh yeah, I gotta get in on that. I gotta

322
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:56,060
 be a part of that is he's following the the playbook from Oh shit. What's his name? The

323
00:38:56,060 --> 00:39:01,180
 action star. It's Steven Seagal. It's Steven Seagal. The next level. Yeah. Yeah. He's just

324
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:05,320
 he's following because remember when Steven Seagal was like doing the the cop reality

325
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:10,220
 show, he was like, I'm a sheriff and honorary sheriff from town and he was like roughing

326
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:13,900
 people up on TV and everything. And they were like, shit, this is this is getting too much

327
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,700
 bounty hunting and all that kind of shit. And then he moved to Russia. What a fucking

328
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:23,380
 joke. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Jurassic scoop. He started from Superman to Homelander. There

329
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:28,460
 it is. There it is. It's not a far leap. It's not a far leap if you're not careful. Homelander

330
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:32,540
 is at least funny, though. Dean Cain is not fun. I haven't listened to the dollop in a

331
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:38,900
 while, but the dollop they did on Steven Seagal is outrageous and amazing. It is I can't imagine

332
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:43,980
 it is worth it. Just listen to if you have a podcast or a video or whatever that you're

333
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:49,020
 like, I want Jacob Smith to watch this. Yeah. Just start off by telling me about Steven

334
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:53,340
 Seagal. If you just start your whole thing by telling me some ridiculous thing that Steve

335
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:59,980
 Steven Seagal did in like 1996, I am in for your entire show before he hit at all. Like

336
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:04,380
 before he was famous at all. Yeah, he had three different wives in three different countries.

337
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:14,260
 Like before. Yeah, he was already motherfuckers. Got shit going down. Yeah. That guy is just

338
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:20,420
 a disgusting narcissist from the jump. And yes. Yeah. Yeah. And he does that hilarious

339
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:26,060
 to me. That crazy karate bullshit stuff where he like he's he's sitting in a in a chair

340
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:31,860
 and people come up to me is like, but he says he's an Aikido master. Yeah, he's but the

341
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:36,300
 Dean can't think we talked about this before in the pod, which is like if you're an actor,

342
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,020
 like the end of these actors keep making themselves prominent in these different movements and

343
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:43,500
 stuff like that. And right. And it's because like all you want your dream is to be told

344
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,020
 what to do. That's what your job is an actor. When you dream of being an actor, you're being

345
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:51,740
 handed something and being like become this. And then having a director direct you to do

346
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:57,900
 stuff or whatever. Yeah. And so yes, it seems like Dean Kane having, you know, hosting 13

347
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:06,460
 episodes a year of Masters Illusion, not enough for him. And so he he needs something to do.

348
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:12,260
 He needs to be well, I mean, it does it does speak to the travails of Hollywood right now.

349
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:16,980
 It's hard to find work. So you know, it's especially hard to find work if you're Dean

350
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:21,980
 Kane. Oh, for fucking sure. For fuck. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You've burned when you've burned

351
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:26,180
 every bridge you've ever encountered. Right. A lot of nobody's knocking on Dean Kane's

352
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:32,460
 door a lot. There are is a great many number of actors who swing their politics the other

353
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:36,260
 way because they're blaming Hollywood for their misfortune. They're saying they're they're

354
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:40,500
 saying they're ostracized before they're ostracized. And they double down on politics so they can

355
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:45,580
 claim that they're victims of something instead of just it's really fucking hard to maintain

356
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:49,060
 a career. It's really hard to be an actor for a very long time. It's really hard to

357
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:55,060
 be in more than one hit thing. It's just hard. I consider myself extremely fortunate and

358
00:41:55,060 --> 00:42:00,220
 basically an outlier to have made as much money professionally performing as I did for

359
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:06,780
 as long as I did. Like, that's just, you know, ridiculous. And I'm grateful for that time.

360
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:10,300
 Very grateful for that time. And I'm hoping maybe it swings back again one of these days

361
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:14,460
 or something. But but this is such a wonderful outlet. I'm so grateful for this, having this

362
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:20,860
 opportunity to. But yeah, it's it's incredibly hard. And if you can't just straight up say,

363
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:25,900
 well, due to some circumstances that are in my control, and some circumstances out of

364
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:31,420
 my control, I just don't have the same career that's happening. That's just by the way,

365
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:35,580
 you can outrun Dean Kane. That guy is a little long in the tooth. He's older than you think.

366
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:41,460
 Yeah, no. Oh, yeah. He's him. Him joining ICE is helping no one. That's not. Let's also

367
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:45,340
 be clear. Well, ICE is helping no one. Well, that's that's the ultimate thing that really

368
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:51,700
 just broke my heart today is that Emiliano's has set up a GoFundMe page to try and help

369
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:57,020
 the families that have that are being legal defense. Yep. Legal defense and to help rebuild

370
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:02,580
 their trash restaurant. Jesus Christ. Right. It's fucking insane. But they're already over

371
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:08,420
 40, 40 grand in 24 hours. So and that's that's exactly the point is these people are in the

372
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:11,900
 communities. They are functioning. They are loved in their communities. They make their

373
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:17,020
 communities better. Yeah, it's like it's like we have to find a way to honestly assess what's

374
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:21,740
 happening with these families on an individual level and how they impact their community.

375
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:26,140
 And we have to find a way and a governmental level to give credit to give credit where

376
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:32,420
 credit is due. The Statue of Liberty tells us who we want coming to the country. And

377
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:38,220
 nobody fucking is down anymore. I bet you that preamble has been eliminated on the government

378
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:42,460
 website. I bet you can't find it on the website. It very well may have been rubbed out at Ellis

379
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:47,220
 Island for all I fucking know. They may have sandblasted that shit. You know, Statue of

380
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:53,680
 Liberty's on Liberty Island, not Ellis Island. No, but yeah, you know what I'm saying? Yeah.

381
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,700
 But isn't that they're all gone, Jacob. All the islands are gone. No, no, no. By the way,

382
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:01,720
 that was the most ready rich I've ever felt doing a podcast. Correct. That's one quick

383
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:06,140
 little thing. Isn't that isn't that saying on Ellis Island too? I have to find out I

384
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:09,620
 have to find out if this comment is true or not. Jurassic Scoop says they rub one out

385
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:15,820
 on Ellis Island and I got to know if that's true. Hold on. I'm checking the records. I

386
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:21,740
 got got to know. Oh, that was like a bad class trip. What are we talking about? Jurassic

387
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:32,220
 Scoop? Where are you? I think you're just saying that I think Jurassic Scoop just masturbated

388
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:38,420
 at Ellis Island. Yeah. I think Jurassic Scoop is on a saying they were at a fair in Wisconsin

389
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:43,780
 having some fried cheese. OK. Yeah, I'm just curious. I'm just curious what would motivate

390
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:48,740
 someone to rub one out at Ellis Island. That's all I'm just curious. Just curious. Hot immigrants.

391
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:55,780
 I mean, just a bad joke. Sexy immigrants. Yeah. I mean, inside my balls is what mass

392
00:44:55,780 --> 00:45:01,220
 free for that joke. That's just how it goes. You better rub one out right now. Have the

393
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:12,660
 courage to man up and be the be the bit. Not on Twitch. Don't do it on Twitch. Not on Twitch.

394
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:17,580
 So anyway, just if you happen to be around the Pennsylvania area and you see an Emiliano's

395
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:22,700
 go and frequent them, give them some business, give them some money, give them some love.

396
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:32,140
 And yeah, just yeah, fuck this shit. This is fucking gross. The poem, The New Colossus,

397
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:35,420
 which is the the poem that you're referring to, Paul, that gives me you're you're tired,

398
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:39,740
 you're weak, all that stuff. That is on the it is inside the pedestal of the Statue of

399
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:44,900
 Liberty, right? According to the US National Park Service. OK, so that is on Liberty Island.

400
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:49,580
 That's on Liberty Island, not Ellis Island. Got it. Got it. Got it. Ellis Island is where

401
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:53,980
 the the immigrants would come in and do the processing and whatnot. Right. Where you change

402
00:45:53,980 --> 00:46:02,540
 your names. That's right. I have the the copy of my great grandfather. Yeah. My dad's grandfather.

403
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:11,020
 I have the copy of the Ellis Island form that he filled out when he entered the country.

404
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:15,980
 Wow. Yeah. You can apparently request these through Ellis Island. It has a picture of

405
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:21,960
 the ship that he that he came in on and and the information they took down from him when

406
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:26,820
 he entered at Ellis Island. And he landed on Smith for a last name, huh? That's right.

407
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:33,900
 That's right. All right. Creative guy. Yeah. Yeah. I got my creativity from him. Well,

408
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,540
 you know what? I bet back in the day, Smith was probably Smith was probably a good name

409
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:43,060
 to go with because that you just like, oh, yeah, I'm a Smith. I can do anything. I can

410
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:46,740
 do it. Everybody knows how to spell it. Yeah. Everybody knows how to spell it. And it just

411
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:52,900
 means, you know, oh, yeah, I'll be a blacksmith. I'll be a candle, Smith. I'll be a rake, Smith.

412
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:58,700
 I'll be a lawn, Smith, whatever. You need me to rub one out, rake, Smith, a rake, Smith,

413
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:04,740
 rake, r a k e rake, Smith, rake, Smith. Goodness sakes. You need me to rub one out. I'm a Jack

414
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:14,100
 Smith jack of all Smith jack of all Smiths. I'll jack a Smith any minute. I'll jack any

415
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:22,060
 Smith that moves. You know who else is a jack of all Smiths? Oh, who? The following sponsor.

416
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:27,380
 Today's show is brought to you by Benny Ho Ho's Las Vegas new hibachi grill and brothel,

423
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:19,260
 You guys ever been to that big Benny Hanna in the Hilton? What was the Hilton? Yes. Wild,

424
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:26,620
 isn't it? I have. The best story I know from there is not mine, but it is Hondros. Let's

425
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:30,820
 hear it. Oh, I love please. He was visiting with a bunch of Spanish magicians back in

426
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:35,620
 the day. Copperfield, of course, was hosting everyone. And it was like, oh, that's where

427
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:38,780
 he's taking him. He's taking him out to that. Oh, this is way back in the day. This is back

428
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:42,260
 in the day. It was the Hilton. Yeah, yeah. The Hanna has been there for a minute. So

429
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:48,220
 when it was like that thing was like the flagship Benny Hanna, right? Oh yeah. And it was like,

430
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:53,500
 if you have an opportunity scoops, go to the Benny Hanna at the West Gate Casino. It's

431
00:48:53,500 --> 00:49:00,180
 huge, like multi-story Benny Hanna. It's ridiculous. It's worth a side. It's like an ancient Japanese

432
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:04,340
 village. It's insane. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's crazy. Yeah. Go check it out. It's at the

433
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:11,420
 West Gate. It's beautiful. Um, yeah. So, so Copperfield, Lance Burton, you know, everybody

434
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:17,060
 in town. He's playing host to everybody at the Hanna. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And, uh, Hondo

435
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:25,060
 is there and, and it's not, not often been in America, uh, English, not great. Uh, and

436
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:34,180
 they put down a big dollop of wasabi. Oh, Oh, and Hondo thinks it's guacamole. Great.

437
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:38,500
 And he just takes whatever food he has and just dips it right into a big, big old hunk

438
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:49,500
 of wasabi. And then his sinuses are still clear. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Oh my God.

439
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:55,020
 Yeah. I watched that happen to my mother-in-law, uh, at a, at a Japanese restaurant one time,

440
00:49:55,020 --> 00:50:00,340
 not with wasabi though, but with ginger. Oh yeah. She just picked up the whole, I don't

441
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:05,040
 know. I might've known at the time, but I don't know now. Uh, but yeah, she just picked

442
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,180
 up the whole wad of ginger and just popped it into her mouth. And the expression on her

443
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:18,720
 face was just so confused. It wasn't pain. It's just ginger. It was just pure confusion.

444
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:26,620
 What have I done? Yeah. Why did I do this? A lot of ginger. Yeah. I did see a guy at

445
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:31,780
 a Japanese restaurant one time, like flick a little ball of ginger. Uh, you know how,

446
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:36,940
 like the, um, Oh, what do you call the, the, the chef technique? Uh, where they're like

447
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:41,660
 planking everything around, they're tossing everything on the, on the big, uh, hibachi.

448
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:47,540
 Yeah. So like, you know how the hibachi chefs can, uh, can, can throw the, oh yeah. Tappanyaki.

449
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:52,220
 That's it. You're right, Wayne. It's not, uh, that's the grill. Yeah. Uh, but they can

450
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:56,700
 like flick like shrimp and everything into your mouth and all. So ignorant guys. It was

451
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:01,660
 Tappanyaki. You guys are so, such ignorant fool. Thank you, Matt. I'm so glad that we

452
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:06,180
 have Matt Donnelly to keep us on the straight and narrow. That's right. He's C-wise. I'll

453
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:10,920
 see you at the throne, Jacob. Thank you. It's just something that we say to each other.

454
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,620
 It's just something we say. It's just kind words. Yeah. Just kind words. Just see you

455
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:22,700
 at the throne. Hope you don't go to hell forever. I'll see you at the throne. But yeah, this,

456
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:29,580
 uh, it was like, uh, uh, uh, uh, Tappanyaki chef at, uh, a place that was kind of rowdy

457
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:32,580
 had like some college kids in there and they were, they were kind of rowdy and everything

458
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:36,340
 and they're yelling. And, uh, this, this one kid kept, keeps on yelling about how he can

459
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:40,540
 eat anything that, uh, the guy makes and, uh, catch anything and eat it and whatever.

460
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:47,140
 And so the guy just balls up a little ball of wasabi, a little smaller than a golf ball

461
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:51,820
 and picks it up with a set of chopsticks and just flicks it like he's flicking water off

462
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:57,260
 the end of the set of chopsticks. Just flicks it straight into the guy's mouth. It was one

463
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:07,060
 of the more magical things I've ever seen magic live was just in town. I always wanted

464
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:11,220
 to learn to be a Tappanyaki chef. I just thought it'd be a really cool thing to just have my

465
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:15,820
 back pocket as like, I want you to learn that out. Just, yeah, just, I can do the whole

466
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:20,140
 bit. Slicy slice slice slice. Yeah. Once in a while I just come over and I have a big

467
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:25,140
 flat grill and I just do the whole deal. I've got the big flat grill. You can come over

468
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:29,220
 to my house and just do it. I got it. So yeah, there has to be a school here in Vegas for

469
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:36,420
 it. I'm, I'm just going to say, if you learned how to Tappanyaki grill before the Jacob's

470
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:40,580
 whiskey barbecue at scoop fast, I really think it's so intense. There's no way I could do

471
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:48,300
 it in months. Maybe, maybe next year. That's like an apprenticeship kind of thing. Right.

472
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:53,820
 Maybe next year. Just, just working on like twirling the, the, the, the tongs. I just

473
00:52:53,820 --> 00:53:00,580
 feel like it would be awful says, but no, you've been a waiter on the job training,

474
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:09,740
 right? Yeah. It will be great. Yeah. You guys want to do a little scoop mail? Yes, please.

475
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:18,820
 Let's do a little scoop mail message for you. We got a scoop mail from Wayne. Hey guys,

476
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:23,780
 I'm writing and looking for some advice towards the end of August. I'm going back to college

477
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:28,820
 to do an animation course and I have a few concerns. Concern. Number one, about a week

478
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:32,980
 before starting the course, I'll be turning 40. Now is a good time to comment on how youthful

479
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:41,780
 I look. Wayne, you look very, very youthful. Very, Wayne is here, right? Yeah. Wayne's

480
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:49,220
 here looking youthful as ever. Yeah. Uh, so it looks very youthful. I fully expect to

481
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:53,140
 be the older, if not the oldest student in the class. What are some ways to help me blend

482
00:53:53,140 --> 00:54:01,020
 in with the youngins? Do I just, uh, shout skibbity every now and then? Yes. Yes. That's

483
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,740
 just what you do, Wayne. That's just, you, you already got it. You already got it figured

484
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:09,260
 out. Concern number two, it's more than likely that some people there will know my comics.

485
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:13,660
 It seems like every social situation I'm in nowadays, when people ask me what I do, there's

486
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:17,900
 always someone who says, oh wow, you draw those comics. I know this may sound a little,

487
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:21,720
 uh, like I'm up myself, but realistically when I meet someone in my home city who knows

488
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:26,340
 about my comics, I'm surprised every time, even though they were on a giant screen in

489
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:30,620
 the middle of Perth. Right. This is not typically a bad thing, but I feel like it could be a

490
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:35,700
 disadvantage in a learning situation. Maybe more will be expected from me because of it.

491
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:40,300
 I certainly don't want the entire, uh, to be the, uh, center of attention. Uh, wait,

492
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:44,540
 who said that? It was Wayne. Wayne said that looking all youthful and shit. Wayne, is it

493
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:48,900
 weird to hear Jacob reading your words while you sit here and listen now? Is it weird?

494
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:54,180
 Is that like a weird thing? No, it's not. He, uh, he asked me if we just wanted to talk

495
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:59,220
 about it or if he should read it and I said, just read it. Okay. Great. Good. Good. Good.

496
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:05,940
 Good to know. I'll read the rest of it as Wayne. Man, he's talked about how to use,

497
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:11,700
 it's fun to take improv classes all the time. Even as a season difference. Wow. It's like

498
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:16,620
 listening to a mirror. It is. It's just like listening to a mirror. So I want to be more

499
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:21,740
 like my favorite Donnelly animator, Rob Donnelly, just kidding. Love you, Matt. I love you and

500
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:25,980
 Paul. I love Paul and Jacob too. Uh, that's Wayne. So Wayne's worried that he's going

501
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:35,820
 to be the oldest new kid at the school. Yeah. Shaw Wayne is going back to fourth grade.

502
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:40,460
 Everybody's nervous to go to their first day of anything. So like, you know, for whatever,

503
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:45,820
 whatever laundry list you have of your individual, uh, things that will make you feel like you,

504
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:49,900
 you will stick out or not belong or feel weird being in there. Everyone is walking in with

505
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:55,700
 their own laundry list of the same exact thoughts. There are very few people who are like fucking

506
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:59,420
 love school. Can't wait to go in there. And when I'm there, I can't wait to make other

507
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:06,220
 people feel awkward for being in school. There's no one's agenda walking into school. So, oh,

508
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:11,940
 that could be Wayne's agenda though. That could just be your agenda. I've got a bad

509
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:19,900
 relationship with school. I am not good at it. I never do any of the work. Uh, I'm hoping

510
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,220
 that it's going to be different this time though. Well, it should be a little different

511
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:27,740
 because this is a subject you're very passionate about and it's not exactly, you know, you're

512
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:31,940
 not going there for prerequisites or, you know, having to do a lot of stuff that you

513
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:40,220
 wouldn't want to do, right? Why the, uh, why the choice to go back to school? Uh, I need

514
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:48,300
 to do something. That's what my therapist tells me anyway. You have too much time on

515
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:56,100
 your hands. Yeah. I honestly do. I understand that. Every time I talk about quitting, uh,

516
00:56:56,100 --> 00:57:00,900
 doing shows in town, SJ is like, you will have too much time. She just doesn't want

517
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:06,780
 you in the house, Jacob. Absolutely. School is a form of you forcing yourself to dedicate

518
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:13,460
 the time that you want to dedicate to doing this in the first place. You know, Oh, that's

519
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:17,580
 true. Draw in the chat mentions that you always have an excuse to not do group projects. You

520
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:22,060
 can just say that, uh, you have family shit going on and can't do the other people's schedule

521
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:29,700
 stuff. That's true. You can't get out of a lot of stuff. Sick again. No, be, be more

522
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:36,900
 of a dick about it. Make it about pets and not kids. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Can't my dog.

523
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:45,380
 I can't, can't do it. His name's pirate dog. Oh, you know, I've got it. It's totally real.

524
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:52,300
 I've got this very emotionally needy ferret that needs attention. It needs medication

525
00:57:52,300 --> 00:58:03,920
 on the hour every hour. My fur baby has the sniffles. Latter day scoop. I think just look

526
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:10,700
 at it as more of the social engagement that you'll be gaining from it. And you know, don't

527
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:14,900
 worry about, I don't know what your, what is your objective? What are you hoping to

528
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:23,780
 get out of it? Well, it's, it's something that I chose because one, it was cheap, something

529
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:33,020
 I could afford to. It's sort of in my wheelhouse, but not something I'm great at as for sure.

530
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:39,700
 I'm looking at it because everything I know is self-taught. And I went to college previously

531
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:46,780
 doing multimedia and which included animation and graphics and all of it. And it was just

532
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:54,620
 not a good time. So even if I learn nothing, it's not much of an investment put into it.

533
00:58:54,620 --> 00:59:01,980
 All right. So at the very least I'll learn something. Hopefully. Again, I, me personally,

534
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:06,700
 I would put the emphasis on the social aspect. The fact that you can meet some like-minded

535
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:13,540
 folks who might be in the same industry. And, you know, I think that's the best that you

536
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:18,740
 can hope for. I mean, don't, don't put this on yourself. It's like, Oh, but you might

537
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:23,420
 meet someone who you can truly collaborate with. And, you know, I really, I mean, I was

538
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:30,460
 fortunate enough to have Matt drop into my lap out there in Vegas, and, uh, wish Matt

539
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:37,060
 would drop into my lap. Yeah, don't we all? Don't we all? But that absolutely changed

540
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:42,580
 the trajectory. Preachingfun.com. Matt will drop into your lap for a price. Totally changed

541
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:49,140
 my trajectory and helped me in a myriad of ways to keep me more creative and the opportunities

542
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:55,540
 that have come my way because of my association with him. So, you know, I think that's key.

543
00:59:55,540 --> 01:00:01,700
 At least that's been my experience, is that it really, it's all about networking and getting

544
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:05,380
 those, those social webs designed a little bit. Paul's bringing up something actually

545
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:08,800
 pretty significant, which is that you actually might find someone in there that you want

546
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:13,860
 to collaborate with. In other words, like that's, that would be interesting. All the

547
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:18,020
 things that hold you back, you might find someone is like, is better at it, right? Like,

548
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:21,180
 so like if you're not an organized person, you might have someone who's organized but

549
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:26,860
 not funny, right? Or organized but not a good writer, right? And so like you want to figure

550
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:35,740
 out like you basically want to find someone with different superpowers, right? And so

551
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:43,700
 that might happen through this class. I, I think these are all good ideas. I do think

552
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:49,220
 that you shouldn't ignore the idea of a bit that is presented in such classic films like

553
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:56,700
 old school and the Rodney Dangerfield film, back to school. I think you should emulate

554
01:00:56,700 --> 01:01:01,020
 these people. I think these- I'll search out the showers. These should be your heroes.

555
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:06,500
 The raging party zone. I think you should endeavor to have your classmates call you

556
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:14,580
 old blue. I think you should just go with the full bit. Start a frat, start a fraternity.

557
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:20,420
 Isn't that old school? Old school. Old school. That was one of the characters in old school.

558
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:24,380
 That's my boy blue. Because in Australia, blue is slang for someone with ginger hair.

559
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:34,100
 Oh really? Ow! Yeah, it is. Backward slam? What the fuck? It is. Like, I didn't understand

560
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:40,780
 it as a kid and one time- I don't understand it as an adult. And went to the butchers.

561
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:47,140
 I'm like five years old and the butcher says, "Oh, g'day blue." And I'm like, "What the

562
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:51,780
 fuck?" And I'm like- Well, I was five. I wasn't thinking what the fuck. I was thinking, "Why?

563
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:56,020
 This guy is being mean to me." The fuck did you just say to me, motherfucker? Yeah. So

564
01:01:56,020 --> 01:02:01,860
 as we're leaving, I'm like, "See your sausage face?" And my mom's like, "How dare you?"

565
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:07,660
 I'm like, "I'm just giving it back to this guy." He gave me the business? I'm giving

566
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:13,380
 him the business. It's up there with, "Hey buddy, nice hat." Yeah, it is. See your sausage

567
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:21,060
 face. See your sausage face. I see a joke about two kids hanging out with the wrong

568
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:25,220
 kind of kids and they've been learning how to curse words and stuff like that and they

569
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:30,220
 just think it's exciting and wake up in the morning and mom goes, "What do you guys want

570
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:35,300
 for breakfast?" And the kid goes, "I'll take some fucking eggs." And mom just backhands

571
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:42,300
 him across the room, be like, "You don't speak like that in my household. And what about

572
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:46,220
 you, little Jimmy? What do you want?" And he goes, "Well, I sure as fuck don't want

573
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:57,500
 some fucking eggs." Yeah, so I think that's what you need to aim for. Okay. Backhand

574
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:06,780
 the kids. Yeah, yeah. Is blue a derogatory term for gingers in Australia? No, no. Sausage

575
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:12,280
 faces though, yeah? Derogatory is, for me to say, a term for gingers in Australia is

576
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:19,940
 "ranger." Ranger? Spell that. Ranger, yeah. I'm assuming it's got to do with orangutans

577
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:24,700
 or something. Oh, because they have orange hair. I haven't searched the etymology of

578
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:31,100
 the word. That sounds right. Yet. No, you just hear that when you run, right? Get out

579
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:41,440
 of there. Right, yeah, yeah. He just hears that word and wants a banana. Well, thank

580
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:45,700
 you. Well, thank you, Wayne. Good luck in school. Keep us updated. Thank you for the

581
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:53,420
 advice. Yeah, yeah. Good luck, buddy. Former frat, an awesome party frat, headed by just

582
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:58,980
 the oldest people on campus. I should make it clear that this is a one night a week,

583
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:03,860
 three hours a week course as well. Well, then it's going to be easier to have the frat house.

584
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:07,780
 They'll never expect, that's at least what the group at least expects, zeta zeta zeta

585
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:21,700
 to form. Thanks, Wayne. Thanks, guys. Let's see, we had Captain James T. Scoop in the

586
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:27,980
 back. Wait, you had a you had a story to tell us. Yeah, yeah, go for it. Yeah. Yeah. Where

587
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:33,820
 are you Captain James T. Scoop? Let me find you here. There you are. All right. So you

588
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:38,380
 said you had a story to tell us about the you had two stories to tell us. Which one's

589
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:44,700
 better? Well, actually, well, they're the same story. I just didn't know it. Even better.

590
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:54,540
 She got you, Jacob. She puts two stories in the same one. Yeah, I will say that. Okay.

591
01:04:54,540 --> 01:05:03,780
 So thank you for answering my last email that was about my grandfather passing. I started

592
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:09,660
 that advice. That was really cool. So I mean, he'd already been dead for two weeks. So it

593
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:18,420
 wasn't like super helpful. That's our brand. We don't want to be too helpful. Two weeks.

594
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:23,780
 That's pretty good turnaround for a Scoop Mail. That's better for us. That's incredibly fast.

595
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:32,660
 Actually, you're welcome. Yeah, yeah, never. Never. But at the end of that, I mentioned

596
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:41,940
 something about a return missionary dating application. Yes. And Matt, like kind of grossed

597
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:46,580
 out by it, right? Like, oh, that's weird. I think this is like, actually an application

598
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:53,060
 for will you date me when I get back from my mission? Well, Matt was absolutely correct.

599
01:05:53,060 --> 01:06:01,860
 I said and thought about it. And I was like, well, that is like fucking creepy. Like, that's

600
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:11,260
 not funny. That's weird. That's what I'm here for. It just got me thinking. Matt Donnelly,

601
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:19,660
 not funny, but weird. That's right. Now you can join the magic circle. It just got me

602
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:25,480
 thinking about these things that you do growing up, probably in any religion, but growing

603
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:31,940
 up Mormon, that don't seem weird, that are weird to outsiders. Yeah. So I've got a story

604
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:44,380
 for you. July 24 is a state holiday in Utah. It's called the day and it's the day that

605
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:52,540
 we all celebrate, you know, bring me on and the early church saints, as we call them arriving

606
01:06:52,540 --> 01:07:00,660
 in Utah, right? So something else that we do for the youth in the church, when I say

607
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:07,660
 youth, this is between ages 14 and 18. You do something called track. You do it during

608
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:22,140
 the summer. Paul, stop what you think. It'd be a lot cooler if it was though. So I had

609
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:26,620
 my track experience. I would, we were, I grew up a military brat. We were living in Virginia

610
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:31,780
 in the time y'all are from the East coast. You know how crazy humid it gets in the summer.

611
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:39,820
 It's like disgustingly hot. So the summer before my senior year of high school, I went

612
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:45,060
 to go with my youth group from church. We went up to the Marriott ranch in July, you

613
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:52,420
 know, to celebrate pioneer day. Even though we weren't living in Utah, we all had to dress

614
01:07:52,420 --> 01:08:01,620
 up in pioneer clothes. Oh, that's great. I'm already happy with this. Slow or slower. Were

615
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:08,900
 there buckles on your shoes? Tell me there were buckles on your shoes. My regular, I

616
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:16,420
 think I had regular shoes on. I don't remember that. So this was like a three day trip. We

617
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:26,660
 were not allowed to bring anything that the pioneers would not have had. So that's not

618
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:31,580
 just like phones and you know, MP3 players or whatever at the time. I mean, that's like

619
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:40,820
 toothpaste. Yeah, that's a lot. Oh, come on. Disgusting. Yeah. No, yeah, I'm serious. It's

620
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:48,020
 so a bunch of 14 to 18 year old teenagers in pioneer clothes, pushing hand carts on the

621
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:54,860
 Marriott ranch for three days with no deodorant or toothbrushes. These guys are going through

622
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:58,540
 hormonal changes and puberty and everything else and they already feel horrible about

623
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:03,540
 themselves. How can we make them feel even less attractive to each other? We must. Did

624
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:08,700
 you see Latter Day Scoop posted an image in the chat there? Does that match your experience,

625
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:14,620
 James T. Scoop? They're pulling some kind of wagon and mug. Oh, it's people like strapped

626
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:20,900
 up to a wagon and pulling it themselves instead of horses. Yeah. Also, I've got, I've got

627
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:25,940
 bad news. That's pretty much what they were doing, huh? I've got bad news for you, James

628
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:35,580
 Scoop. So Brigham Young arrived in Salt Lake City or the Salt Lake Valley in 1847. Toothpaste

629
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:43,620
 was invented in 1824. They already had toothpaste by then. They were just fucking with you and

630
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:53,540
 didn't want you to brush your teeth. They were lying to you the whole time. Couldn't

631
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:58,580
 you technically bring golden glasses and a couple of tablets and be like, "Hey, I just

632
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:03,300
 read on here that every modern thing is cool. It's all good. We can just bring whatever

633
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:08,940
 the fuck we want." I should have, right? I should have. No, I've got some invisible tablets

634
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:14,940
 here that say tooth brushing is fine. Become a new prophet. Yeah. Kudos to the rich. I

635
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:20,020
 mean, I'm a woman, though, so they wouldn't have listened to me. Yeah. Kudos to the rich

636
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:24,580
 kid that was like, "I'm bringing a horse. We're bringing a goddamn horse. We're taking

637
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:29,620
 care of the horse the whole time." So is there a start point and destination? What exactly

638
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:36,660
 is the- Yes. Yeah. So there's the place that you start and a place where you end. And so

639
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:40,580
 we get there, they go through our bags, make sure we don't have anything we're not supposed

640
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:46,180
 to have. No toothpaste. My toothpaste. We're dividing two samples. You can keep the whiskey.

641
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:54,660
 The whiskey existed then. Go ahead. Here you go. Right? Yeah. They divide us into families

642
01:10:54,660 --> 01:11:06,420
 and we're all paired with a married couple that we have to call ma and pa. Gross. Boo.

643
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:14,420
 Is there a way for Matt, Paul and I to become one of the people that they call Paul? Yeah.

644
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:19,620
 Can I apply to be a camp counselor at this thing? No. I would bring my own fishbone record

645
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:25,180
 with that "Hey ma and pa" song. Hey ma and pa, what the hell is wrong with y'all? I promise

646
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:29,020
 I'll show up with the dirtiest mouth and the stinkiest armpits to apply. Oh, God damn it.

647
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:38,340
 Does that help? God. Yeah, totally. That'll get you in for sure. Well, you want a side

648
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:45,900
 tangent, but for girls camp, the LDS girls camp, they always want priesthood holder volunteers.

649
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:50,760
 You don't have to have a girl going to the camp to volunteer. So just throwing that out

650
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:57,460
 there. Super creepy. Of course not. Oh, what is creepy about that? Why doesn't anyone care

651
01:11:57,460 --> 01:12:05,140
 about young women? But he's got priesthood, so we're good. I like that Chuck E. Cheese

652
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:10,060
 literally has better security. Chuck E. Cheese literally has better more guidelines about

653
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:15,020
 who can touch the children and their establishment. I could be way off base here guys, but I feel

654
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:20,940
 like there could be a correlation between these organized religious practices and the

655
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:26,460
 fuckery that's going on at the top levels of our government right now. I might be missing

656
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:32,420
 a beat here somewhere, but I think- No, no. Our president has very shiny teeth. He's got

657
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:39,500
 some toothpaste. Those are his real teeth. Fuck off. And do I think he brushes them himself?

658
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:44,780
 No. Oh, no way. No way. No way. Certainly not the bottom row. I think he just brushes

659
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:54,140
 the top teeth and just ignores everything else. That's weirdly horrible. Okay. If I

660
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:57,500
 found out that was true, I feel like that would be the thing that I thought was the

661
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:06,420
 worst thing about Donald Trump. I got news for you. Okay. I'll try to speed this up.

662
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:12,140
 I'll just mention a few of the most egregious things that happened. Please. All right. Okay.

663
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:19,380
 So for the three days. So we start on this handcart trip. For lunch that day, we got

664
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:27,780
 a cutie, one of those little cutie oranges. And that was it. Jesus. I was so hungry. I

665
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:37,980
 ate the peel. Oh God. I was so hungry. And then for dinner, we got a little 10 cup of

666
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:47,180
 broth and a roll. And then to sleep in, we got a tarp for the whole family. And we could

667
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:52,780
 choose to either sleep on top of the tarp or underneath it. If it was going to rain.

668
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:58,860
 Those are our options. And this was your real family or these were the people that you were

669
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:08,220
 just instructed to call mom, ma and pa. Oh, I was called the big sister. I got nominated

670
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:13,340
 to be the big sister and there was a big brother. So you are getting under a tarp with a fake

671
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:25,020
 mom and dad and family after having a cup full of broth. And a cutie. And a cutie, Matt.

672
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:29,420
 I have to tell you, I think the pioneers were better at it than this. I just want to say

673
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:36,100
 it like I don't think. This sounds like someone who didn't understand history. I don't know

674
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:41,540
 that they were that much better at it. How was this broth contained? Was this in a sealed

675
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:52,700
 like canister? Was it like a soup canister? How was the broth contained? Oh, well, no,

676
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:59,020
 they made it over the fire. Like they heated it up in like a pot and then laid it in the

677
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:04,200
 pots. Okay. All right. So we had to walk along with our little cup and then we got a ladle

678
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:10,780
 of broth. What was it made of? It was just like chicken broth. It was probably just bouillon

679
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:17,300
 cubes to tell you the truth. Right, right. Just salty flavored chicken water. Yeah, yeah,

680
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:23,020
 exactly. Good news though, the orange peel actually has more vitamin C and fiber than

681
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:28,100
 the inner fruit. So you did yourself a favor by eating the cutie peel. Well done. You won.

682
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:32,900
 You won the game. You won the survival game. Yeah, yeah. I knew that all along. I was just

683
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:40,900
 testing you guys. Yeah. That's the kind of instincts we need a big sister to have. Yeah,

684
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:46,820
 exactly. You know, I'm bringing, I am in real life a big sister. So I'm just bringing that

685
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:54,340
 experience everywhere I go, you know, bringing that knowledge. Yeah. But a couple other things.

686
01:15:54,340 --> 01:16:02,180
 So one time it was supposed to be a lesson on faith. We had to be blindfolded and they

687
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:08,740
 would tell us where to go with the cart and guide us, you know, with their voices, but

688
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:15,180
 the worst one, and I even at the time, like, and I was, you know, I mean, I'm 17, fully

689
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:21,580
 in it, fully believing, but even at the time I was so upset at this, they have something

690
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:36,140
 called the woman's pool and stretch of time, you know, but there was a time. It's a wagon

691
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:46,340
 washing fundraiser. That would have been a lot better. It would have been a lot more

692
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:51,300
 fun. I'll tell you that. But it was supposed to commemorate this time that we're like the

693
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:56,100
 men went away to do something and the women spent some time with the hand carts on their

694
01:16:56,100 --> 01:17:04,340
 own. And so we were supposed to like, it was like, in their honor kind of a thing, right?

695
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:10,140
 So the boys were not permitted to help. They had to stand on the edges. They waited till

696
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:15,140
 we got to the steepest, hardest part of the trail. Well, there wasn't even a trail but

697
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:21,540
 of our area. And that the boys were allowed to do was like fan us with like their hats

698
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:26,820
 and stuff. But then us girls, the, you know, women and the women's pool, we had to push

699
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:42,340
 the cards of this huge hill all by ourselves while singing hymns. He had like a testimony

700
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:53,620
 of how amazing and wonderful it was to watch you struggle. It was just so difficult. And

701
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:58,860
 I can't imagine how those husbands must have felt leaving their wives. I just wanted to

702
01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:03,580
 help you guys. And I'm like, you little bitches. No, you didn't. You're just glad you didn't

703
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:09,820
 have to do the hardest part. Did these little Mormon boys think that the Mormon pioneers

704
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:17,500
 had just watched and fanned their wives with hats while their wives did all the work? I

705
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:22,660
 don't know, man. I don't know. But they just kept going off about how like it was so hard

706
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:27,420
 for them to watch us struggle so much. And I'm like, I'm sure it was. No, they're the

707
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:32,220
 victims of this. Do you understand? It's good to be a lily white Mormon boy. Is there any

708
01:18:32,220 --> 01:18:36,740
 way that they could have stepped in? Like, was that a possibility that they could step

709
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:42,540
 in and just help that or they were forbidden? No, they weren't allowed to. They weren't.

710
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:47,500
 They weren't allowed to. What do you think would happen if somebody did? Oh, you know,

711
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:54,180
 I mean, it'd be at least as bad as drinking coffee. Oh, you think that bad. I think that

712
01:18:54,180 --> 01:19:00,940
 bad. Yeah. Holy shit. I mean, I think somebody would have intervened and told them to stop

713
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:05,940
 and if they hadn't outraged, I would have stepped out. It's been like, let's help push

714
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:12,300
 this wagon. Also, I would have never done that stupid shit. Maybe. I don't know. I got

715
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:19,420
 roped into some dumb shit when I was young, young. But I think I started a podcast. It

716
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:24,260
 took me to like 20 to really free myself from this shit. And even then I was still kind

717
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:31,260
 of fucked with it. Yeah. It's hard. I mean, yeah, I started questioning, you know, mid

718
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:41,500
 20s, but then just that fear of like, right. I don't want to go to hell. Yeah. Okay. We

719
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:46,820
 got to kill a chicken and learn square dancing and then I got my period at the end of it.

720
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:53,380
 So, you know, yes. See pushing that card uphill. There's a plan for everything. There's a plan

721
01:19:53,380 --> 01:20:06,780
 for everything. Thank you, Captain James D Scoop. Amazing. Thank you for sharing. The big brother

722
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:10,980
 had to kill the chicken. I was allowed to de-feather it, but I could not be had it because

723
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:19,420
 that was a boy's job. But anyway, that's awesome. Yeah. All right, Captain James D Scoop. We'll

724
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:27,660
 see you at the throne. See you at the throne. Thanks for letting me share guys. Oh yeah.

725
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:38,260
 Also you, you look good as a Ranga. Now we've got you a more Australian slang. Perfect.

726
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:42,980
 I'll say it. I think the Mormons got a couple of things wrong. I don't, I know, I don't

727
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:47,420
 want to, I don't want to ruffle too many. I don't want to ruffle too many recently plucked

728
01:20:47,420 --> 01:21:05,100
 chicken feathers, but I think they got a few things wrong. Well, we'll see you at the throne.

729
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:26,980
 I'm chicken feathers. Uh, guys. Okay. Uh, so I want to scoop baby. I want to scoop baby.

731
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:40,380
 And I was just thinking like we've got, I need help salt pork as our, as our greetings.

 See you at the cone. All right. I'm running Joe. You could use it. You got to just come

740
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:28,480
 out to a scoop event. Come on out, man. And hopefully there'll be some more scoop events

741
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:33,760
 around the country next year. That, that'd be a great goal. I'm running into a time conflict

742
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:38,960
 here. So let's, let's, let's, let's, uh, let's go. We got a scooper today from diamond scoop.

743
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:44,340
 The categories are Oakland, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Raiders. Paul, you're up first.

744
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:49,880
 What do you want? I will go ahead and try Las Vegas for 200 Las Vegas for 200. Everything

745
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:53,520
 you think of when you think of Las Vegas, including the strip and the home stadium of

746
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:59,120
 the Las Vegas Raiders is not actually in the city of Las Vegas. What is the name of the

747
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:06,040
 unincorporated town? These attractions reside in. It is known as paradise. Nevada paradise.

748
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:14,240
 Nevada is correct. Yeah. Me. I'll try a Raiders for 200 every year. There are stupid rumors

749
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:18,800
 that the Raiders will trade QB Derrick car. Oh, this is an older scooperty from before

750
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:29,240
 the Q the Raiders traded Derek. Derek is already played for the saints and retired. Maybe they'll

751
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:33,160
 stop now that the Raiders traded for this player who is an all pro, a pro bowler and

752
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:45,200
 cars former teammate at Fresno state. That was shit. Uh, Adams, uh, Devante Adams. Come

753
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:52,520
 on. There it is. Devante Adams. Nice. Man, you're up. I got to test my vintage Raiders

754
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:59,160
 knowledge here. Raiders for 400. We could use more scooperties head over to HeyScoops.com.

755
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:05,120
 Just a reminder. The Raiders are one of the more mobile teams having played home games

756
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:10,480
 in LA, Oakland, Las Vegas, and even San Francisco for their opening season while Oakland Coliseum

757
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:19,200
 was being built. What year did the Raiders move to LA within five 1985 1985. That's right.

758
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:27,840
 It's right in that neighborhood. 82 for sure. You got it. Safe. Well done. Uh, Paul Vegas

759
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:35,760
 please Vegas during the last weekend of April, 2022 Las Vegas will hold this event with people

760
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:42,640
 coming from all over the world to attend the festivities. Oh my God. Was this scoop fest?

761
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:52,960
 It might've been. I'm going to go scoop fest. Let's try scoop fest. It was scoop fest. The

762
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:58,840
 NFL draft does not count. Oh, that was the year that we had scoop fest during the NFL

763
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:04,960
 draft. That's right. It's me. I'll try Oakland for 200. This former Oakland resident is known

764
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:10,280
 for his comedy and political podcasts and his very sexy salt and pepper hair and beard.

765
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:15,880
 He currently resides in Austin, Texas. Uh, I believe that would be the one and only Justin

766
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:25,600
 Robert Young. Yeah. Jury if you're nasty. Jury if you're nasty. Matt. Um, Raiders 600. Daily

767
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:33,800
 double. All of it, Jacob. I want it all. Raiders legendary owner, Al Davis is known for his

768
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:39,520
 catchphrase. Just win baby. And suing the NFL so he could move to LA. Al got his start

769
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:48,120
 with the Raiders in 1963 in this position. A doggy doggy position. Uh, yes, that's right.

770
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:54,360
 Oh, it's a double daily double. So I have to come up with something. Well, she's a water

771
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:59,840
 boy. Was she the guy that brought the waters? What's it called when you, uh, when you collect

772
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:06,040
 the uniforms and stuff, uh, in Jersey, like the equipment manager, equipment manager.

773
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:10,440
 That's my, that's my equipment manager is my guess. Oh, head coach. He went right to

774
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:21,800
 head coach. Excuse me. Excuse me. The equipment manager for the entire team. Equipment personnel.

775
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:31,040
 All of it. Yeah. Paul Las Vegas, please. The other daily double. Not diggity damn. Look

776
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:37,000
 at you fellas. Vegas is becoming quite the sports town. It sure is. With the golden

777
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:40,840
 Knights making the Stanley cup finals in their first year and the Raiders making the playoffs

778
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:46,160
 in their second season in town. What other major team is rumored to be moving to Las

779
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:56,600
 Vegas? The A's. Let's see. It is the Oakland A's. Maybe they're still rumored. I'm actually,

780
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:00,120
 I'm actually draining my pool right now because we're going to build a stadium right, right

781
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:06,280
 by backyard. Can you believe all that dirt moving around bullshit they're doing for nothing?

782
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:11,840
 Yes. Yes, I can. They can afford it. Yeah, they can. I'm Las Vegas for 800. No, they

783
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:18,960
 can't. In the year 2281 of the fallout universe, after the great war wiped out most of humanity,

784
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:24,640
 Hoover Dam is the site of much turmoil. As depicted in Fallout New Vegas, two factions

785
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:33,800
 fight in the second battle of Hoover Dam. Name one of the factions. Damn. Damn. Damn.

786
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:40,800
 Damn, son. I don't have a single idea. I have to pass the mat. Oh, well as a fallout

787
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:51,640
 player, I pass. Yeah. You don't want to reveal the secrets. Yeah. Paul. Vault Tech would

788
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:57,400
 be my guess, but I don't have a guess because I don't know. I'll pass. All right. NCR, that's

789
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:04,780
 the New California Republic and/or Caesar's Legion or just the Legion. Hey, Leann Casab.

790
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:10,640
 Don't type the answers into the chat during the scooper, you jerk. Oh no. No, Leon's just,

791
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:18,200
 he's too used to us playing our night games. He's playing with me. Thank you. Thank you,

792
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:23,760
 Leon. I can't see the chat. I'm sharing the screen, so I'm not getting the answers. All

793
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:33,160
 right, Matt, you're up. Los Angeles, 200. All right. LA is the home to a ridiculous number

794
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:37,560
 of sports teams, including the surrounding suburbs. How many professional teams from

795
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:43,640
 the big four leagues currently call LA home plus or minus one? Let's see. We got the Kings

796
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:54,160
 in Hockey, Lakers, Clippers, and then we got the Chargers. There's a WNBA team there, I'm

797
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:59,760
 sure. Yeah, but they don't call it. That's not part of the big four. Really? Big four

798
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:08,680
 is Basketball, Football, Basketball, and Hockey. Seven. Baseball. Seven. Let's see. Eight. Rams,

799
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:14,720
 Chargers, Angels, Dodgers, Lakers, Clippers, Kings, and Ducks. Ducks is what I was missing.

800
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:18,720
 Plus two more if you include MLS. Ah, you didn't have the Anaheim Ducks. And now the

801
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:27,080
 Ducks. But you got it within one. Wow. Paul, you're up. I'll close out Raiders. What the

802
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:31,520
 hell? I don't know anything about that. What the hell? This head coach led the Raiders to

803
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:36,280
 their first Super Bowl win, has the second highest win percentage, and revolutionized

804
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:41,700
 sports video games by insisting the series with his name on it was the most realistically.

805
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:52,600
 He tragically died in 2021. That is John Madden. John Madden, of course, the coach. Woohoo.

806
01:29:52,600 --> 01:30:00,640
 That's me. I'll try Oakland. It's a me. Oakland for 400. The Oakland Coliseum was the shared

807
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:07,020
 home of the Raiders and the A's for many years. In its later years, it was known for the dugouts

808
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:17,200
 flooding with sewage. What year was the Coliseum built within 10 years? Uh, 19. Within 10 years?

809
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:31,520
 Let's try 1980. 1966? Holy shit. They don't build what they used to. They don't. I saw

810
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:40,080
 a lot of games in there. It didn't seem that old. Matt. Um, let's do Oakland for 600. San

811
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:47,200
 Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge opened November 12, 1936. Six months before the Golden Gate Bridge at a

812
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:56,720
 cost of $78 million. The estimate to replace the Eastern span in 2013 was $250 million. With over

813
01:30:56,720 --> 01:31:06,520
 runs, how much did it actually cost within a billion? Pass. Passes to me. Paul. Pass. That passes

814
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:12,400
 to me. Uh, let's see. Uh, the scores are Paul has 2000 and Matt and I both have zero. I'll,

815
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:21,320
 I'll take a swing at it. I'll say it was supposed to be 250 million. I'll say 2.5 billion. Good

816
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:31,520
 guess. 6.4 billion. Lord. That's, I'll say it. That's too much. That's that's an overrun

817
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:38,080
 expected. Yeah, that's right there. Paul. Uh, that's worse than the sphere. Los Angeles,

818
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:44,640
 please. Which is impressive. And 2028 LA will tie London and Paris for hosting the most Olympic

819
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:53,720
 games. Name one of the two previous years LA hosted the Olympics. 84. 84. I think that's right.

820
01:31:53,720 --> 01:32:05,520
 84 and 32. That is me. I'll do LA for 800 in 2022. Will Smith slapped the shit out of Chris rock

821
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:11,080
 during the Oscars held at this theater named after an American company specializing in audio

822
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:22,760
 noise reduction, audio encoding, compression, spatial audio, and HDR imaging. Oh, sorry. That

823
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:28,440
 question is directed at me. I was just reading the question and waiting on what are you guys to

824
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:35,080
 answer it. I believe that is the Dolby theater. Got to be. It is the Dolby theater. Blinding.

825
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:43,360
 Yes. Why aren't y'all talking? The Thomas Dolby theater. Uh, Matt Oakland or LA. If I get both

826
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:47,720
 of these questions, I can get in second place. And right now I'm just in second place. No,

827
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:54,160
 I'm in third place. Yeah. I'll take 200 points behind me for second place. Oakland for 800 to

828
01:32:54,160 --> 01:33:01,920
 seal a tie for second place. Let's do it. According to a random list. I found online the ATAT from

829
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:08,200
 star Wars was inspired by the huge four legged cranes on the port of Oakland. It also says the

830
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:16,040
 port is top five in North America. What does at at stand for or what's the largest port in North

831
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:23,760
 America? Oh, geez. Matt, there are two very simple questions here. You can answer either

832
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:32,280
 of them. Uh, artificial testicle, artificial testicle, because it's two balls. Got that one

833
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:38,760
 dead on. Yeah. Yeah. Go for your bonus. I thought the largest port in North America was the port of

834
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:44,760
 San Francisco, but I might be wrong. But I have to guess here because we're at the end of the time

835
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:51,920
 here. Uh, I'll go with the port of San Francisco. All right, let's try it. All-terrain armored

836
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:57,400
 transport or port of Los Angeles. Oh, port of LA. You're just a little north, just a little north.

837
01:33:57,400 --> 01:34:03,040
 I got all-terrain, but I couldn't put my finger on armored transport completely. Paul closing out

838
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:09,120
 the category and the game. Los Angeles for 600. LA is the home of many conventions and trade shows.

839
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:15,320
 This trade show covers the video game industry and at one time was the largest gaming expo of

840
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:23,520
 the year. E3, which no longer exists. E3 or electronic entertainment expo. That's absolutely

841
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:30,800
 right. And with that correct answer, Paul just submitted his win with 3000 points. I'm in second

842
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:36,920
 place with 200 points. Matt is in a close third with negative 800 points. Port of Los Angeles.

843
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:41,960
 Diamond Scoop, port of Los Angeles for the loss. Thank you, Diamond Scoop. If you want to send us

 Mysore up there. I believe it was the first winner of the American accent contest at Scoop Fest.

853
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:33,960
 Yes, I believe he was. Akshay, good to see you, buddy. Yeah, thanks for popping on, pal. Shoutout

858
