1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Oh hello there, I am so glad you are here because I want to thank you, the ice cream truck driver.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Who are the ice cream truck drivers?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 These are the folks that deliver that ice cream straight to your ear holes.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Right now I'd like to thank Travis Jagre, Thunder, Cougar Falcon, Scoop, the lost ice cream truck driver,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Slurpee Caillet motherfucker, Scoop Cotta, Scoop Dijor, Scoop Brady, and Sax Guy, Jimmy D. Scoop.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 If you want to be an ice cream truck driver just like these fine folks, head over to PreachingFun.com.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 PreachingFun.com is where you go to sign up to be an ice cream truck driver, and who knows?

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 The life you save may be your own.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Here's a show.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social?

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Yeah, I'd love to.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Great, let's go.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Scoopfest coming up at the end of the month.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 We won't talk about it the whole episode, but I'm going to say it now.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Scoopfest.com, head over there, join us here in beautiful Las Vegas at the end of September.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 It's going to be awesome.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 So soon.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 It's time for Matt and Mattingly's Ice Cream Social.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Sitting in Las Vegas, that's Matt Donnelly.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Sitting in Pittsburgh, that's Paul Mattingly.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Also sitting in Las Vegas is me, Jacob the Audio Guy.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 We're PreachingFun.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Hey everybody.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 That's a nice hat tonight, Jacob.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Thank you, thank you.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 I like that one.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Paul, you were asleep, so we had our first Scoopfest crisis, but you were asleep, so we didn't bother you.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Yeah.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 I appreciate that.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 What happened?

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Well, that lineup subject to change asterisk is really coming into play this time.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Okay.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Yeah.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 The asterisk has changed.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 All right.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Just one thing.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Just one of them.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Right, but we already had some stuff made up that's going to have to just be like, well-

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Oh no, we've already gotten-

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Lanyards and stuff.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Yeah.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 No, we've already gotten sub people in, and yeah, we're all good.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Oh.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Yes.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 So lanyards weren't printed with the old info yet?

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Oh, no, the lanyards are printed.

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 The schedule on the lanyards-

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 We're fucked on lanyards.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 We're fucked.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 That's fine.

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 That's fine.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 There's one event on the lanyard that's going to be a different name than what's on the lanyard.

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 That's okay.

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 That's the way it goes.

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Yeah.

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 In the same time slot.

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 No problem.

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 I appreciate you guys letting me sleep.

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 I, again, like I said, been fighting a cold.

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,320
 You can hear it in my chest.

61
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:32,760
 My head is really hurting today, and I slept in because I was off today, and Ann didn't

62
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,000
 go in until late, so she was handling the little dogs.

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,360
 Man, I was out.

64
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,000
 I was in bed till 11, so yeah, and it was-

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 P.M.

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 11 a.m.

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Slept all day.

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Yeah, I slept all day.

69
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 No, no, no.

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 That's fine.

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,960
 Now, does Ann factor in your sickness when she hates you for being a wuss, for not going

72
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,000
 into work because you weren't scheduled?

73
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Smart.

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,720
 I'll have you know that that all got resolved, so my non-schedule had two-

75
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,120
 Ranch Slunk in the chat is already blaming the microwave hot dogs for your illness, Paul.

76
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,120
 Two components.

77
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
 No.

78
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,120
 I agree.

79
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,120
 Ranch Slunk, by the way, is correct.

80
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,000
 I didn't have any microwave hot dogs yesterday.

81
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 We had pizza.

82
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Ann and I ordered pizza.

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,160
 Fire it up the oven?

84
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,680
 No, we got Domino's.

85
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
 We got Domino's.

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,680
 It was great fun.

87
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,100
 We were having one of those nights.

88
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,400
 We were really being fun with each other.

89
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,720
 We love just hanging out on the couch being catty bitches.

90
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:36,400
 We watch this show right now called, oh, what is it called, Stewart's Crossing?

91
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,880
 It's not Stewart's Crossing.

92
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,760
 Sullivan's Crossing.

93
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,760
 Sullivan's Crossing.

94
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,280
 Have you guys heard of this show?

95
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
 I've heard of it.

96
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280
 I've not seen it.

97
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,680
 Canadian Scoop Crystals is pumping her fist.

98
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,360
 Yeah, it's a Canuck production.

99
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,120
 It is heavily Canadian, this show.

100
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
 They got-

101
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
 Sponsored by Tim Artins.

102
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,840
 They got some folks in the show who you would refer to in Canada as Native characters, like

103
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:09,320
 Native Americans, Native North Americans, so they got some of that.

104
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:16,560
 It's sort of like Northern Exposure, but not funny and-

105
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,000
 Oh, so just like Northern Exposure.

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,600
 No, it's not funny.

107
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
 Stay down, Northern Exposure.

108
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,280
 And it leans pretty heavy into stereotypical, romance-y dumb stuff.

109
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,640
 First Nations, first people, yes.

110
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,480
 So they have this guy.

111
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,800
 It's the guy from Gilmore Girls who was Luke, who I can't remember.

112
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,320
 The romantic lead in Gilmore Girls.

113
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,320
 Does that give you a-

114
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,840
 Luke from Gilmore Girls?

115
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,440
 Listen, buddy.

116
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,040
 I've watched that series as well.

117
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,720
 These are the shows that I watch with the wife.

118
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,520
 If you just want like a timeout, Paul, and get all your facts together, we can do that.

119
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,520
 We can figure out something.

120
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,280
 I'm just saying.

121
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,840
 You keep asking us for things that definitely Jacob and I have never come close to watching.

122
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,000
 You've never seen Gilmore Girls.

123
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,400
 Stop yelling at me.

124
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,800
 No, that's a snappy dialogue.

125
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,800
 Good show.

126
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
 That's a good show.

127
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
 Snappy dialogue?

128
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
 See you later, guys.

129
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
 I have to go stream the Gilmore Girls.

130
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
 Matt has left the Zoom chat.

131
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:34,800
 Matt will be back on the show after he's watched the Gilmore Girls.

132
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,400
 Hey guys, I'm back.

133
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
 I just want a preview.

134
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,400
 I can't believe the snappiness.

135
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,000
 So much snappiness.

136
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,280
 Anyway, it's a good little show.

137
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,380
 But this Sullivan's Crossing is cray-cray, cray-cray.

138
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:01,240
 The guy is basically just an unlikable character.

139
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,680
 He's just an old curmudgeon who runs a camp.

140
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,520
 He's got this Sullivan's Crossing.

141
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,920
 He goes by "call me Sully, bleh I'm Sully."

142
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,680
 Name a Sullivan who wasn't called Sully.

143
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,680
 That's what I know.

144
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,680
 Who was like, "call me Van."

145
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
 Right.

146
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,520
 No, he's just Sully.

147
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,320
 "Call me Van."

148
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,840
 Van's Crossing.

149
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840
 His daughter...

150
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,640
 There's one of them out there that I just call Goose Killer now.

151
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,240
 Wait, does that mean the whole time it's been Sullivan, Sully Van Halen?

152
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,240
 Is that the way we should be?

153
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,400
 Oh my gosh, it should have been Sully Van Halen.

154
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,880
 Maybe it's Sylvanian Van Halen.

155
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,880
 Sylvanian Halen.

156
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,040
 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our show.

157
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,840
 We are Sullivan Halen.

158
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,100
 We are the number one tribute rock band.

159
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,040
 We celebrate Van Halen and Sullivan's Crossings.

160
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
 Sullivan Morrison.

161
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,000
 It is the best two things.

162
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Sullivan Halen.

163
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Here we are.

164
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Sullivan Morrison.

165
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,120
 If I had anything to reference Sullivan's Crossings, I would do so right now for the

166
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,120
 sake of the joke.

167
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,840
 His estranged daughter comes back to Sullivan's Crossing.

168
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,320
 She's gone on to be a brain surgeon.

169
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
 She's a literal...

170
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,480
 Supposed to be a brain surgeon.

171
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,880
 Now, Matt, how many years of education...

172
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,880
 You know, I've got a bad dare.

173
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,880
 I even reach her.

174
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,880
 You know, I've got the hots.

175
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:30,360
 Yeah, I've got the hots for a teacher.

176
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,640
 That's it.

177
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,640
 That's it.

178
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
 Matt.

179
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,640
 Matt.

180
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
 You gotta talk to your boys.

181
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,640
 I know what I was going to say.

182
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,640
 Right now.

183
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,640
 Right now.

184
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,640
 They gotta do a couple Van Halen covers.

185
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,640
 Yup.

186
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,640
 Don't say anything else, Paul.

187
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,640
 I'm done.

188
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,640
 It's on our WhatsApp thread.

189
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,640
 Yup.

190
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
 It'll be on there.

191
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,360
 I've got shoes burning down the avenue.

192
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,240
 I'm hot for teacher.

193
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,720
 What do you say?

194
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,720
 What do you know?

195
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,720
 I'm hot for teacher.

196
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,400
 Eruption is what I was just thinking of.

197
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
 Which one?

198
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
 Yeah.

199
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,400
 Eruption.

200
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,220
 Just the guitar solo.

201
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,800
 On accordion or harpsichord?

202
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
 Yeah.

203
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
 Yeah.

204
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,800
 That's it.

205
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
 Good Lord.

206
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
 That's...

207
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
 Panama.

208
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
 I've never been to Panama.

209
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,800
 I've never been.

210
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
 I'll never go.

211
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
 Panama.

212
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
 The country's quite large.

213
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,760
 I'm stuck here.

214
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:36,320
 Are there any pubs in Panama?

215
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,600
 You know what his son was named?

216
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
 Wolfgang.

217
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,600
 Wolfgang Sullivan Halen.

218
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:51,520
 I love to skip and dance.

219
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,800
 No.

220
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,960
 So the girl comes back and she's a neurosurgeon.

221
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,080
 After all of that.

222
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
 I'm so sorry.

223
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
 She's a neurosurgeon.

224
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,800
 How many years would you think would take to become a neurosurgeon?

225
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
 Eight.

226
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
 Study.

227
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
 At least eight.

228
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
 Yeah.

229
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,960
 So we're experimenting around 24 tops.

230
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,960
 Okay.

231
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
 Okay.

232
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,840
 So we're already starting to do ramp jumps of logic.

233
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,360
 Canadian Dookie Houser for those making a temporary reference.

234
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,840
 Not even.

235
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,400
 But she's not with it.

236
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
 She misses everything.

237
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
 Everything.

238
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
 Everything.

239
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
 Everything.

240
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
 Everything.

241
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
 Everything.

242
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,160
 Her dad's a former alcoholic, recovering alcoholic.

243
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,520
 She just misses everything.

244
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,520
 Everything.

245
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,600
 One of the things that happened in this last episode that we watched, he gets hospitalized

246
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:50,440
 with a heart condition, had a heart something go on.

247
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:56,760
 And he's in the hospital and around all of this is the looming possibility that he's

248
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,120
 going to lose this Sullivan's Crossing campground because he can't pay the bills.

249
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,820
 And Anne and I just looked at each other and like, he had a heart attack and was hospitalized.

250
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,360
 If this was America, the show is over.

251
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,520
 He has gone into full on forever debt.

252
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,560
 He can't even do bankruptcy with medical debt.

253
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
 He's done.

254
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,560
 He's done.

255
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,100
 We were just like, this is amazing to see this from a Canadian perspective.

256
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,800
 And he also got belligerent in the hospital and pushed a doctor and stuff.

257
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,680
 And we're like, there would have been a security officer there shooting him in the head if

258
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,720
 this was the States.

259
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:43,440
 This is not, it's just so crazy to watch with a non-Canadian eye.

260
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,880
 Oh, that's true.

261
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,200
 Scoop Jesus in the chat is pointing out that Breaking Bad, just the concept of the show

262
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,120
 of Breaking Bad does not work in Canada.

263
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
 Right.

264
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,040
 Because the whole impetus for the show is that he gets sick and can't afford the cancer

265
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
 treatment.

266
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,040
 Right.

267
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,040
 That's number one.

268
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,920
 That was everyone's number one takeaway from Breaking Bad and that's why you saw so much

269
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,920
 medical reform.

270
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,920
 That's right.

271
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,920
 That's right.

272
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:13,240
 Instead of medical reform, we have pizzas on roofs.

273
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:21,000
 It is crazy that when you really see what we have on roofs and blue math, you look at

274
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,840
 any hit drama, exactly what we got any hit drama that we've had of like the last 20 years.

275
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
 Yeah.

276
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
 Yeah.

277
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,840
 None of it.

278
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,320
 None of it works outside of the States because of the bullshit that we have integrated into

279
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,320
 our society.

280
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,760
 Well, so many movies and then you get into like the dated stuff.

281
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,520
 So many movies in the States, you got the healthcare stuff and then like the older movies,

282
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,200
 the plot goes away if anybody has a cell phone.

283
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
 Right.

284
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
 All these things.

285
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
 It's great.

286
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,560
 Like the whole movie goes away if things just aren't terrible.

287
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,560
 Yeah.

288
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:59,280
 Well, I mean the show, The Wire, is one of the most celebrated shows we've made.

289
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,600
 We don't need wires anymore.

290
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,600
 Right.

291
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,080
 The Wire, we don't need a wire.

292
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,080
 Every season, that's it.

293
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,680
 That whole show is just built on, every season was a different systematic failure of our

294
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,680
 government bureaucracy.

295
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,680
 Yeah.

296
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,680
 It's just wild.

297
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,200
 And then you get into the show that kind of started all of those back in the day on HBO,

298
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
 you had Oz.

299
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,240
 And it's just about like if you have any prison reform or if you have decent, like a decent

300
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,560
 justice system, you don't have that show.

301
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
 Right.

302
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,280
 No, that show is about hot prison sex and I'm here for it.

303
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
 Oh, man.

304
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,520
 Well, I'm not saying they're not great shows or that they don't have the amount of prison

305
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,600
 sex that I need to get through the day.

306
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:45,400
 I'm just saying they don't work outside of the US.

307
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,640
 I'm happy with every other part of them.

308
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,440
 But we're just, we're just watching that show and just mocking it at every turn and having

309
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,760
 a good laugh here and there.

310
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,760
 And really enjoys it though.

311
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,800
 And it is kind of a nice relaxing show.

312
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,000
 And I mean, it's honestly, it's like, it's fantasy for us.

313
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,800
 We're like, Oh man, you imagine living somewhere where people could talk to their neighbors

314
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,960
 and then you could go and get taken care of when you had a heart attack and not lose your

315
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,040
 fucking place of business.

316
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,920
 Oh God.

317
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,920
 Not free enough.

318
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
 Oh yeah.

319
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,920
 You're right.

320
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
 You're right.

321
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,000
 Totally not free.

322
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,320
 Not free enough to suffer.

323
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,280
 Where is your freedom to pay?

324
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:33,920
 Oh, well, it's a weird topic to bring up on a comedy show, but we were on the air the

325
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,760
 other day during the Charlie Kirk stuff.

326
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
 Oh no.

327
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
 We can't talk about that.

328
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,760
 We're not talking about it at all.

329
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:46,240
 All I want to talk about with that is that it fucked me up for the day.

330
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,520
 Well, sure.

331
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,520
 Yeah.

332
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:54,040
 Getting, getting, uh, getting news that someone just got killed for being on shows, voicing

333
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,520
 opinions like it fucked me up for the whole.

334
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:04,800
 I made a point to go to my comic book store, even though it was late in the day and I needed,

335
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,320
 I needed just, I just picked up a few, oh, but here's okay.

336
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,480
 So to shift topics completely, do it, do it because we, we were on the air when it came

337
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,760
 out and then the, and then the show came out and everything, it feels weird to not say

338
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:24,000
 something about it, but that's, that's kind of what happened right when we were on.

339
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,480
 And then, and then, yes, the last couple of days have been not so weird.

340
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,480
 Not so weird.

341
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,480
 Yeah.

342
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,160
 Uh, bad news, Matt, guys, guys, I got it.

343
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,480
 I was reading up on, on, uh, Israel and Gaza.

344
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,480
 Should we just go there?

345
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,480
 Should we?

346
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,480
 No, no, no.

347
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,400
 Let's just, let's shift over to a fun topic at, uh, at the comic book shop.

348
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,760
 I got to pick this up.

349
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,080
 It's a brand new arc, brand new start of a new run of powers.

350
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,960
 Oh, Matt's kids are going to be so, so I'm so sorry.

351
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:59,680
 That your son is probably going to find more of these books now and just go to Whackety

352
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,240
 Jackety town for everybody on Twitch, uh, just open up the centerfold, show everybody

353
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,240
 the centerfold.

354
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,240
 Let's see.

355
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,240
 Let's see what the centerfold is.

356
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,240
 Don't do it on Twitch.

357
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,640
 Look at the next issue.

358
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,640
 Oh my goodness.

359
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,640
 Oh wow.

360
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,160
 That's just, that's just, uh, jizz.

361
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,160
 Yeah.

362
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,120
 I don't know what's going on there.

363
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,120
 Yeah.

364
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
 It's not even drawn on there.

365
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,440
 Paul just showed us his jisms now on a comic book.

366
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,440
 I will show you.

367
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,440
 That's just him.

368
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:33,440
 Speaking of those laminated, speaking of snapping dialogue, this is Bendis dialogue right here.

369
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,520
 That's what, that, that's what Bendis is known for.

370
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,360
 Just talkie talkie talkie talkie talkie talkie talkie.

371
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,360
 His comments.

372
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,960
 If you can't see the video, Paul just held up a comic book to the camera.

373
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,080
 It was a full panel.

374
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,560
 Just chuck a block with a word.

375
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,000
 It looked like a lot of speech bubbles.

376
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Lot of word balloons.

377
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Yes.

378
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,720
 Uh, that's some, that's a, that's a Bendis hallmark right there.

379
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,800
 And I'm pleased to see that again.

380
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,320
 I'm looking forward to reading this new arc and seeing where it goes.

381
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,320
 So yay.

382
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,400
 New powers is out everybody.

383
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,600
 New powers.

384
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
 New powers.

385
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
 New powers.

386
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
 Yeah.

387
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,400
 Dead last celebrating as well.

388
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
 That's good.

389
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
 And what else?

390
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,440
 Oh, and then, uh, and then I got this too.

391
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:18,400
 This is for those other super nerds out there, Transformers issue 24.

392
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:24,320
 This is, uh, the culmination of the two year arc done by Daniel Warren Johnson, uh, and

393
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:33,680
 uh, Jorge Corona, uh, this is the end of this story and this book has been incredibly successful.

394
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,640
 Um, what's his name?

395
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,720
 Kirkman from walking dead.

396
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,800
 This is one of his side project things he's taking over the main writing.

397
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,200
 So that's going to be really interesting.

398
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:51,400
 I would love to see the possibility of a Kirkman Transformers storyline that could be made

399
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,120
 television or film thing.

400
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,120
 Preach.

401
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
 Right.

402
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,920
 Are you think, you know, are you, do you know what Kirkman would add to that, to that comic

403
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,920
 Paul?

404
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,920
 What would he, what would he add?

405
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,920
 Snappy dialogue.

406
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,920
 He's my dad.

407
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:11,400
 He's the guy behind you would open, you would open the comic and it would snap right back

408
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,400
 close.

409
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:21,360
 He doesn't have some pretty good dialogue.

410
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,520
 I mean, he's, he's the guy behind walking dead.

411
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:31,000
 He's the guy behind, uh, invincible he, and I would love to see an invincible style cartoon

412
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,480
 helmed by Robert Kirkman for transformers.

413
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
 I think that'd be awesome.

414
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,440
 Are you watching any of the peacemaker Paul peacemaker peacemaker.

415
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,600
 Oh, I haven't watched the new season yet.

416
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,600
 It's yeah.

417
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,600
 I haven't either.

418
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
 The first season was so good.

419
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,000
 I really liked the first season.

420
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 So funny.

421
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Is it good?

422
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Okay.

423
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Yes.

424
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 How many episodes are we in now?

425
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 I think three.

426
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,680
 I watched two, but I think, I think I have one on the hopper.

427
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,680
 Yeah.

428
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,680
 Scoop Jesus in the chat.

429
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,680
 You're I'm, I'm with you.

430
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,360
 We're, we're letting it get a little ahead and then we'll probably, that's kind of my

431
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
 thing.

432
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,360
 Yeah.

433
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,360
 I always want to.

434
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,360
 That's what I'm doing with task.

435
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,240
 Oh, oh, we tried, we tried to watch it, but I'm not trying it yet.

436
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:18,360
 I'm waiting to the four or five episodes to watch it yesterday during all the, you know,

437
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:24,640
 we're watching it and, and Anne's like, I'm already just like a bundle of nerves and nothing's

438
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,040
 even happened in this thing.

439
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:30,040
 Like nothing is, nothing happens in the first 20 minutes or so that we watched.

440
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,440
 And she's just like, and I was like, fine, I'll turn it off.

441
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,640
 And she's like, and I'm like, we just watched that evil lives here, latest episode with

442
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,560
 that horrible kid that ended up going crazy, killed his mom, all that nutty stuff.

443
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,520
 And she's like, yeah, but that's true.

444
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,760
 This is made up.

445
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,760
 Let's just watch.

446
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,760
 What's already actually happened.

447
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:55,840
 Why do you have to keep making up horrible stuff like, okay, you're right.

448
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
 You're right.

449
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:04,840
 This is on the reality of the horror show that is existent and not the fictional horror

450
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,840
 show.

451
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,120
 Also, we are going to talk about Gaza.

452
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,320
 Oh my God, it's just outrageous.

453
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,000
 Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

454
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 That one.

455
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 I stopped watching.

456
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Did you ever get into nerd core rap?

457
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,280
 MC Chris.

458
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,280
 Um, yes, I love MC Chris and, uh, who's the other one that I like?

459
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:32,760
 Well, there's a couple, but, um, there's another guy that used to do, uh, packs every year.

460
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:38,560
 He was a, uh, mainstay, but yeah, but MC Chris is still my nerd core rap guy.

461
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,560
 Why?

462
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,560
 What's that?

463
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,560
 I turned out.

464
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,480
 I liked a band that was nerd core rap without me knowing it was nerd core rap.

465
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,560
 I just said when I looked them up recently, I was literally on the plane and I was like,

466
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,560
 I want to listen to something.

467
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,040
 I basically get, uh, like, I'm like, why?

468
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,000
 I would say I have nothing to listen to and I used to listen to a ton of music and I'm

469
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,560
 always like at a loss of what to listen to.

470
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,360
 I'd do the same things, right?

471
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,360
 Uh huh.

472
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,400
 Um, I'll go into David Bowie or Tom Waits, Jag or something like that.

473
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,440
 And then it's predictable.

474
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,640
 Um, I'm on a good music kick right now.

475
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,280
 I'll tell you about it when you're done.

476
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,280
 Was it?

477
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,680
 So I was like, Oh, there was this band that crushed, uh, I saw them multiple times because

478
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,680
 they just were always in lineups.

479
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,680
 They were never the headliner.

480
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,680
 They're always in lineups.

481
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,760
 A band called Two Skinny Jays.

482
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,400
 Are you familiar with them?

483
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,840
 I have heard of them.

484
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,440
 I am not familiar with their oeuvre.

485
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,400
 They have a, they have one major album called Volumizer.

486
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,740
 Okay.

487
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,600
 And I put it on and I was like, I thought I was going to basically put it on, like maybe

488
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,680
 be embarrassed or just nostalgic.

489
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,680
 Uh huh.

490
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,240
 It is still a really good album.

491
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,880
 It's a bang, huh?

492
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,560
 Crazy, well-written lyrics.

493
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,560
 Yeah.

494
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,560
 Really good hooks.

495
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,120
 They're very good musicians.

496
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,760
 Um, it's really, it's not, um, you know, constructed hooks.

497
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,840
 It's th they were a live band.

498
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:02,200
 They rushed at, uh, the year and a half in college, somebody saw them twice in concert

499
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,960
 and two different locations based out in the East coast somewhere.

500
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,960
 Yeah.

501
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
 Yeah.

502
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
 That's why Matt didn't finish college.

503
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,960
 He was stupid.

504
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,960
 He followed around the Two Skinny Jays.

505
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,640
 Like, here's another person I saw too much of without being like a huge fan, uh, G love

506
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,640
 and the special sauce.

507
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,360
 Have you, do you have the special sauce?

508
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,360
 Yes.

509
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,360
 I remember.

510
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,360
 Oh, they had a couple of hits.

511
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,360
 Yeah.

512
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,360
 They're more mainstream than Two Skinny Jays.

513
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,360
 Yeah.

514
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,360
 They actually had, they had a couple of legit hits.

515
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,560
 They were out of Philadelphia and lyrically, it's, it's inescapable that they are from

516
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,560
 Philadelphia.

517
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:39,020
 I say that as a Springsteen fan, um, he never sings about Jersey, but, um, what is, what's

518
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:45,160
 one of the jams that Two Skinny Jays does that's, uh, grown up is a good one to, to,

519
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:50,640
 to, I think I may know these, this song that you've rattled something in my head from way

520
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,640
 back.

521
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,640
 Yeah.

522
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,560
 Um, and I was just growing up is grownups is the, uh, the movie that they wrote starring

523
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,560
 Adam Sandler.

524
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,560
 That's right.

525
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,560
 Theme song.

526
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,560
 Yep.

527
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,560
 Um, yeah.

528
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,840
 Uh, the opening song of Horns of Destruction is really great.

529
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,360
 A Horns of Destruction is really, really funny.

530
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,320
 Uh, Lemon Drop is a good one.

531
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,840
 Uh, but yeah, I was just going through it and I was like really like, oh man, I'm usually

532
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,560
 embarrassed about my music taste and, and, uh, there was actually one band I thought

533
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,560
 of it.

534
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,480
 I cannot go back, but I laughed when I thought of their name.

535
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,480
 Okay.

536
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,800
 So I won't even go back and listen to it.

537
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
 It's too embarrassing.

538
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
 Oh no.

539
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:37,680
 I remember cause I remember her at this really, really cringy incident of when I was on this,

540
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,880
 the team bus for the basketball team.

541
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,880
 Okay.

542
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:47,120
 And our team, our team was, uh, basically half white and half black at my, at my JV

543
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,520
 squad, uh, when I was playing basketball and, um, spoiler alert, um, the black guys were

544
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
 better at basketball.

545
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,000
 Uh, and, um, uh, Oh, that's where that rumor started.

546
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,160
 And so they would, the, the, the cooler, honestly, the cooler black kids would go sit in the

547
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,160
 back of the bus.

548
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,160
 Like that's the way it works.

549
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,160
 Right.

550
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,300
 And they would all be, you know, hit, hit, hitting, uh, you know, put their headphones

551
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:17,960
 on listening to different discs and their disc bands and I got turned into like one

552
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,360
 song by a rapper called me fi me.

553
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,720
 Okay.

554
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:30,960
 I can't even, I won't, if I listen to them now, I'll just vomit, uh, uh, out of embarrassment.

555
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,200
 No, I had me fi me on and I was like, Oh, I might know a really awesome rapper that

556
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,700
 maybe they're not familiar with.

557
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:46,040
 And so I remember like bobbing my head and like really showing that you were doing some

558
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,040
 hip hopping.

559
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,040
 Yeah.

560
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,480
 I remember telling that you were, that you were enjoying the hip hop cooler black kids

561
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,520
 to know that I'm listening to hip hop and they're going to ask me who, and I'm going

562
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,440
 to say me fi me and they're going to go, what?

563
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,800
 And that's exactly what happened with the exception of the positive reaction.

564
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,800
 Okay.

565
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,120
 They were like, get that trash out of here.

566
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,120
 They're like, I never heard of it.

567
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,120
 I was like, yeah, I heard one.

568
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,120
 He's got one trick.

569
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,120
 That's okay.

570
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,600
 And then the guy was like, oh, I'm like, well, that's all right.

571
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,200
 That's a start.

572
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,080
 And then they just made fun of me for being into it.

573
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,440
 They're like, but you were really into it.

574
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,760
 Oh man.

575
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,480
 See, it's not least worst nightmare.

576
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,920
 This is, this is our worst nightmare.

577
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,760
 This is our difference in age.

578
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,280
 This is our difference in age showing.

579
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,280
 And I was just lucky.

580
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:41,920
 I was just lucky because I was a few years ahead of you and in the hip hop stuff, which

581
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:47,280
 I'm just going to argue was a golden age of hip hop that came up in.

582
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,480
 And so you would talk about someone who never gets embarrassed.

583
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,480
 I don't get embarrassed.

584
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,480
 I don't give a shit.

585
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,720
 I have, I have always put my freak flag very high and not giving a fuck what people think

586
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,920
 I would be in the back of the bus with my boom box on field trips and my two deck cassette

587
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:11,720
 player and I would vacillate between body count, public enemy fear of a black planet

588
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,280
 and the Disney afternoon soundtrack and they might be giants.

589
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,720
 I mean, what all over the place, crazy shit.

590
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,720
 You know what I mean?

591
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,720
 I, I didn't give a fuck.

592
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,680
 I was playing all the hits, all the hits, all over the place and then I really lucked

593
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,680
 out.

594
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,520
 I really scored some points at governor's college.

595
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,520
 Yes.

596
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,120
 Paul definitely had the over the shoulder boom box program.

597
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,280
 Don't think anything else for a moment.

598
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,680
 No, it was too wide for, I mean, you could, it was, but it had a hand.

599
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,680
 Yeah.

600
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,920
 It was a governor's college program.

601
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:48,100
 We had a field trip out to a mall one day, Paul put that double decker right in his lap,

602
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,760
 like a villain with a cat.

603
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:55,280
 That's exactly how I rocked it.

604
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:04,400
 What I did have was a 60 cassette case that I had over my ammunition belt.

605
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,120
 I was a straight up, no, not an amp, but it was a padded case, a bandolier, a padded case

606
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,840
 that helps 30, 30 cassettes, one was like a movie poster for commando with just cassette

607
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,400
 decks all over them.

608
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,200
 Just Chewbacca with, with tapes on my, on my bandolier.

609
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:25,480
 I was ready at any time, whatever the, whatever the thing I had, I had everything, man.

610
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,480
 I had it all.

611
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,680
 Scoop Jesus says you look like John Popper.

612
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:35,120
 I had, I had Pantera, I had fucking, um, uh, what's his name?

613
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,880
 The Harry Connick dude.

614
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,200
 I had it all.

615
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,920
 I would go between Pantera and Harry Connick in the drop of a hat.

616
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:50,000
 But at governor's scholars, we went to this mall field trip and we bought some stuff and

617
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,400
 I bought, um, tribe called quest low end theory album.

618
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,320
 It had just come out, it came out that week.

619
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:05,600
 And so getting on the bus, uh, some of the other kids and, uh, some of the other hip

620
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,960
 pop heads were like, Oh, let's listen to that.

621
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,920
 And so they played it on the bus speakers.

622
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:16,020
 So the whole bus was listening to low end theory on the ride.

623
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:22,000
 Thanks to my purchasing, uh, finesse of making sure that I got that new tribe album, which

624
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 was just fed.

625
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 That's just a fantastic album.

626
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 That's a masterpiece.

627
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,120
 So you're welcome, everyone that's hero.

628
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:37,200
 And Scoop is showing exactly how Spock would have handled me, uh, but, uh, it was a different

629
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,320
 time before the rise of headphones like that.

630
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,320
 Yep.

631
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,680
 You know who else listened to a whole bunch of Mattingly's cassettes at the back of a

632
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,680
 school bus?

633
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,680
 Mattingly didn't know they were there though.

634
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,680
 That's the following sponsor.

635
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,920
 I would have been bopping my head so hard.

636
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,920
 Yeah.

637
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,920
 I know you were.

638
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:58,000
 Um, uh, today's show is brought to you by women brought to you by Tom Cruise.

639
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,200
 That's from MLK in 2025.

640
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,720
 Today's sponsor is women brought to you by Tom Cruise.

641
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,720
 Hey everybody.

642
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,720
 It's me, Tom Cruise.

643
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,920
 I'd like to present women.

644
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,720
 I'd like to, but I can't.

645
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,720
 Yeah.

646
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,720
 Oh, I gotta run.

647
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,720
 I gotta run to my next next.

648
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,720
 Shoot.

649
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,720
 Oh boy.

650
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:22,320
 I'd also have trouble presenting women because my good friend David Miscavige misplaces his

651
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,640
 and we don't try to find them.

652
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,720
 And that's just how it goes.

653
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,720
 Allegedly.

654
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
 Who knows?

655
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
 I don't know.

656
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,720
 Yeah.

657
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:35,520
 I was thinking about Tom Cruise this morning and then everyone makes fun of him for running

658
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,280
 and he always likes to run in his films and he always runs full speed.

659
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,440
 And then I was like, Oh, I, I couldn't do that.

660
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:48,920
 Like if I booked a part and they're like, this is where you run full speed to the airport

661
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,920
 for like 30 seconds.

662
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,480
 I'd be like, Oh, this is going to look terrible.

663
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,840
 I don't think anybody makes fun of Tom Cruise though.

664
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:01,200
 Like we don't make fun of his running because he's an older gentleman and is bad at running.

665
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,280
 We make fun of it because he does it so often.

666
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:07,600
 Well, he writes, I don't think there's any question that Tom Cruise is in great shape

667
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,800
 for a man of his age.

668
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,800
 Yeah.

669
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,760
 It's not like he's like, Oh, I have to do this.

670
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,640
 He's coming to the producers to be like, can I dangle from a plane?

671
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,240
 This is the part where I run.

672
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,240
 Yeah.

673
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,240
 He's making it happen.

674
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,240
 Matt.

675
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,240
 Don't feel bad that way.

676
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,240
 You're going to be fine.

677
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,400
 In today's modern age, what sense does it make not to be on roller skates or some sort

678
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,280
 of ambulatory device that could make you go even faster than running?

679
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:34,880
 I was thinking there was like, they'd have to write in like an electric scooter for me

680
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,600
 to be like, and I was like, Oh, that'd be really fun just to actually see electric scooter

681
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,600
 chase.

682
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,600
 Yeah.

683
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:48,400
 Like really fucking like born identity level, like, but just pushing that little thumb button.

684
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
 It'd be funny.

685
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,400
 Yeah.

686
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,600
 Man, I am a sucker for those.

687
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,720
 I treated myself in San Antonio.

688
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,200
 I always go try to get my steps in, right?

689
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,920
 So I try to get my 10,000 steps in.

690
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:06,360
 And so I kept telling myself that I'd rather those electric scooters, but every time I

691
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,840
 just had, I'd always, it was hot, so I just had to get my steps in close at night, close

692
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,840
 to midnight or whatever.

693
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,600
 But the last night I go, Oh, I know what I'm going to do.

694
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,600
 I'm going to walk.

695
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,560
 I only had to walk for like 15 minutes.

696
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,560
 I'm going to walk.

697
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,560
 I go, I'm going to walk 15 minutes straight out of town.

698
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,560
 Okay.

699
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,360
 Find one of those scooters and ride it back.

700
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,360
 Yeah.

701
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,720
 And that's what I did my last night.

702
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,440
 And man, I just, I know it's so dumb.

703
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,400
 They go like whatever 15 miles an hour, but bopping and zipping through the streets at

704
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,400
 night.

705
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,880
 And you're just going all over it because it was a Sunday night, right?

706
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,400
 The whole, that whole week, whenever I'm there, it's like a show because the river walks the

707
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:45,640
 center of attention and it builds during the week and then it's crazy in the weekends.

708
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,480
 And then Sunday, it's like, you feel like it's great.

709
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
 Like receding.

710
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,280
 It's probably busier than Vegas right now.

711
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,280
 Probably.

712
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:57,480
 Although I guess the reports coming from people who worked with that company are that tourism

713
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,880
 is down in a lot of places, not just Vegas.

714
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,880
 No.

715
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,880
 Yeah.

716
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,880
 Sure.

717
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,880
 What?

718
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,880
 Yeah.

719
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,880
 Probably unrelated to anything else.

720
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,880
 In the United States of America?

721
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,880
 Yeah.

722
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,880
 Yeah.

723
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,880
 Yeah.

724
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,880
 Yeah.

725
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,880
 The land of dreams.

726
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,880
 Yeah.

727
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,960
 I mean, the rivers flow with milk and honey because if people pick up the news, it's nothing

728
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,440
 but sunshine and rainbows here.

729
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,440
 Right.

730
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,000
 This is just like the Garden of Eden out here.

731
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,840
 On the good ship, lollipop.

732
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,800
 But so no, so Sunday night it was dead.

733
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,760
 And so I basically had the streets of San Antonio to myself.

734
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,760
 That's right.

735
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,480
 I want to say it very romantically like that.

736
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,000
 I just zipped around.

737
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 I was loving it.

738
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,160
 I probably look like a big idiot, but I had loved it.

739
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,080
 I had my Mi Fi Mi on my headphones and.

740
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,080
 Great.

741
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,920
 I was going to say, were you listening to Streets of Philadelphia and replacing it?

742
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,920
 San Antonio.

743
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,920
 San Antonio.

744
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,280
 I was just singing that loudly to myself.

745
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:00,320
 The streets of San Antonio.

746
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,760
 It almost fits the meter.

747
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,660
 It means red stick, I'd yell as I drove down the street.

748
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,660
 That's right.

749
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:10,440
 Did you, have you had a show since, since you've modified your language yet?

750
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,440
 No, not yet.

751
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,520
 Not yet.

752
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,800
 My next magic show will be at Scoop Fest.

753
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,800
 Okay.

754
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,520
 Where I'm only doing things they haven't seen.

755
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,520
 Sweet.

756
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,520
 New, new stuff.

757
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,600
 Bunch of a, bunch of feet stuff.

758
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,600
 Yeah.

759
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,600
 A lot of feet stuff.

760
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
 A lot of feet.

761
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,600
 A lot of bare feet.

762
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
 Magic.

763
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,600
 Yeah.

764
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,800
 Borrowed, borrowed and returned feet.

765
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,800
 Oh my God.

766
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,800
 Foot to impossible location.

767
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,800
 Foot to impossible location.

768
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,800
 Matt.

769
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,800
 Matt.

770
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,800
 You know.

771
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,800
 Foot tip.

772
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,800
 Foot tip in this trick.

773
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:50,720
 You know, we have yet to actually implement with PNT the magic that is magic Wanda.

774
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,040
 That's true.

775
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:59,840
 How about we have magic Wanda and your bare foot with googly eyes on it.

776
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,840
 Yeah.

777
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,840
 And we call him Presto.

778
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,840
 Presto.

779
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,840
 Magic Wanda and Presto.

780
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,840
 Huh, huh?

781
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,840
 Magic Wanda and Presto.

782
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,840
 Magic Wanda and Presto.

783
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:16,880
 Is somebody just laying underneath the curtain with their foot up in the air?

784
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,680
 Dude, that's a YouTube channel if I've ever heard one right there.

785
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,680
 I know.

786
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
 That's gold.

787
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:26,320
 It's also in 12 years the best idea that Paul has come up with and he's like, pitch this

788
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,320
 to Penn, Matt.

789
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,320
 They did sled a foot.

790
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,320
 This is my foot.

791
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,320
 They did sled a foot.

792
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,320
 Did they?

793
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,320
 Three seasons ago.

794
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,320
 Oh, that's right.

795
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,320
 Yeah.

796
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,320
 Yeah.

797
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,320
 Yeah.

798
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,320
 Yeah.

799
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,320
 Yeah.

800
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,320
 Okay.

801
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:47,120
 That was one where I helped work on that trick and I gave Penn a button on it where after

802
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:52,680
 the whole thing was over, he says like, oh, you can put those cards back together or whatever.

803
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:58,520
 And then she, the volunteer goes to do it and I go, no, with your feet.

804
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,520
 And they like that.

805
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,520
 And that was always there.

806
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,520
 They're out.

807
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:06,400
 I was at a record of Penn Sunday School and Penn said, Matt, you are a genius.

808
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,360
 And then Teller wrote me an email saying, you are a genius.

809
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,360
 Wow.

810
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,080
 And I didn't know why.

811
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,160
 And then Penn told me at Penn Sunday School is that basically like this very hammered

812
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:20,040
 girl came up to do a sleight of feet.

813
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:26,920
 And when they yell, no, with your feet, she was like, okay.

814
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,160
 And she just flipped herself upside down and started moving with her feet.

815
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,520
 And she wasn't wearing any underwear.

816
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,080
 So she just was flashing Penn and Teller.

817
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,080
 Yeah.

818
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,080
 Yeah.

819
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:45,560
 And they just sat there with a private show and they were like, what a great profession

820
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,560
 we have.

821
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,800
 What an odd job we have chosen for ourselves.

822
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,800
 Yeah.

823
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:58,560
 So they both wrote me privately to let me know I was a genius.

824
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,080
 Great job, buddy.

825
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,800
 Oh, I got to tell you my music thing.

826
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,760
 I've been on a kick lately, full albums.

827
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:15,020
 So all I do when I run through an album now is I do a Google search or a chat GPT search,

828
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:18,520
 whatever search engine I've got kind of most handy.

829
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:24,640
 And I ask like, what is the best album from and I just pick a random decade or year or

830
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,640
 whatever.

831
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,400
 And then I listen to that full album.

832
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,000
 But it's always an album that was made to be a complete album.

833
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,080
 So like this week I've listened to Elton John, Yellow Brick Road.

834
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,000
 And yesterday I just finished Purple Rain.

835
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,800
 I just finished the Purple Rain album.

836
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,080
 And holy fuck, Prince is really good.

837
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,080
 What?

838
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,080
 Breaking news?

839
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,080
 Yeah.

840
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,080
 Prince is really good at this.

841
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,040
 I knew what he was doing.

842
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:57,940
 Like when doves cry, go listen to when doves cry, do yourself a favor, listen to when doves

843
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:02,200
 cry and it is like it's a perfect song.

844
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,960
 The reason it's so ubiquitous is just fucking perfect.

845
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,960
 Yeah, he's really, really good.

846
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,840
 It is one of those things where it is worth a re-listen for those things.

847
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,840
 And you're right, Jacob.

848
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:20,640
 I will take you up on that because he was so popular that like you understood music

849
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,240
 to be that like, for instance, that my kids started listening to Michael Jackson's music,

850
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:31,000
 which is just a no inner conflict there.

851
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,980
 But the thing is like, you're like, oh, he really just had like, his voice honestly is

852
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,760
 like, it's unique and it's okay.

853
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,320
 It's not amazing, right?

854
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:45,400
 But he had two superpowers that he could dance his face off, really believe in dancing, and

855
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:55,000
 his ear for sounds, like is just the actual composition of sounds and music is that.

856
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,120
 So I think like, I got distracted because someone put my website in the chat.

857
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,120
 I don't know why.

858
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,120
 Oh, that was me.

859
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,120
 Sorry.

860
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,400
 In the chat, somebody was asking where they could find dates for your show, so I put your

861
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,400
 website up.

862
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,400
 Oh yeah.

863
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,400
 I haven't updated it.

864
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,480
 You got to go to my Instagram for the updated dates, but I got to update it.

865
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,240
 My next dates are, and this is really important, Scoopfest, then we're going on a bunch of

866
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,120
 cruise ships, and then I'm going to be in Sparta, New Jersey.

867
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,560
 Sparta.

868
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:34,240
 On October 17th, doing two shows there, and then yeah, and then after that there'll be

869
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,360
 a special show in October that we haven't announced yet, but I'll announce after Scoopfest.

870
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,360
 Yes.

871
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,360
 Because it evolves palmatically.

872
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,480
 And um, what else?

873
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:50,400
 I think, I think, I'm not doing, I'm about to enter cruise ship season, which is why

874
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,520
 I'm being, this is, I'm going to do a bunch of cruise ships through the holidays.

875
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,480
 Cruise ships through the holidays?

876
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:03,480
 I'll be back in San Antonio, November 3rd through the 8th.

877
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:11,760
 But the big thing, I'll be making a big stick, because then come the turn of the year, Jokers

878
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,080
 of Magic is going back on tour, when all those dates are locked in, that's going to be at

879
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,080
 the start of the new year.

880
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,920
 There'll be two different tours, one in January and one in March, and we'll be all over the

881
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,080
 place and I'll be pumping those dates a ton.

882
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,160
 That's good to hear.

883
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,320
 Because that's the show I want to be doing.

884
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,320
 Right.

885
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,320
 Yes.

886
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,320
 That show is awesome.

887
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,680
 If you didn't get to see the first run, it is such a fun show.

888
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:41,680
 Anyhow, I want to go back and listen to those Prince albums because I actually want to understand

889
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,240
 that these sounds didn't really exist.

890
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,240
 Right.

891
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:49,700
 Yeah, because I grew up with those being music and so you're like, "Yeah, it's pretty good."

892
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:57,160
 But I think it's so cool to go back and really hear the sounds and the tones of the instrumentation

893
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,160
 of those songs.

894
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,160
 Yeah.

895
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:04,000
 So I'm listening to the Purple Rain album and Darling Nikki is one of the songs on there

896
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:15,160
 and it's all about just like a woman masturbating in a hotel lobby and then has a woman who

897
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:20,120
 has sex with her and then she invites him to come back and it's all this stuff.

898
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,120
 See Shakespeare, right?

899
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,000
 You find the core stories of the American dream.

900
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,080
 It was revolutionary at the time because it was very female forward, very woman empowered.

901
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,400
 She's taking control of her own sexuality.

902
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,200
 She has him come up for a one night stand.

903
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,200
 Oh yeah.

904
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,200
 No, she's in charge.

905
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,840
 And the song, she is fully in charge.

906
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,480
 She rocks him with everything in the book.

907
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,720
 She's got the whips, the chains, the whole secret room thing.

908
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:49,040
 And then she's out the door before he's even awake and just leaves a note, "Kissy, kissy,

909
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,480
 you want to do it again sometime?

910
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,480
 Let me know."

911
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,080
 "Hit me up next time you want to grind."

912
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,080
 Yeah.

913
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,080
 And she's just like, she's out.

914
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,240
 So it was very female forward and very empowering.

915
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,400
 The end of that song has some of the backwards stuff on there.

916
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,800
 So if you listen to Darling Nikki, at the end of it, it is something being played in reverse

917
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,320
 on the track.

918
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:14,120
 So I was out walking listening to Darling Nikki and I texted a buddy of mine, Andy,

919
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:19,400
 who is previously the president of the official Prince fan club.

920
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:25,560
 He has every piece of music that Prince has ever released and then every piece of music

921
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,360
 that he can get his hands on, bootlegs, all that kind of stuff.

922
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,520
 So I texted him and said, "Hey, I'm listening to Purple Rain, listening to Darling Nikki.

923
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,440
 What is the backwards part at the end of Darling Nikki?"

924
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,720
 Because I knew he would just, I was like, "Andy will just know this.

925
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,520
 He'll know it at the top of his head.

926
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,760
 He won't even have to look it up."

927
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,760
 So he texts me back.

928
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,800
 I have this in my head.

929
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,800
 You know what?

930
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,800
 What is it, Paul?

931
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,800
 Do you know what it is?

932
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,480
 It's something to the effect of, "Thank you friends for listening to this.

933
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,920
 We hope you enjoyed the song," kind of thing.

934
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,120
 It's weirder than that.

935
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,120
 What does it say?

936
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,120
 It is, "Hello.

937
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,120
 How are you?

938
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,480
 I'm fine because I know the Lord is coming soon."

939
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,480
 Oh, Lord.

940
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,480
 "Coming soon."

941
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,480
 Oh, no.

942
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,480
 Well, he was deep into that.

943
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,280
 Because remember, Prince was super religious as well.

944
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,280
 Yeah.

945
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:15,160
 There's a ton of stuff at the end of a bunch of these songs, including Purple Rain, When

946
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,200
 Doves Cry, all this stuff.

947
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:22,540
 There's a lot of really Jesus-y stuff in there too, and it's a little weird, but it's also

948
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:26,960
 kind of like a glimpse into Prince, and I'm kind of enjoying that part as well.

949
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,240
 I wish we could have gotten that Kevin Smith documentary.

950
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,240
 Yeah.

951
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,000
 And then the other one is on the shelf too.

952
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 Yeah.

953
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:44,360
 There's another one that anyone who's seen this is amazing, but it got held up by the

954
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,920
 dumbest legal technicality.

955
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,920
 Right.

956
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,920
 Yeah.

957
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,600
 They said they were going to make a six ... They signed the contracts for a six-episode documentary,

958
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,480
 and the guy who made it said, "No, it needs a seventh episode."

959
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:00,000
 And because I went to a seventh episode, the Prince part of the production team got to

960
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,480
 say, "You broke contract.

961
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,480
 No one gets to see it."

962
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,480
 Awful.

963
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,480
 Yeah.

964
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,480
 That's amazing.

965
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,480
 That's it.

966
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,920
 Well, this would be my recommendation, Matt, for you, MC Chris Friends.

967
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,920
 Okay.

968
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:17,880
 It's an EP, so it's a quick listen, and it's all Batman and Robin.

969
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,000
 Okay.

970
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 So I think you'll like it.

971
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 All right.

972
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:34,720
 I will give it a listen.

973
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,720
 Cool.

974
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,720
 You know who else found out today that Prince was a pretty good musician?

975
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,720
 It's the following sponsor.

976
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,760
 Today's show is brought to you by Pacific Rim 3, The Ultimate Rimming.

977
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,880
 That's from 2025 Nesticle Scoop.

978
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,200
 That's Pacific Rim 3, The Ultimate Rimming.

979
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,880
 Hello there, my friends.

980
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,680
 It is me, Guillermo del Toro.

981
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:55,520
 I have tried my best to make an Evangelion live action film, but of course, many things

982
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:01,000
 got in the way of my production, not the least of which just trying to make giant robots.

983
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 It's tough.

984
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,560
 So what I decided to do, take a much of the pre-production material from that and go ahead

985
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:12,640
 and make my own Kaiju film, and I did, and what I have created is the Pacific Rim.

986
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,800
 But now I have the two of the films under the belt.

987
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:22,520
 I had the guy doing the thing from the Lost in the Gang of Mean People, Dangerous People

988
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,520
 show.

989
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,800
 Lost in the Gang of Mean People, yeah, Dangerous People.

990
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,720
 So I got the Gang of Dangerous People show, man, who do the movie.

991
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,040
 I'm like, "Ah, that's okay."

992
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,840
 But now I realize the money is in the pornography.

993
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,760
 So I say, "Okay, let's go."

994
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,440
 And I want to do this the right way.

995
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:45,040
 So I am bringing Yenna Yemisin out of retirement, yes?

996
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,040
 And Yenna Yemisin.

997
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,040
 Who?

998
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,040
 Yenna Yemisin.

999
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,040
 Who?

1000
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,040
 Yenna Yemisin.

1001
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,040
 Yenna Yemisin.

1002
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,040
 No, it's all right.

1003
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,040
 Who?

1004
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,040
 Her name is Yenna Yemisin.

1005
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,040
 You say Yenna?

1006
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,520
 Yenna Yemisin.

1007
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,520
 I'm sorry.

1008
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,520
 Oh!

1009
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,840
 I hear, "Yes, I am a saint."

1010
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,840
 Is that what you hear?

1011
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,840
 Hold on, hold on.

1012
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,840
 Let me look this up.

1013
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,840
 Oh, no, no.

1014
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,840
 I'm sorry.

1015
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,840
 I have a pronunciation all messed up.

1016
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,120
 I may have to say, "Belladonna."

1017
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:16,360
 So Belladonna is going to do this new movie, and she is going to do what is going to be

1018
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:20,400
 called "Specific Rim."

1019
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:28,560
 It's one specific rim that she wants to get her tongue on.

1020
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,440
 And it's the Charlie Man from the "I Got the Gang of Bean People" movie.

1021
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:40,560
 And so, the whole movie about her in a haunted house trying to find one specific rim.

1022
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:45,000
 And you see, no robots.

1023
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,360
 Oh, there's a robot, double-headed robot.

1024
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,360
 Well, okay.

1025
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,840
 Tell me what I did.

1026
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:57,280
 I guess some of these new dildos do have AI.

1027
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,560
 That has to be true, right?

1028
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,160
 There have to be sex toys with AI by now, right?

1029
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:06,840
 But I guess, technically, you can't call it a dildo if it has technical parts, right?

1030
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,840
 I think so.

1031
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,840
 Yes.

1032
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,840
 Yes, Mr. Del Toro.

1033
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,840
 I believe that is true.

1034
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,840
 Look, I'm no dildo expert.

1035
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,840
 It seems like you are.

1036
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,840
 Wink.

1037
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,840
 Wink.

1038
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,840
 No, no.

1039
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,840
 My name's Jacob.

1040
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,840
 I am, of course, a dildo expert.

1041
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,840
 Benicio Del Toro.

1042
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,840
 I mean, look at that.

1043
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,840
 Benicio Del Toro.

1044
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,840
 Guillermo Del Toro.

1045
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,840
 Look up the definition of Guillermo Del Toro.

1046
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,840
 Oh, excuse me.

1047
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,840
 Sorry.

1048
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,840
 Guillermo.

1049
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,680
 Benicio Del Toro.

1050
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:34,160
 Not that hack.

1051
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,360
 Not that dildo expert.

1052
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,280
 Scoop Jesus's artificial intelligence.

1053
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,280
 Yes.

1054
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,760
 The AI inside.

1055
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:52,080
 Guillermo Del Toro's dead last love.

1056
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,080
 Say it again?

1057
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,160
 He's selling a bunch of his old movie props.

1058
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,160
 Is he really?

1059
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,160
 Yes.

1060
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,640
 I don't know if it's an existential thing or he's just trying to make some room for

1061
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,280
 stuff because he's got a lot of shit.

1062
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,280
 Right.

1063
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,600
 Have you seen anything that you want?

1064
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,600
 Oh, my God.

1065
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:16,040
 I mean, not really because horror collectibles aren't my thing, but one or two pieces would

1066
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,040
 be kind of cool.

1067
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,720
 No, I mean, I'm really happy.

1068
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,640
 I actually already bought something from his.

1069
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,640
 Oh, really?

1070
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,640
 What did you get?

1071
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,640
 Yeah.

1072
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,640
 I got a case of snappy dialogue.

1073
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,640
 Oh.

1074
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,640
 It's so snappy.

1075
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,640
 Yeah.

1076
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,640
 Guillermo Del Toro.

1077
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,160
 I tried to open up the case and it was snap, snap, snap.

1078
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,160
 Too snappy.

1079
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,160
 Too snappy.

1080
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,160
 Too snappy.

1081
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,400
 You know, is there a horror memorabilia thing that either of you would really want from

1082
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,280
 old horror films or either of you old horror hits?

1083
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,880
 I'd want the giant pot of boiling water from sleepaway camp.

1084
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,880
 That's what I would guess.

1085
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,880
 Oh, really?

1086
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:50,880
 Oh.

1087
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,880
 They got the big fat guy?

1088
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,640
 They got the big fat guy and he holds up his burning arms.

1089
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,640
 Yeah.

1090
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,640
 The camera, the whole shot.

1091
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,640
 It's all jellied out?

1092
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:58,640
 Yeah.

1093
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,640
 Oh.

1094
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,320
 That movie's something else.

1095
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:08,280
 There was a time when I was a teenager, I was probably like 15, 16 years old, where I

1096
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,120
 was so over horror movies.

1097
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,120
 I was just a kid.

1098
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,020
 I was like, "Fucking horror movies.

1099
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:17,520
 They're not scary at all," but I would go see them because they would have naked teenagers

1100
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,520
 in them.

1101
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,520
 Oh, yeah.

1102
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,520
 And like after the first, what, half hour of the movie, I'd be like, "Well, there probably

1103
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,000
 aren't going to be any more naked teenagers.

1104
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,840
 I'm kind of done with this movie."

1105
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,840
 But yes.

1106
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,880
 I mean, that's sort of the formula, right?

1107
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,880
 Yeah.

1108
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,880
 Yeah.

1109
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,400
 But I was not interested in watching the horror movie part at all.

1110
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,120
 It was just, like the horror movie part, which to me, was just boring and stupid.

1111
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:41,640
 Jacob, have you seen any of the "Terrifier" films?

1112
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,040
 I saw the first one.

1113
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,040
 Okay.

1114
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,040
 Yeah.

1115
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,040
 I watched it with Matt's kids.

1116
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:49,960
 I was going to say, I still want to do a "Terrifier 3" with Matt's kids.

1117
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,960
 They loved it.

1118
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,880
 "Terrifier 3" with Matt's kids would be like a big Patreon level.

1119
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:02,160
 I just bid on eBay for a cracked sidewalk that was the path of death's design.

1120
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:07,160
 So when it was cracking through the streets, I got that crack there.

1121
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:11,120
 Someone has to have Freddy Krueger's glove, right?

1122
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,400
 Oh, that has to be.

1123
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,400
 Yeah.

1124
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,080
 There's a couple of those because they did it different for a couple of the movies, right?

1125
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,080
 Yeah.

1126
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:21,600
 That series went on long enough that there's a Freddy Krueger, and I bet Robert Englund

1127
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,300
 has one in his personal collection.

1128
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,300
 Probably a few.

1129
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,720
 But the classic stuff, like Freddy Krueger's stuff-

1130
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:32,600
 I'm talking like he's collecting all the "Hammer Horror" stuff.

1131
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:36,920
 He's got like old "Wolf Man" and "Bella Lugosi" shit.

1132
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,720
 I would love any of that stuff.

1133
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:43,860
 Like the classic horror stuff, any of that stuff would ... I'd display that very happily

1134
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,880
 in my house.

1135
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:50,240
 Like the pinhead stuff, "Hellraiser," I was a big "Hellraiser" fan of those early movies

1136
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,240
 and everything.

1137
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,240
 Yeah.

1138
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,520
 There's probably some stuff that I'd like.

1139
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,520
 Yeah.

1140
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,520
 They had a replica-

1141
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:01,080
 That's actually when you watch Penn and Teller do needles, it's actually pulling the pins

1142
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,760
 from Pinhead out of Teller's mouth.

1143
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:03,760
 Oh, God.

1144
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,760
 Oh, it is though.

1145
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,760
 I've always wondered.

1146
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,760
 Those are Pinhead's own pins?

1147
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,760
 Yeah.

1148
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,760
 Oh, good old Pinhead.

1149
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,760
 Yeah.

1150
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,760
 That's right.

1151
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:19,680
 Teller didn't ... because he takes the needles out and puts them in like a ... I think I

1152
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:23,520
 might be conflating Teller's version of this with a bunch of other people's versions of

1153
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,520
 this.

1154
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,600
 But does he take the needles out and put them in like a lemon or something, or-

1155
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,600
 He takes them out of an apple to start.

1156
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,600
 Like a pincushion?

1157
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,600
 That's what it is.

1158
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,600
 It's an apple.

1159
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,600
 Yeah.

1160
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,680
 He eats them from the apple and then he pulls them out on his mouth.

1161
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:40,240
 So he could have like a little ... instead of an apple, he could just have a little Pinhead

1162
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,720
 prop and he could just be taking the needles out of Pinhead's head, I guess.

1163
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,720
 That'd be pretty funny.

1164
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,720
 That would be, yeah.

1165
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,720
 That's nice.

1166
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,920
 I'm going to send him a DM right now.

1167
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:52,480
 Teller, I have a note on needles for you.

1168
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,480
 What's that thing called?

1169
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:57,920
 I have a note on your oldest, best, whatever.

1170
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,960
 What's the name of the puzzle box for the Hellraiser?

1171
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,960
 It's got a name.

1172
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,960
 Oh, it does.

1173
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,960
 The Nepronomicon?

1174
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:08,720
 It's something like the Painacron or something like that.

1175
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,240
 The Lament Configuration.

1176
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,600
 Thank you, Steve Jasper.

1177
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:20,680
 Teller's street show, by the way, I don't think he's performed a trick more than needles.

1178
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,680
 Has to be.

1179
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,680
 His most performed trick.

1180
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:27,240
 He had a little mat and he says, "The show will begin when all the needles are in the

1181
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,240
 apple."

1182
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,720
 And he put out his mat and his little table and he just started sticking needles into

1183
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:36,480
 an apple and that's how people would gather around him when he's a street performer.

1184
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,840
 That was his crowd gathering?

1185
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,840
 Yeah.

1186
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,560
 Just who's this guy putting needles into an apple and what's about to happen here?

1187
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,560
 Yes.

1188
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,920
 Andy Cheek asking if I have any movie props.

1189
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,560
 I don't have any official movie props.

1190
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:54,440
 I've got a lightsaber, but it's not a real lightsaber exactly.

1191
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,920
 I would like to have a real lightsaber.

1192
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,200
 Do you have any?

1193
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,200
 Director's cut.

1194
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:02,200
 So you do have some actual screen used movie props?

1195
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,200
 Yeah.

1196
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,200
 That's cool.

1197
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,200
 Somewhere.

1198
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,200
 Yeah.

1199
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,200
 Stuff from commercials I've been in.

1200
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,200
 That's cool.

1201
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,200
 Shoes.

1202
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,200
 It counts.

1203
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,200
 It counts.

1204
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,200
 Oh, some big stuff.

1205
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,660
 I know I've got some stuff around here somewhere.

1206
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,360
 I just don't know what I have.

1207
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,360
 I don't know.

1208
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:20,080
 I have Judy Gau's ruby slippers.

1209
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,400
 Oh, that's nice.

1210
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,200
 I think I have in my house somewhere, I think I have a cane that FDR used.

1211
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,320
 That's probably my best prop is that.

1212
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,600
 That's definitely your best one.

1213
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,600
 It's right where it is.

1214
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,600
 FDR's cane.

1215
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,680
 I can even show it to people on the Twitch.

1216
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:39,680
 Yeah.

1217
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:44,640
 And for people who don't know, Matt does actually have a cane that FDR used.

1218
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,920
 After it was in a show in the episodes where we joked that it was FDR's cane, we found

1219
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:53,400
 out after the fact that it was FDR's cane, but that's a really weird series of events.

1220
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,400
 And it was used in the show as FDR's cane.

1221
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,400
 Yes.

1222
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,400
 Yeah.

1223
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,720
 That's some weird shit.

1224
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:04,820
 It was an old cane from "Grandma Ruby's House."

1225
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:05,820
 That's the funniest thing.

1226
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:06,820
 We just talked about this for what?

1227
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:07,820
 Five minutes?

1228
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:08,820
 Yeah.

1229
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:10,480
 I'm grounded by Ruby Keeler stuff.

1230
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,480
 Of course.

1231
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,480
 Yeah.

1232
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,120
 You've got tons of film use props.

1233
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,120
 Yeah.

1234
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:22,000
 I'm lousy with Ruby Keeler stuff, so yeah.

1235
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,840
 Hollywood Walk of Fame on your wife's family tree.

1236
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,840
 Yeah.

1237
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,480
 Do you guys know what happened to that giant typewriter she danced on?

1238
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,480
 No.

1239
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,480
 Oh, I've got that.

1240
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,480
 I'm using it right now.

1241
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:38,800
 That is something I ... I should have pitched this to the people who work behind the scenes

1242
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:47,200
 at Spiegel World, because they put these different events and shows together, but I thought that

1243
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:52,400
 Spiegel World should get Sean and John together with my wife and reenact the tap dancing on

1244
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,760
 the typewriter bit.

1245
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,720
 Oh, wow.

1246
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:56,720
 Yeah.

1247
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,720
 Yeah.

1248
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:02,640
 That typewriter prop was ... If you don't know what we're talking about, you can YouTube

1249
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:08,400
 Ruby Keeler dancing on a typewriter, and it's a famous movie musical bit.

1250
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,560
 It's from the movie, the 1937 film Ready, Willing, and Able.

1251
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:18,720
 After its use in the film, the typewriter became part of the film's production design

1252
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:24,240
 and is now considered a piece of movie memorabilia, even though its current location is not known.

1253
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,240
 Yeah.

1254
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,240
 I bet that just got-

1255
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,240
 I mean, back in those days, it was-

1256
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,680
 I'm assuming it got taken apart in these programs.

1257
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1258
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:34,720
 Even just recently, even through the '90s, stuff just got trashed, man.

1259
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,720
 Oh, yeah.

1260
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,800
 A lot of stuff gets reused, broken down and reused for different things.

1261
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,800
 Right.

1262
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,800
 Sometimes, yeah, but-

1263
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,360
 Yeah, if you can reuse it, they're breaking it down and reusing it for the next thing.

1264
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,040
 A lot of times, people just throw shit away, man.

1265
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:50,960
 Especially in the movie, the studio era.

1266
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,160
 Yes.

1267
00:53:53,160 --> 00:54:00,920
 Is it true, or is it false that the Falkor is the animal skin from Dumb and Dumber?

1268
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:01,920
 That was a rumor.

1269
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,920
 That was a rumor.

1270
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,160
 I don't know if that was actually true.

1271
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:09,600
 I don't think that was actually the- but they might have repurposed part of him for the

1272
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,600
 mutthut truck.

1273
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,600
 Yeah.

1274
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:15,080
 That's what I kept hearing as a rumor.

1275
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,080
 It might have been.

1276
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,080
 It might have been repurposed and-

1277
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,080
 I don't think it was.

1278
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,080
 I don't think it was.

1279
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,080
 It feels too good to be true.

1280
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,080
 Yeah.

1281
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,720
 It's not quite the same fur either.

1282
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,720
 Right.

1283
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,720
 Yeah.

1284
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,720
 Yeah.

1285
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,600
 Google says no, not used there.

1286
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,600
 Yeah.

1287
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,600
 Okay.

1288
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,600
 Yeah.

1289
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,600
 But yeah, it was a good thing.

1290
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:38,840
 When it was- because it wasn't close in time, was it?

1291
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,840
 The never ending story-

1292
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:40,840
 No, it was a long way off.

1293
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:41,840
 The first movie was much earlier, right?

1294
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:48,160
 And in fact, I do believe, I remember just a couple years ago, someone actually still

1295
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:56,160
 has Falkor in their barn somewhere, kind of rotting away, half rotting.

1296
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,160
 Oh.

1297
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,160
 Yeah.

1298
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,160
 Slower ball.

1299
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,160
 Yeah.

1300
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,160
 That's too sexy.

1301
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,160
 Yeah.

1302
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:08,160
 Falkor, have you seen those fucking Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle heads from the Henson

1303
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,160
 designs?

1304
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,160
 Oh, yeah.

1305
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,160
 Nowadays?

1306
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,160
 Yes.

1307
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,160
 They look-

1308
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,200
 I have a friend who worked on the construction of those.

1309
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,200
 Oh, wow.

1310
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,800
 They look crazy now because they're rotting away.

1311
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,800
 Oh, yeah.

1312
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,800
 They're insane.

1313
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:28,160
 NECA made a line of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cross universal monsters because they had both

1314
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,160
 those licenses.

1315
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,760
 This was like two years ago.

1316
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,040
 They made figures of the turtles as monsters.

1317
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:40,960
 They had like Leo as Frankenstein and I think Raphael was a vampire.

1318
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,760
 They made Michelangelo a mummy, right?

1319
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,760
 Okay.

1320
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:54,040
 And they based his head sculpt design off of the rotting mask of the one that was used

1321
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,040
 in the movies.

1322
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,040
 Oh, jeez.

1323
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,720
 It looks very much like, it's really cool.

1324
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,760
 It's really cool.

1325
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,920
 It looks kind of skeletal.

1326
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:01,920
 It's wild.

1327
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,680
 If you look up rotten Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle head-

1328
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,960
 The people on the Zoom, we're about to see it right now.

1329
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:08,960
 Yeah.

1330
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:09,960
 No, I know.

1331
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:15,680
 I remember talking with a puppeteer, Tim Lagasse, who is big in the puppet world.

1332
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:20,480
 He's the one who taught that puppet workshop to my kids and he basically says that all

1333
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,960
 the material that goes into puppets eventually rots.

1334
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:24,960
 Yes.

1335
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:25,960
 Right.

1336
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:26,960
 Even like sponge and stuff like that.

1337
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,560
 Like sponge will just dry out and become dust.

1338
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,560
 Exactly.

1339
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,560
 Yep.

1340
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,280
 And then you have to update stuff.

1341
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,660
 And Jacob just showed me some pictures that looked horrible.

1342
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:36,660
 That looks really scary.

1343
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:37,660
 Yeah.

1344
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:38,660
 Yeah, yeah.

1345
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:40,800
 Oh no, the heads are just rotting away and then you have the teeth in there and they

1346
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:41,800
 don't rot away.

1347
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:45,920
 And if you look up Neckah Michelangelo mummy figure-

1348
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:51,660
 My search history is already weird enough, I'm fine.

1349
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,520
 It's basically that same head.

1350
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:58,480
 Also, leading up to Scoop Fest, boy do my Amazon recommendations get weird fast.

1351
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,480
 Yes.

1352
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,480
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1353
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,640
 If you're on Amazon for Scoop Fest, my recommendations get real weird real quick.

1354
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:07,600
 But most of the time you're just searching on the site Jackable.com, right?

1355
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,600
 That's right.

1356
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,240
 That's right.

1357
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,240
 Cookies engaged.

1358
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,240
 Turn them cookies on.

1359
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,240
 Time to jack it.

1360
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:20,240
 Speaking of jacking it, it's time for Jock vs. Nerd, winner gets the jacket.

1361
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,240
 Right here on Twitch.

1362
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,240
 Jock vs. Nerd action.

1363
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,240
 Who am I?

1364
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,240
 Oh boy.

1365
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:38,360
 It's exactly, it's exactly the same.

1366
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,360
 On the hunt for balls.

1367
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:40,360
 No, we're rotting Michelangelo.

1368
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:45,720
 We've got a scooper today from Scoopy Logic.

1369
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,800
 Scoopy Logic sent this one in a couple of years ago.

1370
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:52,800
 I've gone back into the old Wayback machine here and found this scooper, a scooper that

1371
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,760
 Scoopy Logic sent in I think in 2023.

1372
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:03,440
 Anyway, the categories are not only a fruit, deals of a lifetime, TMNT, very coincidental

1373
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,440
 there, and hodgepodge.

1374
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,440
 Oh neat.

1375
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,440
 I love it.

1376
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,440
 I'm up first.

1377
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,440
 We've got some TMNT.

1378
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,440
 I'll try TMNT for 200.

1379
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,440
 Let's see.

1380
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:15,720
 This actor voiced Shredder in the original cartoon series will accept his best known

1381
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:16,720
 role.

1382
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,720
 Oh cool.

1383
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:21,200
 Oh, I have zero idea.

1384
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,040
 I have to pass, Matt.

1385
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,600
 This is Philip Seymour Hoffman.

1386
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,600
 No.

1387
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,600
 Famously, Philip Seymour Hoffman.

1388
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,880
 Paul, who is it?

1389
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:35,920
 It's the guy who played Uncle Phil on The Fresh Prince.

1390
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,920
 Oh, interesting.

1391
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,920
 That's right.

1392
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:38,920
 I did know that.

1393
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:39,920
 James Avery.

1394
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,920
 Yes.

1395
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:41,920
 Matt.

1396
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,080
 If that's the $200 question, forget about it.

1397
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,200
 I know, right?

1398
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:51,760
 I'll do not only a fruit for 200.

1399
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,760
 A berry.

1400
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,080
 This tropical fruit naturally grows in bundles.

1401
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:59,600
 It's better than naturally growing in bindles.

1402
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,080
 Right, right, right.

1403
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,720
 Only hobos eat this berry.

1404
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,120
 I don't know.

1405
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,120
 Pass.

1406
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,120
 Paul.

1407
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,120
 Bananas.

1408
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,120
 Bananas.

1409
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,400
 It's a banana.

1410
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,400
 Technically a berry.

1411
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,400
 That's right.

1412
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,120
 Technically a berry.

1413
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,800
 Paul is technically in the lead.

1414
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,800
 Paul, you're up.

1415
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,840
 TMNT, please.

1416
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,400
 For 400.

1417
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,240
 The multicolored masks were established in the original cartoon.

1418
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,680
 What color did they all wear previously in the comics?

1419
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:28,680
 Red.

1420
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:29,680
 Damn it.

1421
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,680
 I knew that one.

1422
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:31,680
 Red.

1423
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,680
 I should have done.

1424
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:33,680
 I should have gone there.

1425
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,880
 Paul out with a commanding lead right now.

1426
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,200
 800 to 0 to 0.

1427
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,200
 Baton Rouge.

1428
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,960
 Baton Red.

1429
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,480
 I'm just getting the basics, though.

1430
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,720
 We got, you know, just getting the simple questions.

1431
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,720
 All right.

1432
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:50,720
 All right.

1433
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,760
 You have to smack talk with your lead, buddy.

1434
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:53,760
 Yeah.

1435
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,760
 We'll see.

1436
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:55,760
 We'll see.

1437
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,760
 I'll try TMNT.

1438
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:57,760
 Try to steal one for Paul for 600.

1439
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,760
 Here we go.

1440
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,400
 This TV producer is credited with writing the classic theme song.

1441
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,400
 I don't fucking know.

1442
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,400
 Matt.

1443
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,400
 God damn it.

1444
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,400
 Stevie Wonder.

1445
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,400
 No.

1446
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,400
 I don't know.

1447
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,400
 Stevie Wonder.

1448
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,400
 Paul.

1449
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,400
 Fred Wolfe.

1450
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,400
 Chuck Lorre.

1451
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,400
 Oh, Chuck Lorre.

1452
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,400
 OK.

1453
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,400
 Chuck Lorre.

1454
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,760
 That's anyone's game.

1455
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:18,360
 And Paul's points are gone.

1456
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,360
 Matt.

1457
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,720
 I've got 200.

1458
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,720
 Hodgepodge.

1459
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:29,680
 James Bond creator Ian Fleming wrote this book that in 1968 was turned into a children's

1460
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,400
 movie starring Dick Van Dyke.

1461
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,400
 Hmm.

1462
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,400
 Deep Throat.

1463
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,400
 Go--

1464
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,000
 Would you say Mary Poppins was starring Dick Van Dyke?

1465
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
 Probably not.

1466
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
 It was.

1467
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
 I mean, he was the--

1468
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
 Yeah.

1469
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
 He was one of the leads in that.

1470
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
 Yeah.

1471
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
 It feels like the actual time frame.

1472
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
 Yeah.

1473
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
 That's not it, though.

1474
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
 I don't think.

1475
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
 I'll pass.

1476
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
 I think I know.

1477
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
 I'll pass.

1478
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
 I think I know.

1479
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
 All right.

1480
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
 Passes to Paul.

1481
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
 Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

1482
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
 Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is correct.

1483
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
 Cool.

1484
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
 Chitty Chitty Bad Bad.

1485
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
 Chitty Chitty Bad Bad.

1486
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
 Paul.

1487
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
 Chitty Chitty Bad Bad.

1488
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
 TMNT, please.

1489
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
 For 800.

1490
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,960
 According to Internet Conspiracy, what band was created after touring in a live action

1491
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,040
 TMNT concert series?

1492
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:21,160
 Oh, man.

1493
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:22,600
 I don't know.

1494
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:23,600
 But I do know--

1495
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,020
 Come on, Paul.

1496
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:26,400
 You know this one.

1497
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:31,560
 Michael Ian Black was part of the promo team for the Turtles way back in the day.

1498
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:34,560
 I feel of great kinship with him doing costume work.

1499
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:35,560
 I'll pass.

1500
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,560
 I don't know.

1501
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,840
 You don't know about the Turtles?

1502
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:39,960
 What band would you guess?

1503
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:40,960
 It's probably a boy band.

1504
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:41,960
 Probably--

1505
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:42,960
 No, it's the Turtles.

1506
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:43,960
 No.

1507
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:44,960
 It's me, I bet.

1508
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:45,960
 I have no idea.

1509
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:46,960
 I'm passing.

1510
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:47,960
 Matt.

1511
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:50,420
 I bet the guess is New Kids.

1512
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:51,420
 Black Eyed Peas.

1513
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:52,420
 Oh, wow.

1514
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:53,420
 The Black Eyed Peas.

1515
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:56,120
 Tonight's going to be a good fight, was the original lyric.

1516
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,120
 Oh, yeah.

1517
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,120
 Mm.

1518
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:02,480
 Let's get some pizza in here.

1519
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,600
 Let's get some pizza.

1520
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:10,920
 Let's get some pizza in here.

1521
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,800
 I'll try not only a fruit, a gourd.

1522
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,840
 The season is almost upon us.

1523
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,880
 Prepare for the all-factory overload.

1524
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,920
 Ah, yes.

1525
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:25,000
 Wait, what-- oh, is it pumpkin or pumpkin spice or, yeah, all those things.

1526
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
 Yeah, pumpkin.

1527
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
 Yeah, pumpkin.

1528
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
 It's pumpkin, pumpkin.

1529
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,760
 I don't know anything, huh?

1530
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,760
 Let's go--

1531
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,360
 Oh, don't be so hard on yourself.

1532
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,360
 You know some things.

1533
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:40,240
 Let's go with Hodgepodge for $400.

1534
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:47,640
 This American actor accidentally killed two people while driving in Ireland in 1987.

1535
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:51,000
 Huh.

1536
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,680
 This definitely tickles something in my brain.

1537
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,680
 I think it's in there somewhere.

1538
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:55,680
 I know.

1539
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,680
 I'm trying to think.

1540
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:57,680
 Is it Robert Downey Jr.?

1541
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:04,040
 He got in a lot of trouble.

1542
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,040
 I don't know.

1543
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:06,040
 Pass.

1544
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:12,440
 Paul. his name is flying out of my head right now.

1545
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:13,760
 And into two people walking.

1546
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,680
 No, it's fucking Ferris Bueller.

1547
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,520
 Matthew-- Matthew--

1548
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:20,520
 Damon.

1549
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:21,520
 Fuck.

1550
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,520
 What is his name?

1551
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:23,520
 Matthew--

1552
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,520
 Sully.

1553
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:25,520
 No.

1554
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:28,400
 Matthew-- oh, Sullivan's Crossing.

1555
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:33,640
 Matthew-- fuck, why can't I get his name?

1556
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:37,800
 It's going to be really funny if Paul's just doing a gamesmanship here and trying to get

1557
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:38,800
 me to say his name.

1558
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:39,800
 No.

1559
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,800
 I can't get his name.

1560
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,800
 I can't get his name.

1561
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,160
 I can't-- it won't come to me.

1562
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,160
 Matthew-- shit.

1563
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,160
 Harry.

1564
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,160
 No, pass.

1565
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,160
 I can't get his name.

1566
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,160
 Matthew Broderick, Paul?

1567
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,160
 There you go.

1568
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,160
 That's it.

1569
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,160
 Yeah.

1570
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,160
 I'll try Matthew Broderick.

1571
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,160
 I could not get it.

1572
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:56,160
 It is Matthew Broderick.

1573
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,160
 No.

1574
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,160
 You could not get his name.

1575
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,160
 Paul.

1576
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,960
 Hodgepodge for $600, please.

1577
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:08,640
 Children's book author Roald Dahl wrote the screenplay for which James Bond movie?

1578
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,760
 Oh, boy.

1579
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,760
 James and the Giant Spy.

1580
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,160
 That's it.

1581
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:16,160
 I'll pass.

1582
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,160
 I don't know.

1583
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,160
 Passes to me.

1584
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:25,040
 I'm trying to think of like, what are the weirder James Bond movies?

1585
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,960
 Like Octopussy is a weird one.

1586
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:30,240
 That one's all set with like a circus troupe and stuff.

1587
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,240
 Yeah.

1588
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:38,200
 Uh, there are some weird ones out there.

1589
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,240
 I guess I'll pass.

1590
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,240
 Matt.

1591
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:46,240
 That is James Bond, of course, Sleeping Foot to Face.

1592
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:49,040
 I bet it was Dr. No.

1593
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,040
 Four people to a bed.

1594
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:51,040
 I don't know.

1595
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,000
 I don't know at all.

1596
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,680
 Dr. No was the first Bond movie.

1597
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,680
 You only live twice.

1598
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:01,560
 You only live twice.

1599
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:06,680
 I think that's the one where I think you only live twice is the Sean Connery one where he

1600
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:09,440
 does it in, where he does Yellow Face.

1601
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,440
 Yes.

1602
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:15,200
 I think he dresses up as a Japanese man in that movie.

1603
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,200
 It's me.

1604
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,200
 I'll try Deals of a Lifetime.

1605
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,200
 200.

1606
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,200
 It's a B.

1607
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:25,760
 In 2007, this creative team negotiated for 50% of all digital rights for their show and

1608
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:29,440
 have made almost $1 billion since.

1609
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,440
 Wow.

1610
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:37,200
 This creative team negotiated for 50% of all digital rights of their show.

1611
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,200
 What was this category?

1612
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,200
 Deal of a Lifetime.

1613
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,200
 Oh.

1614
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,200
 So these are smart people who made a really smart deal.

1615
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,200
 Yeah.

1616
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,680
 Uh, I, I have no idea.

1617
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,000
 I guess I'll pass.

1618
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,680
 Uh, Matt.

1619
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,680
 I think this is, uh, Trey Parker and Matt Stone.

1620
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:54,760
 Oh, that would make sense.

1621
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,700
 Good call.

1622
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:58,360
 It is Trey Parker and Matt Stone.

1623
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,360
 Well done.

1624
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:00,360
 Matt.

1625
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,360
 I knew a thing.

1626
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,360
 Um.

1627
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,360
 Where did you go?

1628
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:04,360
 Boy, they must be.

1629
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,360
 They are cleaning up, clearly.

1630
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,360
 Yeah.

1631
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:07,360
 Yeah.

1632
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:08,480
 You heard it here first, folks.

1633
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,400
 Trey Parker and Matt Stone doing fine.

1634
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,360
 Uh, the references, I don't know if you've watched them.

1635
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,360
 They're funny.

1636
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:15,360
 They are.

1637
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,360
 They are.

1638
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,240
 Uh, Deals of a Lifetime.

1639
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,240
 400, please.

1640
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:25,360
 Outside of the small pittance of merchandising and sequel rights, how much was George Lucas

1641
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:30,920
 paid to direct the Star Wars, uh, the original Star Wars film within $50,000?

1642
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,440
 Everyone knows he was paid with candy.

1643
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,440
 That's right.

1644
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:35,440
 Um.

1645
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,440
 I don't know.

1646
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:37,440
 Pass.

1647
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:41,240
 Paul.

1648
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,240
 I think.

1649
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,960
 How much was George Lucas paid?

1650
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,520
 I don't.

1651
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:46,520
 It wasn't.

1652
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:49,240
 I don't even know if it was $100,000.

1653
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:50,240
 I'll pass.

1654
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,240
 I don't remember.

1655
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,240
 Yeah.

1656
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,240
 I mean, he can't have been paid much.

1657
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,240
 Uh.

1658
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,240
 Do I need to guess?

1659
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,240
 Oh, no.

1660
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,240
 I'm in the lead.

1661
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:58,240
 I don't want to guess.

1662
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,240
 Pass.

1663
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,240
 $150,000.

1664
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,240
 Whoa.

1665
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,720
 Paul would have gotten points if he had said $100,000.

1666
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:06,240
 I would direct Star Wars now for that money, just so you know.

1667
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,240
 Oh, okay.

1668
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:08,240
 Mm.

1669
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,240
 Nah.

1670
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:10,240
 I need $160,000 minimum.

1671
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:11,240
 I'm going to stand fast on that.

1672
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,240
 All right.

1673
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,240
 Paul.

1674
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:14,240
 Uh.

1675
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,240
 I'll close out Hodgepodge.

1676
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,720
 Freight Hundo.

1677
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,320
 Daily Double.

1678
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:19,320
 Here we go.

1679
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:20,320
 We finally found one.

1680
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,320
 Turn it around.

1681
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:22,320
 Turn it around.

1682
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:23,320
 Real deal.

1683
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:30,680
 Volkswagen's top selling product is not a vehicle, but iconically German food.

1684
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:34,200
 Wolf, wolf brand chili.

1685
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,200
 Ooh.

1686
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:39,080
 Well, it's either a pretzel or a bratwurst.

1687
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,000
 Two bits.

1688
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,280
 Okay.

1689
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:43,280
 I'll go pretzel.

1690
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,280
 A pretzel?

1691
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:47,000
 I'll go pretzel.

1692
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,760
 A currywurst sausage.

1693
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:49,760
 Oh.

1694
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,760
 A currywurst sausage.

1695
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:56,360
 Who would have accepted bratwurst?

1696
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:57,360
 Would we have?

1697
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:59,440
 If you had said currywurst, I would have accepted currywurst.

1698
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,440
 Yeah.

1699
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:01,440
 Currywurst.

1700
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,000
 I might have even accepted sausage.

1701
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
 All right.

1702
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
 It's me.

1703
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,480
 I'll try Deals of a Lifetime 600.

1704
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,680
 We've got four questions left.

1705
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,160
 One Daily Double left.

1706
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:19,800
 In 1986 anti-trust lawsuit, in a 1986 anti-trust lawsuit, the USFL Donald Trump successfully

1707
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,720
 sued the NFL winning how much money?

1708
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:32,840
 Hint, pick a number, one through 10.

1709
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:33,840
 I don't remember.

1710
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:34,840
 Pass.

1711
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:35,840
 Matt.

1712
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:36,840
 A dollar.

1713
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:37,840
 $1.

1714
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:38,840
 $1.

1715
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:39,840
 Yeah.

1716
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:40,840
 $1.

1717
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:41,840
 Shoot.

1718
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:42,840
 $3.

1719
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:43,920
 I was ready to guess a dollar too.

1720
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,640
 I watched the documentary.

1721
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:48,440
 They presented him with the check.

1722
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:56,520
 This is back when he wasn't who he is now, and so it was a very embarrassing moment.

1723
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:59,640
 Later on, he would go on to prove that he wasn't capable of embarrassment.

1724
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:00,640
 Yes.

1725
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:01,640
 So there you go.

1726
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:02,640
 Yes.

1727
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:05,720
 But very capable of vengeance, it turns out.

1728
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:06,720
 Yes.

1729
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,360
 Holds a grudge for a while.

1730
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:10,720
 I'll go with deals of a lifetime to close it out.

1731
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:11,720
 Oh no, it's Matt's turn.

1732
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:12,720
 Great.

1733
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:13,720
 It's Matt's turn.

1734
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:18,280
 I need to make up some ground here, so I will steal Paul's question and do deals of a lifetime

1735
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,280
 for $800.

1736
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:20,280
 Daily Double.

1737
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:21,280
 There you go.

1738
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,720
 Now you got it, Matt.

1739
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:28,480
 Paul with the gamesmanship, retired in 2001, this former NY Met receives a little over

1740
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:34,280
 $1 million annually for every July 1st until 2035.

1741
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:37,280
 Bobby Bonilla, baby.

1742
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:39,720
 Is that true?

1743
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:40,720
 Yeah.

1744
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:41,720
 Holy shit.

1745
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:42,720
 How did he do this?

1746
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:43,720
 Bobby Bonilla.

1747
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:49,360
 I have friends, my Mets friends, the day that it pays, they go, "It's happy Bobby Bonilla

1748
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:53,720
 Day," and it's the day that Bobby Bonilla is still being paid by the Mets.

1749
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:54,720
 What happened?

1750
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:59,040
 So basically, they gave him a crazy contract to play baseball, which happens at baseball

1751
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:03,040
 more than any other sport, and then he ended up being so terrible, they wanted him to stop

1752
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:09,920
 playing, and there was no rules yet on stretch provisions, and so they basically, to not

1753
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:14,040
 hurt their salary cap or not hurt their bottom line or whatever, they asked if they could

1754
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:18,080
 stretch his contract out for whatever it was, like 27 years or something like that.

1755
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,920
 And even when he got paid now, it's not even considered ridiculous, but back then it was

1756
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:25,640
 a ridiculous amount of money to play horribly for the Mets.

1757
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:29,040
 It's a ridiculous amount of money to not do anything.

1758
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,320
 Well, ask Kawhi Leonard.

1759
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,120
 Who's that?

1760
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:37,880
 He's a man who's getting paid a ridiculous amount of money right now for not doing anything.

1761
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:42,280
 Made a really, really good ... If we did old school Jock vs. Nerd, this would have been

1762
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:52,280
 the question of the week for sure, but Kawhi Leonard was paid $28 million to not show up

1763
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:58,200
 or do anything for this company that was a sponsor of the LA Clippers.

1764
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:02,760
 Oh, this was the way they got his ... It was like phantom salary.

1765
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:03,760
 Yes.

1766
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:07,400
 It was to get around the salary cap, to give him an extra bonus money inside the salary

1767
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,400
 cap.

1768
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,300
 At least that's being investigated right now.

1769
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,120
 It's just blowing up now, right?

1770
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:16,800
 But it was supposed to be an environmental company, worried about reducing people's carbon

1771
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:23,440
 footprint, and so the joke is that Kawhi Leonard never even tweeted or did anything, but what

1772
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,800
 is Kawhi's stance on people's carbon footprints?

1773
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,360
 Is he even passionate about it?

1774
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,360
 Who knows?

1775
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:29,360
 Who knows?

1776
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:32,360
 It's a weird, weird thing.

1777
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:35,360
 That's really funny.

1778
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:40,440
 It was first exposed nationally by Pablo Torre, which has a great podcast, Pablo Torre Explains

1779
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:41,440
 It All.

1780
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:42,440
 Yes.

1781
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:47,760
 Mark Cuban, I guess current part owner, but former majority owner of Mavericks, started

1782
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:48,760
 hitting up on Twitter.

1783
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:52,440
 He said, "Why don't you come on my show?"

1784
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:59,000
 They debated about who's at fault for this for two and a half hours.

1785
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:04,320
 They put an hour and 10 of it on air, and there's two people passionately arguing about

1786
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,480
 something, and there's no name calling.

1787
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:07,480
 No one gets called Hitler.

1788
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,160
 No one gets called a child molester.

1789
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:12,580
 No one is insulted.

1790
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:16,060
 It was an earnest debate where people kept their cool.

1791
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:20,280
 It's worth listening to just for that miracle, just because I didn't think people could still

1792
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:21,280
 do that.

1793
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:27,840
 Just to be clear, you mean they edited all that stuff out, and that's in the full version,

1794
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,400
 but not in the part that they aired version, right?

1795
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:34,080
 They wouldn't have done all that arguing without calling each other Hitler and child molesters.

1796
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,080
 I know.

1797
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:37,080
 It's against the rules of basic conversation these days.

1798
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:38,080
 That's right.

1799
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:42,080
 I'm glad you didn't disagree with me right there, because I would have had to call you

1800
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,080
 Hitler.

1801
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,920
 Here's the craziest thing.

1802
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:56,060
 We've done so much crazy shit because of bullshit child molestation rumors that aren't true.

1803
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:58,800
 It's all because calling someone Hitler stopped working.

1804
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:03,080
 That used to be the worst thing you could do, and someone figured out that calling someone

1805
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:07,780
 a child molester is worse than Hitler, and then that took over, and that really has created

1806
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:12,080
 a bunch of extra conspiracy theories that wouldn't have been otherwise.

1807
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:18,700
 Do you think that if it were released today, like if new evidence came out today that Hitler

1808
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:23,920
 himself was a child molester, do you think the pendulum would swing back to just calling

1809
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,840
 people Hitlers again?

1810
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:30,000
 Then I'd be like, "Life is a herald.

1811
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,360
 That's a perfect third beat of conspiracy theories."

1812
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:34,920
 That would be it right there.

1813
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:39,320
 Paul, you've got not only a fruit for 600 or 800.

1814
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:40,600
 You have negative 400 points.

1815
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,600
 Matt has 400 points.

1816
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:42,600
 You have 800 points.

1817
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,040
 It's a very high-scoring game.

1818
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:46,140
 I'll try 800, please.

1819
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:53,040
 Not only a fruit for 800, according to the U.S. Supreme Court, Nix v. Headon in 1993,

1820
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,040
 it's a vegetable.

1821
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:55,040
 1893.

1822
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,040
 Sorry, 1893.

1823
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:57,040
 Tomato.

1824
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:03,960
 So the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a tomato is a vegetable?

1825
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:05,080
 That's it.

1826
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:06,080
 It is.

1827
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:09,080
 It's a tax case.

1828
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:13,760
 Vegetables are not a botanical classification.

1829
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:14,760
 It's technically a fruit.

1830
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:17,080
 Yeah, you're technically a fruit, Hitler.

1831
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:18,280
 I'm not technically a fruit.

1832
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,280
 I'm just a fruit.

1833
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:20,280
 La-dee-dah.

1834
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:23,840
 I'm closing out the category and the game.

1835
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:27,720
 Not only a fruit for 600, a composite fruit.

1836
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:35,840
 This misnamed fruit actually consists of many tiny individual fruits embedded in a fleshy

1837
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:36,840
 receptacle.

1838
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:37,840
 Oh.

1839
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,280
 Your mom.

1840
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,160
 I like me a composite fruit.

1841
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,160
 Let's go.

1842
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:46,000
 I like me a fleshy receptacle.

1843
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
 A composite fruit.

1844
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:56,180
 This misnamed fruit actually consists of many tiny individual fruits embedded in a fleshy

1845
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:58,360
 receptacle.

1846
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:02,600
 Fleshy receptacle is really just not where I want to be in the day.

1847
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:03,600
 We are different people.

1848
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,600
 That was my high school band.

1849
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:08,200
 Different people.

1850
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,520
 That was our number one single.

1851
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:15,200
 We open for the meat puppets.

1852
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:19,060
 And I mean that literally.

1853
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:20,760
 I guess I'll pass.

1854
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:23,480
 Matt, you can win with this.

1855
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:30,600
 Man, I don't even know if I have a guess for what a fleshy receptacle would be.

1856
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:35,600
 Fleshy receptacle, do do do do.

1857
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:36,840
 I have a guess.

1858
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,880
 I'll pass to Paul.

1859
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:40,880
 Pass to Paul.

1860
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:41,880
 Pomegranate.

1861
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:42,880
 Pomegranate?

1862
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:43,880
 Oh.

1863
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:44,880
 I bet you're right.

1864
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:45,880
 There we go.

1865
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:46,880
 Oh.

1866
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:47,880
 No, it's a strawberry.

1867
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:48,880
 Strawberry, raspberry, or blackberry.

1868
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:49,880
 Boo.

1869
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:50,880
 Boo earns.

1870
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:57,140
 I thought about strawberry, but I didn't think fleshy receptacle.

1871
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:59,040
 Fleshy receptacle threw me off.

1872
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,480
 That's the game I win today with 800 points.

1873
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:02,480
 Matt has 400.

1874
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:08,040
 Paul has a negative 200 after his fleshy receptacle mishap, and that is a scooperty from Scoopy

1875
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,040
 Logic.

1876
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,040
 Thank you, Scoopy Logic.

1877
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:13,200
 Like I said, Scoopy Logic sent that to us a couple of years ago, so if you want to send

1878
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:17,240
 us a scooperty, send us a Price is Scryte Jock versus Nerd, send us an Obelisk Jock

1879
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,640
 versus Nerd, send us some scoop mail.

1880
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:23,520
 You can do all those things over there at HeyScoops.com, and today is evidence.

1881
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:26,940
 If I don't get to your scooperty when you send it in at first, I'll probably get to

1882
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:27,940
 it later.

1883
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:28,940
 Eventually.

1884
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:32,840
 I want to thank my favorite fleshy receptacle, Penn Jillette, for creating this podcast.

1885
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:33,840
 Thanks, Penn.

1886
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:37,400
 Of course, I want to thank all the people that make this show possible who support us

1887
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,800
 on our Patreon.

1888
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:46,760
 These people all are writing on the new Powers comic book coming out next year.

1889
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:47,760
 Fantastic.

1890
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:48,760
 Circles and circles.

1891
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:53,160
 Signature curl scoop, the micro scoop for shaping.

1892
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:58,600
 We all scream for Mark McLean, unbanned scoop, one small scoop for man, a ranch slunk, a

1893
01:16:58,600 --> 01:16:59,600
 scoop of root canal.

1894
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:06,800
 Aaron, Aaron Boyd, Aaron Wendling, Adam Goff, Adam Stickney, AJB, Akshay Mysore, Alla Scoop

1895

 6666, All-Star Scoop, Amera Scott Scoop, Andrea Anderson, and Andrew J Hughes.

1896
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:18,440
 The following individuals all bobbed their heads vigorously while they listened to the

1897
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:22,880
 podcast in the hopes that someone will inquire as to what it might be that's causing them

1898
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:27,360
 the jam so hard and they try and get a successful obelisk off of it.

1899
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:34,160
 Bearded Scoop 3, Bear Scoop, BJ Joyer, Belgian Triple Scoop, Ben, Ben Dennis, Ben Gao, Ben

1903
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:57,600
 The following people can be seen dancing in the video "Jigging with the Devil" by Sella

1904
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:58,600
 Van Halen.

1905
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:05,200
 That would be Andrew Koenig, Andrew Ossichuk, Andy Cheek, Angela Chan, Angry Face Scoop,

1906
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:13,400
 Ant Foods, Anton Jernberg, Apple Scoop, Ameris Saar, Avin Zarlez, AWOL Scoop, Bad Pirate

1907
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:18,680
 Scoop, Bertie, Bert Vonk, Base Camp Scoops, and BB Hermit.

1908
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:22,400
 Sorry, yeah, I did, I said Boats and Scoop wrong again.

1909
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,760
 So Boats and Scoop, thank you Boats and Scoop.

1910
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:30,880
 Also, all of these people have realized, "Hey, Prince was incredibly good at what he did."

1911

 Brian Richard, Brooks Lyle, Brian McLeod, Brian Traves, Buster Kamikaze, C. Wick, Kali

1914
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:53,560
 And the following scoops were all featured in several Roald Dahl books.

01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:59,720
 That is Charlie Thompson, Chasing the Dragon Scoop, Chelsea Farr, Chris Barsky, Chris Ellis,

 the family.

 We're just one big happy group here.

1937
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:51,320
 We all have so much fun doing this show all the time.

1938

 It's all about the family.

1939
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:53,320
 That's right, Bing.

1940
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:55,280
 Fast and furious family.

1941
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,280
 That's right, Bing.

1942
01:20:56,280 --> 01:21:00,000
 All of his Bing Crosby impersonation are just perfect.

1943
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,480
 We're doing a heist just to show how much family matters to us.

1944
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:05,480
 That's how much family matters.

1945
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:08,440
 We rob people for the love of family.

1946
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:13,160
 That's right, come on out.

1947
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:15,880
 Look, ScoopFest is two weeks away, we've got room for you.

1948
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:16,880
 You can still make that choice.

1949
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:17,880
 We do.

1950
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:20,400
 Go to scoopfest.com and buy yourself some space tickets.

1951
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:24,820
 We're selling tickets every day right now, so yeah, we definitely have space for you.

1952
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:25,820
 Come on out.

1953
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:26,820
 It's going to be awesome.

1954
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:28,400
 Yeah, it's going to be really fun.

1955
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:31,920
 We just added a thing that's going to make people very happy.

1956
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,120
 It is.

1957
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,240
 Make a road trip of it.

1958
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:35,240
 Do what you got to do.

1959
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:40,780
 I don't know if you guys saw this in the chat of our Scoop Group stuff, but we had a pair

1960
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:46,360
 of Scoops who are coming to ScoopFest who ran into a little financial hiccup as far

1961
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:51,760
 as return tickets went for their flights back out of Vegas.

1962
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:57,040
 Our community stepped up and already helped them out, got them some GoFundMe coin to get

1963
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:02,840
 them a flight back home, so I mean, I'm telling you, we got the best listeners on the freaking

1964
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:03,840
 planet.

1965
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:09,160
 I love every one of you guys and it just makes my heart swell every time I come to this podcast

1966
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:12,940
 to record and see all your lovely faces and people that message me.

1967
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:14,280
 I don't get mean messages.

1968
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:15,920
 I just get nice stuff.

1969
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:22,160
 The occasional, "Paul, you didn't get this right thing," but that's about it, but that's

1970
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:23,160
 about it.

1971
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:26,680
 Most of the time, I get, "Paul was right," so I like that too.

1972
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:31,960
 I hardly ever get mean messages, but when I do, several people make sure to forward them

1973
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:35,800
 to me, so I do have that going for me.

1974
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:39,600
 Yes, Winterscoop pointing out that only my heart is swollen when I come.

1975
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,020
 Yes, that's what happens.

1976
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:42,060
 Just my heart swells.

1977
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:43,060
 It's a condition.

1978
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:44,060
 Yeah, yeah.

1979
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:47,880
 I saw it in the comic.

1980
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,760
 It depicted like a circle in a circle.

1981
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:50,760
 Hey.

1982
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:51,760
 Yeah, that's right.

1983
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:52,760
 Some people out there might be looking for another podcast.

1984
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:57,240
 You can participate in our obelisk scheme by selecting one person and one person only

1985
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:58,720
 to check out our podcast.

1986
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:02,680
 I say, promise them all the snappy dialogue.

1987
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,080
 That's a lot of snappy dialogue.

1988
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,080
 God damn it.

1989
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,080
 Very snappy.

1990
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:07,080
 Very snappy.

1991
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:08,080
 Snapped on.

1992
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:13,440
 Snapped on for my Gilmore appreciation, but the dialogue, it's so snappy.

1993
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:23,000
 Tell them we are the Gilmore girls of dudes podcasting.

1994
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,520
 I'm sure we tackle a lot of the same issues.

1995
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:26,520
 Thanks for this, everybody.

1996
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:27,520
 Stay safe out there.

1997
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:28,520
 We love you and we'll see you soon.

1998
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:28,520
 We'll see you soon.

1999
01:23:43,440 --> 01:24:01,520
 Paul is Jesse from the Gilmore girls.

2000
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:02,520
 Jesse?

2001
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:03,520
 Yeah.

2002
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,520
 Jesse is a character in the Gilmore girls, I think.

2003
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:05,520
 Marble Tulip Scooby Tree over at Twitch is Team Jesse for life.

2004
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:06,520
 Oh, oh yes.

2005
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:07,520
 Jesse is Luke's son.

2006
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,560
 So Rory, the daughter, is torn.

2007
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:10,560
 Oh Paul, Paul.

2008
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:11,560
 I didn't care.

2009
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:12,560
 Oh no, but she's torn between Jesse.

2010
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:13,560
 And this rich kid.

2011
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:14,560
 What's his name?

2012
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:15,560
 Logan Huntsberger.

2013
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:16,560
 Logan Huntsberger.

 I happen to be Team Logan Huntsberger.

2015
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:18,560
 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage, Logan Huntsberger.

2016
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,560
 He calls her ace.

2017
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:20,560
 It's the cutest thing in the world and she should have stuck with him, but she was convinced

2018
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:21,560
 that she was going to be the ace.

2019
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:22,560
 So we're going to have a little bit of a chat with her.
