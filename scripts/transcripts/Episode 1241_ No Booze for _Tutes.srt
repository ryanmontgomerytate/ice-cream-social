20
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,800
 to Bucky's while you're in Texas um I've been I haven't been I know it's like a

21
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,200
 statewide treasure I know people yeah been to Bucky's love of Bucky's and it's

22
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,960
 it's I think it's expanding or has expanded to Louisiana as well all I know

23
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,640
 is that when I was performing as hillbill I put my baseball cards into a

24
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,720
 Bucky's bag and put that out with a fishing pole and people really laughed at

25
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,840
 the Bucky's people love the Bucky's bag yeah that makes sense that makes sense

26
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,760
 Bucky's for people who don't know is the biggest truck stop you've ever seen in

27
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,280
 your life but it's not for truckers it's just for you know regular Joe's driving

28
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:44,280
 their little Toyota Corollas up and down the street yeah so it's ridiculous yeah

29
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,120
 they've got smokers they've got smoke shops you can go in there yeah it's all

30
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,320
 crazy I think there's one supposed to open up near Las Vegas or like on the

31
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,160
 way to Las Vegas or something like that it was a latter-day scoop in the chat

32
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,120
 right now is saying supposed to be getting a Bucky's in Utah yeah maybe

33
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,200
 maybe that's it yeah can't believe Utah's ahead of Nevada on the Bucky's

34
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,560
 list man but that hurts that hurts my feelings I feel like you know we don't

35
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,520
 we don't have the the lottery we don't have Bucky's I feel like 20 years from

36
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:19,240
 now we're gonna be dealing with Bucky's like the Walmart situation like how

37
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:24,840
 there are no more gas stations there's just Bucky's it's just Bucky's yeah yeah

38
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,440
 oh yeah no yeah for sure oh and Leon Kasab is pointing out in the chat too

39
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,200
 that they're they're big Christian no big Christian activists as well and yeah

40
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:41,080
 it's it's tough it's tough no I guess we'll just go to In-N-Out or Domino's

41
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:48,800
 instead yeah you'll be fine we got we got a Sheetz slash Wawa locked down out

42
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,740
 here in PA so ain't nobody coming for Sheetz and Wawa I don't think holy

43
00:03:53,740 --> 00:04:00,600
 Sheetz oh why the why the Sheetz not that's their current catchphrase stop it

44
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:09,840
 no why why the Sheetz not that's hey hey you want to get ten tacos for $6.99 why

45
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:18,920
 the Sheetz not that's terrible that's what they say oh and they're in their

46
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,600
 chicken nuggets are called nuggets chicken nuggets are called schnuggets

47
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,040
 cuz that's fine but yeah everything's why the schnuggets makes more sense than

48
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,320
 why the Sheetz not schnuggets approved it's approved no problem I'm fine with

49
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,960
 schnuggets you got to explain why the Sheetz not because they didn't want to

50
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:46,600
 go with eat my sheets I sheets you not I sheets you not guaranteed to give you

51

52
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,600
 are all better than why the Sheetz not why does he's not because she's isn't

53
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,800
 substitute for the word fuck now it's yeah why is it why the shit not it is

57
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,880

58
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:42,760
 never been an issue in my life ever ever Paul's Native American name is flowing

59
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:48,480
 river it's absolutely it is mud creek unstoppable maybe it's cuz you're

60
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:58,120
 getting too many schnuggets I haven't eaten a long time haven't eaten it

61
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,640
 sheets in a long time but I will tell you this I was betrayed by value

62
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:16,920
 gentlemen oh yes so we went we went last week to to Aldi do you guys have Aldi now

63
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,520
 in Vegas we just got it yeah right I haven't been yet but we and I grew up I

64
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,280
 grew up with an Aldi around me in Jersey okay so I really like Aldi our Aldi is

65
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,920
 good it's got some really great stuff and brother the value just stacks so we're

66
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:38,280
 going long and I'm grabbing some grub here and there picking out a few things

67
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:44,400
 and all these one of these places where you can put in a quarter into the bass

68
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,280
 cart and get a bass cart and rent the bass cart what it you just said bass

69
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:56,840
 cart three times what the fuck is a bass cart so I grew up calling them carts yeah

70
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:03,640
 Buggies I see I never call them Buggies they're called no I called them Buggies

71
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:09,880
 they call them Buggies out here okay I always called them carts or baskets yeah

72
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,880
 that's fine no they people out here don't know what the hell you're saying

73
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:22,200
 when you say when you say bass cart no one people like I think I only have that

74
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,400
 with the sheets that was a snuggies independent film that came out in the

75
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,920
 90s about that artist who drew with like maple syrup on his placemat you know

76
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,920
 what he was great my dad was a my dad was a grocery man I'm gonna say bass cart

77
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:39,240
 is probably insider terminology that I inherited oh I bet you it is yeah gotta

78
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,360
 be I bet you anything because he would you know I just I always called it a

79
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:50,800
 bass cart anyway so I actually when I go shopping I don't deal with any of that

80
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:57,440
 okay I get on like a mechanic sled and I lie on my back and I walk around with

81
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,000
 like an Easter basket on my belly and I just shopped that way I just reach I

82
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,660
 back around I move around the store that's like that old Richard Simmons

83
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,600
 thing right of like only search shop in certain spots in the grocery store and

84
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:15,160
 this is the way to do it you get on your belly on the bound oh yeah only stuff

85
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,000
 you can reach from your from laying down that's the only stuff that's safe to eat

86
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,040
 anymore yeah so anyway I don't think I've ever heard the term bass cart

87
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,440
 before well but yet regional term particularly used in the Pacific

88
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,520
 Northwest and other areas for shopping cart or grocery cart I but you for the

89
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,640
 smaller one right you're talking about no this is just saying the the big one

90
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,040
 the regular size was bass cart because I was accepting the notion that it was an

91
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,160
 insider for a different kind of cart right so you get the regular shopping

92
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,480
 carts and you get together get the bass carts - I know it's talking about say in

93
00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:01,340
 my brain I always just conflated it to being it's a cart that has a wire basket

94
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:06,160
 on it mm-hmm right that was what that was why it was a bass cart that's that's

95
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,940
 what it looks like here on the of the old Google yeah so anyway nobody out here

96
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,680
 stealing carts or but what about what about what about tiscots or tascots is

97
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,280
 anyone stealing those out there yes the blue and yellow ones specifically are

98
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:27,720
 gone you cannot what about my virtue someone stole it a long time ago and I've

99
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,840
 been looking for it ever since you're not gonna find it you're not gonna find

100
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:37,840
 it at Aldi pal what about my my pearls has anyone stolen my pearls god damn you

101
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,000
 know I think I'm gonna try and incorporate that bit but I think it's

102
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,320
 gonna become more common because our power grid is gonna start failing a lot

103
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:54,600
 more often so anyway you don't have to take a cart at Aldi ah bass cart

104
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,400
 latter-day scoop we have a picture of a shopping cart filled with bass well done

105
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:06,380
 that's a bass cart for sure good job so well done well you know you don't have

106
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:12,800
 to bring a cart you can just bring your bag okay reusable bag and stick it in

107
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,320
 there and then take that to the checkout line and stick it back in the bag which

108
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,640
 what I usually do is I don't shop a ton of stuff very rarely do I use a cart you

109
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,680
 can also just grab they leave boxes in the front so you just grab a box oh yeah

110
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,720
 yeah from the product and throw stuff in a box check out and you're you know kind

111
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,560
 of eco-friendly save some time it's nice I like it and also people forget their

112
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,440
 quarter sometime and can't rent a cart so they just need to carry a box anyway

113
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,360
 we're shopping around and I'm like ooh it's hot dog time there's hot dogs so I

114
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,480
 grabbed some hot dogs and I'm looking at the hot dogs and they're like you know

115
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,640
 what time it is it's hot dog time hot dogs are maybe maybe three bucks maybe

116
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,760
 all right great good and then I look a fair price for a hot dog and right neck

117
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,880
 well for eight hot dogs I look right next to these hot dogs and there's

118
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:13,960
 another pack of hot dogs that are an all the in-house brand what how much how low

119
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:19,840
 would you go on a packet you've already gone below the number that I would

120
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:27,560
 once I see three dollar hot dogs I go nope I'm done these these I believe the

121
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,880
 I believe the all the hot dogs I believe they were priced at a point where if you

122
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:37,400
 took those up to the cashier the cashier would turn around and give you three

123
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:44,200
 dollars along with the pack of hot well they should have these these boys were

124
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:52,480
 paper these boys were 89 cents wow so I was like Mike Neal said in the chat you

125
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,840
 guessed 99 cents you went over my friend I was like you're out according to

126
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:02,120

00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:24,880
 Leon is sending the right gift so uh poor Lindsey so he said sexy Barry

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,040
 basically it next to these three dollar packs of hot dogs though there was a man

152
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:52,080
 he was his hair was all slicked back and he had on a beautiful black silk suit

153
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:58,360
 and he said Paul he knew my name he said Paul wouldn't you like to save two

154
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,520
 dollars and something since he was right and this is where we got old Tom

155
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:09,800
 Jacoby's hot dogs did you say Tom Jacoby oh he died Tom Jacoby died ten years ago

156
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:16,360
 Tom no I just saw him today Matt you'll be happy to know that I did have my dogs

157
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:22,000
 I did hedge my bets and on the way out I also picked up a pack of five straight

158
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,620

168
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:25,360
 pill into the dog's mouth and quickly offer him a second piece no pill so that

169
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,040
 he'll wolf it all down cuz half the time Bill is smart he will eat the wiener

170

189
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,840
 the microwave no you're lying to yourself but you're talking to a guy who

190
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,600
 loves the texture of pudding skin so that's kind of what I've got with the

191
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,640
 microwave wiener if that's your level crunch from a hot dog I'm gonna bite

 celebrating the victory of selling those hot dogs and getting the permeate an

231
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,400
 American household here's the thing and my investigative journalist wife we're

232
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:49,440
 going to collapse them from within she quickly she quickly while she sat on the

233
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:56,520
 couch many feet away from the kitchen smelling the death and trails she went

234
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:02,720
 ahead and jumped online to find out what is going on with these wieners she found

235
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,280
 a reddit a reddit thread apparently they changed the recipe on these just like

236
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:14,920
 two months ago all right everybody is like dear God what is this this is not a

237
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:23,240
 hot dog this is the phallus smelling things it is the nastiest thing people

238
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,800
 were like I've been buying these for a long time now they're really disgusting

239
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,400
 we looked on the ingredients there were all these weird our hot dogs will fly a

240
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,440
 plane right into your taste buds they really did the secret ingredient is cat

241
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,520
 shit says fro yag and he's right it was nasty there's all like cumin and lots of

242
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,840
 powders and I don't I don't know like for a while it was like chicken and beef

243
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,120
 for the top ingredients they're not anymore

244
00:23:51,120 --> 00:24:01,120
 yeah never forget the flavors right oh god yes he looked at the ingredients

245
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,980
 after he was done yeah well I didn't eat any well and dared me to eat a little

246
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:12,280
 bite and I ate a little bite and it was so nasty when was the last time you

247
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:17,280
 purchased something from a grocery store that your wife then had to dare you to

248
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:23,280
 eat or cause her to me they get on reddit to figure out what was going on

249
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:31,360
 when I've been into it I chewed up a little bit it was like it was like kind

250
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,880
 of like a falafel meat if it had been on a New York sidewalk for a couple days

251
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,960
 like a gyro you mean yeah like a gyro but like really like I'm like somebody

252
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:49,320
 stepped on this here gyro this big cut like the gyros that would come with it

253
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,920
 would just be like the weird gray meat you never you never quite knew where it

254
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:59,920
 came from yes yes yeah yeah yeah just a rotating pile of something yeah so it

255
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:05,120
 was it was bad and and she was looking up all these different people saying oh

256
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,840
 god these these hot dogs just are are the nastiest thing I've ever eaten this

257
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:15,040
 is gross I don't know what's going on with this and then the kicker was she

258
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,280
 looked on the on the bag to find out what the branding and everything it's an

259
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:26,000
 all-the-in-house thing but she saw on the packaging it says explicitly do not

260
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,820
 recycle this plastic

261
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:38,680
 labels that says hey this plastic is not recyclable no but this one was like

262
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:52,960
 warning what did it say why I can tell you my theory okay it's contaminated

263
00:25:52,960 --> 00:26:04,360
 there's something horribly wrong with it oh anyway it was really gross it was

264
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:12,440
 really really bad oh I just did a search on our new Aldi hot dogs good is oh yeah

265
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:20,920
 search that okay yeah one of the lines is people have had experience with bad

266
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:25,260
 experiences with recent quality issues like the hot dogs being too greasy okay

267
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:37,200
 too small okay or leaking yeah what a horrible adjective leaking the hot dogs

268

 it out in a bucket in a very thin very shallow bucket terrible uncle Arthur's

301
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,200
 awful tantrums or something like that it's called I can't remember exactly how

302
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:49,040
 I phrased it uncle Arthur's terrible tantrum whiskey go ahead and get some of

303
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:54,480
 that what it's basically they put it on I get you some they they age it in a bed

304
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:07,480
 pan open open face bed pan 100% it check out you put those bananas and lambskin

305
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:17,160
 condoms crispy I went and saw the Wizard of Oz at the sphere last night we

306
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,440
 should have been sled with that we shouldn't talked about hot dogs for the

307
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:29,440
 a block you know what you know what I just gave you 20 minutes of gold from a

308
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:36,000
 fucking rotten pigs asshole shut up liquid fire shit gold is what you gave

309
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,640
 me my also make Wizard of Oz the a block but then we fell into this pile of gold

310
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,920
 and I can tell you this Judy Garland doesn't microwave up half as nice as an

311
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,720
 Aldi wiener that is true that is true you take that she's real sticky you take

312
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,900
 that back you don't disparage my Judy

313
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:07,200
 holy shit the sphere is still amazing yeah the sphere remains amazing they I

314
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,760
 I think they might have found their thing I think they might have found

315
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,440
 their thing that's gonna make money every day when they don't have concerts

316
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:20,240
 in that building just reboot movies I specifically this one this is okay so

317
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,200
 that it's so weird so it's not the whole movie they have taken the movie they

318
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,880
 have edited out big chunks of it so the whole thing is only like 70 minutes I

319
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,920
 think huh I think I think the whole movie about 70 minutes they've used you

320
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,800
 know there's a ton of AI there's a ton of processing there's all these things

321
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:41,160
 because basically they're taking all the scenes that are zoomed in so like if

322
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,200
 you're if you're zoomed in on Annie M for instance in one scene where she's

323
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,520
 standing in a room talking to people you don't just see her zoomed in you see the

324
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:53,800
 whole room of filled with filled with like whoever's in the room that she's

325
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,520
 talking to you got it so they they took things from the movie they took

326
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,760
 implications from the movie and expanded those out and fleshed those out it was

327
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:08,120
 really neat a lot of AI stuff a lot of a fit not a lot but a fair amount of

328
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,840
 background characters I don't know how you guys are watching movie and TV

329
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,800
 scenes with big groups of people I find myself always watching the extras I

330
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,640
 think we've talked about this before oh no I don't they're little people I only

331
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,360
 look at the stars

332
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:40,680
 little people is the right thing to say yeah yeah guys eat all the hot dogs you

333
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:45,400
 fuckers oh no no eat shit it's better for you that's it that's the new curse

334
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:52,760
 all the hot dogs upon your house oh god the worst thing your house will be

335
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:58,240
 uninhabitable it'll smell too bad yeah no I look at background characters in

336
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,560
 fact that's actually my kids will do that too and they actually discovered

337
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,400
 their own grandmother and numerous scenes because they realized that back

338
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,120
 when my my mother-in-law was doing a bunch of background work all the time

339
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,560
 right up in the background of some of their favorite shows and she'd forgotten

340
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:16,040
 she'd done that show or something it's very yeah she had forgotten that she had

341
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:21,360
 animated herself into spongebob squarepants she was an extra on it so

342
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,120
 this is where they're using you know whatever AI technology CGI technology to

343
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,440
 create you know larger groups that fill the whole screen and stuff like that

344
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:35,400
 right that's right and they're making a whole new scenes and intro scenes like

345
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:40,200
 when the when the house lands in Oz instead of just opening like like in the

346
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,080
 in the movie Dorothy opens the door to the to the house that just landed and she

347
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:49,440
 walks out into Oz she walks out into munchkin land in this there's the whole

348
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,760
 storm scene and by the way they've got you know huge wind machines and snow and

349
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:59,040
 all kinds of shit falls on you and the chairs vibrate and it's a whole 4d

350
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:04,800
 experience but on a 20,000 seat scale instead of 100 seat scale at the at the

351
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:13,800
 fair or whatever so it's really all this stuff they they start the movie after

352
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:20,320
 Dorothy has already interacted with mrs. Gulch with the witch so like they start

353
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,700
 the movie a good 15 minutes in basically they start the movie about two minutes

354
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:29,080
 before she's seeing somewhere over the rainbow mm-hmm so I mean they just skip

355
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:35,040
 through a lot of stuff but I mean it is it is neat and there it was full you

356
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,320
 know 20,000 people in there or however many people they have is their occupancy

357
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:43,840
 for the for the movie stuff well it's already it was like you know it's it's

358
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,400
 doing the number one tourism thing which is people plan trips around coming out

359
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:51,320
 to see it right and apparently we were talking to a buddy of mine who's one of

360
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,720
 the people who run the show over there he was saying they've already sold over

361
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:01,960
 400,000 tickets jeez Lord yeah so like they're just you know I mean because we

362
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,800
 went to the show last night that was their second show of the nighters

363
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:11,040
 that's every Raiders game for the season for the thousand yeah close yeah close

364
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,080
 to right right that ballpark yeah for sure well I'll tell you what's

365
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:20,880
 encouraging to me is seeing is seeing so many of my local friends getting acting

366
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,520
 work inside the theater as extras and sort of like guests and hosts and all

367
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:34,560
 that kind of thing yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah a bunch of people a bunch of

368
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,920
 people I know are working yeah I was like wow like Marcus is there and yeah

369
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,560
 I saw a picture I was like this is just like a who's who of people I've worked

370
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:48,760
 with in the past this is cool yeah yeah so well it eliminates all these other

371
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,600
 shows and jobs it's nice that they picked up our friends on the way which

372
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,520
 is good that's right well I mean we didn't talk about that last night we

373
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,400
 talked about that with with a friend of ours James last night he was like oh no

374
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,360
 one of the guys running the show he was like all these great shows in town and

375
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,360
 we're just selling fuck tons of tickets I know it's hurting the other shows in

376
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:11,160
 town yeah yeah I was like yeah it's true but I mean it's also part of it you know

377
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:20,340
 it's biggest goes through changes and that's the song we all think of when we

378
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:27,200
 hear changes and you know like every show you have every every casino you

379
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,400
 have a production show right right like used to have some kind of big big show

380
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,800
 that song song and dance and you'd have five every song every casino hired 50

381
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:41,360
 dancers and sure just went away they dance on the Decca Lee Titanic watt-sank

382
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:46,640
 that's right that's what it lasted longest Jubilee right yeah but but

383
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,400
 everybody you know even the Penn and Teller theater the Rio used to have a

384
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:55,160
 production show in there and that's why it's like such a big backstage area for

385
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,520
 Penn and Teller it's because it always used to be also they used to also split

386
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:06,800
 it with dance with a dance team yeah so it's you know it is interesting that

387
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:12,760
 like you know Cirque du Soleil has been open for you know 30 40 years right in

388
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:17,600
 this town right and and so you know it's interesting that like a literal death

389
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:23,040
 star got built in the middle of the strip and you're like oh no but that's a

390
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,560
 license they still haven't gotten they still haven't been able to just make

391
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:31,160
 themselves into the Death Star this is when you're talking about the way you're

392
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,920
 talking about this very experience this this was Star Trek this is Star Trek the

393
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,360
 experience oh yeah yeah especially I mean the dome was what they built you in the

394
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:45,600
 I don't know you went to that listen motherfucker they built the dome for the

395
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:52,760
 original Klingon encounter which worked with the the actual motion ride carts

396
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:58,880
 all right the vehicles and then when they put in 4d only the ending of that

397
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,400
 was a theatrical 4d experience but it had seats that would poke you in the

398
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:09,000
 ass and squirt you with water and shoot you with air and stuff oh dude I mean it

399
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,680
 didn't have the dick sucking alien like I would propose we're getting there

400
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,800
 we're getting there eventually it'll every day we're a little bit closer to

401
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:25,960
 that dick-sucking alien did you see it happened at the corn concert did you see

402
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:34,640
 it see what specifically there was a guy at a corn concert up in the up in the

403
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:42,120
 nosebleeds jacking it during going at it during this is going whole hogs her in

404
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:47,520
 the show and a bunch of people like hey dude knock it off and he's like no I'm

405
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:54,240
 getting there like he went he went to completion on him he didn't give a damn

406
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:59,760
 yeah so like the last corn that sir is the second nastiest thing that's been

407
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:13,440
 discussed on this show today that is horrible so I don't know I didn't know

408
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:20,160
 Lucy Kate likes corn everybody likes corn Matt all right they're hard to

409
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:26,960
 digest though okay so all right Vegas politics and entertainment see change

410
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,580
 and all that stuff aside yes let's get it what's getting the actual experience

411
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:38,440
 of going to see Wizard of Oz we get that they open the doors I think 45 minutes

412
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,840
 early so we get there they have decked out they've added a whole bunch of stuff

413
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:48,600
 to the lobby so there's all new LEDs and all there's a mini sphere in the lobby

414
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:53,720
 that people in the zoom chat just saw a minute ago so that they do all kinds of

415
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:58,480
 Wizard of Oz scenes on that after the movie is over that's when they do a live

416
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,840
 performance they do they do live performance afterwards you get to like

417
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:06,680
 interact with the wizard they've got a huge hologram an interactive hologram of

418
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:12,080
 the wizard that appears out in the lobby and sorry Jacob breaking news we're

419
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,360
 getting updates in the chat about the guy jerking off with the corn concert

420
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:20,240
 turns out people were punching him in the back of the head and trying to try

421
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,280
 to basically stop him they were trying to stop him he did I don't think they

422
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:29,440
 stopped him what they didn't realize was featuring out a bug to the guy Jack

423
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:35,520
 like he's like he loves a good donkey punch he's like oh yeah no don't hit me

424
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,680
 no please oh I hate that you're hitting me so much human contact certainly won't

425
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:51,600
 put me over the edge no definitely not with strangers so was Darren the the

426
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,560
 wizard when you were there Darren was not the wizard when I was there but our

427
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:01,400
 friend James Simpson was he was the the guard the you know you can't see the

428
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,840
 wizard nobody sees the wizard not nobody not know how that James is the used to

429
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:11,200
 work at 50 shades right yes yeah yeah yeah you know James yeah he's good guy

430
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,200
 very good yeah we even got we even got a special little just us picture with with

431
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,600
 James and the wizard and in their costumes oh that's awesome yeah it's on

432
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:26,200
 SJ's phone or I'd show it to you James James knows everyone everyone knows yes

433
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:32,280
 yes he is one of those workhorses for Vegas that's right like every show yes

434
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:39,160
 that's right so we were there it is so what I want to talk about it's so weird

435
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:44,860
 to watch a movie that assumes that everyone is not only already seen that

436
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:50,480
 movie but that everyone is very familiar with it yeah yeah yeah so like like I

437
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,760
 said earlier like the movie doesn't start with all of the setup that the

438
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,640
 real movie starts with it doesn't start with you're getting to know the

439
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,480
 characters it doesn't it they're like you know these characters we all know

440
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,640
 that you know these characters we're gonna skip over this part we're not

441
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,000
 gonna have this 20 minutes in the movie where we get to know Dorothy and Annie

442
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,200
 M and uncle Henry and all these people like you don't need to know that you

443
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,640
 know who these people are we're going straight over the rainbow she's gonna do

444
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,760
 the over the rainbow then pretty quickly after that we're gonna see Gulch she's

445
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,880
 gonna be there trying to take the dog dogs gonna get away and we're going to

446
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:28,840
 Oz so like 10 minutes in their defense we're there you have done you have like

447
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:34,000
 80 years to see the original version you know I'm not really I'm not criticizing

448
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,320
 it but it is the first time I've ever seen something that assumes that you

449
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:43,840
 already know the full story of the thing that you're watching well the ruby

450
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:49,160
 slippers are still the number one most valuable movie prop in existence oh they

451
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:53,100
 have to be they are I'd be I'd be surprised if anything else was close to

452
00:42:53,100 --> 00:43:00,640
 it well I think they might get usurped soon possibly depends on what I just saw

453
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:05,040
 that by what Jacob what do you think is gonna get you serpent go ahead oh okay I

454
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:11,840
 think it'll be the giant robot from Pacific Rim Luke Skywalker's lightsaber

455
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:17,640
 handle yeah you're closer there Matt yeah it's an original screen used Vader

456
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:23,880
 lightsaber that is going up for sale oh Leon Kassab says that Rosebud is the

457
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,600
 number two most expensive prop yes found in the trash that that makes sense too

458
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:34,800
 yeah it was we don't want to any spoilers for citizen Kane to anyone has

459
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:40,080
 not yet seen citizen Kane go ahead fast forward about 15 seconds while we do all

460
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:44,240
 the spoilers for citizen Kane yeah I think the the next sphere show so make

461
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,120
 sure you vote up on it I think absolutely no kidding around go to the

462
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,880
 sphere to watch this again oh that'd be amazing actually I do that today that'd

463
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,720
 be great I maybe don't get that that'd be really cool it would be really good

464
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:02,080
 they could do a lot of crazy shit with citizen Kane so watching this movie with

465
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:06,560
 the assumption watching a watching a movie play that is assuming that I don't

466
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:12,800
 need to get any information from the movie is a weird experience already and

467
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,560
 then watching a movie that I have seen I mean who knows how many times I've seen

468
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,640
 the Wizard of Oz in my life I mean probably hundreds if not thousands of

469
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,360
 times back when we were kids it was on TV at least once a year of course yeah

470
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:29,080
 and I would watch it all yeah it was a big man TV yeah I've embarrassed my mom

471
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,960
 by saying this before but my mom did famously asked me one time a few years

472
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:39,640
 ago when they colorized the the middle part of Wizard of Oz oh my and I had to

473
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,700
 break it to her that they had not colorized it they that's how the movie

474
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:46,480
 had been made it was the first part in sepia and second part in color she said

475
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,160
 oh no no no when I was a little girl it was all in black and white mmm I said

476
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:58,520
 mom no no no when she was watching it she was watching it at her home on a

477
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:04,760
 black and white television me exactly so it was all black and white just only for

478
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,560
 her oh people who watched it on black and white TVs I was like now you were

479
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,640
 watching in the black just you just be the family be carving up the recently

480
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,960
 microwaved hot dog and they'd watch it watch it over at the old black and white

481
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:23,480
 TV Thanksgiving math they never had the luxury of microwaved hot dogs in the

482
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:29,320
 50s I didn't know the joys of the pudding just good a metal spirit through

483
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:34,320

 fork it and cook it like that all crazy that crazy remember do you ever see that

485
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:44,720

530
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:07,000
 come up with different ideas and really workshop them and everything I go no we

531
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,840
 actually come up with everything right there on the fly we just we just go

532
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,800
 through and we talk about stuff and we have conversations and sometimes it

533
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:19,200
 takes us to fun places like a horse a talking horse with us we don't we don't

534
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,840
 think about that at all before the show starts that's just what comes up but

535
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:29,240
 it's all we'll think about after no no still the second most disgusting things

536
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:35,040
 that on this show basically got a radio flyer wagon designed specifically to

537
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:49,720
 carry what's there - how do you carry your - I carry mine in a flyer way thank

538
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:56,840
 you radio flyer what I like about the radio flyer it's the color match the

539
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:10,880
 color matches pretty good it's fairly it's fairly unobtrusive and people who

540
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,960
 don't know wouldn't wouldn't even know it's like I'm not wearing anything at

541
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:28,300
 all it's very inconspicuous Wizard of Oz thumbs up worth going very expensive

542
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:33,480
 expensive but but a fun ticket and definitely a different experience than

543
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:39,680
 anything I've seen I think anywhere before right yeah yeah it's a crazy

544
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:45,200
 thing it's a crazy thing for sure so you thought you think they're just gonna

545
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,100
 like well I mean I guess they're gonna keep cranking that one is there is it an

546
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:54,280
 indefinite run I think so yeah yeah I think it'll run until people stop buying

547
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:59,600
 thousands of tickets for it I actually know it's not even fully finished that's

548
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:04,040
 true they're still adding they're still gonna be adding more things to it yeah

549
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:09,120
 and they're selling stuff is there a merch thing associated oh definitely oh I

550
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:14,560
 got a shirt I got a Wizard of Oz shirt for sure yeah you know me and my merch

551
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:18,840
 laughs at me every time we go to a concert or something Jacob will go buy

552
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:25,280
 the merch is it a is it specifically sphere themed there's one t-shirt where

553
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:30,080
 you it says you putting a pill into a hot dog meat for Toto mm-hmm they got

554
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:35,680
 that in there Oh Oh if you don't eat this pill you'll get fleas and ticks I

555
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:41,320
 know it makes my hands smell like the underside of a hobo's rectum but please

556
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:49,120
 just have it just the underside yes the underside of the uncovered underside of

557
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:55,960
 the whole underside of a hobo's rectum yes it smells like Binda leavings

558
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:03,760
 enter a scoop to check out yeah yeah not totally finished with your scoop is it's

559
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,280
 what they're calling it's in its edging phase it's in its right phase the

560
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:17,120
 Wizard of Oz I also ran into a friend of mine we went to the sphere with our

561
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:21,760
 cousins who were in town and they were laughing at us actually the same thing

562
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:26,000
 that we were talking about with James earlier they were like holy shit is it

563
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,040
 fun going out to entertainment things with Jacob and SJ because we just see

564
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:34,480
 people that we know the entire time of course so one of the people that we ran

565
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:40,360
 into was the artistic director from over at the new area 15 universal horror

566
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:46,320
 nights and yeah so she like they've just gotten opened over there they're

567
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:49,120
 cranking it out I think they're still gonna make some changes over there I

568
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:53,560
 don't think they're done just like the sphere so I mean it is that that gives me

569
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,880
 a little bit of hope when we're talking about the the entertainment jobs going

570
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:02,960
 away and yeah oh yeah there's all there's old stuff that's getting hurt

571
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,680
 but there's always new stuff coming in as well so it's always a fun it's funny

 enjoy it really interesting that's the person who didn't enjoy that first thing

612
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:02,160
 I think of when I think of pizza is hot dog all right we got a one-to-one tie

613
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:06,960
 right now Matt you're up first on this one and oh good news Matt it's Starbucks

614
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:17,760
 somebody says hot dog I say so as you saw from the first one these are from all

615
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,960
 they're not necessarily present so the the hot dog pizza I guess it was on 15

616
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:32,000
 hot dogs on a pizza hey you got it possible he got a pretty good idea Jimmy

617

 why don't we try to Jimmy Matt is Starbucks gravy latte real or fake

618
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:45,800
 description this holiday season Starbucks is introducing the Thanksgiving

619
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:52,160

621
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:03,920
 festive indulgence pie slice as you know I get the fuck out of here as we know

622
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:11,760
 Starbucks sits around and just daydreams about women in giant SUVs sitting at a

623
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,720
 drive-thru for 20 minutes and that's right and pulling out something that has

624
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:21,380
 a specific color and so this fits none of those categories and so I'm going to

625
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:29,000
 say false false fake any fake I will say they do some stupid shit in the name of

626
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:35,720
 capitalist chicanery that fucking CEO that came in a while back and he knew a

627
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:40,360
 guy who knew a guy who had a fuck ton of olive oil they started putting olive oil

628
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:46,120
 in some of the lattes like that was a thing like anybody ever put a fucking stupid

629
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:52,320
 not a thing but they actually played nationally rolled that out sold lattes

630
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:55,600
 with olive oil in it get the fuck out of here but no there's no way there's

631
01:00:55,600 --> 01:01:01,720
 gravy fucking coffee no they are doing protein foam which is close to gravy I

632
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:10,880
 make some of that at home I make my home protein foam double crisp double crisp

633
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:18,800

01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:27,040

 drowning that morning coffee on the run but really can't afford to use your other

637
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:43,400
 hand to hold it well Kentucky Fried Chicken has a game-changer for you and

638
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:47,300
 the fast food chain is pushing the limits of what we consider a beverage

639
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:53,140
 container with its latest announcement it's called the scoffee cup an edible

640
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:58,080
 cup made out of a wafer biscuit wrapped in sugar paper and lined with a heat

641
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:05,520
 resistant white chocolate no phony baloney Paul says phony baloney Matt I

642
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:12,120
 sure baloney phony let's go for it I would drink this the answer it's real

643
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:17,640
 shut the fuck up what if our customers occasionally like to have their cake and

644
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:22,200
 eat it why wouldn't we want them to have their cup and eat it instead that's from

645
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:29,320
 KFC spokeswoman Jocelyn boney maybe told the USA Today the cups also feature

646
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:37,800
 aromas and come with the scents coconut suncream and freshly cut grass the those

647
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:45,080
 last few descriptions are disgusting but that is a lawsuit waiting to happen I

648
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,760
 don't think rolled it out nationally though I don't feel like I think it's not

649
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,360
 I've never seen that in my neighborhood yeah I don't know I don't know if that's

650
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:56,800
 a current thing or a past thing I think that thing failed miserably well it's so

651
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:00,960
 Leon Casaba saying it's British he wrote this thing so there you go but that

652
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:07,800
 makes sense now thinking about it as it's a scone cup it's not scoffee that

653
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:13,520
 does make sense right it's pot scone pot cup in it it allot me a cup a lot me a

654
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:20,640

 the chat brought up an image of it already there it is they're gonna be

715
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:14,400
 selling that on the princess cruises it's a real deal I don't see why let's

716
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:20,760
 do one more here cat and crunch delights from Taco Bell this item is Taco Bell's

717
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:25,840
 first variation on Cinnabon delights a cream filled donut hole reminiscent of

718
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:30,240
 Cinnabon's cinnamon rolls the new cat and crunch delights are a donut hole

719
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:36,520
 version of a bowl of cat and crunch berries cereal with milk the pastry

720
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:42,440
 evokes a giant crunch berry with the familiar flaming pink color not found in

721
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:46,840
 nature the cream filling represents sweet cereal milk and the pastry is

722
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:54,200
 rolled in a coating of crushed cat and crunch cereal yeah I know whatever it is

723
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:59,480
 it sounds super healthy well I don't if this is this supposed to be ad copy or

724
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:04,200
 just yeah that would be their ad copy or their their press release but they

725
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:09,680
 wouldn't say they wouldn't say not found in nature I don't think oh

726
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:19,600
 interesting that's my and the my other thought is Cinnabon having the the name

727
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:24,840
 of that stuff like they're not gonna share that with another company unless

728
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:28,360
 they're owned by the same parent company which I don't know they could be because

729
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:34,920
 there's only like four companies but I'm good is it my guess no it's Matt's guess

01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:10,420
 kid said Amanda Clark Taco Bell's senior director of marketing we feel like it

01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:53,440
 the last question last question this one goes to Matt first

754
01:12:53,440 --> 01:13:02,840
 Tostino's salsa cereal there is no better snack duo on game day Tostino's

755
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:07,400
 chips and salsa appearing so beloved that even die-hard football fans are

756
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:11,680
 willing to take their eyes off the game to get the perfect bite but this season

757
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:16,640
 Tostino's and legendary wide receiver Julian Edelman are changing the game

758
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:22,400
 and introducing the most creative way to snack Tostino's salsa cereal for those

759
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:27,320
 asking themselves what salsa cereal is it's exactly what it sounds like eating

760
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:32,280
 chips and salsa with a bowl and a spoon it's a clever twist on the classic chips

761
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:36,680
 and salsa pairing that has been a game day staple for decades but makes it

762
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:40,840
 easier than ever for football fans to enjoy the game without ever needing to

763
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:48,080
 miss a second of the action plus milk plus milk what the fuck

764
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:56,760
 Matt you're up first false Tostino's salsa cereal false in Matt's opinion Paul

765
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:03,120
 I'll tell you what gamesmanship and the only other thing is they included the

766
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:09,080
 name of a player that could just do nobody could have included the name of

767
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:14,200
 an NFL player without it being real no I got a gamesmanship I gotta I gotta true

768
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:20,720
 it are you going true I have to to games true on the salsa cereal because this is

769
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:25,960
 me and Matt oh I guess you're right I guess that is the right games play - yeah

770
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:30,720
 I have to he guessed false I gotta guess true that's true yeah yeah so it is it

771
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:35,440
 is the right gameplay move to make and and honestly the use of the name of a

772
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:39,200
 player they don't you know there you go yeah they don't just throw names you don't have players

773
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:44,800
 around like that like there's nothing that's true that is true it's real Paul

774
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:51,200
 is right oh my god disgusting horrific as game day staples Tostino's chips and

775
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:55,280
 salsa have always gone hand-in-hand with watching football said Leslie Vesper

776
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:59,640
 vice president of marketing Pepsi Co Foods North America salsa cereal is the

777
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:04,080
 latest way we're bringing fans new experiences to enjoy the game and snacks

778
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:11,180
 to go with it no nope god damn it no not interested

779
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:17,240
 Leslie Vesper not interested in that's horrific that is horrific but I knew it

780
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:23,040
 as soon as they grabbed a player name bar doesn't make sense that that logic

781
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:27,480
 doesn't make sense I mean you were correct and I'm wrong but it's very easy

782
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:31,400
 to write a player's name into a fake thing but Matt we have discussed this

783
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:35,080
 many many times I get to the right answer the wrong way all the time oh

784
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:42,520
 Jesus there it is look see it's got his face on the chat Julian Edelman's salsa

785
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:50,040
 cereal oh my gross that's gross how turned on I am by it yeah we'll see if

786
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:56,400
 the corn concert don't hit me in the back of the head but that's the big

787
01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:02,040
 thing right now is having these players and people you know do these big

788
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:08,640
 collabos yeah there was some person I was it's happening now to me to the

789
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:13,160
 point where because I'm unloading all these boxes of shit and there's a some

790
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:16,680
 cereal that's coming out with some music person I'm like I have never heard of

791
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:22,640
 this person I am a thousand years old I discovered something this week

792
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:26,360
