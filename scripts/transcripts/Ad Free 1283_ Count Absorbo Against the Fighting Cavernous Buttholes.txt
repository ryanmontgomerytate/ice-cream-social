 heater going right over here next to me
 my feet are a little chilly crazy out here we got so much snow yesterday it just did not stop
 12 consecutive hours of snowfall it's time for pittsburgh yeah parking and weather with the
 famous fall yeah yeah yeah so uh it's thick thick and rich up in this motherfucker
 we've had to dig passageways for the dogs to go out to poo and pee like you know like
 there's a big mound of snow
 up on one side of our porch that yeah ted keeps playing king of the mountain on it so it's really
 cute and very funny they love it the corgs love it they got those double coats they don't give a
 shit they're out there farting around in snow and then they come running right back as soon as they
 get a little bit inconvenient so well i'm just gonna come back inside now but they're they're
 ridiculous um yeah they're they're spoiled we're very fortunate we did not lose power at all during
 all this so we didn't really get any kind of ice per se uh you know we didn't get any kind of ice
 per se uh you know we didn't get any kind of ice per se uh you know we didn't get any kind of ice
 we're still digging out we had generous lovely neighbors come by at the height of the storm
 yesterday and one guy on his atv with a snow plow on the front plowed most of our driveway and
 another neighbor came and snow blowed the rest of the driveway and then it got another six inches on
 top of that where they'd cleared so we had to shovel again and i've got to shovel again today
 you called them back you called them i did not call them back over they did they did more than
 they needed uh where are you guys we uh we got guys hello hello no they they did great so it's uh
 gonna take a little while to dig out i was supposed to have my first new class this evening
 for a new semester at uh skit but we put everything on delay because everybody is
 buried in snow and it's still pretty difficult to get around lots of schools are closed for
 the next couple of days the temperature is only going to go down from here so
 yeah sexy temperature the tough part is going to be as there's a little bit of snow melt during
 the day then this temperature goes way below freezing and yeah ice ice ice baby so we'll see
 we'll see how it goes i don't go back to work till wednesday thank goodness or until thursday
 wednesday night thursday morning um so yeah i got a little bit of time and had to go in today
 but she's got that snow mode and she said once she got onto the main roads it wasn't terrible but
 you know still not great yeah uh unless you're a corgi unless you're a corgi then it's then life
 is pretty fucking good right yeah they're loving it jacob i wasn't paying attention who'd you thank
 the ice cream truck driver at the top of the show uh not uh not technical scoop port you did not
 you're not no no he's on the next show he's on the next show that's why i laughed at myself
 before we started the show because he was saying he hadn't been thanked yet i was like i got him
 he's queued up for today too bad for him we're doing a double show today so he's gonna hear
 about himself on two episodes well we'll thank technical scoop port twice how about that that's it
 holy shit a large black cat just walked past my back door and it just scared the shit out of me
 you don't have a black cat no i don't own any cats it should scare the shit out of you
 large animal he's coming for your coming for your puppies oh oh it just turned into a human
 it just turned into a human oh shit
 just turned to a goth looking human well we also found out he's leaving we have a we have a fire
 hydrant in our front yard and during because we had about three days of real heads up on this
 major storm coming through and so and doing her due diligence looking up different factoids and
 whatnot about preparation etc turns out we are responsible for keeping that fire hydrant
 under control so we're not going to be able to do anything we're not going to be able to do anything
 we're not going to be able to do anything we're not going to be able to do anything we're not going
 to be able to do anything we're not going to be able to do anything we're not going to be able to do
 anything we're not going to be able to do anything we're not going to be able to do anything we're
 not going to be able to do anything we're not going to be able to do anything we're not going to be
 able to do anything we're not going to be able to do anything we're not going to be able to do anything
 funny enough it's not really covered it's kind of clear that leads me to believe that that water
 line has some it's a big kind of heat it's a big metal fire hydrant right yes but it also i think
 it has must have some kind of heat source in that water line to keep that all warm you don't think
 it's moving though i guess that's it it's just flowing everyone knows that hot water puts out
 fire faster than cold water science it's just science it's just a big metal fire plug like
 that thing's gonna hold heat longer than stuff around it well nick newman is giving me the wave
 off uh that there is no heat under that that uh fire hydrant what are you gonna listen you're
 gonna listen to a fireman i guess i'm listening to a firefighter i don't know why nick gets all
 fucking crap around here i said it wasn't fucking he didn't listen to me
 he's a firefighter fireman shows up makes some chili it says it's not heated you go well i guess
 it's not heated i very quickly changed my opinion on the on the information of experts jacob
 something something i think more of us could learn i just was gonna say it's 2026 are you
 really gonna listen to a fireman tell you what how a fire hydrant works right what a dumbass
 you listening to the experts you want to do your own research why don't you vote
 you
 yeah uh get a glass of warm milk uh warm raw milk and uh spit at the house that puts it out
 did i talk did i talk about this i was at i had lunch when i was in uh when i was in uh burbank
 with my friend uh eli and uh his wife erica and she's a doctor yeah and uh she says all the time
 now she goes we're gonna you know we we think your child has you know blank and we're gonna
 and our plan to take care of them is to do blank blank blank blank blank blank blank blank blank
 and they go hold on hold on and they type whatever she's saying into like chat gbt oh they don't even
 already have an opinion i was already cringing because i thought the parent would already have
 an opinion but they have to look no they're not that informed oh that's even worse yeah they
 question they they go hold on before i tell you to proceed i have to look this up and figure out
 what this chat gbt tells me about what you just told me and whether or not i approve great of the
 doctor's plans this is why no one should be using chat gbt no one should be using
 any of this ai garbage it is a detriment to all of us uh absolutely i use it all the time
 but uh you shouldn't i don't use it to i am chat gpt i don't use it to question experts i don't
 use but you're feeding the beast baby you're feeding the beast just be careful i just tell
 chat gbt every day that paul mattingly loves you tell him whatever i want to get paul's i want to
 get paul's name into that chat gpt brain chat gpt can come to my house
 we'll have a real nice talk come to my house i fed that beast a long time ago uh i remember when it
 first happened i don't think i've told the story on air but i think it's been long enough i can
 the statute of limitations has run out yeah so i when it first came around it was fascinating and
 and and and and so i put every approved script of pen and teller fool us into chat gpt yeah
 and uh figure
 maybe it can help me write more scripts because one of the biggest challenges being a writer on
 that show was writing 80 versions of we'll be right back with more magic after this sure right
 write 80 versions of that every year try to put some cute jokes in it that kind of stuff
 yeah so i put it in there and then one season
 uh all of a sudden like the producers start experimenting with chat gpt to see if it was
 like worth doing and all of a sudden i got like this note that was like hey
 chat gpt stuff it's it's pretty good and i know i gave it all of our scripts like whatever but i
 didn't make that argument and then they were like uh we we'd switched from a 14 episode
 season to a 20 episode season yes right which means that i uh but you had longer to shoot it
 so that was fine but i got paid it was about money it was about whether i sure how much
 more am i getting my episode rate is there a flat rate like what's happening
 uh with it and they were dragging their heels uh i was the executive producer was not getting back
 to me and then they kept making jokes about chat gpt and replacing me with chat gpt
 so all of a sudden it was like three weeks before the season started yeah and i wrote a very uh uh
 formal note they hadn't hired paul back yet um and i wrote a
 very formal note being like hey if you don't want to fly paul back out uh i'd happily switch
 from being a writer to warm-up comic for this upcoming season ah
 um because clearly you got you guys don't know what's getting back to my contract i'm hearing
 jokes about replacing with chat gpt just make me the warm-up comic and let's call it a day
 and i wrote it to
 the one executive producer wasn't getting back to me i wrote to both executive producers and
 the showrunner good good this seems like a reasonable response
 because i was just getting pissed yeah i got the angriest voicemail i've ever gotten from
 the executive producer
 he cursed me the fuck out like read me the riot act like i know exactly what you're talking about
 where he's coming from
 because obviously when i did work the two other producers called the that executive producer who's
 in charge of signing the contracts and said what the fuck's going on with that right and so
 uh that was an awkward it was awkward backstage a couple times throughout that season it was
 a little frosty in the green room a few times uh that particular season of
 with that producer with his chat gpt for halloween that year matt felt like it was pointed a little
 bit at him uh yeah no i mean look you know yeah it is what it is uh i said that like my current
 opinion with uh ai and chat gpt is like we thought we were creating like this god of all knowledge
 right that we could consult and what we created
 was like a
 really eager fresh out of college assistant that's like who's just like wants to just supply you with
 everything sometimes they're right sometimes they're wrong but like they got your back
 right right they're just like uh here maybe maybe you want all this you're like uh maybe two of
 those things but thank you actually you said this but that's not even true what you wrote here i
 don't think you researched that properly this is just wrong this is entirely wrong yeah yeah so
 now that's how i look at that's how i look at chat gpt is is like it's a it's a really really
 wonderful thing to do and i think it's a really really really wonderful thing to do and i think
 wants the gig it's really going places but right now it's just fresh out of college and it's yeah
 and it's trying too hard boy do i like using it to uh to sort information i like putting a lot
 of information into it doing like make me a table that shows me all of that yeah yeah it works really
 well for that that's it for like clerical and like clinical things it's good you know for knowledge
 and like advice it's terrible oh and for like clinical things it's good you know for knowledge
 advice forget it and for humor it's abominable yeah right but for sexy dating chat go ahead
 let's go they'll tell you exactly what you want to hear
 i'll tell you exactly who loves a good sexy twitch chat not twitch chat chat gpt chat on twitch

 got a few more days to still kind of just literally chill out and I am well so so cold
 I am uh I'm looking for uh there we go I see Matt Daugherty in chat here he sent us a breakdown of
 our scoop fantasy football league uh here in review here oh good it's coming down to the wire
 I forgot oh no it's done it's all over it's all over yeah it's all over uh but uh let's see uh
 here's a wrap up of the
 2025 scoop fantasy football league in okay the upper league Jake Harrington team 185 lumberjacks
 took the championship over Mike Brosberg the manimal yeah uh Otto Eisenberg sweat house
 employees uh took third place over Matt Daugherty savory Matty D being relegated down to the lower
 league is Matthew Burdick Matt Matthew welcome to the lower league buddy I've been down here the
 whole time uh
 welcome we have free lemonade and I think you're gonna really like it here it's pretty cozy do not
 drink the lemonade it's not it has gone bad I will absolutely be here waiting for you when you get
 down here so no worries there uh and so is uh Troy Soto uh Troy Sato I don't say no how do Troy how
 do I have we ever said your last name correctly I don't know I say Sato Troy Sato yeah he's been
 well he's been obviously running helping run this league for the very beginning so
 yeah he's welcome to lower league buddy uh and the lower league Jacob Smith Matt what's that team
 Hasselbeck Matt Hassel back that ass up uh you won the championship in the lower league Jacob
 oh did I yes you did oh that's interesting this is the first I'm hearing of it uh you beat Paul
 Clayton whose team arsonist gets all the TDs uh he he you beat him
 but you'll both be moving up to the upper league next season buddy
 Jacob Smith everybody Jacob yeah no I'm in trouble next year I'm in trouble next year
 um also I guess I have to play next year I I guess after winning I'm I'm obligated to play
 another year I joined uh uh 12 magicians in another league and I won that league
 and just want you to know how much worse magicians are than scoops at fantasy football just so I'm
 sure
 that that tracks that definitely tracks uh yeah so uh Paul Clayton let's see in third place game
 Dave Peterson whose team Tyreek of alcohol beat Justin uh Jelinek from the fighting squirrels
 uh so yeah and that's it so if you want to join our league next year this year we were better we
 had like a Facebook group and the Facebook chat was a good place to interact and bust balls so
 we yeah good some fun trash talk we stepped it up this year uh uh for that was the only thing I was
 missing in the other years was there was no consolidated place for me to uh make fun of
 myself uh but this place was very it was very comforting this year I told SJ she was like did
 you win your fantasy football league I said well my my because she was asking about the the big one
 that I play every year yeah I said oh I got I got third place in that one but I won the uh the scoops
 one and she looked at me she was like you
 you played a fantasy football league with the listeners to your podcast and then you you won
 that's that's that's precisely what happened
 she goes did you organize this league I said I did not I did not yeah yeah yeah thankfully I
 at least did not put the thing together I just played at least the illusion of of arbitrary uh
 yeah yeah we had 22 uh 22
 people 22 people 22 teams we've room for 24 so if you want to get in touch with Matt Daugherty
 or Troy next year as we headed it we'll announce it as we head into it but they always we all pay
 to get in the league and then they give a big chunk of change right back to us as a donation
 for our our podcast which is very generous of them and they're wonderful thank you guys oh wait that
 means I won money for this too yeah I forgot about that technically yeah yeah so I took money from
 the scoops as well
 insult to injury over here I uh if you uh if you look over on the chat
 Leon has posted one of the winning t-shirts from the t-fury battle uh which is no ai that was my
 illustration of a duck and then uh people put cavernous butthole under it and you can order
 that through t-fury
 great I think the cavernous butthole ducks would be a great
 uh team to add to the football fantasy football league for next year
 my team name this year was I say horse you say beans so maybe next year I'll change it
 go with cavernous butthole cavernous butthole the cavernous buttholes yeah the fighting cavernous
 buttholes yeah so I I was uh 18th out of 22 players which is pretty good hey look at you
 holding your own pretty good pretty good you're a regular Kansas City chief over here 22 you're a
 regular Dallas Cowboy I'm in the lower league right so those those they're automatically above
 me oh they're all just all okay yeah they're automatically above me who's even in the Super
 Bowl has it happened already do we know it did happen Paul breaking news because this airs
 Thursday who won uh the Patriots with a decisive victory over backup quarterback Stitham
 won 10 to 7 so they're coming into a Super Bowl with a lot of heat that's it
 a lot of heat 10 to 7 did you did you watch that game at all I did because I'm on tour with Eric
 Dillman who's in New England there oh sure sure and we were snowed in right which I haven't got
 that story yet but we we we were we were uh I I'm uh I am in the snowed in hotel uh in Bloomington
 Indiana and so we trudged through the snow to the upstairs bar uh here in town and it was packed
 because it's a snow day sure uh and we watched what should have been an awesome day watching
 football and instead was one of the most boring actually one of the most poorly kicked games I've
 ever seen was it one of those games where it was all field goals no it was all missed field goals
 oh no and all botched punts like right and so that changed the outcome of the whole thing huh
 yeah it was it was it got snowy and super windy like the game started and it was a clear beautiful
 sunny day in Denver oh and then like a blizzard rolled in like third quarter it was clear and
 fine by the fourth quarter you couldn't see your hand in front of your face well that was crazy
 that was the weirdest thing on uh Thursday I guess it was out here Thursday was like spring it was
 weird we were like what the fuck is going on it was sunshine beautiful still snow on the ground
 but just gorgeous and then turned on a dime weather-wise yeah and then well then and the
 Rams in Seattle played probably the best game I don't think the Super Bowl is going to be better
 than that game no I don't think so I think that was it that was a really good game came down to
 really like crazy weird mistakes and yeah like it was a real battle
 yeah it was fun that was a great game uh Gelato Steve in the chat I haven't seen Gelato Steve in a
 minute he says go Pats yeah I mean it is uh it's it's going to be it's it's funny that like both
 teams will be an underdog story if the Patriots win it'll be crazy for a team that had four wins
 last year to take a second year quarterback and win this early would be bananas right and Sam
 Darnold has literally been shipped off by two teams and if he wins as the Seattle quarterback
 it'll be a crazy story for him to win if Sam Darnold wins as the Seattle quarterback
 the Jets should have to go to the SEC
 because if he wins as the Seattle quarterback that means the Jets are so much worse as an
 organization than we ever even thought they were actually no I'm reconsidering we don't want them
 in the SEC I was just gonna say I think every Jet fan I know would take that deal yeah I think
 every different I'm thinking about what LSU is doing I'm thinking about what LSU is doing I'm
 thinking about what LSU is doing I'm thinking about what LSU is doing right now LSU is definitely
 running its team better than uh the New York Jets I would Vinnie Grasso's a huge Jets fan I was like
 I bet he'd be like yeah yeah let's do that for them let's do that for a few years let's see how
 we can handle the Tennessee volunteers for a while go down there I'll tell you who else can
 handle a bunch of volunteers and that's the following sponsor today's show Matt and Manley's

 in Toronto you went with the the h yeah I went with the wrong one the one that describes how the
 the uh atmosphere is doing rather than you know oh oh you went the other way no I went the wrong
 way yeah so I still can't even get it right when you're correcting me I don't even know I just I
 that's that's a that's an Achilles heel uh for me that one but also it's a blind spot I think in the
 future it will be an advantage for me to have my spelling errors uh riddled throughout my writings
 as it will be indicative of my non-chat GPT infused work so people go oh yeah there's
 Mattingly trying to spell again he clearly wrote this without any fucking help obviously from him
 is obviously him with his no no ability to spell yeah uh you guys want to do a little scoop mail
 yes a little scoop mail I would love it
 let's see uh oh we're starting off with uh with a heavy one today we're starting off with one from
 the OG Scoop uh he's in the chat with us as well but he wrote this a while ago hey guys I wanted
 to reach out and just say thanks uh to you guys and all the Scoop community in early October I
 lost my brother at the young age of 56 sadly he had suffered from mental illness and addiction
 for most of his life and was homeless when he passed uh he was in my town uh living in section
 eight housing for the past few years but
 drifted to Florida and ultimately ultimately to Las Vegas in August coincidentally he was in
 Vegas during Scoop Fest because of ICS and the Scoops I consider Vegas a treasure at home away
 from home and the fact that he passed in that area near Scoop family gave me some peace in all
 of the sorrow and issues that arose concerning his arrangements I just wanted to remind you uh
 that you guys and the Scoops have brought me laughter joy and friendship and it doesn't go
 unnoticed thanks again for all the love and support love you all even you you know who you are
 that's Andy the OG Scoop Andy uh so sorry pal yeah man yeah that's tough and then the whole
 scenario that you brought up that seems really tough I don't know how I would deal with uh yeah
 with it with a situation like that that's really and I know there was an issue uh I know Andy had
 uh had you know just all of the the the stuff that goes along with that you know
 transporting the remains back and doing doing all of that stuff right uh you know it it
 makes a lot of it makes a lot of work and uh it sucks yeah yeah it's it's incredibly difficult
 you have to almost delay your grief and put on your professional hat yeah I remember Anne having
 to go through a lot of that shit when her father passed and she really had to kind of postpone her
 feelings for a while to get everything else lined up properly um it's hard it's incredibly hard to
 be responsible I can't imagine being in Las Vegas and being like my brother is unhoused somewhere
 around here that's a really weird thing to deal with it's a hard thing to have to deal with yeah
 I don't think there was crossover I don't I don't think Andy was in town while his brother was here
 because Andy didn't make the the most recent Scoop Fest but his brother was in town during
 the most recent Scoop Fest gotcha yeah yep no it sucks but the uh the the Scoop community
 of course is always fantastic and uh and that's uh you know part of what OG was was trying to say
 that is something that's always worth compliment rescinded nope oh never mind never mind I tried
 I tried everybody you heard me you heard me try shit rejected I will not take it we got one here
 from poutine scoop hello fuckers what was your first clue that you guys liked music as a kid
 I don't mean uh bus dumping bands while on the island music but the first time you knew for me
 it was Alanis Morissette I didn't get you uh
 I didn't get you you ought to know oh that must be what that's supposed to be autocorrect uh had a
 field day with this email sorry uh I didn't get you ought to know as a teenager but when hand in
 my pocket came out as a single I had to get my first cd and radio what was it for you poutine
 scoop poutine scoop I know that my first cd that I bought when cds come out came out was uh
 razor's edge the classic acdc album razor's edge and I stand by that purchase I stand by that
 I you know I've always been embarrassed about my musical tastes and uh I've always been
 self-conscious about that even like I shared a room with my brother Rob and when we did homework
 together I would default to his taste in music uh he he played the music in the room that we did
 homework too uh like I I was still buying just like springsteen and billy joel stuff
 I was gonna say having watched that springsteen documentary I think you're uh I think your
 embarrassment is justified fully justified the movie the movie you said doc right but the movie
 the movie's bad but the documentary is good um oh I haven't seen the documentary uh it's on hulu but
 uh he was playing like dylan he was playing old school rem he
 right
 he was playing like cool stuff and then I was always just aping whatever my brother older
 brothers were into so yeah I I would say I my first cd purchase I literally was like what's
 the greatest selling cd at the time was pig fight pig fight dark side of the moon oh all right
 um I would actually probably say it was when when uh post island time
 I think like uh when steve and I uh did reduce and I moved to san diego as our as our as our less
 interesting and less fruitful sequel uh we had a roommate mikey there and he got me into all
 kinds of cool bands I really got into tom waits at that time uh yeah it was just a bunch of cool
 bands came out of that and that really kind of shaped the way I listen to music I swear to god
 that I don't think I like I'm curious how I listened to music before I took acid once once I
 took acid I heard music differently the rest of my life huh and I can you describe that well yeah
 I don't I was just a melody person I was into whatever the catch was you weren't listening to
 lyrics and then all of a sudden I took acid no I still to this day I'm still not a good lyric
 person but I love arrangements instrumentation like how far where's the
 bass of the mix like versus like where's the drums like where the keyboard and I get fascinated
 by arrangements and sounds and quality of sounds and and types of sounds and and I like all of that
 stuff in music now and that did not happen until I took lsd okay and I don't know matt I didn't even
 do that often you know I mean like I can count on my hand how many times I've done it but it just
 changed the way I heard music forever I think you really need to much how I listen to music
 I think you need to spend some time with nine inch nails the fragile I think that
 album will uh I bet I would go back and really appreciate it I think you would because that
 that's a double album and it is just layers and layers and layers a lot of shit yeah I mean I
 definitely listen to music in a very similar way I definitely listen to it uh I'm listening to like
 the structure of it I'm I'm listening to like interesting uh side melodies and harmonies and
 all uh and yeah I'm bad about listening to lyrics as well yeah I remember like like going to
 Beyonce's album and like hearing she puts hints of her other songs in other songs and she's like
 following those threads and stuff and the patterns and yeah I like all that stuff now
 uh but I'm still self-conscious you remember years ago when 50 shades closed I was an uber
 driver for two weeks oh yeah and the thought of putting on my own music when someone else got into
 a car stranger was like good lord like that was the most stressful thing to me was what to have
 on the speakers when someone entered my vehicle yeah my brother and I were very lucky
 as kids for a little while while we were going to St. Mark's uh mom and dad couldn't pick us up
 after school we had a babysitter for a couple months and she would come and get us and she was
 a cool college student and she was jamming to the Violent Films she had that oh solid car the whole
 time um and that first Violent Films album it was fresh it was brand new then and John and I
 listened to that a lot that was her jam and so we both got to that John even more than me
 like he's seen them in concert a couple more times than I have he's a big Violent Films head
 and then we just got into you know a little more alternative stuff you know he went Depeche Mode
 Tom Waits I went um they might be Giants and Body Count so you know we both had our things
 uh we listened to all kind of crazy shit but that's the thing both of us very diverse musical
 tastes does there was a great time and there was a great time and there was a great time and there
 like I'm on uh I'm on a tour right now and we're sharing a Sprinter van yeah and we were doing a
 late night drive and all of a sudden it was like we should put on some music and I was like I'm in
 I'm in the front seat you know and I was like you have you have control you couldn't do it I was
 like and I literally was like what is everybody like like I was like I'm not gonna lead the
 charge I will not lead the charge on this I will not do it I was too scared I yeah I was like I
 don't think this whole place is gonna jam out to the Avett brothers I don't think that's gonna happen
 you never know
 just gotta go for it Southside Johnny baby I say the other fails the other part of of John and I's
 music and I think I don't know if this applies to you or Jacob Jacob probably you but we were
 in a region coming up through college and whatnot that got a lot of bands tons of bands come through
 Ohio and Louisville they just there's just a touring circuit through there with venues that
 are older venues that can house you know three hundred to a thousand people for level bands
 coming up
 and at that time you could go see a concert for 15 20 bucks you know yeah so got to see all kind
 of shit coming up in college I don't I don't guess that's really an option for a lot of college
 students today I don't know I got to see this is a weird random one I got to see Vanilla Ice on one
 of his first concerts that he did when he switched over to like thrash metal oh yeah when he first
 came out of rap
 oh right yes like Vanilla Ice or Ice Ice Baby would it might have even still been on the charts
 when he was doing this and he was doing like scream thrash metal versions of all of his rap
 songs crazy it was crazy it was at a place called the Bait Shack in Louisiana and yeah it was like
 this is insane I remember going up to Ohio with John uh one time we went to see Alanis Morissette
 right before she blew up uh we saw her on her Jagged Little Pill tour right before everything
 really got huge like I said we probably saw her for 20 bucks and uh Tyler uh what's his name
 the Foo Fighters drummer was with her at that point oh um that was one of his early gigs the
 guy who just passed away sadly yeah yeah Tyler Hawkins thank you Hawkins that's it all I could
 think of was Horton thank you uh Scoop Chat so yeah and it was just uh you know it was just a lot of
 you know yeah it's cool and I also got to see Gwar at that same spot I saw Gwar twice in the same
 weekend I saw him in Louisville and then saw him again in Cincinnati oh by the way Gwar's uh cover
 of Pink Pony Club is so good right it's just spectacular it's just if you haven't seen Gwar
 cover uh Pony Club then do yourself a favor pour one out for odorous also there was a really good
 there was a really good rock uh radio station in my hometown growing up so I could I could pull
 that up and they they always had really good songs they played some really good songs and
 they played some fucking bangers on there and uh yeah it was like I don't know what the number was
 it's like 106 or something like that uh but yeah that was that was probably the most that was most
 of my music growing up because like we had cassette tapes and all but like I wasn't going
 out and buying them I didn't have we didn't have cassette tape money not all that I was just
 looking at my library to see like what what what are my top like what not
 not my top my most recent uh ones I F1 soundtrack I really liked it uh great uh Springsteen Arctic
 Monkeys Jesse Wells Brandi Carlile Jesse Wells that's good Jesse Wells is killing it yeah um
 uh Noah Cyrus uh Irish band called Seal another Irish band called the High Stool Prophets that
 was obviously inspired from Scoop Fest uh yeah yeah more Irish music in my life
 two skinny J's Lena Hall uh Imagine Dragons Avett Brothers Brandi Carlile again what we got
 Postal Service yeah what's the skinny with uh Pine of Plain they uh they still out and about
 they're there's now they're going out two out of three at a time and rotating between the three
 of them because this cruise ship uh changed their policies about hosting trios because of the amount
 of cabin space it takes
 up oh for fuck's sake yeah well there's only one solution one of they have to pair up somebody has
 to pair up right yeah yeah yeah there's only one solution they have to become one of those things
 like they have to attach each other's mouths to their assholes become one of those things
 so they can go on tour together the only thing that they can do hey guys it's Matt Vian and Phil
 start fucking quick
 uh let's see what have I listened to lately oh yesterday I was listening to uh victory lap uh
 Nipsey Hussle album oh I forget what triggered Nipsey Hussle in my head but boy was that album
 fucking great uh gone too soon oh and then and then randomly uh boy talk about two sides of a
 different coin here uh randomly last night I was listening to one more from the road which is a live
 Lynyrd Skynyrd uh concert from the 70s wow so that's my two most recent is Nipsey Hussle and
 Lynyrd Skynyrd wow so I guess nobody living I suppose now that I'm thinking about it as well
 nobody living nobody living oh let's see we got one here from hey scoop get off my lawn hey guys
 exciting news for Christmas my wife bought us tickets for Matt's show in Lexington next week
 oh hell yeah that I don't think it's next week anymore right it happened it means I saw you it
 means you came and we hung out yes I kept talking about it and she had to pretend it would be awful
 to see Matt for a third time just so I wouldn't think that she didn't want to go or just so I
 would think she didn't want to go
 uh boy is she right now the real question is will you do Battle of Dreams again I'm convinced and
 possibly wrong about how the trick works so I'll be watching carefully the last time you did it you
 kept my wife's dream and put it away for later still waiting to know why see you soon Matt and
 here's an obelisk I did a while back for you guys enjoy hey Scoop get off my lawn uh quickly before
 you get to that game uh yes no Battle of Dreams was cut from this show uh that was a fooler's run
 and the jokers uh they did not want it in the show um uh I don't do that trick as often as I used to
 just because I haven't ever been performing in an environment where I have I tried to do it on
 cruise ships and what happened was I found that the staff would not get all the papers out to
 everybody but they would get out to like 20 or 30 people and it made it feel more exclusive than
 exclusive uh with people in the audience there people were upset that they didn't get to do it
 yeah and it's also part of the prover that anybody can do it that's it anybody can participate yeah
 so sometimes people don't even have the papers like what the hell do I care yeah I actually want
 to change the so right now Penn and Teller are doing it in their show and they have made it much
 more sophisticated is it going well and it's going very well and Penn has really made it his own and
 he invented the trick and performed the trick saw the latest version of Penn and Tellers and said I'm
 not going to do it anymore you guys are doing such a better job with oh wow I did and so he said I'm
 going to stop performing it um are they back at it you should have you should have started by saying
 that you should have started by being like I'm not doing it in my show anymore because Penn and
 Teller are doing it so well well so hondro and I have decided not to for now I didn't really like
 that we were all doing it and like we would also all three of us would kind of like talk about
 different things we've learned from different versions of doing it
 anything that part was awesome you know to feel like I'm included in the group with hondro and Penn
 and uh I actually want to change the trick for myself now uh because of doing crowd work off
 people's dreams uh versus like I basically I'm trying to like figure out a trick that could
 I could cut into more social media friendly things right uh and put it earlier in the show not make
 it like a finale piece
 uh I'm thinking about asking people for fun facts about them or someone in their family
 as a go-to ask instead of asking people to come up with a crazy dream
 I think I want to get like hardcore some kind of fun fact about oh yeah fun fact about somebody
 that you're there with that's a that's a fun that's a fun ask yeah and I think that and so
 uh but right now I'm doing the Joker's tour so there's no room for new material I pitched it
 right I said no and um uh uh I pitched it
 I said not funny enough so we moved on and I have a bunch of cruise work coming up and then lately
 I've been doing more corporates I don't think it's the kind of trick I want to do for corporates yeah
 right I want to like put it in a live environment first to feel what it really is before I figure
 out what the corporate version is um so I'm trying to figure out when the hell I can add
 new to my show but the first time the first opportunity I get I'm adding that to to the
 to the routine oh yeah um because it was finishing with a physical production of the dream uh right uh
 because it was finishing with a physical production of the dream uh because it was finishing with a physical production of the dream uh
 when I was touring and uh especially for my show a production is a big deal uh because I'm a one-man
 operation uh and I think I have a fun thing for that I think I have a fun way to finish the trick
 out so uh we'll see and you got that um and you got that prop that I sent you for your new finale
 spot too Jacob sent me I ran across a sale it was a sale on like Facebook Marketplace yes for like a
 giant fire cage like a disappearing so you go inside set yourself on fire and disappear right
 yeah the best thing about Las Vegas is people selling magic props on Facebook Marketplace
 well I I gave away uh uh my levitation uh rig all right on Facebook Marketplace
 and and and we're interacting and the person who did it is actually a performer here in town
 she showed up right so we're interacting
 and all of a sudden a woman pulls up in a truck and I was like oh I didn't know the person I was
 interacting with was a woman and then it's that thing of like oh God we're meeting over Facebook
 Marketplace how do I not be creepy but then the thought of that makes me automatically creepy
 right plus you were saying all of this out loud you were thinking out loud oh God a girl
 and I just dropped my pants down to my ankles
 and I I basically was like hi wife wife wife my wife your wife my wife my wife wife my wife my kids I
 have wife and kids we are not this is not weird um but we ended up becoming uh we actually ended
 up becoming Instagram friends and now I'm gonna see the rig in action uh I think uh in April oh
 yes um which would be great because I never put it into my show but uh yeah so and now it'll
 be in Jim Kramer's show yeah yeah but Lexington so a bunch of scoops came out to Lexington and
 obviously obviously like not keeping that fresh in my mind that we did a turnout here but yes oh
 yeah scoop John B Mike wins Nicholas Newman his lovely wife uh so many scoops came out I was
 giving out the chips Paul you'd be proud of me I was giving I am I'm very proud of you for giving

 oh yeah uh this state is ranked fourth in the U.S uh in happiness in recent studies fourth the fourth
 happiest so fourth happiest overall I guess probably Nevada because there's nobody living
 there comparatively yeah like Nevada's population is pretty low right oh no we have a lot of self
 esteem down here in Nevada we do uh I feel like Louisiana is not happy I feel like it's filled
 with not happy people especially right now they're all snowed in and iced in
