 And who knows? The life you save. The fade out button didn't work.

24
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:17,280
 That was the stop button? To be fair, I suppose the fade out button might work. I haven't tested it,

25
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,600
 but the stop button works effectively. Okay, good. Yeah. All right. The stop button works

26
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,960
 just fine. I literally was like, wait, do you have to start over? Like, what's happening?

27
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,240
 No, no, no. See, Matt, I'm covering it with all of this. See, nobody even noticed it

28
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,000
 because I covered the lack of a music fade with this clever banter.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,680
 Hey, Johnny. Do you want to go to an ice cream social? Yeah, I'd love to. Great. Let's go.

30
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,400
 I'm so excited, guys. We're broadcasting from Core Sensors in Morristown, New Jersey.

31
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,680
 I'm in a conference room.

32
00:02:51,680 --> 00:03:02,800
 Yo, very nice cabin. Yeah. It's time for Matt and Natalie's ice cream social.

33
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,800
 Sitting in Jersey, it's Matt Godley. Sitting in Pittsburgh, it's Paul Mattingly.

34
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,920
 Sitting in Vegas, it's me, making the audio guide. We're preaching fun.

35
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,640
 That's where you're wrong. I don't know if I can break a computer.

36
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,200
 I couldn't see. What's in there? Pressure sensors and pressure transducers.

37
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,880
 That's what's on display. That's what's sold. That's what's made and sold here.

38
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,680
 Do you have an end with the pressure sensor and transducer mafia?

39
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,880
 I do. What's going on?

40
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,560
 It's true. Who's your hookup?

41
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,400
 I've been connected to the pressure transducer industry for quite some time.

42
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,760
 Is it true? Yes.

43
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,200
 Who's your pressure transducer pimp? Who's your pressure transducer guy, Matt?

44
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,680
 One of my original roommates in my party house of Fort LaForge, my buddy Sam.

45
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,880
 So the ones that are on display last week when I was like,

46
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,280
 I need new pressure transducers. Where were you then?

47
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,720
 I don't want you to take it up my supply.

48
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,920
 The ones that I'm seeing in that cabinet, are those on display as check out the hotness

49
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,360
 or are they our vaunted history? What is this? What am I seeing?

50
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,760
 I don't even know. I wasn't given a free samples.

51
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,120
 I was because here's the thing. So my buddy, Sammy, it's his company.

52
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:22,960
 I am staying at his house. His office is closer to my magic show that I have to literally,

53
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,760
 as soon as we wrap, I'm leaving and going to do two magic shows.

54
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,400
 And he said, and the internet's stronger here.

55
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,280
 So let's just sit up in my conference room. What a nice guy.

56
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,120
 Yes. He's a very nice guy. And so, yeah, I did not get the two penny tour though.

57
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,480
 So I'm very curious myself as to what is on display on these shelves as well.

58
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,760
 And I assume when you leave, you will be given several pressure transducers.

59
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,160
 Oh yeah. I got to bring the kids home something.

60
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,280
 Does he end every sales call? Does he end every sales call with no pressure?

61
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,320
 No, no, no, no. Good, good.

62
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,880
 Cause that would be the end of his business. He did tell me something.

63
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,280
 So he gets, you know, it was a business. I mean, it's cold called all the time. It's fan called.

64
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,200
 Sure. He found out if I should betray this or not.

65
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:26,000
 Here we go. Getting the fucking pressure sensor to y'all.

66
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,160
 Pressure. Pressure sensor talk, talk and pressure sensor, sensor pressure.

67
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,320
 Pressure sensor. It's our new segment on the show.

68
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:51,760
 If you're spam called by someone in India, there's a term you can use an insult in India

69
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:59,360
 that basically makes people break script and either curse you out or hang up on the spot.

70
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,960
 Wow. No. Yes.

71
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,280
 There's a magic super curse that we could be using this whole time.

72
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,880
 Yes. And it basically translates to, uh, uh, basically sister fucker. Like you're, you're,

73
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,280
 you're, you, you, you, you fuck your sister. Um, it's a good one.

74
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,160
 So we're, we're implying that they have more fun than they're comfortable having is what you're

75
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,640
 saying. It's pronounced, you know, Ben shot. That's how you pronounce. That's, that's the term.

76
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,920
 So right now exactly. We just got, we apologize to our Indian listeners right

77
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,840
 now who are screaming into their phones. And, uh, he indeed proved it to me.

78
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:48,480
 He took a spam call while we're having breakfast and it was someone trying to, to buy his home.

79
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,800
 And they said how much? And he goes, uh, about 140, 150 Ben shots.

80
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,760
 And the person hung up the phone immediately.

81
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,720
 Hilarious. 150 Ben shots.

82
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,440
 This is one of those terrible things because on one hand I feel it's, it's a little punching

83
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,280
 down because the person running the phone isn't the asshole who's doing all of them.

84
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,680
 But they are the one actively doing it. So it's, yeah, I don't know. I do like it though. I like

85
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,440
 having a magic word solution. Nobody gets hurt. I've been, I've been getting a lot of phone calls

86
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,160
 lately from, uh, numbers that I don't have saved. So I've been answering unknown numbers when they're,

87
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,800
 when they're popping up and, uh, yeah, so I've been getting hit with a couple of good spams lately.

88
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,120
 And, uh, I'm glad to have a code. I really couldn't believe it.

89
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,440
 Yeah. When I saw it in action, I was like, oh my gosh, you have seen in the chat with a T it's

90
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:57,200
 with the D shot. Uh, yeah, yeah. Uh, which, which part of it is, is it a direct translation?

91
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:03,760
 The shod be like fucker. I mean, I think like it's like a, to a degree, like the ultimate degree,

92
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,080
 right? Okay. Like, I know like, like in Italian, you can say like Blanco or like,

93
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,840
 you know, uh, whatever that means white, but if you say like Blunky Sumo, it means like the most

94
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:20,480
 whitest white. Uh, I said that to somebody, I was joking with an Italian where I was talking

95
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,280
 about whether I was good at basketball, like my brother. And I said, I was, uh, not only Blanco,

96
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,640
 but Blunky Sumo. I was the most white and it made him laugh really hard. Um,

97
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:40,160
 it's weird that basketball is the place where we get to talk about race with the, uh, the least

98
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:49,920
 amount of concern, right? No. Yeah. It's really kind of nice. I was, you know, hanging out on the

99
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:58,480
 ship. I just got off yesterday. Uh, and one of the, uh, one of the, the artists was, uh, he was,

100
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,920
 he was from Israel. He lives in, you know, the United States currently, but it was from Israel.

101
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:12,240
 And, uh, we were out with, uh, a black comedian, uh, it's great comedian named Orlando Baxter.

102
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,600
 Okay. And I already had some like weird conversations with my

103
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,520
 Israeli friend as he would drift into certain politics from time to time.

104
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:28,960
 Oh, he had, he had interesting views that you didn't necessarily find incredibly comfortable

105
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:37,600
 to talk about. Yes. Oh, okay. Okay. Interesting. And somehow the topic came over to the Cosby show

106
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:47,760
 and then the fact that, uh, uh, Malcolm Jamal Warner had died recently.

107
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:55,600
 Oh, that's right. Yeah. He had died, uh, uh, drowning and swimming. Yeah. Yeah.

108
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,640
 Trying to save his daughter. Did he, did his daughter live? I don't know. I, I believe so.

109
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:09,280
 Okay. I'll find out. And this person then made a joke about black people and swimming

110
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:14,640
 and I excused myself from the table and went to the bathroom. Oh dear. Oh my.

111
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,560
 Because you were laughing so hard, you were.

112
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,360
 Oh, God damn it. God damn it. What the fuck is wrong with people?

113
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:36,000
 And then, uh, he brings up that, uh, Orlando brings up that his wife is indeed a chemist,

114
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,840
 uh, from Harvard. And then, uh, uh, my mentalist friend then brought up

115
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:47,440
 that, uh, Harvard was supporting, uh, genocide in Sudan and that he should be mad at Harvard.

116
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,440
 And then Matt had to excuse himself again because he was laughing hysterically again.

117
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,920
 Why, why, who, who taught you that this is the way to have conversation?

118
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:08,400
 All right. This was so similar. My, my mom used to teach when, when my mom, uh, was a college

119
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,280
 professor, she would, uh, teach all of these international students. Yeah. And it was not

120
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:20,080
 uncommon around the holidays for, uh, uh, an international student or eight to show up at

121
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,080
 the house for, uh, the big, big holiday meal because, you know, she would invite them over

122
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,760
 because they didn't have a family or whatever in the area to go spend the holidays with.

123
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:34,800
 And, uh, there was this cat one time I never saw him again, never had never met him before,

124
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,920
 uh, but he was just an Israeli student of my mom's. And I remember his, because he, you know,

125
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,800
 he was Israeli. He w he had been in the Israeli military before, uh, coming over to the U S to,

126
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:52,160
 to go to college. And, uh, he, his job in the Israeli military had been peel potatoes. He had

127
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,800
 worked as a cook. And so he was like, I peel thousands of potatoes a day. Uh, let me peel

128
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:05,280
 the potatoes for dinner. I can peel them instantly. And he could, uh, we gave him a potato peeler at

129
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:10,080
 first and he was like, I don't know how to use a potato peeler. I just need a knife. And so I got

130
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,800
 him a, got him like a little paring knife and he peeled enough potatoes for like, there were

131
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,040
 probably 20 of us at the house that day. He peeled enough potatoes for everyone in like a

132
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,360
 minute and a half. It was incredible to watch. That's awesome. But I was over there. I was,

133
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,000
 I was probably, you know, in junior high, maybe, maybe young high school or something like that.

134
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,360
 And I was over there and he was telling me about, uh, like Israeli military and, uh, telling me

135
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,880
 jokes about Israeli military or jokes that they would tell each other in the Israeli military.

136
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,240
 And, uh, yeah, as a young teenager, I was like, I need to not be in this conversation. This guy is

137
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,880
 saying things that I am not. Like he's, this is his thing. I'm going to, I'm going to go piss

138
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,320
 myself in the bathroom. He has forgotten the first rule. The potatoes have eyes. That's right. You

139
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:05,840
 can't just go around behaving however you want around the spuds. Yes. Uh, Malcolm Jamal's, uh,

140
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:11,280
 Warner's, uh, daughter was saved. She was saved by a surfer. So yeah, she was, she was, uh, okay.

141
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,480
 Cowabunga, dude. Yeah. What happened to Theo? No way.

142
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:26,160
 Gnarly. Uh, Matt, were there any jokes you wanted to repeat about, uh, Theo Huxtable drowning?

143
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,720
 No, no, no. Oh, interesting. Okay. No, I didn't, I didn't think of any in the bathroom when I

144
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,920
 walked away. I didn't think of any. I just saw a preview for something last night with Malcolm

145
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:43,520
 Jamal Warner in it. And I was like, Oh no. Yeah. Yeah. Was it the ocean? I know. That was what it

146
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:52,400
 was. It was Davy Jones locker. I, uh, yeah, no, no, it wasn't, that wasn't even the only awkward

147
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:58,080
 conversations that I'll bet. I'll bet. I'll bet. Even the most awkward conversation. You know,

148
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,600
 if I gave a damn enough to want to talk to people, I'm sure I'd have a lot of

149
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,440
 awkward conversation. Right. Right. I don't push myself. You're, you're, uh, you're a bold man.

150
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:14,000
 Also, you're stuck on a boat. It happens on boats. Yeah. You can't, you can't, you know, we, we all

151
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,720
 have to like, what am I gonna do? Like, you know, get irate and then spend the last three days giving

152
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:25,760
 someone the silent treatment for the ship. And you're going to see them every five minutes.

153
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:32,320
 Exactly. You're playing pinball with people on the ships. Yeah. Yeah. No, no. Oh, speaking of awkward

154
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,000
 conversations, I forgot to talk about this one. I went out with, uh, uh, uh, Rondell Sheridan when

155
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,360
 we went, we went out and so we went to a little bar after the comedy club and the bar, all the

156
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,280
 staff want to take pictures of Rondell. We get back out of the street and, uh, the four of us are

157
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:55,760
 waiting for an Uber and there was a gentleman like 10 feet off of our conversation who just sees us

158
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:06,160
 joking around. Oh, decides to insert himself and he was into his cups. Oh, yes. Oh dear. He was,

159
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,400
 he was like, you met the mayor. He was, I met the mayor. He literally, and he literally just

160
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:19,120
 like stumbled towards us. He had like this big maroon UMass sweatshirt on over like shorts.

161
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:26,880
 And then, and, uh, and he had like a perfect like movie for my first mustache, like 22 years old,

162
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:33,600
 my first bushy mustache, like mustache, uh, that looked like it was like put on by like a costume

163
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,440
 person and not like, like it wasn't, didn't belong on him. And, and he literally like,

164
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,160
 like while wobbling, smiles ear to ear and goes like, can I get in on this?

165
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:58,960
 Damn it. That person is a hero. Damn it. Damn it. What the hell? Can I get in on this?

166
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,600
 Y'all having a good time? Let me get in on this good time. Oh my God. You look like a bunch of

167
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,800
 good time fellas. Let me get in on this. Good Lord. Can I get in on this? And then like, we just

168
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,480
 like, I hear that, but my, my two friends were still talking like, just keep talking, you know?

169
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:21,440
 Yeah. And, uh, uh, and he's like, and he's just like leaning in and going, uh, yeah.

170
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:30,080
 Seamless transition. Like, like as if he's like camouflaging into a party or something,

171
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:39,840
 but like, it's just the four of us. This is great. And the other three are like,

172
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,640
 just like including Randall are just like, not like looking at me, like I am not engaging this

173
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:50,240
 man. Right. But he like is not going to, because they don't want to live and he is staying like

174
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,000
 two-dimensionally confident. Like he is just still doing like listening, like eyebrows and

175
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,360
 listening ears. And like, he's, he literally puts like an arm up, like a teapot, like a teapot.

176
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:08,720
 I am in this conversation. This is a conversation that I'm going to be a part of.

177
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,920
 Finally, just go like, all right, I'll, I'm going to jump on this grenade. I'll isolate.

178
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,960
 And I just, I just square to him and I go like, you doing all right, pal? You having a good night?

179
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,280
 And he's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You guys seem like a lot of fun. You guys,

180
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,160
 you guys like comedy? I like comedy. You guys like comedy? And I was like,

181
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:32,240
 I can't tell whether he is or isn't making out Randall Sheridan or not. Do you know why is this

182
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:40,800
 happening? As much as I have involved my life with the comedic arts. Yeah. I have never, ever

183
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:49,760
 initiated a conversation or even said the words. I am into comedy. You know what I mean? Like I've

184
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:59,120
 never, I've never said that. I don't think I'm into comedy. No, no. It's, it's, it's in the same,

185
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:05,200
 it's in the same category as people who criticize jokes right after saying that they really like to

186
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,600
 laugh. You know, I love to laugh, but you know, this joke just really pushed me in the wrong

187
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:16,560
 direction. You know, it's, it's that, it's that same family. So my buddy, I'm really into comedy.

188
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:23,920
 My buddy, uh, Tom noting that I, I, I, I stepped in it, decides to just push me further in. And he

189
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:30,320
 goes, Oh, if you like comedy podcasts, he knows a bunch of people do comedy podcasts. Oh, I mean,

190
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:37,920
 this is a guy to chip. If there was ever a guy to chip, this is a guy. Get him listening. Uh,

191
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,200
 and then I did probably one of the most obnoxious things I've ever done.

192
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,200
 He keeps bringing up famous people that he likes that are funny from the improv comedy world.

193
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,680
 Good. Do you remember any of his examples? I'm not going to say examples. I'm going to

194
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,880
 tell you what I did. Oh, okay. Okay. I got out my phone and showed that that person was someone I

195
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,440
 could call and then said, but we're not going to call them. And I would close my contact.

196
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,520
 And he brought up someone else to go, Oh, sure. Yep. We can call that person too, but we're not

197
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,240
 going to, you and I are not going to call that person right now. That's a good asshole move.

198
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,360
 That's a hell of a move. I just kept showing them all these people I knew from the UCB theater from

199
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,000
 back in the day. Cause that's what we liked from like the comedy bang bang and other kind of podcast

200
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:33,280
 space. And he literally was like, whoa, whoa. He was like flipping. There's no way this could be

201
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:39,280
 faked. Exactly. Exactly. There's no way somebody can have these names stored in their phone without

202
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:45,440
 their, without the correct numbers. Good point. Good point. I could have just been like, sure,

203
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:57,680
 Alec Baldwin here, you know, whatever. Isn't this amazing? I'm just thinking this says Alec Baldwin.

204
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:06,320
 Wow. We're here now. We're here now for phone. We are fully here now for phone. Right? If I'd done

205
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:15,520
 this 30 years ago, people would have thought I was insane. This means phone. Yeah. Oh, you're talking

206
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:21,120
 about the gesture that I'm holding a brick. My creepy claw hand means phone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

207
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,560
 Matt's just holding up his hand to the camera like he's holding a phone. Yeah. We don't do hang loose.

208
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:33,120
 No, we don't do that anymore. No, we don't even do hold like a thing, like a receiver type. We do

209
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,600
 claw hand. But we still do the, we still do the crank thing for a car window.

210
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:44,640
 We do somewhat. We do somewhat. Well, I will, I will say that, uh, and of course we still have

211
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,800
 the picture of the floppy disk to, uh, to save things. The car that I have right now, the car

212
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:57,600
 that I have right now, which is just about to turn six years old or rather 10 years old is the first

213
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:04,880
 car I've ever had with power windows. Uh huh. So it was only a decade ago. Just so you know, if you,

214
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,720
 if you ever get a text from me with celebrity's name on it, it means you're about to get a phone

215
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,240
 call and you're supposed to be that celebrity when you answer the phone. Oh, I would do that in a

216
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:21,120
 heartbeat. I would do that in a heartbeat. That's a really good idea. That'd be really fun actually.

217
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:28,240
 I'm afraid three of us need to remember that. Yeah, we should. That could be really good.

218
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,960
 I did a bit, I did a bit for Teller a couple of years ago. Oh, this is Daniel Craig, isn't it?

219
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,920
 He had a friend that wanted, uh, wanted his kid to talk to Batman. So I did Batman for the kid.

220
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:48,800
 Yeah, I did. That's me, Batman. What do you want? It was very bail. It was very bail.

221
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,840
 I understand you can help me find the joker. And I like the kid was looking for the joker

222
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:02,560
 for like a week. I got totally keep an eye out when you're in a parking lot, just scan,

223
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:09,120
 make sure you look everywhere. The kids started out in the joker. So yeah, that I think that's a

224
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:15,680
 good bit. Let's be an ice agent. Let's start. You set them down the wrong track. No, I don't,

225
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:20,960
 I don't know. I don't think they can find the joker. It's not just going to change his wife's

226
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:29,440
 name to Bob De Niro on his phone. That's great. Oh, here's me, Bob De Niro, isn't it?

227
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:38,480
 Good. Get me some bangers and mash your Bob De Niro. I am. You guys are just getting

228
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,480
 better and better at your piff impression. Yeah, we're just, we're just chilling piff the whole

229
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:49,280
 time. It's true. It's true. By the way, any, anybody who goes to see Matt at any of the magic

230
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,400
 shows, if you come see Matt at a scoop event, feel free to name celebrities and see if that

231
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,720
 that has to be obnoxious. I just, I didn't know how to like, he wasn't going to go away. So I

232
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,880
 just literally was like, it was like shiny keys. Like how do I bounce shiny keys in front of his

233
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,600
 face to keep him from, I basically was like, I have to keep him from either recognizing or pestering

234
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,240
 Rondell Sheridan is what I was probably also is probably the nicest thing you could do really.

235
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,480
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cause you probably made his day. You're like, Oh, I'm two degrees from that guy.

236
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,800
 Uh, uh, lemur cream or lemur screamer creamer wants Clooney Batman. Paul, let's hear on Clooney

237
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:35,520
 Batman now. I don't know what your game is. Freeze. Perfect. I don't know what your game is Robin.

238
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,640
 I don't know what you think about man. Didn't know a lot of game. I don't know what you think

239
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:48,640
 your game is. Poison Ivy. Jesus. And Myra wants, uh, post care, uh, post cancer Kilmer Batman.

240
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:59,840
 It's a lot quieter. I don't know what your name is Robin. I don't know what your game is.

241
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:09,760
 Batman. Wait, I'm Batman. I don't know what your game is. Poison Ivy. Wait, no. Two face was the

242
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:17,360
 one in mine. I'll tell you who else definitely did not feel uncomfortable by that impression.

243
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:24,160
 And that is the following sponsor. This show is brought to you by, uh, Dicks Out for Democracy,

244
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,800
 Crouchless Shorts for your next anti-Trump rally.

245
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:42,320
 Hello. I am Jerry Daisy Duke Farla Flon and I've started a company. Of the Montana Farla Flons?

246
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:50,800
 The same. Out here, out here in, in God's country, we all like to free ball, but we also

247
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:58,320
 don't care for the rubbing of, uh, denim. So what we've done is we have eliminated the middleman,

248
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:05,680
 literally. We've cut out the spot where your wieners at in all of our jeans. And I don't sell

249
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:14,480
 just jeans. I sell Daisy Dukes cut high and tight to where you can't tell if it's ass or, or what it

250
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:24,400
 is because it's so high. Ass or other options. That's right. Ass or who can say.

251
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,400
 And now we've confused the issue even further by eliminating more of the material on the,

252
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,840
 on the gene to let your dick and balls fly loose.

253
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,960
 That's right. Go to, go to free as your own balls.org and sign up today

254
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,720
 to get on the mailing list. We're just pre-ordering them right now.

255
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,880
 There is nothing more democratic than crotchless Daisy Dukes.

256
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,720
 And the question of what is that ass or what have you.

257
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,000
 There's a time where people debated whether the snake or the turkey or the eagle was the

258
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,280
 greatest symbol of us and our rights. When our own free swing and scrotum was hanging

259
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:14,400
 right there the whole time. Seriously. It incorporates both snake and eagle

260
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:29,360
 because you have the serpent-like phallus and the comfortable bald nest of the majestic eagle bird.

261
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:41,760
 There's nothing more American than a coiled wiener sitting atop a pile of fuzzy balls.

262
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,400
 Enter Hey scoops at checkout. Patriots.

263
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,120
 I also would like to endorse this product.

264
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,200
 Thank you Val.

265
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,960
 Oh Val Kilmer Batman.

266
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,720
 Yes. I wore very tight pants. I wish I'd had a hole for my ween ween

267
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,520
 because boy I had to hold my pee in a lot.

268
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:14,320
 On most days, many days I couldn't pee. What's, what's your game killer croc?

269
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:21,440
 There have been some new, there have been some good drug ads lately.

270
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:30,400
 An acne medication that I saw the other day it had a warning that it would just cause eye problems.

271
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,360
 Instinct eye problems. That's all it said was eye problems.

272
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:35,840
 What is this?

273
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,560
 And I thought that was-

274
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,320
 Did I take this medicine?

275
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,360
 That was probably a Paul medicine. It caused eye problems.

276
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,040
 And I thought that was going to be the worst one I saw. I saw one last night.

277
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,040
 I paused it and had to rewind to it.

278
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:55,680
 It caused an increased risk of lower limb loss.

279
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:01,280
 Lower limb loss.

280
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,240
 But it doesn't say legs. It just says lower limb.

281
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,960
 And it doesn't say what the loss might be.

282
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,760
 Because the way it's phrased, it definitely looks like it's just going to fall off.

283
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,640
 Wow. And what does the drug help?

284
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,600
 This was a cholesterol medication.

285
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,840
 All right. Lucky you.

286
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,400
 Well, I mean, I guess I want that low LDL enough. I'll give up a foot.

287
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:31,600
 I guess. This seems, if we're going to advertise drugs in this country,

288
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,680
 the warnings at least have to make sense.

289
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,400
 No, there's no, no, they don't.

290
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,960
 And I know our European listeners are just confused about drug companies being able to

291
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,120
 advertise on TV. We are too.

292
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,400
 It's insane times, man. It's insane.

293
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:46,900
 Yeah.

294
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:53,760
 I was just seeing somebody talking about the whole Tylenol debacle, right?

295
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,800
 Yeah. What do you mean debacle? We figured out what causes autism.

296
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,640
 Sure. Well, this is a cause for celebration.

297
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,440
 The thing that they mentioned, and I don't know, it seemed to make some sense to me that they were

298
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:13,680
 like, why wouldn't Tylenol have started a lawsuit by now if their sales had been impacted in any way?

299
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:20,880
 Apparently nobody's listening to this bullshit, but he's still piloting fucking Tylenol, right?

300
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:26,160
 I mean, we're in the land of commerce here. That's all that matters is bottom line.

301
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,520
 So apparently it's not hitting them in the pocketbook enough to make them

302
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,240
 because there is no more litigious society than the United States.

303
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,880
 Right.

304
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,080
 So I, you know, I can only fathom, you know.

305
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,840
 Not only has Tylenol stock not dropped, it is trading near its 52 week high.

306
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,400
 There you go. So there it is.

307
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,520
 Okay.

308
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,480
 Yeah. There was a brief significant drop in September,

309
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,360
 but apparently it bounced right back like the next day.

310
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,740
 Okay.

311
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,920
 Interesting.

312
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,640
 There you go.

313
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,640
 That is fascinating. That actually makes me feel good that it was that dumb that people

314
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,680
 were like, okay.

315
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,800
 And it also kind of makes me feel good that they aren't suing.

316
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:13,040
 They're like, oh, we can't demonstrate damages.

317
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,040
 So I guess we'll just leave this one alone.

318
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,000
 Yeah, that's so strange.

319
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:25,840
 Oh, I never, Basi in the chat, just the thing that was created in the 50s is

320
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,640
 responsible for something that was discovered in 1911.

321
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,280
 Yeah, exactly.

322
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,420
 Yeah.

323
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,880
 I need to think about that aspect of it.

324
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,240
 That's a fine way to think about that.

325
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,200
 There's not a whole lot of medical research going on here at all.

326
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,880
 Well, I didn't believe it until now.

327
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,280
 I mean, it's not like Basi's statement just caused me to shift my opinion on Tylenol.

328
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:51,200
 Excuse me, Jacob, you're talking out of your neck.

329
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,240
 I got to tell you, I'm pretty sure just looking at you,

330
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,120
 because I could just look at people and diagnose them.

331
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,720
 I'm pretty sure that you were circumcised way too early.

332
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,560
 That's what I think now.

333
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,080
 Damn it.

334
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,880
 Val Kilmer?

335
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,400
 It's me, Val Kilmer, back from the dead.

336
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,720
 Quado from Total Recall?

337
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,120
 What's your game, Freeze?

338
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:27,200
 He'd be an amazing, he is an amazing villain.

339
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,000
 What the fuck am I saying?

340
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,680
 He is a fucking Batman villain.

341
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,640
 He is a Batman villain.

342
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,680
 Jesus Christ, we're surrounded by Batman villains.

343
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,920
 And not in the good way.

344
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,160
 No, there's nothing fun about it.

345
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,720
 None of them look like Uma Thurman dressed in plants.

346
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,920
 Oh, Uma Thurman.

347
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:49,200
 Sorry, everybody.

348
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,440
 I just got Paul started on jacking it.

349
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,000
 Just set him off, everybody.

350
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,200
 I'm sorry, that's my fault.

351
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,640
 Uma Thurman.

352
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,360
 Come on.

353
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,120
 I'll be back in five and just a nap on camera.

354
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,080
 So we're getting the house repainted.

355
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,240
 It's crazy out here.

356
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,080
 We're trying to juggle, making sure we get home in time to help them

357
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,680
 get the stuff they need or whatever.

358
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,880
 And, you know, but we're staying out of their way as best we can.

359
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,120
 But we got to put the dogs outside sometimes.

360
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,360
 But then the dogs and stuff's getting painted.

361
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,280
 So stuff got painted last night right where the dogs were outside.

362
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,040
 So we had to lay down some cardboard and the dogs wouldn't go on the cardboard.

363
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,400
 So we had to carry the dogs all around.

364
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,800
 It was a site and had to go get some special new clothes

365
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:40,160
 because she had a special interview come up last night, yesterday.

366
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,920
 So we were out doing dogs were such a mess.

367
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,120
 You had to go get new clothes.

368
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,000
 No, no, no.

369
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,120
 Like an 80s movie montage where you wait outside the dressing room.

370
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,600
 And like she just kept coming on outfit after outfit.

371
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,320
 And you're like, yes, no, maybe that's how we do it.

372
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,760
 Every time, every time we go to Kohl's and I go first into Kohl's.

373
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,360
 I have her wait in the car and I go into Kohl's first

374
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,840
 and grab a couple of scarves and sunglasses.

375
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,720
 Go ahead.

376
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,040
 I basically transform into the character of Hollywood from Mannequin and Mannequin 2.

377
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,480
 And so I take on this new persona.

378
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,000
 And when she comes through the door, I just say, oh my,

379
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,200
 let's find something for you that will just work.

380
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,360
 And then, you know, she starts trying things on.

381
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,280
 And then as she comes out as Hollywood, I will then comment and say,

382
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:34,000
 well, I guess the 1950s called back, you know, something to that effect.

383
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,800
 And then, you know, she'll come out again.

384
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:43,520
 I mean, oh, goodness, no one told me Miss Greta Garbo was going to be in the building.

385
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:50,880
 Huzzah, you know, things like that, things of this nature, things of this nature.

386
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,800
 So then so I wonder what percentage of our audience was not alive

387
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,560
 when the movie Mannequin was released.

388
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,320
 That makes me scared to think about zero.

389
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,200
 It's not zero.

390
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:03,680
 You're right.

391
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,720
 It's not zero.

392
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,560
 That movie's older than Acetaminophen.

393
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,400
 Someone in the chat says Acetaminophen was actually used back in 1893.

394
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,040
 I don't I mean, whatever.

395
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,680
 I think we can fact check everything, including the link between Tylenol and autism.

396
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,240
 Missing link.

397
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:20,960
 There.

398
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,400
 The missing link.

399
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:22,960
 Yeah.

400
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,200
 Nobody thinks that we know what we're talking about.

401
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,920
 Yeah, I admit it.

402
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,160
 Apparently, nobody thinks that RFK knows what he's talking about either.

403
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,920
 Since that doesn't affect Tylenol stock price.

404
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:42,560
 I'm constantly doing this noise while I'm going down on Cheryl Hyde.

405
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,760
 Her pussy is just full of this voice.

406
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:56,400
 Oh, you know, it's hard enough.

407
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,120
 Most men to find the clitoris.

408
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,240
 Her clitoris runs away from my voice.

409
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,520
 All right.

410
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,560
 Andy Cheek points out that we have done more research than the government on

411
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,200
 the link between Tylenol and autism just here.

412
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,880
 I believe that's true.

413
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,880
 I believe that is true.

414
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,640
 Agreed to disagree.

415
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,120
 He got us.

416
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,640
 What's your game calendar, man?

417
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:29,680
 Drove through Taco Bell the other night after work and the guy on the speaker goes,

418
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,760
 yeah, it's like 1 a.m. or so.

419
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,120
 And a guy on the speaker goes, hey, how's your night going?

420
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,240
 It's doing all right.

421
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,800
 How are you doing?

422
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,200
 Shitty, man.

423
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,000
 Oh, yeah.

424
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,040
 Thanks for asking.

425
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,680
 So I put my order in.

426
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,120
 I pulled up to the window and this dude just leans out of the window.

427
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:57,040
 He goes, man, I've been having a night that needs to tell me just all the jerks

428
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,920
 that have pulled up to the Taco Bell drive through that night.

429
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,720
 He just needed to vent.

430
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,840
 That's amazing that you were you were there for him.

431
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,400
 I was like, what you got, buddy?

432
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,280
 I'm here for you, man.

433
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,800
 I was just talking.

434
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,320
 We said we just sat and chatted in the drive through for about five minutes, too.

435
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,360
 We had a nice little chat.

436
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,480
 He's a good guy.

437
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,360
 We were just talking Taco Bell at work the other day.

438
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:26,880
 And some of my younger co-workers, I was like, guys, I don't know if you know, but.

439
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,000
 Back in the day, if you spent twenty dollars at the Taco Bell,

440
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,920
 you had ordered the entire menu.

441
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,760
 Yeah, like, yeah.

442
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,480
 Now you can get the big you can get the big case of.

443
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,880
 Yeah, you could get a box like it was like for like 15 bucks, yeah.

444
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,800
 Fifteen bucks for like 16 time.

445
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,600
 It was crazy.

446
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,720
 Yeah.

447
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,320
 And now it's just it's.

448
00:36:52,320 --> 00:37:00,560
 Things used to be cheaper brought to you by talent.

449
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,080
 Oh, yeah, we're raising the prices of tacos.

450
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,680
 Don't say taco around the Mr. President.

451
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,560
 He doesn't like that.

452
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,920
 Paul Brogan in the chat already mentioned that they were not alive when Mannequin came out.

453
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,920
 Well, so there's there's one already.

454
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,840
 Brogan, I hope you have at least seen Mannequin and Mannequin, too.

455
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,160
 OK.

456
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,080
 No, Brogan is shaking their head in the chat.

457
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:27,600
 Well, Brogan, you've got homework because Hollywood is I fucking conic.

458
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,160
 Yes, you don't have any homework.

459
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,000
 You don't have to watch Mannequin.

460
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,120
 Matt Mattingly's Ice Cream Social does not want to encourage people to watch the film

461
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,680
 Mannequin.

462
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,720
 I mean, I do.

463
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,440
 Peek Andrew McCarthy, you know.

464
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,400
 Peek Andrew McCarthy.

465
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,040
 That is true.

466
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,880
 Peek Andrew McCarthy for sure.

467
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,520
 It's it's it's what's her name.

468
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,160
 It's it's oh, my God.

469
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:50,880
 Him control.

470
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,480
 Him control at the height of her powers.

471
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,600
 My God, she's unstoppable.

472
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:04,160
 I mean, if you want a little peek into what formed old Paul, baby Paul's idea of.

473
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,120
 Because it was so mysterious up to this point.

474
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:16,320
 He who would have thought that Paul's ideal woman would be a beautiful Kim control

475
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,720
 that could then turn into a life size action figure who would have ever imagined.

476
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:33,360
 I'll tell you who else wanted to fuck a mannequin when they were a kid and still kind to do.

477
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,480
 And that's the following spot.

478
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,720
 That's the whole thing about Mannequin.

479
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,160
 He sets up these beautiful, elaborate sets in the windows and becomes famous for his

480
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,360
 beautiful sets.

481
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:51,360
 I just wanted to see one where the mannequin is dripping goo from the previous night's

482
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,240
 escapades.

483
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:58,640
 Did they use this mannequin and shooting Ghostbusters covered in slime?

484
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:12,320
 Following sponsor, why does this Macy's display say, mind if I use your shower?

485
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:20,960
 Today's show is brought to you by an eyewash station.

486
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:28,240
 Please do not touch the mannequin goo.

487
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,840
 Seriously, no washcloths.

488
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:40,720
 Today's show is brought to you by Feral Child's wedding video voiceover service.

489
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,280
 That's right.

490
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,760
 If you need a wedding video voiceover, you can get it done by Feral Child.

491
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,840
 That's from Nola Scoop in 2021.

492
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:52,800
 What was like when proposed to stay together for life?

493
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,760
 Well, now can remember with Feral Child's voice.

494
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:04,000
 Remember, mom and dad walk down the aisle.

495
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,800
 Remember, dog carry ring.

496
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:14,640
 Remember, little boy pee on altar.

497
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,040
 Accidents happen.

498
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:23,920
 Remember, bridesmaid get caught on fire from standing next to candelabra.

499
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:32,400
 Remember, bridesmaid require eight years plastic surgery to regain facial recognition.

500
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,400
 Remember, bridesmaid still not right in hand about terrible burning.

501
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,120
 Oh, I got to fast forward through this part.

502
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:50,480
 Bridesmaid and bridesmaids say vengeance will be hers.

503
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,080
 Oh, man, we got a lot of bridesmaids.

504
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:59,440
 I'm going fast forward a little more.

505
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,160
 Okay, here we go.

506
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,400
 She's still alive.

507
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,840
 Most of head look hamburger, but she not gone.

508
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,640
 Enter eight scoops of checkout.

509
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,960
 Fourth surgery not successful.

510
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,200
 That bridesmaid ruined my wedding video.

511
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,840
 I mean, it's an event to remember.

512
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,080
 You'll never forget that time the bridesmaid caught on fire.

513
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,000
 No, you won't.

514
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,040
 You won't.

515
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:37,520
 Oh, man, I watched hacks, season four of hacks on the plane.

516
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,640
 Okay.

517
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,680
 On the plane here.

518
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,640
 I fell off of hacks.

519
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,720
 I liked the first two seasons a lot.

520
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,480
 And then I fell off somewhere in season three.

521
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,880
 And then I picked up a season four, obviously missing some of the information from the end

522
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,640
 of season three, I feel like I gathered all that information pretty quickly.

523
00:41:52,640 --> 00:42:00,160
 And then I just watched three episodes of them being horrible to each other

524
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,440
 and then being horrible people.

525
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,360
 And I was like, where are the jokes?

526
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,040
 What am I supposed to be watching?

527
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:11,120
 Because the first two seasons of it were like, they were too close to home for us.

528
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:11,760
 Oh, sure.

529
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,160
 It was too much Las Vegas showbiz and it was too accurate.

530
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:16,660
 Yes.

531
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,960
 And yeah, now it's, oh, well, this is just, okay, I get it now.

532
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,280
 All right.

533
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,080
 Yeah.

534
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,160
 Broken people being mean.

535
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,040
 Yeah.

536
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,880
 When they, and they changed what the show is.

537
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,960
 They change it from, she's like the older person who's trying to revitalize her career.

538
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,240
 And now she's just rich and powerful.

539
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:36,480
 Yeah.

540
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,840
 And I was like, who am I supposed to be rooting for and where and why?

541
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,840
 What am I supposed to want to do to do things?

542
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,120
 Right.

543
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,320
 And I just was like, oh man, it put me in such a bad mood.

544
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,440
 I was really in like a sour mood getting off my plane.

545
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:53,920
 Oh.

546
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,440
 And I literally was like, why am I in a bad mood?

547
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,560
 I was like, today's nothing.

548
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,360
 I'm just traveling.

549
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:01,120
 All I'm doing is traveling and get to get to get to my friend's house

550
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,400
 to go grab dinner and watch football.

551
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,320
 How am I in a bad mood?

552
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,240
 And I was like, I think hacks put me in a bad mood.

553
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,640
 Thanks a lot, Elizabeth Smart.

554
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,920
 Well, there's your hacks hacks.

555
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,920
 Don't watch it.

556
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,160
 And I know people who write on it.

557
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,200
 I know people who film it and stuff.

558
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,720
 But I pulled out, I pulled their names out on my phone and showed them to my friends.

559
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,160
 Gene Smart.

560
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:24,480
 Thank you.

561
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,760
 Who was it designing women with me?

562
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:35,440
 Shaq Taylor who played Hollywood iconic mannequin character.

563
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,080
 Seven degrees the Hollywood.

564
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,280
 You know, it all goes back to mannequin.

565
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,680
 You know, it goes back to mannequin.

566
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,600
 Paul, Paul, Elizabeth Taylor.

567
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,400
 Okay.

568
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,480
 Elizabeth Taylor married briefly to Michael Jackson.

569
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,240
 Michael Jackson married briefly to Priscilla Presley.

570
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:59,040
 Priscilla Presley married briefly to a mannequin named Michael Jackson.

571
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,920
 Michael Jackson was a mannequin.

572
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,560
 Hollywood.

573
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:08,320
 And say only four degrees, four degrees, four degrees.

574
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,800
 It wasn't as smart with a girl who was kidnapped, right?

575
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,080
 I would rather watch that than the rest of the hack season.

576
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,800
 You'd rather watch Elizabeth Smart be kidnapped.

577
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,760
 Rather just watch it.

578
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,040
 Apologies to Elizabeth Smart.

579
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,080
 Andy Cheek is pointing out I got it wrong.

580
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,360
 It wasn't Priscilla Presley.

581
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,640
 It was Lisa Marie that he married.

582
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,600
 Okay.

583
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,480
 I don't know that he didn't marry Priscilla.

584
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,400
 I'm not a Michael Jackson historian.

585
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:40,900
 Exactly.

586
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,000
 She went from one King of Pop to the next.

587
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:50,000
 I am watching Task.

588
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,560
 You're still doing it.

589
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:52,960
 Okay.

590
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,360
 Yes.

591
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,160
 It's so depressing.

592
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,280
 You're putting Matt in a bad mood.

593
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,000
 But I'm just in.

594
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,960
 It does make me so sad.

595
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,080
 But I'm going to bed then.

596
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,360
 You're ready though.

597
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:01,920
 You're ready for that.

598
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,960
 I'm going to bed sad.

599
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,080
 I did that for my whole childhood.

600
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:06,240
 No.

601
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:12,000
 But the thing about it is so Mark Ruffalo,

602
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,040
 he grows his hair out.

603
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,240
 He's got kind of bushy hair.

604
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,560
 And then he gets a head injury at one point.

605
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,880
 And he also gets beat up.

606
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,400
 So his back is all jacked up.

607
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,120
 So at one point he walks in.

608
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,080
 It's like a dead serious scene.

609
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,880
 It's like a pivotal scene in the series.

610
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:36,400
 And he is walking and talking like Columbo.

611
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,320
 Like he is just being Columbo.

612
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,440
 It's full on now at this point.

613
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,880
 He just looks like Columbo.

614
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,680
 And he's literally doing the like, yeah, just one more thing.

615
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,240
 And like he's bringing up things that he knows that he figured out.

616
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,320
 And he's trying to make a guy basically cave.

617
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,520
 He's Peter Falk in it.

618
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,480
 And I'm so distracted.

619
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,360
 I'm like, this is like four o'clock in the morning on my cruise ship.

620
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,200
 But I'm like, this is just Columbo.

621
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,960
 I'm just watching this thing from Columbo.

622
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,840
 This guy could have found Elizabeth Smart.

623
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,440
 Six episode wind up of watching the most depressed hunk of American life.

624
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,280
 And I am just totally distracted by this Columbo impersonation.

625
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,240
 I'm watching this thing.

626
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,480
 It looks right out of Columbo.

627
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:21,120
 Mark Ruffa Columbo.

628
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:21,620
 Yeah.

629
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:28,800
 Well, my other excitement and all the fracas that went on last night

630
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,000
 and getting everything squared away, getting the dogs where they need to be.

631
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,680
 Because we're wrestling around.

632
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,880
 I'm wearing my this new hoodie that Mizzoula got for me, which I love.

633
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,360
 It's this really cool Star Wars hoodie that he got for me.

634
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:46,720
 And I put some doggy treats in the pocket.

635
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:52,320
 To because I was, you know, wrestling, wrangling dogs.

636
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,880
 I'm doing laundry today and I put it in my second load.

637
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,360
 And I go to clear out my second load and I had left the doggy treats.

638
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,840
 And I'm like, fuck me.

639
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,600
 Cleanest doggy treats in Pittsburgh.

640
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,640
 I'm so mad.

641
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,960
 And it's just, luckily it was the gunk of it.

642
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,880
 The treats were all just in the pocket and the sweater.

643
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,000
 It didn't break out.

644
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 You didn't get the rest of the laundry exactly.

645
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,960
 But I had to clean, clean, clean the sweater out.

646
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,400
 And it's still not coming clean exactly.

647
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,720
 It's in the dryer now.

648
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,240
 But I took the rest of that load that looked fairly okay.

649
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,600
 You know, it didn't have like stuff in it, but it had been washed.

650
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,960
 I've always said that about your loads.

651
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,480
 Your loads usually look fairly okay.

652
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,760
 They look fairly okay.

653
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,640
 But well, they look best when dripping out of mannequins.

654
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,080
 Sure, sure.

655
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,560
 But I-

656
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,560
 Use the eye wash station.

657
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,280
 Please save yourselves.

658
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:56,080
 But I threw everything in the dryer and then I go to take the stuff out of the dryer.

659
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:59,040
 And I'm taking it out and I, you know, because I used the like the little,

660
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:06,000
 the scent booster stuff, the anyway, the downy scent, whatever it is.

661
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:06,320
 Yeah.

662
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:12,320
 Anyway, I give a little sniff and it's got just this sort of very faint,

663
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:16,160
 but they're sort of beefiness to it.

664
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:21,040
 And it was like, fuck, I have to wash all these clothes again.

665
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,080
 Why did you have to wash?

666
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,080
 But they already had the scent of beef.

667
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,600
 Why did you wash them again, Paul?

668
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,720
 I'm trying to rid myself of the scent of beef.

669
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:35,120
 I'm trying to un-beef my laundry.

670
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,720
 You have beef experience.

671
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,480
 I do, brother, do I.

672
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,280
 So this is-

673
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,640
 I'm looking for that right now.

674
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,400
 This is my afternoon is-

675
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,400
 Oh, I know what beef is.

676
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,360
 I have had beef experience.

677
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,640
 I know beef.

678
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,880
 It's true.

679
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,520
 And brother.

680
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,320
 Know it, I wear it.

681
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,240
 Exactly.

682
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:09,040
 So yeah, that's my excitement for the day is cleaning my new favorite shirt and finding

683
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:14,640
 I sabotaged my new favorite shirt with a bunch of fucking dog treats.

684
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,320
 With beef scent.

685
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,280
 With beef scent.

686
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:17,520
 So hopefully-

687
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,840
 Some say sabotage, some say improve.

688
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,040
 Hopefully it's fixed.

689
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:21,520
 We'll see.

690
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,160
 It dried finally.

691
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,440
 We'll see what's going on.

692
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,280
 Good Lord.

693
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,800
 I want, I want all of Paul's wardrobe to just smell like beef.

694
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,120
 Well, give it a couple days.

695
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:33,600
 It might.

696
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,440
 We'll see.

697
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,240
 I need to put some more perfume on it, maybe.

698
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,880
 Yeah, that's probably what it's missing.

699
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,400
 All right, you want to do a little scoop mail?

700
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,320
 That's all I want to do.

701
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,360
 I ache for it.

702
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,240
 Message for you, son.

703
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,680
 We got one here from Poutine Scoops.

704
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,080
 Hello fuckers.

705
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:55,440
 Here's an Italian air show story from my childhood.

706
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,560
 Back in 1995, there was a referendum in Quebec to separate from Canada.

707
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:08,400
 As dumb as 13 year old me and my friend thought, we're gonna need our own money as a country.

708
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,920
 We proceeded to heat up a Canadian penny with a lighter

709
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,480
 to engrave it with a fleur de lis or something.

710
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:21,120
 The lighter didn't soften the penny enough, so we went outside

711
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:27,200
 and grabbed the red gas can for the lawnmower, oh, gas can, gotta be gas.

712
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,600
 Grabbed the red gas can for the lawnmower and tried to soften the penny some more.

713
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:36,960
 Spoiler, you can't melt a penny with gas as a 13 year old.

714
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,360
 What?

715
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,200
 Jet fuel doesn't melt steel pennies.

716
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,480
 No, I guess not.

717
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:49,040
 We put too much gas on and at some point, my genius self tries to put the fire out

718
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:55,760
 by stomping it down with the first thing I got on my hand, which was the red gas can.

719
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,200
 What?

720
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:05,920
 So you had a fire that you were trying to melt a penny in the fire, pouring gasoline on it,

721
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:12,320
 and then you had the gas can in your hand, and so you tried to use the gas can to then tamp out.

722
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,080
 Tamp out the flame, yeah, yeah, yeah.

723
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:14,880
 Oh no.

724
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,080
 Oh yeah.

725
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:22,240
 We now have a significant red gas can fire on our hands.

726
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:26,400
 My friend runs to grab the water hose with the full red gas can on fire.

727
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,560
 Won't stop burning because it's a gas can.

728
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,320
 Quick, get more gas.

729
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,680
 We gotta put up the gas fire.

730
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,800
 Throw some rice on that.

731
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,120
 Oh, that would have fixed it.

732
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:42,160
 Now, do you guys remember the red gas cans exploding in 80s movies?

733
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,520
 Because I did.

734
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,880
 It's gonna just explode and destroy the house.

735
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,440
 I'd better kick it farther away from the house.

736
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:49,920
 Oh no.

737
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,840
 So the bottom of the red gas can had already melted on the grass,

738
00:51:53,840 --> 00:52:03,520
 so only the top of the can got kicked away and the not yet burned gas went everywhere.

739
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:08,800
 So as a 13-year-old on fire guy, I proceeded to...

740
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,800
 I don't know what that's supposed to say.

741
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,160
 This is an oddly written letter.

742
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,000
 I think this person might still be on fire when--

743
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,360
 This is a traumatic event, clearly, for this individual.

744
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:19,920
 Yeah.

745
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,840
 I am watching it burn right now.

746
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,560
 I type as I...

747
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,040
 I'm doing voice-to-text!

748
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,480
 This group is reliving this, yeah.

749
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:33,200
 Went all the way around the house to the back to get my water hose

750
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,640
 friend who then extinguished my legs.

751
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,880
 Oh my god.

752
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,320
 Your legs caught fire?

753
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:40,820
 Yeah.

754
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:44,400
 This reminds me of a wedding video I just saw.

755
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:53,600
 The girl with the flame on the chain and she tosses it all over the place?

756
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,800
 Oh, I haven't seen that.

757
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,760
 Oh, okay.

758
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,800
 Did it really happen?

759
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,920
 She burned up people?

760
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,280
 Yeah, she tossed a flame ball into the crowd of people at a wedding.

761
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,560
 Does they all freak out when it happens?

762
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,360
 Yes, yeah, yeah.

763
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,040
 Did anybody die?

764
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,000
 Three months in the hospital, skin grafts, all the things.

765
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,200
 My legs still look weird, but they weren't great.

766
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,920
 The worst thing about it is my scars won't sweat and it's a good part of my legs,

767
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,560
 so the end of the scars sweat like crazy because it's all going out wherever it can.

768
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,120
 Oh!

769
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,120
 It gets a little itchy, but no big deal.

770
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,000
 I'm so sorry, Poutine Scoop.

771
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,120
 Oh, that's so awful.

772
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,320
 The referendum went 50.2 to 49.8.

773
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:34,240
 So no, I'm still Canadian and we still don't have our own pennies.

774
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,440
 That's Poutine Scoop.

775
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,600
 You know, I don't think Canada even has pennies now.

776
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,960
 So it's all for naught.

777
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,720
 Well, I don't think they even have pennies now.

778
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,200
 Just like us, I think they also got rid of their pennies.

779
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,120
 I see Crystal Twist is saying I'm right.

780
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,800
 They don't have pennies anymore.

781
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,360
 Oh!

782
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,240
 So not only was it for naught, but it wouldn't have even worked before.

783
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:56,400
 Well, technically, the US has never had pennies.

784
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,640
 We have one-cent pieces.

785
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,040
 The English and the Canadians have pennies.

786
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:01,840
 There's no US.

787
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,160
 Poutine Scoop.

788
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,720
 That is such a heartbreaker.

789
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:13,360
 As a former young adolescent boy who played with fire, I can only say that there but for

790
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:18,640
 the grace of fate do I not join you in insanity.

791
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:27,200
 I remember one day we were at a friend's house and he put gasoline in one of those little

792
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:34,240
 plastic dinosaurs that are about six inches tall, right?

793
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,360
 Do you remember those old hard plastic dinosaurs?

794
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,000
 Yeah, yeah.

795
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,600
 And they were hollow in the middle.

796
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,240
 Exactly.

797
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:44,960
 So he filled it up with gasoline and he set the mouth on fire,

798
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,400
 thinking it was going to look like breathing fire.

799
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,200
 I'm with this kid.

800
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,880
 This is a smart kid.

801
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,920
 It didn't really do much.

802
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,240
 It just started melting the face.

803
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:59,600
 But then he went and tipped the tail and the gasoline barfed out of the

804
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:03,520
 thing and it filled this basement with fire.

805
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,120
 And lucky there was nothing on the floor.

806
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,480
 You were inside doing this.

807
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,480
 It was, yeah, it was inside a basement.

808
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,880
 It's a concrete floor and luckily nobody got hurt and it got out.

809
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,160
 But it was scary.

810
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,280
 Burned the house down.

811
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,480
 It was scary for a minute.

812
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

813
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:24,000
 It's actually pretty scary here at the core sensors building.

814
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,600
 Zach broke the light.

815
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:31,440
 So there's a light that broke the light and now we'll never find our way out of here.

816
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,160
 I live here now.

817
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,800
 Well, at least you've got some sensors and gauges.

818
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,300
 That's right.

819
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:41,840
 If I'm wondering how much pressure I'm under to finish this episode,

820
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,600
 I can actually figure out that number right now.

821
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:50,000
 But I appreciate Poutine sharing that trauma with us for our interview.

822
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,760
 I definitely, we definitely went through like a fire period when we were kids.

823
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,260
 Yeah.

824
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,640
 Everything we would hear about.

825
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,140
 Yeah.

826
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,320
 There was this, there was this period of time in the 80s and 90s

827
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:08,480
 where you'd hear about these things and people would tell them as cautionary tales.

828
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,320
 Like make sure you don't mix, what was it?

829
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:20,320
 Ivory soap and gasoline on an electric stovetop because that's how you can make napalm.

830
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,360
 Yes.

831
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:24,480
 And would be told that it would be like, well, clearly that's what we're going to do.

832
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,320
 I'd say it's time to make some napalm.

833
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:26,800
 Yeah.

834
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,160
 Yeah, and we would do that.

835
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,720
 We had like a hot plate out somewhere.

836
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,120
 Like somebody had gotten a hot plate.

837
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:37,760
 And I remember we were in a culvert one time in some neighborhood.

838
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,440
 A hot plate in a culvert?

839
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,760
 Yeah, it was crazy shit.

840
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:49,920
 We read one time that if you cut off a whole bunch of strike anywhere match heads

841
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,840
 and shoved them into a tennis ball, that it would act like a hand grenade.

842
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,340
 Right.

843
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:58,800
 Which it shockingly almost worked exactly like that.

844
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:04,000
 It was, you talk about like pouring gas on the floor of the basement.

845
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,680
 The hand grenade tennis ball was my pouring gas on the floor of the basement.

846
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,560
 Where'd you throw it?

847
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:12,240
 We were outside and I don't think I threw it.

848
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:16,000
 I think one of the other guys threw it and just up against the brick wall.

849
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,040
 Oh shit.

850
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,360
 And like it just went.

851
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:23,360
 It exploded and little nubs of fire.

852
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:26,640
 Just thousands of little nubs of fire just went in every direction.

853
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,200
 Wow.

854
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,880
 And it definitely started a couple of fires.

855
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:29,520
 It was terrifying.

856
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,240
 Oh god.

857
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,620
 Yeah.

858
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:35,680
 We used to ride our bikes up to the recycling center.

859
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,680
 Steal newspaper out of the recycling center newspaper.

860
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,960
 And then we took matches from a bucket of matches at 7-Eleven.

861
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,760
 And then we would go light newspaper on fire.

862
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,140
 Yeah.

863
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:51,440
 It's its own fault for being so flammable.

864
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,240
 That'll teach it.

865
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:54,960
 That'll learn it.

866
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,320
 We got one here from Anonymous Scoop X.

867
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:04,160
 This recently happened and understandably I can't possibly tell anyone in my life.

868
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:10,080
 But this is where you three boys and your confession booth of frozen dairy delights comes in.

869
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:10,720
 Yay.

870
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,360
 Here we are.

871
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,880
 Now we're actually serving our purpose.

872
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:18,320
 This gentleman falls within the first blow job topic.

873
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:18,820
 Oh.

874
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:20,720
 Falls in?

875
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,800
 Sounds like there's some qualifiers here.

876
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,240
 It sounds like there might be.

877
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:28,320
 I've been dating my almost 40-year-old partner

878
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:33,760
 as a 34-year-old woman I can't bring myself to say boyfriend for the last few years.

879
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,120
 We were flirtatious friends for many years which escalated

880
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:40,480
 to friends with benefits and finally to long-distance partners.

881
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,520
 We'd meet up every month or so in person, go on dates,

882
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:48,000
 play games and perhaps most crucially fuck for hours.

883
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,640
 It's been a journey of exploration for both of us.

884
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,320
 We both have what is probably an unreasonably high sex drive

885
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:59,360
 and we both enjoyed exploring new kinks and experiences.

886
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:04,880
 I take particular pride in bringing any dream or fantasy to life for the champ.

887
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,400
 As a former cosplayer, I've also had a lot of fun sewing costumes,

888
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,640
 making outfits and embroidering and embodying new characters.

889
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,040
 Amazing.

890
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,200
 As much as I've wanted to play out some of these things,

891
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:20,000
 it's the first time I've met someone who was as adventurous as I was who I was comfortable with.

892
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,760
 Jacob, this is clearly AI or some weird old penthouse forum thing

893
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,080
 where someone's just pretending to be awesome.

894
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,760
 I never thought it would happen to me.

895
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,040
 Can't be true, this can't be true.

896
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,320
 This is real life, David.

897
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:36,560
 Matt, all of those penthouse forum letters had to come from real people,

898
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:39,120
 so I mean clearly those things really happened.

899
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:39,620
 All right.

900
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:43,920
 All of this is important context for what came next.

901
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:47,120
 It was always a running joke in our friendship group that my fellow

902
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,600
 was two scoops of plain old vanilla.

903
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:53,120
 As an alternative lass covered in tattoos and arresting bitch face

904
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,880
 to rival the best in the business,

905
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,280
 we managed to go completely under the radar for a long time.

906
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:02,720
 But behind closed doors, he was very different.

907
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,520
 We dabbled in toys, different positions, role plays.

908
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,800
 We would laugh about how if they knew, they'd be shocked.

909
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:13,520
 Cut to a few weeks ago, years down the line, two days in a row,

910
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,320
 I'd woken the chap up with a good morning blow job.

911
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:21,920
 He recovers quickly, so both mornings, he'd manage to come twice in a row before work.

912
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:22,640
 Holy smoke.

913
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,880
 What can I say, I'm dedicated to the craft.

914
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,960
 That's an incredible refractory period.

915
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:27,460
 That is.

916
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:29,760
 Anyway, after day two--

917
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,760
 This man should be studied by RFK Jr.

918
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,320
 I don't know how you do that.

919
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:42,480
 Anyway, after day two, we were talking away, and it got into the topic of porn.

920
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,240
 He let me in on the fact that he watches role play porn.

921
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,960
 The boy watches it for the plot.

922
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,000
 I was in absolute hysterics.

923
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:52,880
 I couldn't believe it.

924
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,880
 I didn't know these people still existed.

925
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,760
 He's really rooting for that pizza delivery boy.

926
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,240
 He asked what porn I watched, and I had to explain that

927
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:04,480
 I didn't think he would know what all the letters stood for in my search term.

928
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:08,320
 I'd simply said, if there are less than four people in the room,

929
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,840
 I'm probably not interested.

930
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:16,160
 He was also surprised when I said that I can't stand the introduction,

931
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,840
 so I just pass forward to the good bits.

932
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:21,120
 So L-E-M-O-N, those are the types of things you put in there?

933
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,720
 That's right, that's right.

934
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,560
 Lemon party.

935
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,600
 P-A-R-T-Y, because I like it.

936
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:33,200
 That's when the situation escalated, and it hit me like a bust to the face.

937
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,000
 Well, I'm quite vanilla.

938
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,240
 You know that, or I was before we met.

939
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:41,360
 Before you, I'd only had one blowjob.

940
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,120
 He mumbled, somewhat embarrassed.

941
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:49,440
 Then in an even quieter voice, he said, well, sort of half of one.

942
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:57,840
 He explained, one girlfriend once had tried it and decided it wasn't really for her.

943
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:07,360
 Had been married since, and she was absolutely not forgiving it a go.

944
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:12,880
 Boys, I'm ashamed to say I laughed my fucking ass off for a long time.

945
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,080
 Throughout the day, periodically, I laughed repeatedly, and not a chuckle.

946
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:20,320
 I laughed at the volume of a demented, drug-addled clown.

947
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:24,160
 I couldn't believe that he was telling me this many years down the line,

948
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:28,400
 what must be literally hundreds of blowjobs later.

949
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,640
 He'd had four blowjobs in the space of 24 hours,

950
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:37,440
 compared to the half a job he'd had in the previous 38 years of life.

951
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,480
 It's important to say I wasn't laughing at him.

952
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:44,080
 I was just laughing at the ridiculousness of the situation.

953
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:44,480
 Yeah.

954
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:49,120
 Although apparently clarifying that did not make up for how hard I was laughing at the time.

955
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:53,280
 So that's my story of how my partner's dreams came true

956
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,760
 when he realized he'd met a human vacuum cleaner

957
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:00,000
 who'd happily putter around in a homemade poison ivy outfit.

958
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,920
 Oh, poison ivy outfit, full circle.

959
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,320
 If it meant hit be happy, although not quite a first blowjob story,

960
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:11,120
 you'd have to have a very specific category for the first blowjob story for that one.

961
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,960
 Thanks for giving me an outlet for this tale.

962
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,960
 The podcast brings me absolute joy.

963
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,960

01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:30,080
 I get it.

969
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:30,560
 I get it.

970
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:35,120
 Hey, the fade button works.

971
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:36,160
 Nice.

972
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,840
 That's a nice change.

973
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,400
 It's time for Jack vs. Nerd.

974
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,640
 It's on.

975
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,960
 You ain't doing no Jack vs. Nerd action.

976
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:45,920
 Oh, am I?

977
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:46,640
 Fuck, yeah.

978
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,360
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

979
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:57,840
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

980
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:58,340
 No.

981
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:03,040
 We got a scooper today from Swedish Scoop.

982
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:11,760
 The categories are San and Santa, Shakin' My Spear, Old MCD, Deformed Farm.

983
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,320
 Do you think that girl went on to blow someone else?

984
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:19,920
 Do you feel like she's also had to retell that story to a partner?

985
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,120
 The one who wasn't for me?

986
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,000
 Yeah, yeah.

987
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,880
 Do you think later she got used to it?

988
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:27,600
 Tried another?

989
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,240
 I doubt it.

990
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,280
 I didn't used to like this nearly as much as I do now.

991
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,360
 But these days, I don't even talk without a cock in my dick.

992
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,760
 That's right.

993
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,680
 Old McDonald's Deformed Farm.

994
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:48,240
 Oh, that's what that Old McDonald's Deformed Farm and songs I weep for.

995
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,200
 Okay.

996
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,880
 Paul, you're up.

997
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,120
 Well, I got to try Old McDonald's Deformed Farm.

998
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:59,760
 For 400, this animal had an ab-ab here and an ab-ab there.

999
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:04,160
 Here an ab, there an ab, everywhere an ab-ab.

1000
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,200
 That's A-A-B is how ab is spelled.

1001
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,480
 Oh, jeez.

1002
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:16,400
 I mean, like a deformed sheep, I guess.

1003
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,400
 I guess.

1004
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,600
 Oh, a dyslexic sheep.

1005
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,480
 Oh, they all have a condition.

1006
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,920
 Okay.

1007
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,560
 All right, we get it now.

1008
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,000
 All right.

1009
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:30,560
 Matt, you're up.

1010
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:33,520
 Songs I Weep For.

1011
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:39,840
 Eponine, I never remember how to say her name.

1012
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:44,960
 Eponine sings this song of unrequited love and loneliness in Les Miserables.

1013
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:53,360
 What's it called?

1014
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:58,880
 I love him that every day I'm learning.

1015
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,560
 Master of the House.

1016
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:03,040
 That's it.

1017
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,240
 Master of the House.

1018
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:08,240
 I can't remember, Pass.

1019
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,240
 Passes to me.

1020
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:16,400
 Shit, all I could think of is, oh wait, is it Castle on a Cloud?

1021
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,560
 That's the little girl song.

1022
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,480
 Yeah, I don't remember who is who.

1023
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,920
 I don't remember what French name belongs with what character in Les Mis.

1024
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,880
 ScooperNovaGirl typed it into the chat if you just want to read it and get it right.

1025
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,400
 Oh, okay.

1026
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,480
 I can't see the chat.

1027
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,240
 You guys can see the chat during the--

1028
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,720
 Oh, I didn't know that we have this advantage on you, Jacob.

1029
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,360
 Oh yeah, no, I can't see the chat during the scooperties

1030
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:40,320
 because I'm sharing my screen so you guys can see the scooperty.

1031
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,040
 Pretty great.

1032
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:44,960
 Oh, is it?

1033
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,080
 On my own.

1034
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:49,520
 On my own.

1035
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:50,640
 Wait, you can't see the chat?

1036
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:51,040
 He grabbed.

1037
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,320
 No.

1038
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,040
 That's so funny.

1039
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,880
 He grabbed it.

1040
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:55,600
 All right.

1041
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:56,640
 I mean, I know the show.

1042
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,000
 You knew the song, yeah.

1043
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,840
 Yeah, I just had to find it in my head.

1044
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:05,440
 Me, it's-- I don't know what San and Santa is, so let's try that.

1045
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:05,940
 400.

1046
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:09,440
 Jesus's mom in Espanol.

1047
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:17,040
 So how do you say fictional in Spanish?

1048
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:21,040
 [LAUGHTER]

1049
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,880
 How do you say historical fiction?

1050
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:29,280
 What, so it's Mary in Spanish?

1051
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,560
 I think it's different than that.

1052
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:32,480
 OK, I pass then.

1053
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:32,960
 Paul.

1054
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,160
 I think it's Magdalena.

1055
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,320
 Oh, I see.

1056
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:39,120
 Santa Maria.

1057
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,320
 Well, shit on me.

1058
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,800
 Shit on my penis.

1059
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,080
 Mary Magdalena.

1060
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,360
 Paul.

1061
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:48,960
 Fucking shit my dick.

1062
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:53,280
 I'll do songs I weep for for 2000, because I got to get on the board.

1063
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:58,480
 Fire Maple Song is a single off the first album by this '90s rock band,

1064
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,800
 better known for Wonderful and Santa Monica.

1065
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:04,720
 Oh, that's Everclear.

1066
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:08,480
 Everclear is correct.

1067
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,680
 I saw them at concert.

1068
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:10,160
 On the board.

1069
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:10,960
 They were terrible.

1070
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,560
 No.

1071
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,160
 Yeah, they were awful.

1072
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,840
 Matt, you're up.

1073
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,120
 I left before they were done.

1074
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:24,080
 I'll do Shaken My Spear for 400.

1075
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,160
 I've never gone out of my way to see Everclear.

1076
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:30,240
 This tragedy focuses on a pair of star-crossed lovers from Fair Verona.

1077
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,320
 Did you know the girl was only 13?

1078
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:32,880
 Yoinks.

1079
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,960
 It's about Jerry Lee Lewis.

1080
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,680
 This is Romeo and Juliet.

1081
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,760
 Romeo and Juliet.

1082
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,280
 Is that the whole answer?

1083
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,240
 I don't know.

1084
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:43,360
 I forgot what the category is.

1085
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:45,840
 I believe that's the answer.

1086
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:46,800
 Oh yeah, Romeo and Juliet.

1087
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:51,200
 I didn't know if it was going to be like a Romeo and Juliet,

1088
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,640
 get fucked, or something like that.

1089
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:56,160
 Let's see.

1090
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,720
 I'll try, I don't know, Shaken My Spear for 800.

1091
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,400
 Daily Double.

1092
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:09,360
 Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow is a famous soliloquy from this Scottish play.

1093
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:14,080
 That would be the Scottish play Macbeth.

1094
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,000
 MacGregor the Bridge Builder.

1095
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:16,500
 No.

1096
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:21,520
 Macbeth is correct.

1097
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,020
 Paul.

1098
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:29,760
 I'll try Old MacDonald for 2000.

1099
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:31,840
 Wow.

1100
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:35,280
 This animal had a crack-crack here and a crack-crack there.

1101
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:38,240
 Here a crack, there a crack, everywhere a crack-crack.

1102
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,920
 Oh my gosh.

1103
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:44,720
 It's probably an arthritic duck, but I don't want to guess for 2000 points.

1104
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:45,280
 I'll pass.

1105
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:47,360
 Matt.

1106
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:47,680
 Pass.

1107
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:51,120
 Or what's that condition that Mr. Glass had?

1108
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,240
 A drug-dealing duck.

1109
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:53,840
 Oh, drug-dealing duck.

1110
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:54,320
 Good lord.

1111
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,000
 See, there's a lot of ways that could have gone.

1112
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,400
 Crack-crack here and a crack-crack there.

1113
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,560
 Yeah, I would have gone like a plumber duck or something.

1114
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:01,060
 Yeah, yeah.

1115
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:04,000
 Matt could have been a plumber.

1116
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,400
 Shaken My Spear at 1200.

1117
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:14,640
 This titled Prince of Denmark asks, "Am I a coward?" in Shakespeare's longest play.

1118
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,880
 Hamlet?

1119
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,640
 Indeed.

1120
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,080
 Hamlet is correct.

1121
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,480
 Where's the thing?

1122
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:22,980
 There it is.

1123
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:26,080
 Me, I'll try, I'll close out Shaken My Spear.

1124
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:26,880
 I actually know these.

1125
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:32,000
 Shakespeare's wife shares a name with this modern actress of The Dark Night Rises,

1126
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,920
 Selina Kyle and Le Miserable Fantine Fane.

1127
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,520
 It's your girl, Matt.

1128
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,020
 Oh yeah.

1129
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,840
 Catwoman.

1130
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,960
 Batgirl or Catwoman?

1131
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,720
 I don't remember, but it's one of them.

1132
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:49,840
 It was actually Catwoman, but she went Batgirl.

1133
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:55,120
 Who was Batgirl in that movie?

1134
01:10:55,120 --> 01:11:00,400
 I can't think of her name.

1135
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:04,480
 Princess Diaries.

1136
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,480
 Oh, now you got me on it.

1137
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:09,920
 I don't fucking hardly remember her name either.

1138
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,440
 I don't like her at all.

1139
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:14,880
 Pass, baby, pass.

1140
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,360
 Matt's just sitting there just slowly jacking it.

1141
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,200
 He's just keeping it in half-staff.

1142
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,320
 He's ready to go.

1143
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,280
 I can't remember her name.

1144
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,440
 All right, half-staff, Donnelly, what you got?

1145
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,840
 Anne Hathaway about her.

1146
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:27,200
 Oh, yes, there it is.

1147
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,600
 Anne Hathaway.

1148
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:34,880
 Where there is a will, Anne Hathaway.

1149
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:35,680
 Yeah, she does.

1150
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:41,680
 I'll try songs that I weep for for $1,200.

1151
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:44,000
 It's not time to make a change.

1152
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,040
 Just relax.

1153
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,000
 Take it easy.

1154
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:51,120
 Sings Cat Stephen, Youssef Islam in This Tearjerker.

1155
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:54,400
 Oh, this is a good one.

1156
01:11:54,400 --> 01:12:00,880
 This one got me for real, in real life, because I listened to that.

1157
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:04,880
 I went through the Cat Stevens binge when I moved to the Virgin Islands,

1158
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,560
 and I was living off of my own.

1159
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:10,080
 And then I listened to it after I had a child.

1160
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:14,240
 And I indeed felt both sides of the song, and it fucking destroyed me.

1161
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:21,600
 I have to pass because I can't remember the title of the song.

1162
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:22,320
 It goes to Matt.

1163
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:22,800
 What is it?

1164
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:23,520
 Father and Son.

1165
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,240
 Father and Son.

1166
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:26,880
 That got you?

1167
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,320
 Believe it or not.

1168
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:28,820
 Yeah, yeah.

1169
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:30,800
 Interesting.

1170
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,160
 I hope you don't ever have kids.

1171
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:32,960
 It'll really get you.

1172
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:40,880
 Um, it's really, you know, the lyrics respond back and forth between Father and the Son.

1173
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,360
 And that's it's super, super deep.

1174
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:46,000
 And I think it's a really good song that they sued.

1175
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:52,880
 Who's that psychedelic band ended up just absolutely just copying the song by accident

1176
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,200
 and had and had to pay up in the lawsuit.

1177
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,880
 I don't know.

1178
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,640
 I'll look it up in a sec.

1179
01:12:58,640 --> 01:12:59,920
 Someone to check and look it up.

1180
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:01,600
 But was it in the in the 60s?

1181
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:02,080
 They did it?

1182
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:06,400
 No, it was in the late 90s of the 2000s.

1183
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,720
 There's a Flaming Lips.

1184
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:09,280
 That's what it was.

1185
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:09,920
 Flaming Lips.

1186
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,760
 Oh, Flaming Lips basically ripped one off.

1187
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,320
 Too similar to Father and Son.

1188
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:18,720
 In the settlement, the bands agreed to a royalty split

1189
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:23,840
 with Stevens receiving 75 percent of the publishing royalties from Fight Test.

1190
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:24,160
 Yeah.

1191
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:24,640
 Okay.

1192
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,680
 Man, Cat Stevens had some good lawyers on that lawsuit.

1193
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:28,560
 He sure did.

1194
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:29,280
 He sure did.

1195
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,000
 Holy shit.

1196
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,080
 Let's see.

1197
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:32,480
 What is it?

1198
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,080
 Matt, your turn.

1199
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:34,800
 I will do.

1200
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,560
 Score check.

1201
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,880
 By the way, Matt is crushing both Paul and I.

1202
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:39,840
 He has 4,800.

1203
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,200
 Paul and I both have 1,200 each.

1204
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:43,920
 I can step into it with Daily Doubles here.

1205
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,000
 I'll do songs that I weep for for 800.

1206
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,840
 Daily Doubles!

1207
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,120
 There it comes.

1208
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:49,680
 Oh, no.

1209
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,840
 From your mouth to my ears.

1210
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:57,040
 This legendary Academy Award winning song asks,

1211
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:02,400
 "If happy little bluebirds fly, why, oh why, can't I?"

1212
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:07,680
 It also ranked number one on AFI's 100 years, 100 song list.

1213
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:10,400
 Baby Got Back.

1214
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:15,040
 Somewhere Over the Rainbow.

1215
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:21,280
 Somewhere Over the Rainbow.

1216
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,160
 Oh, I just brought back a flashback of Judy Garland

1217
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:27,840
 singing that 100 feet high in the sphere.

1218
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,480
 Was it crazy?

1219
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:30,960
 I'll try.

1220
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,520
 Yeah, it was. It was really crazy.

1221
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,520
 San and Santa for 800.

1222
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:40,560
 This is what you get when you eat breakfast on the beach in California.

1223
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,920
 High property taxes, am I right?

1224
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:49,840
 I don't know.

1225
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:50,560
 What's the thing?

1226
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:51,360
 Salmon Sand?

1227
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:57,520
 I have no idea.

1228
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,000
 I'll pass.

1229
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:58,240
 Paul?

1230
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,800
 A breakfast sandwich?

1231
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:05,920
 Oh, San Diego.

1232
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:07,360
 Oh, San Diego.

1233
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:11,040
 I get it now.

1234
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:11,360
 Paul?

1235
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:16,320
 Old Deform McDonald for 1200.

1236
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:22,960
 This animal had a rub-it, rub-it here and a rub-it, rub-it there.

1237
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:27,280
 Here a rub-it, there a rub-it, everywhere a rub-it, rub-it.

1238
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,680
 It's got to be a habitual masturbating frog.

1239
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,160
 A vitally masturbating frog.

1240
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,320
 Close enough, perverted frog.

1241
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,840
 Matt?

1242
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:38,960
 A horny toad.

1243
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,880
 I'll do San Santa.

1244
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,000
 I'll horny toad.

1245
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:42,480
 1200.

1246
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,360
 Horny toads.

1247
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:49,680
 Musicals adore this New Mexico city with characters in both newsies and rent,

1248
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:51,520
 dreaming of running away to there.

1249
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,440
 Santa Fe?

1250
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:56,560
 But how do the songs go, Matt?

1251
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,520
 I don't know the Newsy Santa Fe song.

1252
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:01,360
 Santa Fe.

1253
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:06,080
 But I'll do the whole score of rent for you right now.

1254
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:09,200
 The newsies are trying to get to Santa Fe?

1255
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:13,200
 The one, Christian Bale's character, he sings the whole song about Santa Fe.

1256
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:14,480
 What?

1257
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,960
 It's like, it's the big torch song.

1258
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:20,880
 It's like Santa Fe, I'll be there, I don't remember anymore.

1259
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,320
 I mean, I've been to the city, it's fine.

1260
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,840
 That's a perfectly plausible city.

1261
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,680
 How can that compare to New York?

1262
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:28,400
 I don't get it.

1263
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:32,880
 Well, that's why there's only two songs about it, not the dozens about New York.

1264
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:33,920
 I suppose you're right.

1265
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:36,320
 Let's see, it's me.

1266
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:41,040
 I have 1200, Paul has 1600, Matt has 10,800.

1267
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:44,160
 There are two questions left and no more deadly doubles.

1268
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:45,360
 Anybody's game.

1269
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:49,840
 I'll try Santa and Santa for 2000.

1270
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:54,320
 This character threatened Chris the octopus in a heartwarming children's tale.

1271
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:57,040
 It isn't Chris's fault, he lost his hat.

1272
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:57,540
 Yeah.

1273
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:02,960
 So that's the homeless guy, the bum.

1274
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,320
 No, no, no, he didn't threaten him.

1275
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:07,840
 Okay.

1276
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,000
 What's the category, Jacob?

1277
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,640
 Oh, I don't remember.

1278
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,800
 Santa and Santa.

1279
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:19,440
 Oh, he's the bum dressed as Santa?

1280
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:20,640
 It's just Santa Claus.

1281
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,320
 Santa Claus is the villain in Christmas.

1282
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:27,760
 Santa Claus is basically the bad guy in Christmas.

1283
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,920
 Isn't Santa Claus the bum though, too?

1284
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:33,760
 No, he is the surrogate for Rudolph.

1285
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:37,360
 Oh, I haven't read Christmas plus recently enough.

1286
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,040
 It's all right.

1287
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,960
 Well, we're working on the sequel.

1288
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,320
 It'll be a big thing.

1289
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,000
 Yeah, I'll bone up on the original.

1290
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
 So I'm not confused by any of the plot lines.

1291
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,920
 We're going to do some reprints.

1292
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:48,880
 Yeah, it'll be awesome.

1293
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:52,080
 It's going to close it out the category and the game.

1294
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:55,200
 Old Mac Deform, Old Mac Deform Farm.

1295
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:55,680
 Yeah, you know.

1296
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:58,080
 Yes, Old Mac Deform Farm.

1297
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:02,640
 This animal had a hith hith here and a hith hith there.

1298
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:02,960
 Good Lord.

1299
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,400
 Here a hith, there a hith, everywhere a hith hith.

1300
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:10,000
 It also starred in Disney's Robin Hood.

1301
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,680
 Mike Tyson the snake.

1302
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:14,240
 If Mike Tyson was a snake, this is what I would sound like.

1303
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:17,040
 It's a it's a lispy snake.

1304
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,760
 A lispy Mike Tyson snake.

1305
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,200
 Nailed it.

1306
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:25,360
 And that is the game.

1307
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:29,760
 Matt Donnelly ekes out the win with ten thousand eight hundred points.

1308
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:32,560
 I'm in second with thirty two hundred.

1309
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,040
 Matt said Paul's in third with twenty four hundred.

1310
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,400
 That's from Swedish Scoop.

1311
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:37,920

1321

 The Fezzes are the hats.

1322
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:01,600
 You got Fezzes, you got robes and a pair of T-shirts that you can choose between.

1323
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:02,960
 They're all really cool.

1324
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:03,520
 Do the thing.

1325
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:08,880
 Oh, and if you buy a T-shirt, a robe and a Fez all together,

1326

 By the way, quick shout out.

1388
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,920
 I watched the movie Ballerina on another flight.

1389
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:10,480
 Plot not dissimilar to Gymkhana.

1390
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:11,680
 Plot not dissimilar.

1391
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:20,320
 She has the her dance moves are her special weapon kind of thing.

1392
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,320
 Like, no, it's just goes like in Gymkhana.

1393
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,160
 It just goes to a village and just people just want to kill him.

1394
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:27,680
 And that's the plot is that a bunch of people send them out where they go in the villages.

1395
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:30,960
 And then the village happens to have a pommel horse in the center of it.

1396
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:31,680
 Yes.

1397
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:32,560
 Right, right.

1398
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:35,200
 Because if not for that pommel horse, he's dead.

1399
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:35,700
 Yes.

1400
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:38,960
 Ballerina found to be very similar to that movie.

1401
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:43,040
 There's a ballet bar in the middle of a village.

1402
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,600
 If it weren't for that ballet bar, it should be dead.

1403
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:49,520
 One of the whole walls of the village is a mirrored wall with a ballet bar.

1404
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,440
 They have a ballet bar and a mirroring wall.

1405
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:56,160
 Good lord.

 I had one.

1409
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,320
 What was it?

1410
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:06,240
 I had thought of a joke.

1411
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:07,040
 I forgot it.

1412
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:07,440
 I did.

1413
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:08,720

1415
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,200
 Oh, shit.

01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:12,240
 No, I don't have a joke.

1417
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:13,840
 What do you think I have a joke ready for?

1418
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:14,160
 Yeah.

1419
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,360
 I don't have a joke already.

1420
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,040
 I'll finish up then.

1421
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:17,760
 No, no, no, no, no.

1422
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,840
 I'll come up with something.

01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,160
 Oh, so confusing.

01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:21,520
 Oh no.

1512
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:24,000

1518
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,920
 That's right, this show's got bills.

1519
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,320

1522
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:21,280
 Hey, that Patreon, the whole goddamn thing is about to get turned upside down on its head.

1523
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,200
 Not Patreon in general, just ours.

1524
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:24,400
 We're going to change it all up.

1525
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:25,360
 It's going to be a lot of fun.

1526
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,360
 So keep your eyes out.

1527
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:28,480
 We're changing a few things.

1528
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,800
 Huge changes.

1529
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,640
 Dogs and cats laying together.

1530
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:36,800
 Very casual pruning of our Patreon that's happening.

1531
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,960
 No, no, it's huge changes.

1532
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:44,160
 I like that technical support looks like he's giving technical support in his window there.

1533
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:45,520
 Oh, good.

1534
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:46,080
 It's legit.

1535
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,280
 The name's legit.

1536
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:48,640
 Nominative determinism.

1537
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:53,680
 Oh, he's got the company shirt on and everything.

1538
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:59,440
 All right, I want to thank Core Systems for giving me a home here.

1539
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:04,320
 Pocket some of those pressure sensors.

1540
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,200
 Pressure sensors.

1541
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:05,760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1542
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,280
 I can see that.

1543
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:10,240
 I want to thank Pendula for creating this podcast.

1544
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:12,240
 And I want you all to stay safe out there.

1545
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:13,440
 Know that we love you.

1546
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,440
 And we hope to see you soon.

1547
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:18,320
 We'll see you soon.

1548
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:41,120
 I've got a fucking fly in my face.

1549
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:43,840
 Let all these spiders live down here.

1550
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,200
 They're not doing their fucking job.

1551
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:48,800
 Maybe the squirrel ate the spiders.

1552
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:52,080
 But why would he eat the spider to swallow the fly?

1553
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,080
 I don't know why.

1554
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:54,580
 Okay.

1555
01:26:54,580 --> 01:26:56,640
 Maybe he'll fucking die.

1556
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:58,500
 Perhaps.

1557
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:01,060
 See ya!

1558
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:07,440
 There aren't many guarantees in life, but there are in life insurance.

1559
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:10,960
 If you're 50 to 85 years old, call Colonial Pen now.

 With Colonial Pen's guaranteed acceptance, there are no physicals, no health questions,

1562

 just permanent, whole life insurance designed to help cover final expenses and medical costs.

1563
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:26,560
 And as long as you pay your premiums, your policy can never be canceled.

1564
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:27,280
 That's right.

1565
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:28,640
 All those worries you have?

1566
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:31,040
 How your family will manage the bills when you're gone?

1567
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:32,560
 Will they be okay financially?

1568
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,400
 Colonial Pen is the answer.

1569
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,560
 Plans are available to fit almost any budget,

1570
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:40,080
 because cost should never be the reason you can't protect your family.

1571
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:45,120
 So again, if you're 50 to 85, call 1-800-757-4488 now

 Ages vary by state.

1578
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,560
 Once insured, your rate will never go up.

1579
01:27:58,560 --> 01:27:59,600
 You choose an option that's best for you.

1580
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:00,800
 Premium is based on the option you choose.

1581
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,000
 Benefit amount based on age and gender.

1582
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
