9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:57,340
 Several horses reportedly did not come to the Las Vegas rodeo this year because of a horse flu

10
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,760
 No, I know horse whoopies

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,320
 really

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:09,840
 Social sitting in Las Vegas, that's Matt Donnelly sitting in Pittsburgh. It's automatically sitting in Las Vegas

13
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,120
 Loaded with horse herpes. It's me. Jacob the audio guy

00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:27,840
 If you type in horse herpes Google will auto fill Las Vegas. Oh shit

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,760
 Yeah, wait a minute if you type down herpes at all Google will auto fill lost me

18
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,000
 Can they get this by like sharing a water trough and shit? Is that how bad it can be?

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,640
 That how viral it is. Where's Nick Newman when we need him?

20
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,640
 I was looking for him in the chat before we started. He's not in. Let's see

21
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,840
 No confirmed cases were reported reported in Nevada, but there is a significant equine

22
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,920
 Herpes virus outbreak affecting horse events nationwide causing major major disruptions cancellations

23
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,680
 like the all-in barrel race and

24
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:08,000
 It heightened biosecurity at the NFR rodeo, which is the one in Vegas here during early December

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,560
 so a lot of people just didn't bring their horses a lot of people just just left their animals at home and

26
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,840
 Came to the rodeo. Apparently the rodeo was really affected by it

27
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,920
 Paul says Paul Paul's Paul is right. Let's do it

28
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:30,120
 Okay, primarily directed through contact nose to nose or indirectly from shared items like tack buckets clothing and even people's hands

29
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:37,920
 Aerosol droplets or contact infected with fluids man. It's amazing how we all don't have horse herpes. This is everything

30
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,040
 I'm already looking up if it can go to

31
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,560
 People no, it's not a zoonotic jumper, please. Fuck. No

32
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,920
 I don't want horse herpes if I

33
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:57,440
 Know our next humans cannot get infected with horse herpes. Don't worry about it. Keep on fucking those horses

34
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:06,060
 Keep on the horse a fucking use a stepstool safety first people safety first. That's right. Oh good Lord

35
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,800
 Yeah, just be out there puffing it. Mr. Hands has nothing to worry about

36
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,360
 There'll be more horse herpy stuff in the new Taylor Sheridan show about the rodeo

37
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:28,900
 It'll be called it'll be called bull rider long dick man

38
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:38,080
 Speech guy Sheridan's running out of good names bull rider long dick man speech guy

39
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,800
 You know what you know what to say about riding bulls

40
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,640
 What's that? A lot of times people think it's all about those eight seconds. You got to stay on the bull

41
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,700
 Those eight seconds. Those are the least important seconds of the whole thing

42
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,280
 The most important time is when you enter the pen

43
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,360
 my secret

44
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,420
 Give that bull a little light touch behind the ear. I

45
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,240
 got a little dab of

46
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:15,100
 Hot icy cold on my finger. I give him a little rub right behind the ear with icy cold. I

47
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:21,200
 See hot and that's what he's what he's quoting. What are you quoting? I'm making up a dumb

48
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,140
 speech that he would do for this

49
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,620
 Rodeo, I thought you were quoting something but you're doing

50
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,420
 I'm improvising Matt. That's what I do. No, no, no

51
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,920
 I didn't mean to be that much of a dick about it

52
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,000
 But you didn't make me feel liberal guilt, that's why I didn't think it was a Sheridan speech

53
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:52,140
 Also to be fair, I don't I don't watch you don't watch so I don't know enough of

54
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,280
 Okay, so now I know where to go to go with. Okay. Yes

55
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,760
 I rub a little bit behind there and then when that bull knocks me off

56
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,820
 After eight seconds if I stay on there for more than eight seconds

57
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:11,200
 That bull is outlived its life and that bull is gonna become your case of fajita over at Chili's next week

58
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,000
 But you can't look at that bull and realize that's my case of for a heater coming to me

59
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,920
 You look at that bull thing. What a noble beautiful animal and all I see is the

60
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,340
 999 dinner for two special at Chili's

61
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,500
 You fucking limp tarred

62
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,360
 Enter share it at checkout

63
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,720
 Closer is that more like yes, I don't yeah close pretty that's much closer. What a dick. You're gonna watch any of those shows

64
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,640
 You would hate them Paul

65
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,600
 You would hate them I

66
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,800
 Know there was a thing is a yellow stone like lessons yellow stone

67
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,160
 there was this character a pimp like a hippie who got arrested but he became like a like a girlfriend of

68
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,560
 Kevin Costner, but like in this like pseudo, we don't like each other, but we do kind of thing

69
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:12,880
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, and her job the last season was just to get lectured by every cast member of a different aspect of Montana society

70
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,240
 It's a good gig if you can get it and at one point this one character who's a Native American

71
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,400
 Who's already was already feeling guilt about marrying into a Montana family that like, you know, it's against her Native American

72
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,080
 Uh-huh, you know, whatever she lectured her and I was like Jesus

73
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,480
 I was like everyone's breaking character just a lecture libs

74
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:37,800
 Once we torched this lib girl, we can go back to fighting about real things between our cultures

75
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,600
 But in the meantime the enemy of my enemy is my friend

76
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,120
 and

77
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,440
 There's a plot point happening in land made right now and I and I and I and I feel crazy

78
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,480
 Only because like in season one this person got a payout from the oil company like a wrongful death suit

79
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,840
 Okay, this couple this whole season this whole season

80
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,960
 They're fighting over money and I'm like weren't you paid a shitload of money from an oil company?

81
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,760
 Why isn't that coming up in conversation? Why is it coming up?

82
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,360
 You were paid out

83
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,600
 There's a large plot point last season about the large plot point that's happening right now in mayor of Kingston

84
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,880
 which I watch right now like like the pilot episode is that

85
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,080
 What's his name the guy got ran over by a snow blower in real life Oh

86
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,320
 Hawkeye Hawkeye. Yeah. Yeah. Yes

87
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,120
 So that guy he ends up becoming his brother's job because his brother gets killed in a botched robbery, right?

88
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,840
 And they went through like four seasons were like man. We haven't brought him up in a while

89
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,880
 So the last episode that they bring up his dead brother like six times

90
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,960
 So go they're really making up for the lost

91
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:47,260
 Lost bit there Jeremy Renner Jeremy Renner is who I'm thinking of. Yeah. Yeah, it's hard

92
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,040
 It's hard. He's it is

93
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,520
 Yeah, okay you talk about somebody coming away with the wrong life lessons after a near-death experience

94
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,920
 Yeah, oh

95
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:09,200
 Yes. Oh, he's just kind of doubled down on his asshole or he's a bit of a shit bird. Okay. Yeah, I

96
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,260
 How I don't know I I like Jeremy Renner a lot

97
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:19,560
 Not a lot. I like Jeremy Renner. I'd fuck him. He's gonna break your heart Matt. He

98
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,160
 It's probably true

99
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,080
 but he like

100
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,680
 like

101
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,680
 Survived on like like he and his brother were like split like a box like doughnut holes when they were like dirt poor

102
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,800
 Okay, they got by in Hollywood by like buying and flipping a house and then flipping that in other houses and doing construction

103
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,680
 So like that but like he went from like dirt as poor to like building himself up into

104
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,600
 Like a house flipper while trying to be an actor at the same time and I thought that was pretty cool that he was not

105
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,920
 Any kind of like nepo baby or anything down like he really had to like fight to stay in the business and try to make

106
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:00,280
 A go of it. So I do like it and her locker. Come on. That's a cool debut story. Sure. All right

107
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,280
 What is why is he a shipper?

108
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,160
 I get them vibes when I hear him talk. Oh

109
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,600
 Did something no, he's just kind of he's just kind of his

110
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,320
 When I get along with him, I don't give a shit about that

111
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,080
 His stance on some shit, it's a little bit

112
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:25,660
 But whatever it's all is weary Paul is weary. I'm good for him. Good for him. Do your thing make you make your money

113
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:33,860
 Poker the other day for the first time in a very long time. Yeah, and I thought I was gonna watch someone get murdered

114
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:41,160
 Oh, I was at the poker table. I thought one player was gonna murder another player tournament or open table open table

115
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:48,280
 Okay cash game. Okay, no big deal low stakes cash game one three one three. No limit cash game

116
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,840
 I

117
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,840
 Fell of it that was at the table a couple of seats down from me

118
00:09:52,840 --> 00:10:01,160
 He won a sizable pot from me got a little bit lucky on the last card drew out on the last card

119
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,560
 Nobody I'm not saying anything to him. You know, I'm do the hand ends he wins

120
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:12,360
 It's a good size hands doing yeah, you're stewing. I'm not even stewing. I'm like, oh that's over. All right. He got it

121
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,900
 He says without me saying anything. He says to me

122
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,800
 Boy, I thought you were gonna draw out on me there

123
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,480
 And I looked I looked back. I was just confused. I looked back. I was like I wait I was ahead though

124
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,600
 I was ahead until the until the last card you got the last card there and you won it

125
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:36,280
 He goes yeah. Yeah, but I was mathematically ahead already. I was supposed to win that hand already. I just wasn't ahead on the cards yet

126
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,720
 and I and I kind of laughed I kind of I kind of good because he was

127
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:47,520
 Absolutely being genuine. He was he was saying that with all sincerity. He was like that. I was supposed to win that hand

128
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,200
 I was ahead mathematically which he wasn't by the time he actually made the call

129
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,480
 He was mathematically behind when he made the call doesn't matter doesn't matter. He won the hand. I wasn't mad about it

130
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,440
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so that was that was that he was a touch of a you know a

131
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:09,320
 Scouche this much of just a bit of a jerk about it. Just uh, just not even not even a jerk

132
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,160
 I was done with it though. I so we continue playing the game

133
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,660
 I don't say anything to him about it after I got it after I figured out what he meant by that

134
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:23,080
 Didn't matter that he was wrong. I was over it moving on so about half an hour later

135
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:29,420
 I win a big hand a very big hand off of that guy. Okay

136
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:34,680
 So I made all the money back and then quite a bit more off of that guy

137
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,000
 Like I say about half an hour later

138
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,400
 Again, this person is not sitting next to me. There is a person between us

139
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:48,160
 After I win that hand, I don't say anything because I'm not stupid

140
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:56,320
 When it comes to this I'm not scenario you're in this scenario. I was not stupid at that moment. Yeah, there we go

141
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,440
 so I

142
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,040
 Don't say a word

143
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:05,320
 The person between us though looks at the guy who just lost the hell and by the way

144
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,200
 I had drawn out I had drawn out on this hand

145
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,320
 So I got a little bit lucky on this hand and the fourth card out

146
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,240
 I got a little bit lucky with that card. Well the more reason to shut up right? You got lucky. That's it. Yeah

147
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,240
 I'm just being quiet. I'm

148
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:26,440
 Stacking up my chips. I'm moving on to the next hand the guy between us looks at the guy who just lost and goes

149
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,720
 Well, that was payback for earlier, huh?

150
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,440
 And I like my head just snapped up, you know, I'm looking down I'm looking anywhere but at this guy

151
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:48,800
 My head just snaps up and I just was like I whatever is happening here. I don't want to be a part of this

152
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,520
 That's I would give a I would give a stern stop helping

153
00:12:53,520 --> 00:13:00,320
 Line to the guy over there. No, I wanted to I wanted to so badly

154
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,360
 I didn't want to open my mouth though

155
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,640
 I was afraid that if I drew any attention to myself that it was all just gonna dump on to me

156
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,240
 I've you did a party consider going

157
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,760
 Right and then high-fiving the guy

158
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:24,520
 Took the words out of my mouth

159
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:33,160
 You need to shut the fuck up

160
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,360
 Oh shit

161
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:47,400
 I was done. I couldn't hold it together anymore. I burst out laughing. You need to shut the fuck up would make me laugh really hard

162
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:56,120
 I was crying at the poker table. I had to get up and walk away. It was awful

163
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:02,240
 Because that's it like you you have to laugh at that point because

164
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
 That's all you could do. It's all you can do

165
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:12,600
 And if that guy is above the laugh line, he's about to get kicked out of the casino. Anyway, yes. Yes. Yes

166
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:18,320
 Yeah, so Jake like I I just want to make it clear that I'm not involved in whatever this conversation is over here

167
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,080
 I I think I'm gonna go home. I think I'm just gonna go home in that kind of scenario

168
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:28,160
 Can you can you just get up and go? Can you just get up and go after after any game after any hand?

169
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,920
 Open can open table you stand up any time. I feel don't you feel I have felt bad in the past

170
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,840
 I haven't played in forever, but I would feel bad after winning a pot and then leaving

171
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,520
 It's called hit and run it. You know, you're not it's bad etiquette

172
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,320
 It's also how you get money, right?

173
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,960
 it's certainly it is certainly allowed within the rules and the people who do it are

174
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:56,360
 Probably more intelligent than the other people who are still sitting at the table. I just stay there to lose

175
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,920
 But I think the D to see to take a fake phone call pretend to talk about an urgent matter

176
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:10,440
 Baby now both babies both babies at the same time

177
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:20,780
 Guys guys, I gotta go. Sorry all the baby lots of babies so many babies so many babies guys. Hey

178
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:24,560
 Great game and you need to shut the fuck up. Bye

179
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,800
 I

180
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,880
 Think I stayed for about five more minutes because I didn't know how to not leave awkwardly right? I was like I'm this is it

181
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,880
 I'm leaving

182
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:45,640
 It was so bad it was so bad I was like this you're gonna get yourself shot

183
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,800
 I'm gonna get shot just by by sitting here. I don't want to get shot

184
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,880
 I don't want to be in a fight with some random dude in a casino at 1130 at night

185
00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:00,740
 I've been sitting at a table where someone hit and run and it's not even I feel that like oh they're there

186
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,300
 You know that that lucky motherfucker

187
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:07,580
 It's more like all the money at the table is gone. Like you look like it's just a bunch of short stacks

188
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:12,040
 You're like, oh now what are we all playing for $50? Now the game is just kind of over. Yeah. Yeah

189
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,340
 But still, you know, it's it's an open table

190
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:21,960
 It's all I would have sat and played for a while longer if this guy had not

191
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,460
 Egged on the guy that I had just accidentally roughed up. Yeah. Yeah

192
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:32,280
 Yeah, the scenario the the amount of scenarios where the table and the other guy was already putting more cash down on the table

193
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,900
 Like he was staying in. Yeah, so he wasn't leaving. He wasn't going anywhere anytime soon

194
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:41,960
 Like nope. Nope, whatever's happening here. I don't want to be in it

195
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:47,640
 People going on tilts one of the weirdest things to watch and it's so hard to deal with and yes

196
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,100
 Especially at like a low stakes game. Yeah

197
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,380
 But this this is supposed to not matter, right?

198
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:01,860
 Like on on pot therapy Whitney's husband Peter. Yeah, he's a professional poker player

199
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:10,680
 and so we I always anytime I play poker, which is probably I don't know at this point three times a year I

200
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:18,760
 Go I'll play poker and often times I will end up with a story for Peter from these low stakes games because he's

201
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:25,240
 He's won three games aren't the games that he's playing but every now and then you run into a

202
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:31,160
 Professional, you know big quote-unquote professional poker player at a low stakes game

203
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,640
 Well, they all have these training apps now and they're all like these there's

204
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:44,640
 Game theory stuff. Yeah makes people do dumb things on purpose to mess with other people's math and no one's getting the cards

205
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:52,040
 And it's gotten super weird watching people do that at a low stakes game where no one is doing the math in the first place

206
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,920
 Yeah, yeah. It's like meta fuck you. Yeah

207
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:02,920
 It's it's crazy. It's just a weird crazy thing and also like, you know, and I I've been you know

208
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,040
 We've all been victims of bad beats, you know that kind of thing

209
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:16,180
 It's like it's poker for a reason, you know, like you're like, oh, yeah, I was doing the math and then gambling happened

210
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,240
 Yeah, yeah, that's the kind of like what we're doing

211
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,200
 is

212
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:28,880
 Tempting fate for bouts of luck and craziness, right? Sometimes the wrong car just comes out or the right card speaking of gambling

213
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,360
 Go ahead. What are your guys takes on the current state of?

214
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,560
 sports and

215
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:41,120
 Sort of the veneer cracking around. Oh that play was clearly somebody

216
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,440
 Covering a spread or fucking around for no good reason

217
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:50,120
 Especially the collegiate level. Well, the Raiders got a lot of heat

218
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,080
 Right. Is there gonna be is there gonna be any kind of real?

219
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:01,180
 No, because what I don't know but my consequence like you can't have a consequence if you don't know that something happened

220
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:04,320
 There's no way to tell if something happened unless somebody says like I did this

221
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,160
 I will say that I hear Paul and that like when they start loosening up all the sports gambling

222
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:16,200
 All the scenarios that everyone thought of sure came up in a hurry all the things like what if this happens what that happens?

223
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,240
 It seems of all come to a head really quickly. Oh

224
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,960
 Let me be clear. I don't think I don't think that Paul is wrong on this

225
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,880
 I think that Paul is absolutely correct on this. Oh, what's that? I don't know. I think you're absolutely correct on this

226
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,920
 I'm saying I don't know how to prove it

227
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,240
 I don't know how to I don't know how to like get anyone but like did you see that play?

228
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,840
 Like it was making being viral. I've been really intentionally not watching any football anything

229
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,040
 but there was some college game and

230
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:48,760
 The kid is running down the field with the ball and just he's got nobody in front of him

231
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,480
 He's almost the goal line. He just walks off the side

232
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,200
 Have you seen it? I?

233
00:19:54,200 --> 00:20:00,120
 Because there's so many college games. So there's so many that's things like college sports specifically, right?

234
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:05,960
 so like you can watch the NBA and the NFL you have 30 teams going at it, right or 33 to whatever and

235
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:12,000
 With college you have hundreds and hundreds of this 30 teams just in the Big Ten, right?

236
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,600
 and and

237
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:21,360
 And in those scenarios, right those those those smaller colleges where they're not making a lot of money, right?

238
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:28,240
 So like this if I had the opportunity to take two steps to the left and make $20,000. I think I'd do it

239
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
 You know, let's all right

240
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,480
 I'm in for 20. I just need a thousand people to join me

241
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,260
 You're not in for 20,000 you're in for $20, but I feel like I just feel like

242
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:51,360
 You can't trust any sport at this point on a professional level. I don't think you have here's why here's why I think you are

243
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:59,160
 Not wrong, but mistaken in the in the path that you're going down. Okay, I don't think you have to go to gambling

244
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,820
 I think you can just go to the to the legit money the quote-unquote legit money in it

245
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:08,800
 And that's all you have like I don't well, yes, and that's gambling side of it

246
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,920
 I'll think you have to go to the dark money to find the crazy shit

247
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,160
 Oh my god, I was laughing so hard in college football. It's it's getting nuts

248
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,480
 Yeah, and Indiana the mean that's going around is like Indiana's been terrible football for 150 years

249
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,240
 You can pay players and suddenly they're good. They're like

250
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,200
 Indiana was the only only college playing by the rules for the last 150 years

251
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:34,600
 And I was laughing because Indiana won a crazy game against Ohio State and both right players are interviewed

252
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,320
 We're like I want to thank God. I want to thank our Lord God Lord God Lord God

253
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,660
 And I was like buddy you have the highest payroll

254
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:44,440
 You could thank old Johnny greenbacks

255
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,680
 You want to thank your river of money of boosters

256
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:58,280
 God which is what I call all of my sugar daddies here at Indiana University. Thank you God

257
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,400
 No, it's gonna college football is gonna get weird

258
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:10,120
 College football is about to get bizarre because the amount of money that's going into that through like the legit channels

259
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,880
 Yeah, it's it's so much money. It's yeah, it's gonna be great

260
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,960
 Oh, yeah, and then Andy has mentioned the transfer portal that being able to transfer from from team to team much more easily now. Oh

261
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,560
 Yeah, but coach. Oh, yeah

262
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,200
 Like coaches leave teams with like I'm gonna leave this twelve million dollar a year job

263
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,440
 Even though I was I thought I was trying to kind of stay for ten years

264
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:39,080
 I'm gonna leave because I was gonna pay me even more money like you can't there's no these contracts mean nothing. Yeah

265
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:47,760
 Even more infinite money than protein right, but there's 32 NFL teams, right?

266
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,680
 Yeah, just 30 I think it's 32

267
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,520
 So like if you're like the 33rd or 34th best quarterback, right?

268
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,880
 you can now make money by staying at a

269
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,880
 University, yeah playing quarterback in college, right? If you just want to stay at Michigan

270
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:15,680
 So what's gonna happen make more money playing at Michigan than you can backing up at the New England Patriots?

271
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:21,640
 What's gonna happen would just make sense for me to play six seven or eight years at Michigan. That's what I'm wondering is gonna

272
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:27,000
 That's what that's where it's gonna get gonna have 35 years playing college ball, right?

273
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,200
 I mean a Chador Sanders is a good example of one. He's playing for the for the Cleveland Browns now

274
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,600
 he

275
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:40,520
 When when the draft happened, he's a rookie this year when the draft happened the place that he got drafted at

276
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,320
 They said point-blank. They were like he could have made more money if he had just stayed another year in college

277
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,600
 Yeah, but if he had got drafted in the NFL

278
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,560
 Yeah, they just say it there's like, oh, yeah, he he could have made more money if he had stayed it

279
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:58,200
 He played at the University of Colorado. They either just stayed there and made more money that would have just been it

280
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,280
 Yeah

281
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,920
 Logan copper scale and chat says isn't isn't youth league in high school football following got a favor for safer sports

282
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,920
 Yes

283
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:16,280
 And a large in the large part. Yes, but for the less glorious positions like linemen and things like that are you're finding?

284
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,640
 It's harder and harder to find these quality people want to sacrifice their bodies for for the thankless positions

285
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,800
 Well again, I can't I can't say it enough like that that

286
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:32,080
 Aaron Hernandez special segment that last podcast did they did. Yeah three episodes on him. Yeah, and

287
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,200
 both

288
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,720
 Marcus and Ed were like we came up as youth people young men playing football and

289
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,940
 They talked about the horrors of it through high school and all that kind of stuff and it's just it's you know

290
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,200
 It really it was insane. Well, it changed their mind was insane

291
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,640
 they've been they've been football like Ed has been a football fan forever like Miami Dolphins is like part of his

292
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,400
 Identity as a human being and he's now just now after all this

293
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,320
 This this podcast this little podcast run and doing research in it

294
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:11,600
 He's really just starting to change his mind around the CTE and the dangers of the sport and just the inhumanity of it

295
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,400
 My brother was captain of his football team in the high school

296
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,320
 Mm-hmm, and he tells stories that I'm still afraid to repeat here now

297
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:27,000
 Like really that went down like that would be a crazy

298
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:35,960
 Scandal. Yes. Yeah, there are there are things that happened on a regular basis on the on the teams at my high school

299
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,200
 That people would go to jail for now

00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,960
 Works at the John wick experience

346
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:20,620
 Okay, broad area 15 area 15 and every 15 and they

00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,040

349
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,080
 brought in a sex doll as

350
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,920
 Oh

351
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,160
 Okay. Okay. Are they married?

352
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,640
 They had a backstory. I don't know the backstory

353
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:45,560
 Was he carrying the doll or was it in like was it in like a wheelbarrow? What are we talking about here?

354
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:54,120
 It was our arm arm wrapped around the shoulder arm around the waist scary

355
00:29:54,120 --> 00:30:00,040
 It was like a like a baby monkey. It was wrapped on him like a baby monkey. Yeah, no

356
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,560
 Don't go wrapping your sex doll around you like a baby monkey. That's

357
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,480
 Yeah, stick to the rivers in the streams that you're used to

358
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:14,600
 Did you carry your kids like baby monkeys? I carried whatever way they wanted. I carried them every which way I could what's what was best

359
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,040
 Was it arms over shoulders or legs over shoulders? That's easier, right?

360
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,320
 Legs over shoulders is easier, right?

361
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,120
 fireman's carry in a pinch

362
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,600
 Okay

363
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,600
 Like if there's a fire. Yeah

364
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,900
 Some kids rest easy on the hip and some don't it's a weird thing

365
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:35,560
 So one of my kids was very easy to just hold on the hip and one of my kids was could not it was just it was

366
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,520
 Uncomfortable for both of us couldn't stay there didn't like it. So what was the solution?

367
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,660
 Stop stop walking. Stop raising him. Stop loving him. Stop. Sure. Sure. Sure. Yeah

368
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,760
 Clearly we're genetically incompatible

369
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,740
 Put him on ice flow. He knows I mean, I think he's doing great. I don't know

370
00:30:53,740 --> 00:31:02,840
 Happen to Matt's third son, it's our new favorite segment a baby that didn't fit on Matt's hip

371
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,920
 These are the reasons Matt throws away kids. Oh

372
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:12,040
 I don't want to I don't want to I was gonna argue Mike Nelson, but my doesn't says yes

373
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,040
 Me my real dog loves John wick and we had to go see

374
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,920
 So, okay

375
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,160
 So somebody pulls up with a wheelbarrow with a real doll

376
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:25,880
 What's this allowed and they said they said as the basis said as long as you pay for two tickets

377
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,920
 We don't you can do whatever you want. And so they made him pay for a second

378
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:36,040
 But but

379
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,600
 The doll is taking up the space number one and number two

380
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,560
 Doesn't that reinforce his dream?

381
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:47,180
 Yes more that's that's what I was gonna say. I was like, I bet he I bet he like

382
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:50,300
 I'm sure he's like, oh second ticket, of course. I'll have to pay

383
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:54,280
 I'm still assuming he was it a she

384
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:59,560
 Was a guy with it was a guy with a girl doll. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's what okay

385
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:06,200
 I mean, I mean, yeah, that's that's what it was being over girl. It was Jimmy slow. Nina Jimmy. So Nina. Oh lord

386
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:12,640
 She scoop Jesus says the lady will be paying

387
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,180
 I

388
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:24,880
 Put the money in her hand and like shakes it off on the counter to different debit cards

389
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:36,520
 Today I treat my man like a prince he carried me like a baby monkey

390
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:43,360
 Apparently he did speak in her voice for different parts stop it. Yeah

391
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,320
 Stop it. No, I'm so happy

392
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,020
 No, no, no, no, no, no

393
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:54,620
 Sometimes I think the John wick movies are a little over the top

394
00:32:54,620 --> 00:33:00,600
 But I really like like the the character and his motivation over the death of his dog

395
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,860
 It was just an emotional connection to his wife

396
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,460
 Sorry, my wife's been drinking. I'm so

397
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:13,520
 My liquor speaking of liquor it's been a minute

398
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,320
 No, take me to the bathroom and rough up this bus bus. I

399
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:25,160
 Don't try rub it

400
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,400
 You better put your mouth where my money is and by money

401
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:34,040
 I mean pussy hole and by pussy hole. I mean strange plastic cavern that needs cleaning

402
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:41,160
 Built-in flashlight, okay, you wish it was a built-in flashlight this

403
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:48,200
 It's basically Saran wrap. Oh, no

404
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:54,360
 Crisco at this point

405
00:33:54,360 --> 00:34:07,860
 When the robotic parts of my bus bus went failure town and he just replaced he placed my innards with Saran

406
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:11,860
 Crisco and Crisco was a poor choice for some

407
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,520
 Oh

408
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:34,660
 My horrible innards attract flies and you can't tell where the Crisco starts and the old cum stops

409
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:38,460
 So, you know clean up is not a breeze as it were

410
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:42,840
 Okay

411
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,120
 I never want to hear the phrase

412
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,720
 calm again, I

413
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:55,520
 Want that to be the only time in my life. I hear old come where does the Crisco stop any old come start?

414
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,520
 I don't know

415
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,720
 Not okay with that

416
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:09,360
 Yeah, at one point he drops her. Oh god. Yeah. Oh what happened eyes popped out

417
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:19,080
 I can't believe what I'm seeing at the John wick experience. I

418
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:26,960
 Can't believe my eyes and this is where it gets weird up into this point

419
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,920
 Not weird. This is where it gets weird. Yep

420
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,800
 he quickly

421
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,120
 again third hand story

422
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,480
 Pockets the eyes

423
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,560
 Picks him up puts him in the pocket. Oops, okay

424
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:47,360
 Still carries around the island's doll for the rest of the experience. Oh

425
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:51,680
 Doesn't go about putting the eyes back in no because

426
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:57,520
 He knows there's a possibility of a second drop and he's lucky to have fished him out when he did

427
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:04,680
 Maybe yeah, it's like I bet cuz I bet those things are I bet those are probably some of the more expensive parts of the doll

428
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,520
 also

429
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,520
 He's fucking those eye holes. I

430
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,600
 That thank you. Thank you for saying it before I had

431
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,720
 That doll is getting skull fuck

432
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,640
 Those eyes are not supposed to come out

433
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:26,460
 What was I supposed to do your honor not fuck those eye holes

434
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:30,200
 Real eye popping experience

435
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,320
 Experience

436
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:40,480
 Supernova girl if you'd seen the kind of mascara she was wearing your honor. She was asking for it. Oh

437
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,680
 Has anyone done a ventriloquist act with a real doll?

438
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:52,000
 Who's that Lorgren Lorgren, that's that's a great idea. I don't know

439
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 Yeah, it is it's it's super it's super

440
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,640
 uncomfortable funny to imagine a whole a whole doll there

441
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:09,120
 Cuz cuz it could start off like kind of normal then real quick and just be all about you do terrible things to me

442
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:13,360
 In the night all the time you do the most horrible shit

443
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:18,640

00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,400
 Kill me

461
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:15,680
 I'm tired of having raw beef inside of my asshole for this man to fuck on

462
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,520
 I'm glad I got that nice and clean as a drop

463
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,520
 Oh, it's not gonna be a clean drop tonight

464
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:35,340
 That's the worst part I wouldn't mind if it was all just you know, but but this is what becomes dinner later

465
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:39,640
 He squeezes it out of me and fries it up in a pan. I

466
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,320
 Can put on the bacon

467
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:48,160
 Do anything else while while they were going through the John wick experience

468
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:53,120
 Well, somebody was asking was it dressed what did you get a description of the clothing?

469
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,120

470
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:01,960
 Like a like a sex dress. What was it? Nymph fish like dress. Yeah, like it was nymph fish

471
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:07,480
 What are you saying? Yes nymph like nymph fishy pixie. Oh

472
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:13,680
 Like I can't okay elf, maybe the elephant. Well, did it have elf ears?

473
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,920
 How the elf would I know?

474
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:22,400
 Good joke now stop abusing my nose cavity

475
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,680
 Filthy penis please

476
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,880
 Please

477
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:36,560
 My sinuses my sinuses look like mammoth cave with stalactites of your old dried gum

478
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,620
 You know, you're never getting that shit out of my cranium

479
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:46,920
 That's true Paul

480
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,600
 This is a good time to remind people that we have an obelisk scheme if you're looking for

481
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,400
 Person or one person only to turn on to this podcast

482
00:40:53,400 --> 00:41:04,440
 Have to check out the sex talk complaining about abuse and old gum. There you go

483
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:17,320
 Eleven thousand dollars

484
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:23,260
 For what I should have asked you how much do you think a real doll costs?

485
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:28,120
 Number that seems cheap. No

486
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:37,480
 Pay for your real dolls Paul. I've looked into their pricing and like 20 so he's had like an economy model

487
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:44,160
 He's basically fucking a you go. I don't know what he that's not just looking at the website here

488
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,480
 I don't know the first one. He's yeah, he's out there fucking you goes

489
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,820
 You want man, especially if you're gonna take her out in public. You better be having a Maserati

490
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:58,020
 Yeah, it didn't have need heated seats. That's right. Nick. You got you gotta have one

491
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:02,240
 It's got those built-in warmers because there's nothing worse than 3 a.m

492
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:07,880
 Sliding it in to some cold roast beef inside that butthole. Oh

493
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:12,960
 Nothing worse than that Paul. I mean I have a single thing worse than that

494
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,280
 well, what's worse is after you bust and then you you forget and they turn her over and then you end up in the wet spot and

495
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,840
 It's like well, this is all my fault. How much for just raw doll

496
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:29,600
 Matt I think what you'd be interested in is the torso model

497
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:39,320
 Just torso that is very much an availability. I don't want any lip. I don't want

498
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,960
 I

499
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,440
 Bob says Leon

500
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:55,360
 Buying of course they do buying a real doll now is like buying a BlackBerry in 2003 like it's just

501
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:59,320
 we're about to get fucking crazy with

502
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:08,480
 You think this is this is a dumb invest or or is this a smart move Matt and a BlackBerry might be a smart

503
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,480
 Cuz don't you want a dumb real doll?

504
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:16,520
 You don't want this thing fucking spying on you and killing you in your sleep. These things are according to their website

505
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,700
 They already have AI vaginas

506
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:29,080
 No, Jacob you've misread that it's a one because of all the raw beef that's crammed in there a little a little steak sauce

507
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:33,160
 Gets get things moving. It's an a one vagina

508
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:39,960
 We're not on Twitch, right?

509
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,080
 Which oh, yeah, I haven't put pictures of these real dolls. They're fighting up on

510
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:51,780
 Like I've definitely found some pictures of just the torsos, of course

511
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:57,960
 Or as they call it on this website the Donnelly I mean

512
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,600
 Jacob you drive a scooter half the time. I don't like the Donnelly Harold and I don't like the Donnelly torso either

513
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:08,040
 You know, we don't get to name our legacies

514
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,320
 No, it's not the episode title fuck you guys

515
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:29,140
 Well, you have to have a really active imagination to go just torso like you know, it's not it's not about that it's about

516
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:33,560
 Think about having to mess around with the legs all the time

517
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:37,120
 Yeah, no, that's what I say to my wife all the time

518
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:45,480
 Do it save several steps? What steps does it save?

519
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:51,800
 It saves moving giant metal poles out of your way for your date, that's what

520
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,920
 Come over here Bob

521
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:07,160
 What a world but do you think do you think those kids are gonna last I vaginas he said

522
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,480
 I don't know what that means. I I've been looking on their website to see what that means

523
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:18,740
 They just call it that and then if it's like it's like it's like would you like me to keep trying to slobber it up?

524
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:22,160
 No, I came I'd like to go to bed now. All right, would you like me to print out different techniques?

525
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,840
 I'd like to possibly do your wiener some other time

526
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:35,560
 If you want to tell you several jokes about vaginas and magicians since you're a magician the AI

527
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:40,960
 Vagina, I would like that you put your dick in the AI vagina and Will Smith is in there to fight it

528
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,240
 That's the AI vagina

529
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:50,160
 You go you go to go down there and it's just like oh hell no

530
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:57,200
 Keep my AI vagina out of your mouth

531
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,360
 There is a whole help page here

532
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:19,880
 Vagina yes or no nothing on this website says what that is though Jacob. What the fuck is that?

533
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,880
 Please look up the torso facts

534
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:27,960
 What are the frequently asked facts? What are the frequently asked questions about the robot or so?

535
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,040
 Matt do you have any?

536
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,960
 I could I could just you know guess

537
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,240
 No, no

538
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:46,160
 Frequently asked questions section about the torso only doll. Okay. Well, just what are some of the people with no questions?

539
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:54,280
 Those men know what they want and they don't want to shut up ship it torso, please

540
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,800
 Let's go go

541
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:02,360
 Torso engage. There's a whole there is a whole section on storage and maintenance though

542
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:09,040
 Okay, and the first question is the first frequently asked question is how do I style my dolls hair? Oh

543
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,280
 Man, I know I don't

544
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,120
 Could you take it to a salon?

545
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,680
 sure

546
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,880
 Like you know like like it's like I always talk about this with Donnie Marie

547
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,960
 It's like the fact that like you make all these incest jokes about them

548
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,440
 That's not the part that grosses you out is not the sexual tension

549
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:29,760
 It's when they're actually brother and sisterly that you're like, oh, this is weird

550
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:34,920
 Yeah, these these older adults being like teasy brother and sister is so weird

551
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:42,560
 For instance the actual most disturbing part of the real doll website is the storage tips, right?

552
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,780
 That's it. It's it's the X's and O's that are the sex parts like a given

553
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:52,880
 But now it's the X's and O's. Let me just read this sentence to you and see if you can just

554
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,120
 Contain yourself. Okay for best maintenance of your doll

555
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:03,560
 It should preferably be stored hanging in a neutral position with legs lightly spread

556
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:06,120
 from the provided neck bolt

557
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:15,840
 You hang the leg by the neck bolt with the legs slightly spread so that things can dry out

558
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:23,880
 Yeah, and make sure you remove the neck bolt when you're using the doll or when it is lying down

559
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:31,160
 Mm-hmm. Okay, and then it goes on to talk about avoiding creases in the silicone as that can cause creases

560
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,400
 How much for just the neck both?

561
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:45,080
 Hang your real doll by her neck bolt, please

562
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:50,240
 And I will see that you really love her

563
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,720
 Hang your real doll

564
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,160
 Neck bolt in the closet for me. Oh my god

565
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,720
 Yeah, it's a it's a

566
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:06,480
 Careful now Jacob, we're on a rate of ship. We're I know that's why I showed you a picture of clothes

567
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,360

570
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:27,200
 Alright, I mean it'd be a good way to just

00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:35,600
 Change up the conversations when you're going home, right? Oh real a real buddy talking about anything else except you bringing a real doll to Christmas

572
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:40,000
 Nobody's talking about politics, right? I mean politics is done. It's just a

573
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,360
 Fucking a mannequin. I don't I don't fuck that that goes on my front lawn that goes on my own

 Great. Share it a second that new masters universe movie is looking like it might be. Okay, Dolph Lundgren. Oh

600
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,800
 No, I don't know if he might have a cameo in there or not. I

601
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:23,440
 Know, you know Jared Leto is the one kind of flying the ointment, but they're saying he's Skeletor, right?

602
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:29,400
 Yep, but they're saying it's it's it's it's getting fairly positive buzz so far. All right, we'll see who knows

603
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:34,360
 Did he quit? I don't think so. All right, that would be the way to go bossy if he quit

604
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:41,400
 It would be a big positive buzz, but no, I don't think so, but we'll see. All right, so explain to us AI vagina, please

605
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,760
 According to this. Oh

606
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,280
 Boy, I

607
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:51,520
 Would show you videos of it, but twitch would ban us

608
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:58,140
 Like the the mouth movements come on which is just science

609
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,400
 Come on

610
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:06,320
 The the things they move their mouths around but it's it looks like they're kind of

611
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:14,680
 okay, they don't look sexy when they're moving their mouth around they look like a a crack addict with their

612
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:18,220
 They're moving their mouth around like they're grinding their teeth

613
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:29,120
 On the best day, would you trust a fake robot mouth with your dick? Nope, no me neither. No, what the fuck?

614
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:38,160
 Dollars for a dick a keen like a simplified toy. You asked that question so backwards Paul. Okay, what's the question?

615
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:44,640
 How ignorant you are? All right, what's the question? Would you like to have safe sex with a meth head? That's the question

616
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:50,920
 No is the answer no

617
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,480
 I don't think there is safe sex with a man head

618
00:53:53,480 --> 00:54:00,040
 Don't worry the head and mouth both contain safety mechanisms to lock the neck and mouth in place

619
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,520
 When needed for posing or for rough play? Oh

620
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:10,680
 No, what so don't worry about it ball. It's all taken care of. No, this doesn't know

621
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:16,320
 I don't want the words rough play and my dick connected in the same sentence

622
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:20,980
 This is this is some pen talking about permanent damage

623
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:23,440
 Acceptable. Yeah

624
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,440
 Shit. No, thank you

625
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,880
 Permanent damage. Okay, that was the phrase right?

626
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,680
 Jesus Christ. I

627
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:35,920
 Permanent damage. Okay, how much do these things weigh? This doesn't look like it's a lightweight thing

628
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,140
 I'm just imagining carrying this through the John wick experience

629
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:43,000
 Yeah, that's that's your that's your

630
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,480
 Your gym time, I guess that maybe makes up for it a little bit that you don't have to go to the gym that day

631
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:54,280
 I guess like I can't find just a I just want to wait of what all these things are and they can't be nothing

632
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:58,000
 That's really terrifying all of its terrifying. Yeah

633
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:04,600
 Oh the AI vagina looks like it's basically just a flesh light with a little motor type thing in there

634
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:09,060
 So it can it can move around a little bit and the reason they call them AI is because you can like

635
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:11,860
 Plug it into some software that will

636
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:16,880
 quote-unquote sync up with something you're watching on TV or

637
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,280
 Okay, right like stuff like that

638
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:27,440
 Like it'll it'll do that or or it can be remotely controlled by some operator somewhere

639
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,880
 So you don't have say on to how it's jerking your we've got a patreon level for that

640
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:35,800
 I mean absolutely and I think it's like we keep waiting for the moment

641
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:41,280
 We're gonna declare that AI has gained its own consciousness and I think it'd be funny if it starts with the robot vaginas first

642
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:47,480
 Well, I mean I see that would not be good for us bossy is dead on here, you know

643
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:51,860
 Porn is always the forward part in tech. He's looking forward to the torn dick horror stories

644
00:55:53,560 --> 00:56:00,480
 I'm with you. No, but it's absolutely right you you from the days of the printing press you want to know where technology is going

645
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:08,280
 What technology allows the dissemination of porn most easily and cheaply that is where tech is going

646
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,280
 That was what won the VHS

647
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:14,500
 Beta war it's a lot of things. Yeah, if if

648
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:22,040
 That's a weird thing with streaming racing to the first a AI sex pot the cheapest one is that we're gonna figure out

649
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,200
 Yeah

650
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,200
 Seems a good way to become billionaires guys

651
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:35,120
 Excuse me after I have to leave right now, you know what they say build a better cock trap and the world will beat off to

652
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,940
 your door

653
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,940
 They do say that

654
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:49,400
 That's a Franklin bon mot right there

655
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:59,480
 Well, that's one piece of information that Paul has but he probably doesn't have any others so he's gonna lose a jock versus nerd, okay

656
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,480
 Of real dolls and AI

657
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:33,280
 We got a scooping to come into us from Smitty scoop the cat the categories are

658
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,520
 Pennsylvania geography potpourri and second chance

659
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:42,400
 Smitty you sent an email along with this that I already lost. I don't worry about that

660
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:48,200
 Basically, we're all real close for the year. We're all real close on the Smitty stats for the year

661
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,200
 It's any of our games for the year

662
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:53,640
 It's me first. I'll try potpourri 400

663
00:57:53,640 --> 00:58:01,120
 Richard Hager of Wichita Falls, Texas was just certified by Guinness as the oldest bus driver in the world

664

00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:09,720
 Oldest bus driver. I

666
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:13,780
 Bet he's 95. Let's say 95 good guess

667
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:17,340
 It is 95. He said he planned to retire at 95

668
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:23,120
 but now he plans to just keep driving for as long as he remains healthy and able okay, which definitely is not an

669
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:28,420
 Indication of how our retirement system is going in this country. Paul America is a horror show

670
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:31,240
 second chance for 400

671
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:40,000

 I'll pass cuz I cannot remember what this was that passes the map. I

677
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:09,120

678
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:14,160

752
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:36,720
 Name the song you consider me the young apprentice caught between the cilia and

753
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:42,800
 Godress hypnotized by you if I should linger staring at the ring around your finger

754
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:47,720
 I have only come here seeking knowledge things. They would not teach me in college

755
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,880

763
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:20,960
 I think there's two scooper dees left. I think both of them are out there to double their doubles rather

764
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,000
 Double daily doubles listen to me playing the wrong game

765

 I'll go with Potsdam a Potsdam

773
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:13,360
 I'm sorry, it's Potsville

774
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:21,560
 In 1993 isn't it all family purchased the Cardinals and began claiming the 1925 NFL championship and fighting any attempts to recognize

775
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:23,880
 the Potsville Maroons

776
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,320
 1925 NFL championship

777
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:29,120
 Is that where the water maroon phrase came from?

778
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,680
 Maybe let's say yes

779
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:37,520
 As far as I know it is okay. That's me. I'll try geography 800

780
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:45,040
 North Carolina is the closest point of land to what British overseas territory, which is an archipelago

781
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:48,320
 consisting of 181 islands

782
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:54,760
 Is that the Virgin Islands

783
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:59,160
 Virgin Islands Oh

784
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:02,320
 Bermuda Bermuda

785
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:09,460
 181 I'm pretty apparently I'm just learning that too Paul. You're up second chance for 1200

786
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:14,240
 Daily double

787
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:19,280
 Yes, let's go into the fire name this song

788
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:25,280
 So she tells him she must go out for the evening to comfort an old friend who's feeling down

789
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:32,540
 But he knows where she's going as she's leaving. She's heading for the cheat inside of town hint. It's not Ruby

790
01:08:33,120 --> 01:09:03,080
 Hmm. Oh, uh, oh, uh, amethyst. No, was this? This wasn't Jolene. Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene. I'll try Jolene. I'll try Jolene. Let's try Jolene. Lion eyes, the eagle.

791
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:13,480
 Lion eyes, the eagle. Jolene of the music world. Sure. Matt, um, Pennsylvania geography or second chance.

792
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:20,080
 Jacob's running away with this. Running away with this with zero points. I have zero points and a commanding lead.

793
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:32,240
 Geography, please. For 1200. Name the four U.S. states that meet at the Four Corners Monument, the only Quadra point in the U.S.A.

794
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:52,840
 I've done this before. Yep. And I forget. Yep. Idaho, Montana, Montana. I think it's, I think Nebraska. There it is. Italy. Yeah, I think that's it.

795
01:09:52,840 --> 01:10:00,640
 Venice. Venice is the fifth one that nobody talks about. Is it Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Idaho?

796
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:15,720
 Is Nevada one of them? Maybe I'm wrong. All right, pass. Oh, I'm passing. Paul. Pass a Rooney. Let's see. Clockwise from top left, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona.

797
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:26,560
 All right, then. All right, I've just clicked off that screen. Can either of you two name the four states that are in the Four Corners?

798
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:36,840
 Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and Idaho. I think that must be correct. It's me. I'll try geography for 2000. It wasn't right. I got it wrong.

799
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:52,240
 On 11/25/2025, the U.N. announced that what city had just passed Tokyo to become the most populous city/metro area in the world. The Dhaka, Bangladesh, Jakarta, Indonesia, New Delhi, India or Shanghai, China.

800
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:57,480
 I mean, those all seem like they could be it. Yeah, they do.

801
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:05,000
 Oh, this is just a just a few days ago. I have no idea that I passed. Paul, I will guess.

802
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:10,000
 Bangladesh. Let's try it. Hey.

803
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:21,920
 Jakarta, Jakarta, 42 million, Dhaka, 37 million, New Delhi, 30 million and Shanghai, 30 million.

804
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:30,920
 Paul, you're up. You got Pennsylvania or second chance? Second chance, baby. Let's keep going. For 800. It's another daily double. Stop it.

805
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:41,680
 Stop all the engines. Which of the Golden Girls actors had the most husbands? B. Arthur, Betty White, Estelle Getty or Rue McClanahan? I believe it was B. Arthur.

806
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:44,280
 I don't think it was.

807
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:47,800
 Nope, it's Rue McClanahan. It really was Rue McClanahan.

808
01:11:52,240 --> 01:12:05,760
 Matt, you got Pennsylvania for 800 or 1200. What would you like? Well, I'm I'm firmly in second. You are. I love that I got all the ones wrong before again. I'll do Pennsylvania, 1200. Learning nothing.

809
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:20,000
 Which of the following cities is not actually located in Pennsylvania, but instead is in New York and is the home of a SUNY school, S-U-N-Y school. SUNY. Is that Postom? SUNY school. Postom, Pots Town or Potsville?

810
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:31,600
 Let's go. Potsdom. Potsdom is correct. There we go. Hooray. Click on one of these buttons that says somebody got it right. That's a fun change.

811
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:49,320
 And I'm closing out the category end the game. Potsylvania for 800. Jacob, this is for positive points. It's high stakes. This is this is only for positive points. The Hill School, an elite college prep boarding school is located in which city? Potsdom, Pots Town or Potsville?

812
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:56,320
 I mean, I got to guess. I got it. I got to guess one. I'm going to say be Pots Town. I think that's the only one we haven't used.

813
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:10,000
 It is Pots Town and I have positive points and the win. I win today with 800 points. Matt, you're in second place. No worries, big guy. You've got negative 2000 points.

814
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:35,600
 And Paul in there bringing up the rear with negative 6800 points. That's from Smitty Scoop. Thank you Smitty Scoop.

01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:48,080
 Well, maybe, maybe just all torso. Um, I want to thank you for a while. All the people who support us at the show. Can you take just the torso to the job? My experience?

816
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:53,680
 Well, then you won't have to worry about the eyeballs. Just buy a ticket. That's all they want.

817
01:13:53,680 --> 01:14:02,680
 I can't believe they made him buy a ticket. I love it. Um, I want to thank all the people who support us and support the show. I mean, this show has to keep going.

818
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:15,680

820

 We will name it after you. It'll be a whole thing right over there. Preaching fund dot com farts in a bag dot biz, a churn torso and Jake could have a Mondays and Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays.

822
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:20,560
 Not at all. Paul's not getting it. Not after putting Crisco in the last one.

823
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:24,000
 You couldn't tell where the Crisco started.

824
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:32,400
 Yeah. Thanks everybody for listening. Stacey, I'm out there. We love you and we'll see you soon.

825
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:42,040
 I was afraid doing a double today would make a weird one for the second one, but I think we don't wait for that one to kick.

826
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:44,840
 It's easy. It's always easy to come up with good stuff.

827
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:52,480
 We double it up on Friday too. We are.

828
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:57,720
 Let's dance it with the devil. Ride the devil.

829
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,320
 Preaching Fund.

830
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:09,720
 They charged him for a fucking ticket to carry a doll around with him.

831
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,240
 So gross.

832
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:16,520
 The more I think of it, the more I'm just like, oh, the people at John Wick experience were just being mean to that guy.

833
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:20,720
 Also took him to the Sphere. So that was another, that's a really expensive ticket.

834
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:22,320
 That's a fucking ticket there.

835
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,920
 Hope you put her eyes back in.

836
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:28,200
 Well, otherwise she wouldn't be able to enjoy it.

837
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:31,760
 That's exactly right. He might enjoy it, but not her.

838
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,160
 (laughing)

839
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,000
 Bye.
