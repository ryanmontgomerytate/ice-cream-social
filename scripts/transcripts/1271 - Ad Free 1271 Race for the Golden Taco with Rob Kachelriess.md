**[0:01:24]** Three for me where we've had snow and I can't go out

**[0:01:29]** It's fucking freezing cold and I can't go out and clean up the backyard from the dog poop and with four dogs

**[0:01:36]** Pooping all the time. It's a lot of dog poop

**[0:01:38]** And so when I go out to do anything in the yard like change up birdseed or anything that Anne needs me to do

**[0:01:45]** So I try to stay the hell out of the backyard when there's nothing but dog poop and it's freezing

**[0:01:49]** I have to come back in and spend another 10 minutes cleaning my shoes off from all the skank that gets on my shoes

**[0:01:55]** I'm trying super careful. I try to dodge it like landmines. I can't miss it

**[0:01:59]** You have there's an amount of dog poop in your backyard that it is impossible for you to walk around it

**[0:02:05]** It's close because they like that area that leads right up. Oh, it's one spot. It's kind of makes more kind of a zone

**[0:02:13]** Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. No, the entirety of my backyard is not filled with dog shit

**[0:02:18]** I was like, holy Jesus. How often are you cleaning? I'm cleaning every week, but this is two weeks in a row

**[0:02:23]** I haven't been able to so right. It's a lot. It's a backup, but it's also frozen

**[0:02:28]** So what are you gonna do? I got to invest in some new fucking boots

**[0:02:31]** But yeah, here I am start a business of frozen dog poop pickup for other people's houses

**[0:02:36]** Gross. Yeah. No, thanks. Did I tell you guys actually had a couple kids come by

**[0:02:40]** Back when we got our first like three inch hit and they just rang the doorbell. Hey, can we clean your driveway?

**[0:02:46]** I'll be a three inch hit right now

**[0:02:48]** He said can we clean your driveway off for a little bit of money? I said hey house 20 bucks

**[0:02:51]** They're like, let's get it. Let's do it and they did it and it saved my fucking hole

**[0:02:55]** It's like this is amazing. This is

**[0:03:01]** America I'm telling you this is what it's all about

**[0:03:03]** But here I am freezing my took us off and then I read Vegas is having record high temperatures

**[0:03:10]** Oh record highs. Yes. So while you're in the middle of a triple volt

**[0:03:15]** polar vortex, yes is

**[0:03:18]** Which is a very rare event, but it's caused all of the Arctic atmosphere to move to send upon your your town

**[0:03:25]** To send upon rural, Pennsylvania. We are slowly building an El Nino over here

**[0:03:30]** Which is creating warming temperatures and bringing them over here to create one of the most warm and dry

**[0:03:37]** Decembers in Vegas history. Yeah, it's the combo you want. Yeah

**[0:03:42]** So this this Saturday love it dry El Nino or El Nino. I forget which one creates it warm

**[0:03:48]** El Nino versus the polar vortex the battle for the century

**[0:03:53]** Ding ding ding ding ding. Let's go

**[0:03:56]** warm and dry was actually the original name of Matt Mattingly and it is the primary designation for the kind of sex robot you want

**[0:04:04]** That is, you know, the first and foremost. Is it warm and dry?

**[0:04:08]** Just torso and just torso warm and dry torso by Matt. I

**[0:04:15]** Just I just got back from my kids Christmas concert and I say concert because

**[0:04:20]** Basically say my air quotes. Yes, because there's a music program and

**[0:04:26]** a couple things one is that this year out of nowhere someone started a

**[0:04:32]** Cheerleading program at the school to teach kids how to cheer. I

**[0:04:36]** Thought you're gonna during the showcase. There was some kind of

**[0:04:40]** We're sitting there go music go music go

**[0:04:46]** I don't know. So that's it. So they never have had a cheerleading program for no

**[0:04:52]** No, no, no, but it's important to teach coeds first through fifth grade. I believe it was all girls in it

**[0:04:58]** I did not see a boy in it. They were gonna they were gonna make it coed

**[0:05:02]** But they decided that Matt's son would be too good

**[0:05:06]** Another thing as soon as they say they didn't wanna. Yeah. Well Keelers the kid cheer captain now, right? I mean

**[0:05:13]** Cool

**[0:05:14]** Kiela's going up on you Paul Kiela's grown up on you, buddy

**[0:05:16]** He's not in that school anymore. Kiela is gonna come back and be the coach. He's in a different school

**[0:05:24]** Yeah, oh no, baby's baby's getting old I got it wrong is that yeah La Nina not El Nino

**[0:05:31]** Nina yeah. Yeah, is that a

**[0:05:35]** Directional wind

**[0:05:38]** Declination, what's the difference? I'll give you a directional wind

**[0:05:44]** What is a Madonna title right? Yeah, it's like El Nino. Yeah

**[0:05:50]** and so before

**[0:05:55]** Before the concert was to begin we had to do 15 minutes of just watching them do cheers for cheering sake

**[0:06:02]** Do cheering was it at least Christmas theme cheers. Nope

**[0:06:13]** Children just go like you know be aggressive be aggressive. Yes

**[0:06:19]** Like just watch that for 15 minutes. I would categorize this as like a sneak attack, right? Like the parents are gathered

**[0:06:25]** Yeah, no one knows about this shooting program of audience

**[0:06:29]** This is a violation of the Geneva Convention and then I'm like, but I got you guys all hyped up, right? I mean

**[0:06:35]** Look at him he's high

**[0:06:38]** Look how high he is sweaty

**[0:06:42]** Sped walk 25 minutes home. I was so pumped. I

**[0:06:45]** Think this thing is working

**[0:06:47]** Yeah, you're right. You're right. Cuz basically once once that bumped the concert time. I was like well now

**[0:06:53]** I'm not gonna make ice cream social on time

**[0:06:56]** I was like basically I waited the one part that I knew my kid had watched it and was like snuck out the

**[0:07:01]** Back and then great was like I'm gonna walk home so that my wife can see the whole thing

**[0:07:07]** It took me a really long time to figure out that your text said that you were that you had to ditch your wife

**[0:07:12]** Yeah, yeah, it didn't say you had to ditch your wife. It said he had the I know I

**[0:07:17]** Know that's yeah

**[0:07:18]** That's why I'm so happy for your wife and that's why I put exclamation points because he said you had to dick Sarah

**[0:07:24]** Oh my goodness

**[0:07:28]** Sorry, I'm running late getting back the concert ran long I had dick Sarah

**[0:07:32]** We understand right there because we understood your context clues, but it's still very funny

**[0:07:38]** Yeah, I even put a capital D on there. Look at that

**[0:07:45]** Man you put a capital D on that all the marriage is anything like mine when that happens. It's capital D kind of day

**[0:07:55]** I mean we're getting close to the holidays so we're due but we'll see

**[0:08:06]** That's fucking great, yes, so

**[0:08:11]** Who am I kidding everyone goes over the holidays we can't but

**[0:08:17]** But

**[0:08:18]** So then they go to this this music program right where they they sing some songs

**[0:08:23]** But then they also do this thing. This is like some innovation. They had a few years ago and

**[0:08:28]** What happens is they do a great of writing

**[0:08:31]** storytelling time you

**[0:08:32]** Know

**[0:08:35]** Sounds terrible already. So then they select like three or four

**[0:08:40]** I guess I don't know ten it just it felt like it felt like a million, but I stayed for four

**[0:08:48]** These stories that the kids have written together

**[0:08:51]** There are Christmas themed stories and all the instruments on stage instead of creating songs for the Christmas concert

**[0:08:58]** creates sound effects for the

**[0:09:01]** Oh, that's the worst

**[0:09:04]** I'm watching some avant-garde

**[0:09:06]** Children's Foley exercise do they intentionally add lots of sound effects to the stories?

**[0:09:15]** See I did this as a little kid

**[0:09:17]** I think I've told you guys this before my dad wrote a program on our Atari 400 that was sound effects

**[0:09:23]** Okay, and you can play all kinds of different sound effects through the program

**[0:09:26]** And so I recorded myself a story about mr. T and Lee majors going to space yes, and I used all those sound effects

**[0:09:35]** As a young aspiring radio guy and Foley artist myself

**[0:09:39]** Well don't get me wrong. I loved doing Foley stuff, too

**[0:09:43]** And I liked doing it with friends as well. I don't think it should be done for

**[0:09:49]** 200 parents

**[0:09:50]** But i'm sure the comedy and timing of it was just spot on

**[0:09:58]** And I don't know if maybe seven demos is worth the idea of showing off this Foley expertise

**[0:10:05]** Oh boy

**[0:10:07]** Maybe pair it down to one or two of the best ones and then present those they did seven different stories

**[0:10:13]** Yeah, well they did more how long a story I did I did they're like five minutes six minutes

**[0:10:21]** What yes, that's too much

**[0:10:23]** No, you do a story than a cheer a story than a cheer a story than a cheer break it up figure it out

**[0:10:30]** Three christmas songs and seven stories. That's what you get here christmas songs. What were the christmas songs negotiation went worse than ukraine and russia

**[0:10:38]** This is a very terrible negotiation happening

**[0:10:42]** Well, it's okay israel's gonna pay for it. That's right

**[0:10:46]** Um, yeah, what were the christmas? Oh, uh, well first like oh christmas tree

**[0:10:51]** Uh, okay was it oh christmas tree was an old honing ball. I have issues with uh, oh hanukkah

**[0:10:58]** Oh hanukkah, let's light the menor that song

**[0:11:00]** Wait, what they do a version of a christmas tree. That's oh hanukkah

**[0:11:04]** There's another song called like oh hanukkah. Oh hanukkah. We light the menor

**[0:11:08]** Oh hanukkah, you guys don't even know the song i'm talking about. No, no

**[0:11:11]** Okay, I think this is a children's school song that has that has come up to

**[0:11:16]** Include everybody it's abominable

**[0:11:19]** I mean like the snowman it is like it seems like it was inspired by someone like

**[0:11:25]** Uh a fever fever chopping wood. It was like the melody they came up with for it. It was like

**[0:11:31]** No

**[0:11:32]** And and I guess it's like the first songs that was like first included

**[0:11:35]** But like when christian schools were like, I guess we have to sing hanukkah songs

**[0:11:39]** And they've included this about it. Uh, leon can stop and chat. Yes. This is about israel

**[0:11:44]** Um

**[0:11:46]** Listen you can't say that the jewish people run show business and then also put out that terrible song you can't have it both ways

**[0:11:54]** Either you're in charge of everyone's beautiful music career. You can come up with a better melody

**[0:11:59]** than uh

**[0:12:01]** Uh than that there there are there are other beautiful hanukkah

**[0:12:03]** They just don't want mariah carey running away with all the publishing rights. That's all

**[0:12:10]** Uh, but uh, yeah, so

**[0:12:13]** Um, it's it's it's it's a terrible song and they sing it or I guess yell it or shout it

**[0:12:17]** It doesn't there's no way to unshout it. It's just shouting

**[0:12:20]** That's just do they play instruments too or the kids just sing it. They play instruments, too

**[0:12:26]** Okay, that makes it worse. It does make it worse and um, yeah

**[0:12:29]** And and like it might as well like be done to like like the ramones like they might as well have like a punk

**[0:12:34]** drummer just driving the whole they don't do like klezmer and and

**[0:12:39]** Jews harp and all that kind of thing they have every instrument out there paul

**[0:12:42]** Uh, I don't know if they're all done in a way that makes it satisfying to the year

**[0:12:46]** Somewhat more authentically

**[0:12:48]** Authentically jewish in nature of these there's marimbas and chimes and wood instruments and all kinds of stuff out there

**[0:12:54]** It's a couple laptops chimes trying to get all beastie boys on it

**[0:12:59]** Laptops open a couple laptops going on

**[0:13:02]** They're running tape

**[0:13:03]** He got straight up djs djs on the wheels of steel the ones and twos. Yep

**[0:13:09]** but

**[0:13:10]** I was like what kind of avant-garde artsy shit am I watching?

**[0:13:14]** There is nothing that makes me want to have kids less than uh than children's musical events. Oh

**[0:13:21]** I oh it's the worst dance concerts concert concerts all of it. It's just terrible

**[0:13:26]** Oh, this is and this is just just and this is just for the parents

**[0:13:29]** People who don't have kids won't get this but uh going to see different productions kids productions is torture enough

**[0:13:34]** But uh, if you kind of don't plan it correctly and you don't realize it but you go in the last one

**[0:13:40]** Oh, it's a huge mistake

**[0:13:42]** What do you mean at the end of the last one?

**[0:22:59]** I

**[0:22:59]** And then like went away like half annoyed

**[0:23:04]** And I

**[0:23:05]** What a weirdy and I said like she went away as half of a domino's advertisement from the 80s

**[0:23:12]** The person next to me I was like I didn't even bring up the singer part

**[0:23:15]** She did I only said yes to the singing part because I thought we were trying to figure out how we knew each other

**[0:23:20]** I thought you were helping me out

**[0:23:22]** He's like no, you just think every black woman's a singer. Go fuck yourself. You racist is basically what?

**[0:23:27]** Happened there. Ah, that's what it was. Yeah

**[0:23:31]** So we did not hit it off

**[0:23:32]** That was I I one strike on the socializing for the for the uh for the city cast vegas

**[0:23:38]** outing there

**[0:23:39]** Oh, that's and that is too bad because that is the person that we brought in today to uh interview for this

**[0:23:45]** Hello. Hello miss. Uh, you so you you met matt donnelly last night. Did you oh no?

**[0:23:51]** Yes

**[0:23:53]** And and you did not care for your interaction with matt donnelly

**[0:23:57]** Hey, are we actually recording on this? Oh, we're recording right now, buddy

**[0:24:01]** Okay, let's do this. I'm here. Am I sounding okay on this?

**[0:24:06]** That's rob we're doing it we're in the middle of a bit but rob rob is here

**[0:24:10]** um

**[0:24:11]** Rob, I was just talking about being at city cast les vegas social gathering last night and we're already rolling

**[0:24:15]** I know I could sense the excitement in your voice as you

**[0:24:18]** Recall the big event. That's what that was

**[0:24:21]** I will say i'm gonna burn you guys right now you guys handed out conversation starters last night

**[0:24:26]** To people as they walked in

**[0:24:27]** We sure did and I am laughing because I have inside information on your company

**[0:24:33]** That you guys are allowed to be a little political but you're not supposed to be like a politically leaning podcast organization, right?

**[0:24:40]** Uh, we we get feedback every now and then from upper management as well as the audience

**[0:24:46]** What I like to say is city cast is for everyone if you love las vegas or love to trash las vegas either way

**[0:24:53]** We have a home for you great officially welcome rob from city cast las vegas. Thank you

**[0:24:59]** And uh, hey las vegas newsletter editor and I appear occasionally on the podcast

**[0:25:04]** Yeah, just to clarify absolutely you do a great job on both your newsletter is outstanding

**[0:25:08]** I think you do an amazing newsletter

**[0:25:10]** I think some of my favorite things uh that you guys make the nevada independent and the las vegas review journal

**[0:25:16]** Look like you might as well just light dog poop on fire and ring their doorbells. You're embarrassing them

**[0:25:21]** You are embarrassing them. Well, we we link to them sometimes so we got we got a tip ahead to them

**[0:25:26]** You know, we just kind of like to collect what everyone's talking about add a little bit of our own stew to the mix

**[0:25:31]** And or mix to the stew either way, but um, it's we slide into your inbox at 6 a.m

**[0:25:37]** Every morning and give you a quick look at what's going on in vegas. So here is the uh,

**[0:25:42]** Everyone loves las vegas icebreaker. You guys hated me when I came with a party last night. Okay, great

**[0:25:48]** What's should we should we have the conversation based on this card now?

**[0:25:53]** This card says what's your ethical responsibility as a citizen when you believe your country is acting immorally. That's your casual

**[0:26:03]** Icebreaker for me to just talk to any citizen of las vegas

**[0:26:08]** That is a literal few people

**[0:26:11]** That's a literal icebreaker

**[0:26:14]** They have to switch out today

**[0:26:16]** Some did yes, I don't want to talk about those nature

**[0:26:19]** Rob this doesn't have to be a god-chosen journalism moment, but this has david figler written all over it. This is figler all over it

**[0:26:26]** I think it was more like um, we have what we call a membership team

**[0:26:30]** That helps us organize these events because it was for city cast neighbors. That's our our membership group. That's right

**[0:26:36]** And uh, you know, we were kind of worried because some of these people, you know

**[0:26:39]** They want to get out and about they want to meet new people. So we don't want it to be

**[0:26:43]** You know awkward so sometimes, you know

**[0:26:45]** We had a couple games out like uno and stuff

**[0:26:47]** But nobody even had to open them because everyone was naturally organically making conversation and mingling

**[0:26:53]** So it's true the icebreaker card was part of that and I think a few people used it

**[0:26:58]** But not everybody did but it's a good way just to welcome people and get them thinking about something straight off the bed

**[0:27:03]** it was uh

**[0:27:04]** It was a landmine and the people that I met but uh, we moved on anyway

**[0:27:09]** So you did get some intel and asked the question to it

**[0:27:12]** I did I did fitting off with uh with two doctors, uh last night, uh, daniel and christine, I think

**[0:27:17]** Uh, okay last night. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, they're doctors and uh

**[0:27:22]** I'll vouch for them. Yeah. Yeah, and they did it. There's always someone's about there. I just say yes, I mean

**[0:27:26]** Uh, if we're not for your newsletter rob, I wouldn't know things like the taco bell ultra run

**[0:27:32]** Which is coming up in a couple of weeks here

**[0:27:34]** Actually, it's coming up saturday saturday. Oh, it's the saturday. All right

**[0:27:38]** It's not too soon

**[0:27:40]** It's uh where people run from summerland to henderson and stop by seven taco bells

**[0:27:46]** And have to eat a taco bell menu item at each stop. Oh, no

**[0:27:52]** You know, I and then run some more

**[0:27:55]** One of the things we do at city cast vegas is we do events we compile events and it's kind of like a guide

**[0:28:00]** To the week and I was coming across this thing called the taco bell ultra marathon

**[0:28:05]** I'm like that looks boring some another marathon sponsored by some

**[0:28:09]** Corporate entity and then I looked at it and this isn't sponsored by anybody at all. This isn't official

**[0:28:14]** It's a grassroots thing that um

**[0:28:18]** A person came up with who was in an organization here locally called. I believe the las vegas slow runners

**[0:28:25]** so, you know, there are people who want to be out and about but it's kind of like all skills and

**[0:28:30]** Uh all skill levels welcome

**[0:28:32]** And the whole idea is you start at a taco bell

**[0:28:35]** In summerland you end up at a taco bell in henderson and you stop at five others along the way

**[0:28:41]** This is more than 30 miles. This is why I didn't feel this was a real event

**[0:28:45]** I'm like, yeah like this is a joke for people who don't know henderson and summerland are on opposite sides of the city

**[0:28:51]** Of las vegas they they are they are two just neighborhoods basically on the east and west sides of the city

**[0:28:56]** It's not even easy to run between the two takes a while. Yes

**[0:29:00]** Oh driving between the two is a nightmare running between the two full of taco bell seems like a hellscape

**[0:29:07]** Right. So there's there's some guide guidelines and even experienced runners. I did talk to someone involved

**[0:29:13]** So I knew this was legit and they're like, you know, i'm a runner myself

**[0:29:17]** This will probably take me like eight hours. Some people may be five some people may be longer

**[0:29:22]** But also I think some of the participants might just do like two or three taco bells

**[0:29:26]** I think the real serious ones are the ones who are like doing the whole thing

**[0:29:30]** I'm a taco bell 5k guy. I'm not a taco bell seven taco bell running guy

**[0:29:34]** I can I think run from one to the other and then call it a day

**[0:29:37]** But you have to eat something different at each taco bell. You can't repeat and then you have to eat the whole menu item

**[0:29:44]** Yes, and you can't run with it. You have to finish it and then go

**[0:29:47]** You can't just eat like a bite of a taco and then head out. You got to eat the whole taco

**[0:29:52]** Exactly, and um, also there's a 15 minute penalty added to your time if you throw up

**[0:29:58]** Wow

**[0:30:00]** This is a real rule

**[0:30:01]** That's fine. There is a 15 minute in this race

**[0:30:04]** There is a 15 minute penalty for that in life. There is a much bigger penalty for it if you don't throw up though

**[0:30:10]** No

**[0:30:11]** If it wants to come out let it come out

**[0:30:13]** Please do

**[0:30:15]** Hi

**[0:30:16]** And again just to let you guys know city cast is legit

**[0:30:19]** I reached out to the slow runners and the person's person's personal

**[0:30:24]** Instagram page trying to get them on today's podcast and could not reach them

**[0:30:28]** But you got you got the interview you got that you got the facts

**[0:30:31]** Uh there. Yeah, so I ended up talking to someone who's actually making the official t-shirts

**[0:30:36]** So if you go on their website, they have an official t-shirt for this unofficial taco bell event. Holy smokes

**[0:30:42]** Um, one of the taco bells is right on the corner from my house

**[0:30:46]** You should just go and hang. I know I was like maybe just go cheer them on one of those tables with like cups

**[0:30:50]** Of water maybe there was water. That'd be a bucket ready for anyone who's ready to uh, you wouldn't bring wire 15 minutes

**[0:30:57]** You have 15 minute penalty buckets waiting for them

**[0:31:01]** Little cups of baja blast. That's what you gotta have ready

**[0:31:04]** There's a baja blast bonus

**[0:31:07]** Um, you can there's two bonuses

**[0:31:09]** One is you can add diablo sauce to everything and do a diablo sauce shooter at the end

**[0:31:14]** I think it's just drinking a packet fine fine

**[0:31:16]** And the second one is you have to commit to drinking at least two liters of baja blast

**[0:31:22]** Along the way over the seven locations

**[0:31:26]** So what's that equate to like four larges or something like that?

**[0:31:31]** It's about two liters. It's about half a dozen

**[0:31:34]** Vomits six. I think is what this was invented by someone who loves taco bell and hates running. There's no there's no, you know what this actually

**[0:31:41]** Happened in a couple other cities. Um, apparently this is an annual tradition in denver

**[0:31:46]** I think they're the first ones to come up with it and just a few weeks ago

**[0:31:49]** There was one in the dc area and just by coincidence the ceo of city cast david plotz

**[0:31:57]** He saw my story sent me a note and said his son ran in the dc version

**[0:32:01]** And completed it was in october

**[0:32:04]** I believe it was late november

**[0:32:06]** Okay

**[0:32:07]** Okay, great

**[0:32:08]** Maybe denver was october maybe I don't know the website I found says uh 50 kilometers nine taco bell meals

**[0:32:15]** Across dc. Whoa. Yeah, it's insane even worse than the uh, this one

**[0:32:21]** Yeah, oh man

**[0:32:24]** Uh 31.07 miles while stopping at nine taco bells

**[0:32:31]** There's not a single part of that that makes me want to do that

**[0:32:36]** And the idea is you wear costumes and kind of have fun with it sure and it's all a truss system, right? Yeah

**[0:32:42]** And you win a golden taco at the end if you're first, oh

**[0:32:46]** Oh, come on burying the league being a golden taco winner is pretty great

**[0:32:53]** Yeah, great

**[0:32:54]** I don't know what it is that goes that goes right on the intro to everything I do after that, you know

**[0:33:00]** No matter what i'm doing

**[0:33:01]** That should be um front page in the rj golden taco winner is yeah

**[0:33:07]** Yeah

**[0:33:09]** All right, and I don't know what it is I asked my contact who is part of this

**[0:33:14]** Um who's making the shirts and I said what is a golden taco and she said I don't know

**[0:33:19]** So it's a little bit of a surprise for whoever gets it. All right

**[0:33:23]** Uh rob I gave you uh, I gave you 12 hours. I gave you 12 hours notice on the spot

**[0:33:28]** To do a year-end round-up hours of sleep

**[0:33:31]** Yeah, yeah, exactly

**[0:33:33]** And he does last night I challenged you to come on here and I wanted uh, the top three

**[0:33:39]** under-reported vega stories for 2025

**[0:33:42]** Yes, now when I asked you that the idea is popping your head right away or did you was it hard to come up with?

**[0:33:48]** Uh, no, because you also gave me um the option for uh, the five overall news stories of the year

**[0:33:53]** And I said well three sounds easier than five. So let's talk about that

**[0:34:01]** And I think my first option will make you groan. You'll be like you didn't put much into this

**[0:34:05]** But I want us to think about

**[0:34:07]** I want I want us to think about the uh the year

**[0:34:11]** So far looking back. It's been a it's one of those years. It kind of feels like

**[0:34:15]** Two years. It doesn't really feel like all this was one year lots been going on

**[0:34:20]** But what do we remember as the first do you guys remember what the first big news story of the year is?

**[0:34:27]** From okay January of 2025

**[0:34:31]** Yes

**[0:34:33]** No, no

**[0:34:34]** I don't remember what the first new story of december. I guess this election shit

**[0:34:38]** Are we talking just vegas? Uh, maybe somewhat indirectly

**[0:34:42]** Just vegas, right?

**[0:34:45]** Just vegas. Yes. Yeah, i'm thinking

**[0:34:46]** From now i'm on the outside in pa now getting still I still have lots of feeds coming up

**[0:34:53]** My first thought goes to the boring company increasing their uh

**[0:34:58]** presence

**[0:34:59]** They uh, elon musk tunnel company. Yeah

**[0:35:02]** Okay, any any other um guesses

**[0:35:05]** I guess there was a bunch of protests stage in january, right?

**[0:35:08]** And we we have a bad we have a bad record with how we handle protests. Are we are we there?

**[0:35:12]** There's always a protest about something every day this story i'm going to give you a hint. Okay was

**[0:35:17]** explosive

**[0:35:21]** Explosive explosive news story. Oh was this the uh, the the tesla truck that blew up at trump's tower

**[0:35:27]** That's right. It happened people forget this it happened on january 1st

**[0:35:30]** Oh my god, 2025 new year's day

**[0:35:33]** Yeah, yeah

**[0:35:34]** Yeah

**[0:35:34]** This was the tesla cyber truck that the guy blew up

**[0:35:36]** Like in the valet parking area of the of the trump tower here in vegas and he was in it, right?

**[0:35:42]** Yeah

**[0:35:45]** he um

**[0:35:45]** Blew up along with the tesla. Um, he drove to be clear. He wasn't he didn't blow it up by accident

**[0:35:50]** He meant to blow it up. Yes. Yeah, this was an act of terrorism. This was an attack. Yeah

**[0:35:55]** Yeah, it wasn't like, you know the accelerator like right, you know

**[0:35:58]** Had a mishap

**[0:36:01]** I don't think they have those in teslas. Anyway, but um, yeah, so this guy drove from colorado springs rented the tesla

**[0:36:09]** And you know, he came pulled up. I think i'm learning right now that it was a rental

**[0:36:13]** I think i'm learning that right now facts. This is what you get from city cast. That's right details

**[0:36:20]** Yeah, I mean you're not gonna blow up your own tesla

**[0:36:22]** And you know replacing the batteries

**[0:36:27]** So if you do survive

**[0:36:29]** You know you want to yeah, that explains why somebody else's car my my rates at budget and hurts went up last year

**[0:36:35]** That explains it. I think this had something to do with it. Yes, he used toro. Do you know what toro?

**[0:36:40]** Oh, yes, you are. Oh, it's sort of like um

**[0:36:44]** And I know it's kind of like almost we thought about getting into this when it was brand new

**[0:36:48]** It's the uber of rentals. I think yeah

**[0:36:50]** You can like sort of like air b and b in your car, right?

**[0:36:52]** Yeah, that's car sharing that actually does make it more fucked up because everyone running a toro usually owns like one or two cars

**[0:36:58]** For toro, you know, it's basically like how we all can run our own rental car company

**[0:37:01]** So that means that people used to do this with the condos. Yeah

**[0:37:05]** So this means that person really did blow up someone else's like really that was a really expensive hundred thousand dollar

**[0:37:11]** Tesla cyber truck. It's kind of it's kind of like an extra fu, you know

**[0:37:15]** I'm gonna ruin this guy's car

**[0:37:17]** But yeah pulled up to the portico chair the valet and you know

**[0:37:21]** What I think is kind of under reported about this story is yeah got a lot of attention at the time

**[0:37:26]** but you know when

**[0:37:27]** The person responsible dies, you know, you don't really get to follow up on motives

**[0:37:32]** You don't really get to follow up on you know, what was behind this, right?

**[0:37:35]** And you know, there was sort of I mean the guy had a history in the special forces with the u.s army

**[0:37:41]** And you know, there were sort of like questions over his political leanings

**[0:37:45]** And if that had something to do with it or if he's just having

**[0:37:49]** You know a bad time in life and is coping with this and maybe had some mental health issues

**[0:37:54]** Sure, but the fact that you know, this is happening at the trump tower

**[0:38:00]** which

**[0:38:00]** You know coming right after a very contentious election

**[0:38:05]** and um

**[0:38:06]** The trump presidency was there some drama around that. I I missed that

**[0:38:09]** Yeah, you may have heard. Um the host was president again

**[0:38:12]** So I have not been following the news closely

**[0:38:16]** yeah, so um

**[0:38:18]** You know

**[0:38:18]** But it also makes you think about how easily it is for kind of what could be considered an act of terrorism to take place

**[0:38:25]** At a las vegas landmark, right? I mean pull up into a valet

**[0:38:29]** So you kind of wonder about okay

**[0:38:30]** What's happening since then to account for this kind of stuff to catch people before they take this kind of action?

**[0:38:36]** And how do you increase security?

**[0:38:39]** Remember there was that crash that happened in front of planet hollywood a few years back

**[0:38:43]** Yep, and and now because of that because they ran into tourists walking on the sidewalk now you have the

**[0:38:49]** You know the pillars the ballasts, I believe

**[0:38:52]** Yeah

**[0:38:52]** They're concrete ballasts that are along the along the sidewalk blocking off the the sidewalks from the road now

**[0:38:57]** Because the crash you're referring to is open. Yeah. Oh, yeah, they're they're everywhere now and they and they came up quick

**[0:39:04]** They grew out of the sidewalks

**[0:39:06]** Right, we gave birth and planted the seed and

**[0:39:10]** That's the company I should have started the ballast company. I would have made a fortune

**[0:39:14]** Yeah, I think especially in this town. So I mean vegas is always looking at ways to improve security

**[0:39:20]** The chat is yelling at us bollards. Yeah bollards not ballast ballast is at the bottom of a boat bollards

**[0:39:25]** Are the things on the side of the road? Yeah, it's not like my business's words or anything

**[0:39:32]** We'll edit this in post these microphones are decorative. Yeah

**[0:39:36]** So I thought that's a somewhat under-reported story mainly because it's been forgotten

**[0:39:41]** Yeah, you're right. I totally haven't thought about that forever and it happened in my own backyard

**[0:39:47]** and

**[0:39:48]** I didn't connect it to all of the bollards that are around

**[0:39:52]** Here or ballasts

**[0:39:55]** Or ballads for the people standing in front of buildings singing to make sure you don't crash your car. They just sing beautiful slow songs

**[0:40:03]** Matt she's not that singer. I don't know who you think

**[0:40:06]** So I have a second story that the second story kind of uh follows a similar theme

**[0:40:13]** we're gonna kind of go and and flow between one story and another but um

**[0:40:18]** Have you noticed anything about metro police this year?

**[0:40:22]** I mean, they're super nice and polite and don't give out a bunch of fuck you tickets

**[0:40:27]** Oh wait, no, i'm wrong

**[0:40:29]** Uh, they've handled uh, I think they've handled the arrest of some of our friends very well

**[0:40:36]** Do you know people have you had to bail out people? No, we're good friends with jimmy. Uh, sonina who had that terrible, uh,

**[0:40:42]** Uh, there you have protest. Yeah, you got arrested for some nonsense

**[0:40:45]** Yeah, right. Um, so, you know the one thing i've noticed about metro this year

**[0:40:50]** Which has gotten some attention, but I think it needs to get a little more attention. Okay, the way this fleet

**[0:40:55]** is expanding

**[0:40:56]** Um, just the technology they're using, um

**[0:41:01]** I think you may have seen the hoopla over their big cyber truck speaking of which cyber truck patrol fleet

**[0:41:08]** Yeah, some guy gave them a bunch of cyber trucks

**[0:41:11]** Yeah, and how much do you think those fleet of cyber trucks cost?

**[0:41:15]** Oh

**[0:41:16]** Oh gosh, I i bet with the retrofitting and stuff that they're doing to the cyber trucks

**[0:41:21]** They've got to be two hundred thousand dollars a piece, right? They got to have bulletproof, uh stuff in them

**[0:41:26]** I kind of 200 000

**[0:41:29]** Elon musk tried to

**[0:41:32]** Speaking of things that we forgot about remember when elon musk, uh

**[0:41:35]** Debuted the cyber trucks and threw a big steel ball bearing at the back windows to show off the bulletproof glass

**[0:41:42]** And it wasn't bulletproof glass. So he just broke them on stage at the unveiling. I do remember that they just went

**[0:41:46]** Oh, well, yeah

**[0:41:47]** They were like oops and then they did it again on a different window. That one also wasn't bulletproof

**[0:41:53]** So he just broke two different windows give us 10 of those yeah, that's the ones for us

**[0:41:57]** So some guy bought a bunch of tesla cyber trucks for for las vegas metro police

**[0:42:01]** Uh, like right so like 10 or 15 of them

**[0:42:04]** This was nearly three million dollar donation from a tech investor

**[0:42:09]** uh ben horowitz who is

**[0:42:12]** With a venture capital firm, uh andersen horowitz. Oh, so good guy. Okay, and

**[0:42:18]** Yeah, but this isn't the first time he's donated to uh metro

**[0:42:23]** Do you uh, do you remember the other?

**[0:42:26]** Forgotten story this year of remember the guy who set tesla cars on fire at the at the dealership

**[0:42:33]** Yes, yes, which was like a protest right and he was caught but metro said, you know

**[0:42:39]** We wouldn't have caught him without some of this new technology

**[0:42:42]** We have specifically license plate readers that are now throughout the city

**[0:42:47]** And there's a there's about 180 of them

**[0:42:50]** At least at the time that we did the story and those cost about six million and who do you think paid for those?

**[0:42:57]** This guy horowitz

**[0:42:59]** Yeah, oh wow

**[0:43:01]** So this guy not get a lot of speeding tickets. What's going on with this?

**[0:43:04]** Mr. Horowitz person. Well now correct me if i'm wrong rob

**[0:43:08]** But are not the very legality of those devices still in contention?

**[0:43:14]** Um

**[0:43:15]** You I mean you can definitely make from a privacy standpoint. This is a privacy violation

**[0:43:19]** I mean, do you want to be tracked? You know your whereabouts going because that's how they work answer. No

**[0:43:25]** Okay, that that's the question answer interesting. Yeah

**[0:43:29]** but the way they sort of get around this is

**[0:43:31]** I believe they make the donation to um, sort of like a third party like fraternal order of police type of thing

**[0:43:39]** And then it kind of goes through that way

**[0:43:41]** You know if this guy was really in some kind of legal trouble

**[0:43:45]** What would happen right when you're donating millions and millions to make um

**[0:43:50]** you know metro police, um

**[0:43:53]** In theory more successful more like a uh an army unit

**[0:43:57]** But um, you know what happens if you commit some major felony, you know commit

**[0:44:02]** I'm not saying this guy's a bad guy at all. Maybe he's a great guy

**[0:44:04]** But you know, it works in some protection. It is weird, you know makes you it makes you pause. Yeah

**[0:44:10]** is there any other

**[0:44:13]** Motive like in other words like just just just spitballing

**[0:44:16]** I mean like like why would a guy spend over 10 million dollars to quote-unquote make the city safer?

**[0:44:22]** But basically to give tesla trucks and surveillance equipment

**[0:44:24]** to one city

**[0:44:27]** Uh, like what what's it? I don't understand anytime there's a side collection for him anytime. There's a data collection element

**[0:44:35]** That can be monetized. So he's not doing this out of the goodness of his heart

**[0:44:39]** There is money to be made with that license plate data. That's what i'm asking right?

**[0:44:43]** I don't know exactly. I don't know exactly what or is it even probably you could probably

**[0:44:48]** Here's what you can probably figure out a way to measure like cars

**[0:44:53]** um mileage and all that kind of thing there their mph

**[0:44:56]** Or mpg, uh, you know ratings and things like that

**[0:45:00]** What does the acidity of your armpits have to do with anything paul? I don't know

**[0:45:03]** It always has something to do with it balance for a man, but made for a lady

**[0:45:08]** Uh

**[0:45:09]** No, it's all it's all crazy. I I saw a tiktok recently where someone was talking about this very thing and

**[0:45:16]** It's not about the billionaires accumulating all this wealth at the end of the day

**[0:45:20]** Yes, that's kind of a sickness and a weird symptom of it all

**[0:45:23]** But the accumulation of the wealth is secondary to their end goal, which is becoming above the rules of normal society

**[0:45:31]** Right and how better to become above the rules of normal society

**[0:45:35]** Than by purchasing the people who enforce the rules of normal society

**[0:45:39]** I mean this literally is like like batman comic villain level. It is

**[0:45:44]** Right frightening where you're like, oh, I I just did a google search on this guy

**[0:45:48]** Uh, apparently he's opening a new nightclub in las vegas. It's called horowitz island

**[0:45:54]** island

**[0:45:55]** Uh, and apparently the police are just not paying any attention to it at all

**[0:45:58]** Okay, good good good

**[0:46:00]** The big the big the big uh innovation of the nightclub is that you you don't get carted at the door

**[0:46:05]** That's right

**[0:46:08]** They've got technology that allows you to not be carted at the door. It's basically a teen club

**[0:46:13]** It sure is

**[0:46:14]** I don't know the teens seem awfully old to be hanging out there

**[0:46:20]** Allegedly

**[0:46:22]** I'm sure is a great guy

**[0:46:24]** But it's not just cyber trucks. It's not just uh the license plate readers

**[0:46:28]** There's also a fleet of drones now. Oh, no, that's uh, mr

**[0:46:32]** Horowitz says the drones kill me well the the the city owned one day maybe yeah. Yeah, it's true

**[0:46:39]** That that's such a weird thing

**[0:46:42]** Oh, and if you look at it, you know, if you just kind of

**[0:46:46]** Who's our governor right now joe lombardo?

**[0:46:49]** Yeah, the old sheriff and what did he used to be so I mean chief of police getting your influence

**[0:46:54]** Um where you can you know, it could be very valuable depending where people end up in public office. Yeah

**[0:47:02]** I but that you're right. This is next level bizarreness. I had no idea

**[0:47:06]** It was just one person footing the bill in a donation role to create this kind of militaristic

**[0:47:13]** approach to policing

**[0:47:16]** Is the are the cops at least flexing on safety? Are they flexing on any kind of statistics to back up any of this?

**[0:47:24]** Uh cause i'd be more afraid they're flexing on people he or if it's doesn't like

**[0:47:31]** Right well the sheriff right now is um

**[0:47:34]** Um, you know running for reelection. He's saying uh murders are down I believe but these are all stats

**[0:47:39]** You can count them how you like but you know, what happens if there's a greater for example ice presence in las vegas

**[0:47:46]** And we are experiencing right now

**[0:47:48]** Right and um, but it could get really bad in theory like some other cities

**[0:47:52]** And what happens when the governor gets involved or the sheriff gets involved and now you start mixing politics with uh influence

**[0:48:00]** and how

**[0:48:01]** Much to resist this kind of stuff or get involved in it. It just raises a lot of questions and hypotheticals

**[0:48:07]** It's not great. It's not it's not a good look. It's it's the um, what's what's the uh,

**[0:48:12]** The thing you wanted you you want to avoid the uh, the appearance of impropriety

**[0:48:16]** And this this certainly does not avoid that appearance. That's what i'm trying to whether there is that's what i'm whether there is any

**[0:48:21]** Propriety or not this looks shady as fuck. That's what i'm poking that jacob is like, of course hearing this you make you go

**[0:48:27]** Like yikes, right?

**[0:48:28]** but like our what is the counter and that's I mean that's what's actually i've been fascinated by

**[0:48:32]** A lot of these terrible things that are happening in the country is that that doesn't even seem to be

**[0:48:38]** A quote unquote company line that people are hiding under anymore people just say like, yep. It's terrible

**[0:48:43]** We love it. We love terrible shit happening. It's awesome

**[0:48:46]** Like I don't I don't if you're not doing anything wrong. You shouldn't be worried about it

**[0:48:52]** Um, so yeah, this guy is someone in chat saying that he invests in in in in in flock safety

**[0:48:59]** I guess that's the company that tracks license plates. That's the license plate. Gotcha

**[0:49:03]** so the racer slash reader slash

**[0:49:05]** So he is he's getting data to

**[0:49:08]** sell

**[0:49:09]** This that's it. Yeah, it seems like it we get we get to be his demo city

**[0:49:13]** Although in vegas, we're so many cars without a license plate. You're gonna lose a chunk of data

**[0:49:18]** We just stepped up a thing about to call people out on that

**[0:49:21]** But now we've got neighbors reporting on each other on that. So that's fine

**[0:49:25]** Tattletale line is what rob is the one who reported that let me know that was working there. The tattletale line is working

**[0:49:31]** Have you ever been working working? I don't know. It's generating more tax revenue for the state. It's scary

**[0:49:38]** Rob, that's what I want city cast to crack

**[0:49:40]** I want you to do either an article or a podcast with just tattletalers what they get out of it why they're doing it

**[0:49:48]** Like who have you have you encountered anyone who's called in anyone on that line like like a

**[0:49:54]** guide on how to narc

**[0:49:57]** Yeah, like no. No, I want to hear from the narcs. I want to hear from the well

**[0:50:01]** Well, my favorite narc is that you can report on people who have smog issues with their car

**[0:50:08]** There's an actual program matt what's your license plate up

**[0:50:13]** Leave my carola smog out of this

**[0:50:15]** Well, you can't tell me those guys working in the smog shacks aren't just as soon as somebody fails and heads off on their day

**[0:50:22]** They're not jumping on the horn and they oh, yeah, I got a tip

**[0:50:27]** I don't think they get like a cash reward for oh, well, then maybe they're not doing it like

**[0:50:32]** Making life hard for your neighbor. It was like aluminum cans like you get 10 cents. It's like a

**[0:50:39]** Golden taco

**[0:50:43]** Um

**[0:50:44]** So I guess we're just at the beginning of what this means rob, right?

**[0:50:48]** We don't know what this actually is going to entail. Uh, we we haven't seen police drones in action yet. Have we

**[0:50:55]** Um, I think they're more of like a glorified delivery service right now where they are at different stations

**[0:51:00]** And then they can kind of go and maybe scope out an area before the actual officers arrive

**[0:51:06]** Oh, well, I that's kind of a monitoring thing. All right

**[0:51:10]** That uh, I I just picture I believe three four of them coming up to me while i'm on my walk at night

**[0:51:15]** Just shooting lasers at me is what i'm picturing

**[0:51:18]** Well, that's coming next

**[0:51:20]** To be unveiled at ces and I mean truly if you're making uh drones for metro services

**[0:51:26]** The way you're going to sell more of those drones is to have the predator style three laser dots that you can project on people

**[0:51:33]** While they're on their late night walks

**[0:51:36]** Yes, the sign of you will sell a fuck ton of those drones to all of these police departments

**[0:51:41]** If you just put those three lasers on it. Yeah

**[0:51:45]** Um, was that all three was that was that two?

**[0:51:48]** Uh, that was two

**[0:51:49]** I know they kind of run together and probably feel like one big story

**[0:51:52]** But let's go with what we all want to talk about elon musk tesla tunnels boring company

**[0:51:59]** We've talked about it a lot at city cast in some way. It's kind of our lane

**[0:52:02]** But we've teamed up with pro publica twice now

**[0:52:05]** And i'll tell you pro public pro publica does not mess around they are very serious and diligent about what they do

**[0:52:12]** A big shout out to david figler our host

**[0:52:15]** And lawyer not our lawyer but a lawyer

**[0:52:18]** Who really is curious about this stuff really digs deep into it and finds the things that not a lot of other people

**[0:52:24]** Find out about so well, you are right. This is definitely under reported

**[0:52:28]** I don't think people are talking about this at all on a national level

**[0:52:31]** And this company is running amok like a bad

**[0:52:36]** Like action tv show where someone has no regard for the law and just keeps ignoring. Oh, it's fine

**[0:52:42]** It's really like yeah commit violations now deal with it later

**[0:52:47]** They've had warnings. They've had um

**[0:52:51]** But in the latest, I mean we reported I believe it was like over a thousand

**[0:52:54]** Since they started and then um, or excuse me over a hundred thousand dollars in fines

**[0:53:00]** From uh, nevada osha for some safety violations, right and that was last year

**[0:53:07]** um this year we were reporting that um

**[0:53:12]** Trying to think of what it well it did illegal dumping was one of them they were they were yes

**[0:53:18]** kind of by where um

**[0:53:20]** Historic commercial center is I was put historic in front of it

**[0:53:24]** That's a very kind way to um, you know branding I spent so many years in that spot

**[0:53:29]** In historic commercial center. Yes. Yes in the historic onyx theater. Yeah

**[0:53:36]** The historic, uh

**[0:53:39]** Hawks syringe syringe syringe is historic

**[0:53:42]** historic green door

**[0:53:49]** History is made at hawks gym

**[0:53:52]** But uh hawks gym you can have that to be your new slogan by the way

**[0:53:56]** You'd have that for free history is made at hawks gym

**[0:53:58]** I mean it is historic and how many clothing optional all-male 24-hour gyms are there in this country?

**[0:54:06]** Not enough

**[0:54:10]** But i'm sorry, let's stay focused here rob

**[0:54:14]** Let's stay let's stay underground with these tests

**[0:54:17]** So, um now we reported there was um

**[0:54:20]** Almost 800 environmental regulations over the last two years alone and these were sort of for like, um

**[0:54:26]** Um digging without approval and releasing untreated water

**[0:54:31]** Into like city streets which go back into our water system, right?

**[0:54:36]** And there was a case where but you mean like untreated, uh waste water from their machines and things like that

**[0:54:42]** Like right water water that they've been using not just water that they found underground somewhere and they're dumping it like

**[0:54:47]** It's not like they just found a pocket of water like they're they're

**[0:54:51]** Bringing all this this water in

**[0:54:54]** Diluting chemicals and yeah, they're doing all this stuff with and they're just dumping it in the street

**[0:54:57]** Right and you do go underground you come across water and that kind of thing

**[0:55:00]** But you know, there's also waste from just use right and um, you know, they just seem to be

**[0:55:06]** Drilling full speed ahead and worrying about um the repercussions later. Um, there's some questions about transparency

**[0:55:13]** We had a congresswoman dina titus on our podcast at city cast and she said she wants to see

**[0:55:21]** Governor lombardo just open up the transparency of the meetings that are taking place

**[0:55:26]** With state officials and the boring company because they're sort of allegations that they're kind of getting some preferential treatment as far as you know

**[0:55:35]** Covering this stuff up and not being so transparent about it and kind of giving them some more chances than another company might get

**[0:55:43]** But um, you know, there's been agreements there's been allegations of the agreements being broken and just fines left and right

**[0:55:49]** But this is a company that has a lot of money at their disposal elon musk is on pace

**[0:55:54]** If not already to become the world's first trillionaire. He has money to burn

**[0:55:57]** and definitely nicer guy

**[0:56:00]** right and

**[0:56:02]** This all is for something that um, I know your insider intel said we shouldn't be as

**[0:56:09]** Impinionated but I think the boring company the boring tunnel and the boring company and what they're doing under vegas is an incredibly stupid

**[0:56:16]** Public transportation. Yes. Yes. The end goal is not

**[0:56:21]** It doesn't justify the means at all

**[0:56:23]** Like who cares taking traffic above ground and putting it underground the same exact tunnels

**[0:56:29]** Could have been a subway or some kind of large scale people mover

**[0:56:33]** um why

**[0:56:35]** In the name of technology we're just putting taxis underground putting disneyland style conveyor belts underground

**[0:56:43]** Where people could just walk down there and then stand on the conveyor belt would have made more sense than this

**[0:56:48]** I would have taken that over this. Um, yes, you know just by the way

**[0:56:52]** I'll still take that over this if somebody has the conveyor belt technology that they want to put in those tunnels today

**[0:56:57]** I'm fine with them. Shoot. I just sold it. I just sold that company to make bollards

**[0:57:02]** now

**[0:57:03]** If somebody could read the dollar short what's there with the monorail system?

**[0:57:07]** If only they could expand on the monorail system

**[0:57:10]** But that looks like it's going to get completely demolished at a certain point monorail right because there's no, um

**[0:57:16]** You don't have the replacement parts for the monorail. So now it's outdated

**[0:57:19]** So once it does bite the dust, we're we're we're stuck with it ridiculous and can't fix it

**[0:57:23]** Yeah, so, uh, maybe we'll have like tesla's driving themselves over the monorail

**[0:57:32]** Tesla does have like a subway car train type of thing that operates in

**[0:57:37]** Europe somewhere. I believe germany. I saw this story. I'm like wait, they actually can do this too. Why aren't they doing that here in vegas?

**[0:57:46]** And now their latest idea is well, what if we take the tesla's

**[0:57:50]** Underground put them above ground and now they can go to the airport for five bucks

**[0:57:55]** And we're like, okay, that sounds great. That sounds like a taxi with a super discount price

**[0:58:00]** That's not new tech. Nope

**[0:58:03]** Yeah, tesla operates a battery-powered shuttle train the giga train in germany for its giga factory in berlin

**[0:58:09]** Yeah, providing free transportation train. Yeah, this just like this just makes a lot of sense

**[0:58:15]** Yeah

**[0:58:15]** That's it. That's exactly that was exactly what uber did bitch. Where's my giga train is where i'm putting it out. We are

**[0:58:22]** we are

**[0:58:25]** Uber came in with a problem with saying no

**[0:58:28]** Yeah, and sometimes we should say no and say hey, how about what you're doing in germany? Let's do that. Yeah for sure

**[0:58:34]** It was was there any uh understanding of what that big green goopy pile of gunk was

**[0:58:40]** There was that weird mystery lake that they had created speaking of discharged water. Yeah

**[0:58:46]** Yeah there I mean, uh, it's funny because I think so much of the attention was how security handled that story

**[0:58:53]** So at their new station that they're building at the old firefly side if you remember that place on paradise

**[0:58:59]** So their latest um arms top is heading out

**[0:59:03]** it's heading out towards um

**[0:59:05]** unlv so

**[0:59:06]** You know, it's kind of going to give some accessibility to like the sphere area and all that

**[0:59:11]** But there's construction happening and there's a little kind of pool of greenish water out there

**[0:59:17]** And when a local station, I believe that was the cbs, uh klas affiliate here

**[0:59:23]** try to take some video of it what you're allowed to do from the sidewalk they

**[0:59:29]** Security shooed them away tried to cover it up

**[0:59:31]** So, you know if there's nothing wrong with that you would think well why are you trying to do that?

**[0:59:36]** I'm not going to totally jump to conclusions and just go with the headline. Yes

**[0:59:40]** It's a little weird and suspect but you know, it's up to them to explain what this is and from what i've seen so far

**[0:59:46]** They really haven't

**[0:59:48]** Yeah

**[0:59:48]** I mean it's it's up to you to explain what this luminous green pool of of sludge in the middle of the city is

**[0:59:55]** I heard that on that video that they made them delete was uh,

**[0:59:58]** Four turtles eating pizza and fighting each other get out of here

**[1:00:03]** Right out of the they were using uh, taekwondo. I think taekwondo turtles

**[1:00:08]** But all this in the name of having 12 cars drive you from one hotel to another underground

**[1:00:13]** I would like metro to take their drones and fly above this pool of green water

**[1:00:17]** Exactly, let's go lombardo fire them a little visit. Yeah, the giga train in germany carries 500 people per trip

**[1:00:25]** Just saying it's a lot more than four. Jesus. Yeah, that sounds convenient. Doesn't it? Yeah, it really does

**[1:00:31]** If only somebody had come up with the idea to put a train car underground like a a sub

**[1:00:38]** Train way tell me they couldn't refit the monorail. They could refit the monorail make it work

**[1:00:45]** Yeah, that's my vote no glory in it no ego in it paul

**[1:00:48]** There's no ego in it put the giga train on the monorail tracks and expand it

**[1:00:52]** Yeah, just bring it done. Yeah, bring it to where it needs to go

**[1:00:55]** Rob, thank you so much for giving us an awesome, uh top 300 reported stories of 2025
