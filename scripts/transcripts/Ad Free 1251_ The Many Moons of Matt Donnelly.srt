19
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:08,440
 through hey so left eye I'm left I Lisa Lopez and I went into the so optometrist

20
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,920
 is the one to get your glasses ophthalmologist is the one that actually

21
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,600
 looks at your eyes right I'm sure yeah let's say yeah anyway I mean

22
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,360
 optometrist also looks at your eyes I don't know but they think of this yeah

23
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,080
 let's go do we really know the answer to this question like in our hearts

24
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,680
 ophthalmologist is the one that knows how to really get in there and do the

25
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,320
 thing yeah Larry in the chat is saying ophthalmology is surgery yeah so I went

26
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,920
 to the ophthalmologist according to our juniors let's see a Shaman I don't think

27
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:46,560
 you're gonna ever heal until you start having more you need to wear them in

28
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,360
 your eye RFK jr. I wasn't gonna bring you in until later in the guest segment of

29
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,200
 the show but it's good to have you

30
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:12,920
 I have to say some of your information seems to be outdated from what I

31
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:21,600
 understand medical accuracy how many blood leadings did you do today

32
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:30,720
 I personally have 18 leeches on my scrotum right now yeah but not for health

33
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:42,640
 reasons personal pleasure the Kennedy curse is ball leeches I have

34
00:03:42,640 --> 00:04:06,920
 misunderstood what the Kennedy curse was so how's your eye okay so it hadn't

35
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:13,320
 gotten any worse which is good good good over two days or whatever the guy looked

36
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,740
 at it very intently right eye is fine still the fact that it's only in the one

37
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:26,840
 eye it is possible that I have some back and forth blood flow issues so just to

38
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,720
 be on the safe side we're gonna get that my whole neck looked at for the veins

39
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,480
 going back and forth there just see we've always had a great neck it's any

40
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,200
 kind of occlusion anyway we'll see but he doesn't think that's it either he

41
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:46,360
 seemed to be very very positive about it's just probably it's probably just

42
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,960
 the stress of scoop fest the extra work the extra travel all the extra lack of

43
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:59,560
 sleep all that shit and dehydration etc then yeah and then that's it so it's

44
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,720
 probably just on its way to Wellsville it's healing up hopefully but at all the

45
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,600
 blood work in the world done I don't have a they don't have syphilis and you

46
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,760
 know and I'm not yet you don't have them yet I'm not diabetic well that's the

47
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,160
 case with all those things I'm not diabetic yet I'm not syphilis yet I'm

48

 pirates and boarding parties and they're like we have to do this is just a

102
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,080
 captain's general order like get all of the weapons in case we have to repel

103
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,960
 border they actually said they said it's not a policy across the board said we

104
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,760
 ran a background check on you specifically and we're taking the knife

105
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,040
 away from you that's what they said stop it they did not

106
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:21,120
 I was like wait this isn't this isn't as extreme this is too real it's too real

107
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,520
 Roy it's too real yeah very good else right born in Jersey hand the knife over

108
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:32,600
 pal yeah yeah that makes sense that's a yeah a cursory background check born in

109
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,920
 Jersey get the first red flag right away first item first item on the on the

110
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,520
 background check they didn't have to even have to read down the list no and I

111
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:49,200
 had a other but we have other magicians here on board early foolish Kylan misty

112
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,520
 night a little magic duo this guy time follow them on the insta this guy Tom

113
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,920
 Crosby who fooled Penn and Teller with his Rubik's Cube routine nice he has a

114
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,080
 he's one of those things we're like if you knew anything about him before he

115
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:08,080
 went up he has a Rubik's Cube twitch channel that's very popular so in terms

116
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,640
 of guessing whether it was a gimmicked cube or skill had you known about his

117
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,280
 twitch channel you would have guessed skill but he fooled I remember that he

118
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,720
 was he was one of the he went on and fooled them by just doing the ultra

119
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,840
 violet yeah he had someone else makes of the cube it was ultraviolet he took a

120
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:29,120
 flash ultraviolet flashlight to it and then stalled them behind his back yeah

121
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,620
 and so with the with the cube they thought they guess that basically that a

122
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,280
 cube can light up whichever way it wants you can lay it since since it's the UV

123
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:42,240
 thing you can light it up therefore it's a right thing so yeah technically puzzle

124
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,720
 cube good job scoot shooter Rubik's Cube is a brand name puzzle cube is the is

125
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,680
 the term although most cube people still say Rubik's Cube even though almost none

00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:34,360
 their dad and his son is a big game developer now and yeah pretty cool that

154
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,640
 always got me a lot of points with the boys in elementary school so you know

155
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,920
 I'm sure well yeah because all those all those boys in elementary school they

156
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,080
 were all just hard for rice checks all the time god damn it give me that rice

157
00:15:47,080 --> 00:16:09,120
 checks yeah James T scoop don't give away where you keep your private checks

158
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:22,320
 memorabilia collection on air it might get robbed by those NFL players well

159
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:29,320
 that's really cool what a small world huh how often have you ever bring up in

160
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:35,320
 conversation with people I wish I could say not often but I have so little that

161
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:45,600
 I can drive about also check I can say I brought it up last check quest was

162
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:55,600
 monumental monumental I say yeah I mean yeah it's all in if people do that um

163
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,360
 yeah when people aren't related to the guy that made you I mean like I said a

164
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,200
 lot of people think that's pretty damn cool so yeah I'm fairly certain

165
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:10,920
 I'm 90% sure that might have been the very first free video game ever given

166
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:16,080
 with a product oh just saying certainly the first free video game given with a

167
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:22,200

178
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:48,000

179
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:56,320
 video game history at large yeah that's right he is he's incredibly important no

180
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,480
 no no no no no no no no he's still yeah you know no he's one of the more

181
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,160
 important video game guys I talked about ever so he finally left id he left it

182
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:12,280
 kind of early and seems like he has a hand leaving am I right James T scoop

183
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:17,120
 does seem to be well he started his own thing and he fucked up because his his

184
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,960
 big game Daikatana was a massive failure they put tons of money into the into the

185
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:32,840
 advertising and everything so the but the big advertising push in many of the

186
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,960
 print ads was in you know in September whenever the game was coming out John

187
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:45,000
 Romero is about to make you his bitch that was that was that was the tagline

188
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,520
 because he had such cache among first-person shooter fans but then the

189
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,480
 game the game tanked so were you around when Daikatana came out was that part of

190
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,080
 why you left because the failure Daikatana everything went to shit in a

191
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,000
 relationship after he lost all that money yeah yeah he well he oh gosh I

192
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,840
 don't want to speak out of school here I don't get like on like fun speed or

193
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:18,240
 something yeah I think yeah the first time he lost all his money is is about

194
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,280
 the time they split so pretty early on yeah my dad always was he's just one of

195
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,480
 those guys he'll lose his money but then he always finds a way to make it back

196
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,400
 he's out living in Ireland right now with his new wife and yeah yeah yeah

197
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,560
 he's still he's still very wealthy guy oh yeah oh you know he's doing all right

198
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,800
 yeah he's but you're right he's gained and lost fortunes over the years oh yes

199
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:46,240

209
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:51,040
 the game Quake yeah I don't know if I don't know if Romero I guess I think he

210
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,120
 was yeah he was on with Quake yeah yeah yeah I just looked him up and it says it

211

 says Quake yeah he was on with Quake yeah I mean yeah like I mean I don't

212
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:06,040
 know John they're like really at all but mostly his sons you know but yeah yeah

213
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,200
 it's fun yeah but that's funny though that you're that you're related to the

214
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:19,680
 guy who made the the Chex cube yeah so even though he's not actually part of the

215
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,080
 family anymore I assume that you're gonna get that sweet Chex cube money I

216
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,960
 actually passed down to you when he dies I guess it's time to come clean I'm not

217
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,480
 here as a cruise ship entertainer this is my cruise ship I'm on my own ship

 thing yeah the whole the whole putting on a show and singing and talking and

247
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,800
 doing the whole thing he's had a minute it's like he has practiced and he's very

248
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,800
 very good was did did you get graced with the double beetle shot did Ringo

249
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:48,000
 pop in secret on this no Ringo Ringo wasn't in town he was in town the week

250
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,440
 before and I was hoping that he would that he would stick around and make an

251
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,880
 appearance but it didn't look like he did okay so yeah no no special guest but

252
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,260
 holy fuck was the show good I bet they had they had audience cameras and

253
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,520
 everything at one point the the camera stopped on somebody in the audience and

254
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:11,200
 and Paul was talking to him and they had a sign that said that they had seen the

255
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,040
 Beatles at Shea Stadium a while in 65 okay that's pretty and so he's like wait

256
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:20,000
 you really thought you saw us in 1965 at Shea Stadium and she's like yeah if I

257
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,640
 fucking well did it was it was so crazy the the number of people that were there

258
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,880
 what it meant to everyone I took my mom my mom my mom came in town and and so

259
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,840
 she came in town to see the Beatles and yeah I mean it it meant a lot to her it

260
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,880
 meant a lot to me it meant a lot to everybody around us yeah it was it was

261
00:26:44,880 --> 00:27:01,320
 so fucking cool it'd be like John Romero showing up to my house I kept yelling it

262
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:06,760
 out I kept yelling it out as a request of die Katana how you talk about a

263
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:11,040
 seminal seminal creator there you go how big was your I have cancer sign will you

264
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:24,680
 please say it was roughly the size of a sherry's berry it was a holy shit Paul

265
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:29,040
 McCartney did because there were signs in the audience and he I thought did

266
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,240
 something very smart which was he addressed the signs and they could put

267
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,600
 them away put them down that's nice yeah yes I did like he did like five minutes

268
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,720
 between two songs early on he was like oh we got some signs out here let's see

269
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,080
 what they say it and you'd go through a couple of them and then when when he was

270
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,880
 done with him then put him down there was one person towards the front that

271
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,280
 they're holding up a large piece of cardboard yeah and all it said was Paul

272
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:59,360
 McCartney saved my life can I have a hug oh my and that was one that he did not

273
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:05,280
 acknowledge of course no cuz nobody sorry because the answer I'm sorry is

274
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:10,080
 just probably not no no no no no no was there one song that he performed that

275
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,600
 really put you over the moon or one that you were surprised that he was belting

276
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:22,320
 out oh you know he's he's 80 what 383 move on I'm skeptical by the way okay I

277
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,920
 don't think that Paul McCartney saved that guy's life at all I don't think he

278
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:31,280
 did anything I mean I think he just was by coincidence this song maybe meant

279
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,080
 something to the guy before he maybe it was gonna jump off a bridge or something

280
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,320
 but I don't think Paul McCartney specifically you don't think that

281
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:43,200
 renowned neurosurgeon Paul McCartney might have saved that guy's life you're

282
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,840
 close you're close Paul actually the the guy in the audience I did I got to speak

283
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:53,240
 to him he was confused I turned out John Lennon jumped in front of a bullet meant

284
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,480
 for that guy he thought it he thought it was Paul McCartney this whole time and

285
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,040
 I was like no I'm sorry that that actually killed John Lennon that the

286
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,680
 bullet meant for you did kill John Lennon. It'd be really funny if he really did have a

287
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,280
 doctor named Paul McCartney who helped his brain but then he's like

288
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:13,720
 mistakenly thought it was the other guy so they're like like halfway through the

289
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,160
 concert he maybe puts a sign I was like wait it can't be the same Paul McCartney

290
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:27,560
 yeah this guy doesn't look anything like the guy that saved my life. This is a different guy. I should have known. I paid so much money for these tickets I don't think this is

291
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:36,120
 the same guy at all. I feel foolish this piece of cardboard I feel foolish. I mean

292
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,440
 this is a nice song and everything but this is not what I'm here for I was here

293
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,640
 to give thanks to the person that saved my life. Cut a brain tumor out of my skull and I

294
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,440
 wanted to give that person a hug so anybody doesn't want to hug me at all if

295
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,840
 anybody has a chance to go see this McCartney tour now you would highly

296
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:59,400
 recommend them? Oh yes oh yeah it's the got back tour there it was it was so much

297
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:04,960
 there was so much going on. Is Sir Mix-A-Lot opening for him? Sir Mix-A-Lot is not opening for him.

298
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:11,040
 Well that's a missed opportunity. That is I agree. Baby got back. You can do side bends or

299
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,120
 sit-ups please do actually keep your body active as it gets older if you want

300
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:25,360
 to keep that blood flow going. You are an octogenarian you should do side bends and sit-ups. I engage in a lot of Tai Chi I got an

301
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:36,040
 afternoon over at the park. I got pool aerobics. It's pretty great. Keeps my ass in shape. I walk every day 4,000 steps a

302
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:49,440
 day. I know that isn't 10,000 but it's still pretty good. Baby does bends. Baby's got steps. I'm in the bother slub. So I think I

303
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,840
 mentioned to you guys that on on my greatest day ever last week I ended up

304
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:01,560
 buying that Rock Band 360 controller that I've been looking for. Yes. So I

305
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:05,360
 finally got it mentioned that I got a chance to test it and Jacob you'll be

306
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,680
 happy to know my first game I wanted to test it with was Rock Band Beatles. Yeah

307
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,440
 you talked about that last week. Because I loved that game and I loved the art

308
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,600
 style of it and everything. So I get my old 360 going hadn't turned it on in

309
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:24,640
 probably a year. Turned on my 360 opened it up put a disc in the tray closed it

310
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:33,960
 up it goes meh meh meh and then it just says open tray and I'm like oh no. That

311
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,560
 seems like a bad sign. It was a bad sign so I pressed it and opened it up and I

312
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:44,000
 tried it again and meh meh meh nothing. So my 360 isn't reading discs and I'm

313
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,360
 like fuck I got like 200 discs sitting here for my 360. That's the one system I've kept. I would like my

314
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,480
 games to still be able to run. So I'm like oh shit. So I started getting really sad

315
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,880
 because not only was I like well you know all my 360 games aren't working but

316
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,280
 now I'm gonna have to go through all the hassle of returning this guitar. I don't

317
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:08,560
 really know if it doesn't work or what but I I don't know how people existed

318
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:15,240
 before the advent of YouTube honestly. So I go on YouTube and I look up this very

319
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:21,840
 specific malady going on with my 360 and a short pops up and a guy does exactly

320
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:28,120
 what I did gets that same error message open tray. He puts it back in as the disc

321
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:33,800
 is going back in. He just reaches up on the top of the system goes bap bap bap

322
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:39,520
 oh and then sure enough sure enough he just hit the top of the thing bap bap bap

323
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,360
 on the top of the system and then sure enough it reads a disc and he plays the

324
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:49,920
 game and I'm like well I don't know I don't want to be beaten on my system

325
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:55,720
 necessarily but I but I do know like ps1s old ps1 models you had to flip them

326
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,640
 over and run them upside down to actually get them to read after a while

327
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,440
 and when they got old huh that was a fix so I was like all right well so I

328
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:07,120
 looked again the next one that came up same error message same thing guy goes

329
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,520
 bap bap bap it starts to read it I'm like alright fuck it what have I got to

330
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:19,720
 lose I do the thing I put it in bap bap bap fires it right up my fucking

331
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,200
 controller works with it I played a perfect round so the controller is very

332
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,120
 responsive for a you know 15 year old piece of plastic hardware that could

333
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,000
 easily get fucked up I'm like yeah this fucking works is great I was really

334
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 happy got to watch my you know the Beatles animation and all that which is

335
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,880
 really really cool so I played a couple Beatles songs with my new Fender

336
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:48,240
 Stratocaster and I was just I was just over the moon but yeah I had to fucking

337
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:59,960
 Fonz my 360 just bap bap bap yeah got it going yeah yeah yeah no if your dog

338
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,040
 starts feeling bad and you're gonna take it to the vet to have it put down try to

339
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,680
 hit it on top of the head a few times I tried that with pirate maybe that was

340
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:16,560
 what brought it no no no no no no no no dogs are doing really good thankfully

341
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:23,840
 although I don't know what the fuck happened last night and gets up she has

342
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,720
 to go in early every every fucking day it's something new with this place with

343
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:32,800
 her she's getting called in early so she goes to let the dogs out at like four

344
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,760
 in the morning it was and well no one had yet that was why she had to do it I

345
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:45,320
 don't know what the fuck was in the yard but it ran over the fence she heard

346
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:51,880
 crazy commotion it had knocked over and bent the bird feeder I think it was a

347
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:55,740
 big fat raccoon but Anne thinks it might have been a bear who the fuck knows

348
00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:01,520
 bear a raccoon did not bend the bird feeder then it could have you have like

349
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,280
 a metal pole on yeah the big metal pole big big metal raccoon didn't bend that

350
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,920
 so yeah it might have been a bear is what I was thinking it might have been a

351
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:22,960
 bear but the dogs went and chased the bear I love this yard yeah invited him

352
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,760
 over he'd have been probably nice enough to give you this if you ask ask him you

353
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:36,280
 know just say please can I have your bear syphilis they'll do it I want that

354
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:41,720
 bear syphilis give me your bear syphilis

355
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:47,800
 so anyway yeah who the fuck knows or could have been a deer maybe I don't

356
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,360
 think a deer though because deer would have really had to jump over our big

357
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:57,840
 fences as possible who knows but it was probably it could have been a bear but

358
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:02,840
 yeah so a little little crazy we had some wildlife activity in the in the

359
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:10,240
 yard on the housed drug addict who wanted to eat bird feed not completely out

360
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,380
 of the realm but I don't think he would have bent it over like he did to get at

361
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:19,000
 the bird food but I fixed it I fixed the the pole today so it wasn't that it

362
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,840
 wasn't that strong I was able to straighten it out with my hands just kind

363
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:29,000
 of you know so I think it could have just been a big fat possum big old fat

364
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,280
 raccoon yeah I think it could have been or tiny raccoons in a raccoon costume it

365
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,560
 might have been it might have been stranger things my god or a lot of tiny

366
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,120
 raccoons in a bear costume you guys experiencing these full moons right now

367

00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:11,160
 at the McCartney show they had a lot of you know there was video of old Beatles

398
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:16,400
 performances and things like that and one of the things that was in there Matt

399
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,600
 made me think of you and your kids okay and like specifically kids like more

400
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,680
 specifically just kids in general today but but especially your kids you thought

401
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,360
 you thought to call child protective services during the concert I think that

402
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,640
 often I you know I probably probably popped into my head at some point

403
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:42,600
 during the concert yeah how would you feel okay about things if your children

404
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,680
 while while attending a concert or you know a big a big event for for somebody

405
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:51,880
 that they liked if they were screaming in a way that seemed like they were in

406
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:57,360
 pain just because the person was on stage you know what I mean yes yeah I

407
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:02,120
 mean it it kind of struck me I don't have kids I don't think about things from

408
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,680
 the point of view of having kids very often and for some reason it just struck

409
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:11,800
 me at that concert that is a weird thing for you know fairly young children to

410
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:16,680
 just be you screaming at someone because they are so overwhelmed with emotion

411
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:21,200
 that was the children at the Paul McCartney concert screaming no no this

412
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,840
 was this was videos of old Beatles footage when this was that's really hard

413
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,920
 like there were children at the Paul McCartney concert several of the we saw

414
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,760
 several of them with their parents and their parents were trying to keep them

415
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,760
 awake because boy 13 year olds that have been brought by their parents to the Paul

416
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:44,640
 McCartney concert not give a shit this is a thing of kids and their parents

417
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,800
 going to concerts I never thought to go to a concert with my dad I don't think

418
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,480
 my dad ever thought to go to a concert with me I guess we would go to like a

419
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,600
 show or musical or something so maybe I don't know how different that is but it

420
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:01,120
 is it is a thing that I'm hearing a lot more of which is like but he didn't take

421
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:05,200
 you to something that he liked and just to be like you should like this is

422
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:11,480
 Willie Nelson buckle up yeah well I mean they called it Beatlemania for a reason

423
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:17,080
 it was straight up right that's what I mean mania yeah it was insanity it was

424
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:23,600
 and I think you know it just goes to the repression of the society at that time

425
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:28,720
 you know sure one of the few times people were allowed to really let their

426
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:35,200
 emotions fly and I mean if you haven't been able to be free you know that's a

427
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,000
 chance to really get it out it's it's not dissimilar from you know going to

428
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,860
 like a church revival speaking in tongues and shit you know I yeah you're

429
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,960
 probably right I also think like you know like it's really hard to relate in a

430
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:54,000
 non-internet era where like there is no fix right like you like Paul McCartney

431
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,880
 and he's not in this country that read this year right right and you can't go

432
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,760
 on any internet outlet to do it you have to try to find a magazine or something

433
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,080
 doing them do an article I'm just to kind of keep scratching that itch and

434
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,920
 then finally you after you know however you probably only gonna see him was in

435
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,080
 your life and you're there and you're gonna you're gonna scream your guts out I

436
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:20,640
 definitely think that's a crazy thing I remember when pedmas filming apprentice

437
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:26,760
 One Direction was staying at Trump Tower for their Madison Square Garden concert

438
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:34,680
 and the amount of fans that were just sitting there all day just packed around

439
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:40,240
 that building oh yeah member of One Direction to walk out of the apartment

440
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,320
 was crazy we tennis with they were all waiting for Harry's time this was about

441
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:50,000
 as famous as it gets right now yeah I think people go wild seeing her and

442
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 screaming for her definitely yeah but I think it's more yeah but it is yeah it

443
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,040
 is rare yeah I don't know I was sitting there I was standing there during the

444
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:08,240
 concert trying to like appreciate the gravity of what this was in the in the

445
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:14,360
 60s and 70s and yeah I don't think I can do it I couldn't really wrap my head

446
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,440
 around what that must have been I mean at scoop fest I don't think people even

447
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:27,680
 moved to applaud at all right that's at least half on us do something to warrant

448
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,480
 the applause I don't know is it is it kind of like a bell curve where the raw

449
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:36,640
 sexual chemistry just gets too profound and then the applause dies down it's

450
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,520
 like they're like they're just shocked into silence when they see us on the

451
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,880
 stage are like dear God my libido is in a state of frenzy that I can't even

452
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:50,800
 articulate I just have to I just have to sit here calmly or I may explode from

453
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,280
 just observation yeah that's what that's what several scoops came up to me during

454
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,280
 scoop fest and told me their libido is in a state of frenzy from observing

455
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:06,080
 that's right sorry we're not applauding my libido is in a state of friends

456
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:25,240
 never gonna clap never gonna give it up because of my libido that's in a state

457
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:31,240
 of friends he said paralyzed by horniness that's exactly it no that's

458
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:35,640
 crazy that hard to applaud with two hands full of cop how old scoops you

459
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:42,280
 how old is McCarty 83 I believe it's crazy that he's still out there and

460
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:49,620
 delivering oh yeah and putting on a good show putting on such a good show how

461
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:56,360
 much stuff was new how much stuff was Beatles how much was wings oh that was

462
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:02,080
 there was some wings there was a fair amount he made a joke at one point he

463
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:06,280
 was like oh we're gonna play some of the new stuff right now well I guess it's 20

464
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:11,400
 years old but it's still new ish and they went into it that's funny there

465
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:17,000
 wasn't much that they played that I didn't know there were a couple of there

466
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 were a couple of wing songs that he played but he played for a long time too

467
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,720
 he played for it was well over three hours that's crazy wow yeah oh Laurie

468
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,940
 Ellsworth in the chat saying not not wings one of the best moments of the

469
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:36,360
 night was a wing song when they played live and let die oh and oh the end the

470
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:41,280
 whole place just explodes crazy it was so it's crazy how prolific he is right

471
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,360
 because like we can bring up like four wing songs that are just gigantic smash

472
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:54,040
 hits host Beatles really it's just crazy have you I mean Jacob yeah Del delved

473
00:46:54,040 --> 00:47:03,160
 into the simply having a wonderful Christmas time conspiracies I've heard

474
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:07,200
 a little bit about these right what do you of course I haven't delved into these

475
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:12,600
 I have I am vaguely familiar with what you're talking so apparently simply

476
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:16,560
 having a wonderful Christmas time is actually about someone interrupting a

477
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:30,920
 wiccan ceremony we're in there having like pagan rites I'm skeptical as you

478
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:36,280
 should be as you should be it's really funny to have that song be a song of

479
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:44,400
 interrupting is very funny like people see that's that's where it starts the

480
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,880
 moon is up yeah so it's like it's the beginning of a pagan setup that's that's

481
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:54,560
 there you know that you said it like it's a to B that's a to Z because I'm

482
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,600
 just on the search for it is simply having a wonderful Christmas time about

483
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:02,320
 witchcraft is the auto fill that's right when I said right of course and it says

484
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:15,120
 no interestingly enough no oh oh did you ask Siri about that notoriously truthful that's Siri the moon is up wiccan

485
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:21,360
 wiccan ceremony no other human would look up at the sky see the moon and

486
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:25,280
 think that'd be good first line of the song nope see the moon I get wiccan oh

487
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,200
 see the moon I get wiccan apparently this is all based on just a

488
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:35,360
 misunderstood lyric all right okay sure so yeah the the the lyric that people

489
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:40,840
 hear and thought was wiccan Paul such a staunch defender of this wiccan

490
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:47,200
 ceremony conspiracy fine let's hit a lyric mr. smarty pass yeah so the lyric

491
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,980
 that Paul is referring to is the moon is right that is what that is the the

492
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:57,480
 lyric that people took to they glommed on to it that this is wiccan according to

493
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:02,240
 Paul McCartney when it when interviewed about this I said no the lyric is about

494
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:10,160
 the mood m.o.o.d. not m.o.o.n. the mood is right not the moon is right the mood

495
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:15,960
 Paul I want you an rfk jr. say one side of the conspiracy theory and then say

496
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,120
 which one the other side of the conspiracy theory is and see which one

497
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:26,200
 seems more natural and rfk jr.'s throat well when you when you watch listen to

498
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:34,400
 simply having a wonderful Christmas time well you'll find his own there are

499
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,760
 moments when they're talking about sharing drinks and those could be tainted

500
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:52,400
 with adrenochrome from babies you know simply having a wonderful Christmas time

501
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:58,440
 that translates to I'm drinking adrenochrome from babies you play it backwards it's

502
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:06,280
 uh we're drinking adrenochrome and now what's the other side that is just a

503
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:16,160
 Christmas song yeah yeah for me and my family it's not Christmas until someone

504
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:32,840
 brings a dead bear and I'm not dead yet you will be sorry that was the what do

505
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:37,480
 you call that pole at Christmas not the Yule log

506
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:51,120
 the Yule log yes someone bet that you're right the regular Christmas sounds more

507
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:58,680
 believable the only way to win is to force you to agree with rfk jr. and then

508
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:07,680
 I figured you would maybe that'll bring it back the moon is right fucking AI

509
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:13,840
 character the moon is right the moon is left ah man there were so many good

510
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:19,360
 moments in that concert completely full it was Allegiant Stadium Raider Stadium

511
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:28,360
 in Vegas totally full but they so he did I'm looking at the set list now

512
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:35,200
 they did band on the run from from wings they did get get back and then they had

513
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,280
 a little moment and he would talk a couple of times between between some of

514
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:45,640
 these little moments and then they went in to let it be and they started let it

515
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,280
 be in a very interesting way and then they in that they filled out the song

516
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:53,000
 and then they did the whole thing and by the end of it there were a couple of

517
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,320
 times in the concert by the end of it you had about 50,000 people really

518
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:04,080
 nicely singing along not singing at the top of their voices not screaming but

519
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:12,080
 just like pleasantly singing along children that's right that's right now

520
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:15,000
 this is an Allegiant was that was it where it was okay yeah there's an

521
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,920
 Allegiant Stadium that makes and at the end of let it be three years old still

522
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:23,040
 filling up Allegiant Stadium is crazy that's insane that was insane yeah and

523
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:28,120
 seemingly just effortlessly just and also moving around playing a lot of

524
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:33,360
 different instruments he played his bass is his you know famous he still had his

525
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:38,080
 bass out yes famous violin style bass I played a couple of different guitars he

526
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:45,480
 played two different pianos he played a mandolin and he played a ukulele that

527
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,480
 had been given to him by George Harrison and he told a little story about how

528
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:53,160
 George had given him this ukulele so he plays a lot of different instruments

529
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:57,240
 like he's all over it but the end of let it be you asked if there was anything

530
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:03,540
 that kind of hit me and the end of let it be definitely was was one of the two

531
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:07,840
 times in the night that I teared up a little bit just just standing there and

532
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:16,000
 and let it be yeah there will be an answer let it be and the whole audience

533
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,560
 is singing that and at the end of it he did something that I thought was fucking

534
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:26,480
 brilliant and perfect he just let that last note hit and as the audience

535
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,400
 applauded they just stood there they just they just didn't say anything and

536
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,560
 you could tell that everybody was definitely a little moved like the

537
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:40,320
 energy in the room was a little moved and he just said you know there there

538
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:49,120
 will be tomorrow just let it be I said man this guy fucking knows how to do

539
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:55,440
 this yes like he knows how to do he knows how to tap in to the energy he

540
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:01,320
 knows how to tap in to the room everybody in this room was was

541
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:08,200
 seemingly listening to to this song and thinking about the the way the world is

542
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:12,160
 right now and thinking about our brothers and sisters all over the place

543
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:17,960
 that are having a hard time because of a great many things because of war in

544
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:23,080
 different places of the world because of the the insane political climate that is

545
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:27,800
 in the United States right now and lots around the world as well I know I know

546
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:33,080
 it's an old guy thing you have to be 83 to really see the whole pattern and all

547
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:40,040
 of the average age of MSNBC watcher yeah that's it and I mean man he you know he

548
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:44,680
 hits the end of that and he knows what the whole room is thinking he knows what

549
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:48,680
 the whole room is doing and he just lets him let's everybody sit in it and he

550
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:52,040
 doesn't have to say it he doesn't even have to come out and and point an arrow

551
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:59,120
 at it he just says like yeah this is this is a thing and it's shitty right

552
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:04,520
 now and it's gonna be okay and then the the concert ended or that the the main

553
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,440
 part of the concert ended before the encore and the last song of the main

554
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,280
 concert was hey Jude which was another big of course sing-along moment I got a

555
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:19,120
 good you know 360 video of the whole crowd exactly yeah and I finished that

556
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:24,360
 and then they came out for the encore a couple of minutes later and here comes

557
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:30,760
 Paul carrying an American flag and then the some members of the band are coming

558
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,520

560
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:43,960

00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:07,780
 and they just stood there and wave these flags around for a few seconds and let

565
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:12,720
 everyone just kind of think about that and then they and they went into I've

566
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,720

01:00:54,640 --> 01:01:00,800
 golden book all about Bruce Springsteen it is a Bruce Springsteen biography

624
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:05,040
 that's as a little golden book that's really cool I just got this are you

625
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:08,320
 excited about the movie Matt I just got this note slipped under my door and it's

626
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:18,400
 telling me I should check out some Beatles my music player oh my god uh no

627
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:26,000
 no I'm not excited about the movie what do you what's the scuttlebutt is it is

628
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,240
 it a Jared Leto and Skeletor kind of situation because that's got me in a

629
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:33,440
 fucking tizzy Jared Leto is playing Skeletor in the new

630
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,640
 Bruce Springsteen movie yeah oh well that way I would I would be out of it

631
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:42,140
 too yeah it's got the dude from succession taking very big swings you

632
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:49,640
 know the bear playing Bruce is like a really weird melancholy thing and I love

633
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:54,640
 Bruce so much I've read I've read multiple biographies on him his

634
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:59,400
 autobiography as well as other biographies I I love I will see that man

635
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:03,480
 in concert as long as he's playing I'll see him when he's 83 playing playing oh

636
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:07,880
 yeah uh he can't fill up a legion by the way that's the thing it's like that's

637
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:10,240
 why I'm so impressed with Paul McCartney I don't think Bruce could fill up a

638
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:15,760
 legion yeah I think Paul I think Paul plays less than Bruce though yeah I think

639
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,480
 Paul gives audience less opportunity to say also he just does the big ones

640
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:28,120
 arguably one of the most popular people in the last in the 20th century yeah I

641
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:34,600
 think he's got a little more fame than Bruce yeah yeah anyhow I just don't I

642
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:39,000
 just don't know what the I don't know what the story is just worried you're

643
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:45,040
 just worried I don't know Matt has concerns about the Philips when Ray came

644
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:51,560
 out I do like Ray oh yeah sure really great biopic and then they kept making

645
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:58,720
 other ones that weren't as good afterwards right still about Ray Charles

646
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:05,520
 just like then a bunch of others that came after it well we did get walk hard

647
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:09,880
 from all that so that I was gonna say you have the John C Riley wall card came

648
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:14,480
 out of that whole hard yeah we say like we I think one is very hard to make a

649
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:21,240
 really good biopic and then - I don't think we have it like in our in our in

650
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:26,320
 our in our you know artistic hearts taken a lot of biopics you know like I

651
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:29,600
 think one comes around that we really just kind of like guess for what it is

652
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:34,280
 right and so I this is coming right on the heels of that really well done

653
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:40,240
 Dylan movie and yeah I just don't know if you'd get to do that twice that was

654
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:46,480
 good that was a good movie and I agree let's cancel Bruce Springsteen

655
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,600
 Jeremy Allen White's not singing right he's lip-syncing or doing whatever

656
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:57,240
 oh that's that's rough - yeah because that was actually our boy doing the

657
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:01,000
 songs right yeah Timothy Chalamet just straight-up became like a channel ever

658
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:06,680
 ding-dong don't play man same with Jamie what's his last name we played right Fox

659
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:11,200
 Jamie Fox Jamie Fox oh yeah you're right me Fox like what's a good straight up

660
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:16,040
 went to like Ray Charles school just straight up oh yeah Charles I mean doing

661
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:20,960
 Ray almost turned Jamie Foxx into a full-time musician yeah was Ray Charles

662
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:28,520
 still alive at that time yes I think so I think so he had some he had some

663
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:31,680
 actual direct firsthand - yeah yeah there's definitely yes there's definitely

664
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:36,800
 footage of Jamie Foxx learning from Ray Charles that's cool in the in the

665
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:43,880
 behind the scenes oh yeah Ray Charles died in 2004 so I hope I'm wrong but

666
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:50,440
 everything about everything I'm seeing it makes me go like sure sure well I

667
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:57,840
 mean at Tron Aries is getting in the 50s for scores right now oh no yes it's

668
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:03,200
 also not a good Bruce Springsteen movie at all and not great but I get it he's

669
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:07,160
 hardly it there's hardly any Bruce Springsteen in it you could barely call

670
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:11,200
 it a Bruce Springsteen movie I don't get the Jared Leto thing the only thing I

671
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:15,120
 think is honestly Jared Leto must have dirt on a lot of Hollywood place like

672
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:19,800
 you know to place like an interplanetary you know neon motorcycle race based

673
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:28,200
 solely on the ghost of Tom Joad album is a mistake it's just a mistake I was

674
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:31,520
 really excited I'll be very honest with you I thought that was gonna be it yeah

675
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:41,280
 just because they had so many of them first there were two that there were

676
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:45,960
 three that there were four no it's all about soon I have to try to see it right

677
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:49,600
 away because I think for the sake of this podcast I just have to I think as a

678
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:56,640
 podcast yeah I have to but yeah we'll see how it goes

679
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:02,120
 same thing with me and Tron Aries I really want to see those visuals with

680
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:07,680
 that Nine Inch Nails music I want to go see it in IMAX because the soundtrack is

681
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:13,480
 exquisite right it's it's some of the best Nine Inch Nails music in the last

682
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:19,760
 ten years yeah so I don't know I watched it's really really good I watched F1

683
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:25,120
 last night okay new Brad Pitt movie this is the Brad Pitt right yeah you did a

684
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:30,920
 great job with a soundtrack on that it's really like felt like old school like it

685
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:36,040
 was really a lot of scorpion songs very old school sports movie that like the

686
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:42,480
 soundtrack was really pumping you up nice I liked it it was it was it was you

687
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:48,680
 know I think we figured out so much with movies now it was it was a it's a sports

688
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:53,800
 movie it's a it's a sports movie traditionally done well executed it was

689
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:59,880
 really fun to watch and yeah I just I I'm looking forward to it it looks like

690
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:03,920
 watch for me so last night did my first shows on the ship so it was like I was

691
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:08,400
 staying I was a little wired so I just watched it to the end so then I went to

692
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:16,480
 sleep it was fun how did the first shows on the ship go good good good good it

693
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:24,760
 was it's a big enough room where I basically like couldn't get like I did I

694
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:29,400
 did the show as written and so it went over well a lot of people laughed you

695
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:33,360
 know me I like to get like something spontaneous happening in the show and I

696
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:37,080
 want like another character to emerge that kind of stuff and I didn't get any

697
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:42,640
 characters out of the show and so everyone else like you know could show

698
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:47,640
 really funny I was like yeah yeah I was fine there's a fine show there's a solid

699
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:54,340
 BB - this is good I mean even awesome crew here is also neat they have seven

700
01:07:54,340 --> 01:08:00,960
 movable giant LED screens that you can arrange or whatever order you want that's

701
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:06,880
 a that's a nice plus it is yeah and so I created like a V with six LED screens

702
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:12,000
 and put one all the way back nice and it was really nice to create intimacy with

703
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,960
 the audience to kind of focus that V right there and so I got to perform kind

704
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:20,800
 of center stage and not feel too small in the giant theater okay and it was and

705
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,640
 so that part's super fun their crew is just unbelievable they just follow

706
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:27,200
 every direction to a hill you tell everybody everything once everybody's

707
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:33,400
 remarkably calm nobody's there's no crew that you want that's the juice right

708
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,480
 there ship is next level it has no cruise director that they have different

709
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:39,360
 people in different positions that handle things but no one's job is to

710
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:43,480
 talk to our hosts to the audience so you just come out and do your show and your

711
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:47,880
 show ends there's no extra hey this is what's happening tomorrow here's what's

712
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:53,040
 going on later on tonight on deck seven blah blah blah blah that's that's cool

713
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,960
 this whole ship is so different it's so it's like it's like it's honestly with

714
01:08:55,960 --> 01:09:01,440
 the cosmopolitan let's see it's it's a there's no fake opulence like there's no

715
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:09,000
 like grand ballroom type feel to stuff like it's all very hip hotel nice little

716
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:14,240
 niche nice things yeah yeah it's really it's designed from what I can see in

717
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:18,000
 there it looks pretty cool it's oh it's the nicest room I've been put in as a

718
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,600
 guest entertainer by far well that was the thing as soon as I as soon as I

719
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,320

 oh we got a scooper to come in as today from ML Kennedy the categories are that

766

 was remade this time in English good remakes and confusion remakes always be

767
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:10,240
 first I'll try I'll try that was remade for 200 this 1984 Ivan Reitman film was

768
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:16,560
 remade by Paul Feig I think in 2016 but never mind that one we're trying again

769
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:26,480
 with a soft reboot next March this is a this is an older scooper to here oh yes

770
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:31,920
 I guess it is but thank you this is great what I have is this not next March

771
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:35,240
 is this is this like a previous March that already happened yeah yeah this is

772
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:40,280
 March 2017 or 2018 yeah oh well that's that explains why I don't know this I

773
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:54,800
 pass Matt yes Paul Ghostbusters oh oh yeah dad dad dadada oh okay Matt uh this

774
01:14:54,800 --> 01:15:03,360
 time in English please for 200 based on a play 1978 Lacan's a folly was titled

775
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:10,160
 this when it was remade with Robin Williams in 1996 the birdcage the bird

776
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:19,240
 cage is correct let's see I'll try oh no it's Paul Paul you're up uh I will try

777
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:28,800
 that was remade for 400 this 1987 Paul Verhoeven classic was remade in 2014 the

778
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:35,120
 remake made 243 million dollars despite no one remembering it I guess crimes new

779
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:45,840
 enemy didn't make an impression RoboCop RoboCop is correct ah boy I'm not doing

780
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:51,120
 well on this one at all I'll try good remakes for 200 be afraid to be very

781
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:55,920
 afraid this 1986 Cronenberg remake starring Jeff Goldblum and Gina Davis is

782
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:03,380
 much better than the original 1958 version help me that would be Jurassic

783
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:09,140
 Park Jurassic Park starring Gina Davis she was the t-rex she was the t-rex big

784
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:19,920
 old lady that'd be the fly the fly yes she was the pilot Gina Davis Matt good

785
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:29,460
 remakes 400 but the category number three there we go yes this film was

786
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:34,880
 awesome in 1956 arguably better when remade in 1978 still pretty good when

787
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:40,520
 remade in 1993 and pretty terrible when remade in 2007 as the film is about

788
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:44,520
 duplicate replacement copies it makes sense that another remake is in the

789
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:56,740
 works Oh I don't know pass that's Paul Paul would you know that is invasion of

790
01:16:56,740 --> 01:17:03,840
 the body snatchers invasion of the body snatchers is correct Paul is fucking

791
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:09,360
 rolling with ML Kennedy's game today Paul you're up that was remade for 600

792
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:16,240
 please this 1990 Paul Verhoeven film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger was not

793
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:21,080
 based on a Stephen King work it was remade with Colin Farrell in 2012 you'd

794
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:28,040
 probably need a perfect memory to recollect that that would be get your

795
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:36,480
 ass to mouth total recall total recall is correct there we go I forgot that

796
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:39,560
 Colin Farrell had made a total recall was that any good it couldn't have been

797
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:52,840
 right I didn't see it let's see I'll try a good remake 600 this 1960 killer plant

798
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:57,800
 film was made for about $28,000 and all its interior shots were done in two days

799
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:04,080
 naturally the more popular 1986 version is a 25 million dollar musical I believe

800
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:13,160
 oh wait does it oh it's a daily double I can say it all out loud I think it is a

801
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:21,160
 little shop of horrors but it could be attack of the killer tomatoes in 1960

802
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:25,880
 yeah I don't think it's yeah yeah yeah it's a little shop of horrors yeah yeah

803
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:34,680
 there it is you got it Matt I will take good remakes for 800 Jeff

804
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:39,840
 Bridges replaced John Wayne when the Coen brothers remade this 1969 film in

805
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:51,560
 2010 true grit true grit is correct Paul I'll close out what that was remade for

806
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:56,120
 8 Schwarzenegger was replaced by Jason Momoa when they tried to revive this

807
01:18:56,120 --> 01:19:02,320
 film franchise in 2011 the 2011 remake made less money than the 1982 film even

808
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:08,440
 before adjusting for inflation tell me what is good in the box office that hurts

809
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:16,880
 not this that hurts Conan Conan the barbarian I had no idea Jason Momoa did

810
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:22,160
 a Conan remake oh yeah it's terrible and I love Conan I'm sitting here with the

811
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:27,960
 whole classic run a Conan I got this I got these brand new ones this is the

812
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:31,840
 brand show of hands anybody surprised that Paul has Conan toys at his

813
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:37,280
 fingertips no hands no hands look they definitely didn't inspire each other

814
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:41,240
 that's all I want you to know okay master's universe is not a ripoff of

815
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:57,560
 Conan that's for sure good who yeah he should he's getting there well it's if

816
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:01,400
 they do pull off that third Dune movie which I guess they are moving forward

817
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:06,440
 with some production stuff he might that might be really interesting to see him

818
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:11,200
 turn that because that's a crazy character arc for that character that

819
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:17,240
 he's playing oh really oh yes yes yes yeah cuz he is good and the he's one of

820
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:21,080
 the parts of the Dune movies that I like so far so do you know what happens to

821
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:25,720
 his character no no I don't know anything about it so it's Duncan Idaho is

822
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:30,720
 this okay character he plays and Paul Atreides love Duncan Idaho you saw how

823
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:34,520
 you know they'd captured that relationship of how he idolized him and

824
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:38,440
 everything is like that's what was that second name you said Paul Atreides the

825
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:41,960
 main character oh okay that's oh the Timmy shit Timmy's channel have a ding

826
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:47,200
 dong yeah okay so they were you know best buds well he ends up cloning him

827
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:53,680
 over and over and over again and he gets Duncan Idaho gets real weird and

828
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:58,580
 philosophical about shit being a clone it's interesting so yeah just like

829
01:20:58,580 --> 01:21:03,480
 Michael Keaton in multiplicity just like that exactly it's me I'll try this time

830
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:08,820
 in English for 400 Spike Lee directed the 2013 version of this 2003 Korean

831
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:12,920
 film the second installment of the Vengeance trilogy preceded by sympathy

832
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:17,880
 for mr. Vengeance and followed by Lady Vengeance

833
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:27,720
 what you heard it I I have I have no idea I I don't think I do I think I'm

834
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:30,520

838
01:21:56,040 --> 01:22:00,200

839
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:07,440
 the what's his name yeah I didn't see that one Matt you're up I'll do with

840
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:15,520
 confusion remakes 200 Rob Zombie remade this 1978 movie in 2007 then he made a

841
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:19,160
 sequel then we ignored both those movies and all the other films in the

842
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:23,720
 franchise to make a sequel to the original 1978 version in 2018 which

843
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:29,440
 shares the same name as the 1978 and 2007 movies huh I don't know this but

844
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:37,520
 that's very funny yes Paul Halloween Halloween is correct oh I

845
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:41,920
 wasn't against Halloween but yeah you would have got it yeah if you had you

846
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:50,240
 would have gotten more points Paul shit uh yeah confusion remakes before the

847
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:54,640
 thing from another world was remade by John Carpenter in 1982 and called this

848
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:59,280
 then in 2011 they made a prequel to the 1982 movie and gave it the same name

849
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:07,360
 as the 1982 film of a thing the thing is correct this category specifically just

850
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:12,000
 bread and butter to Paul here I mean this really is pretty much with four

851
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,960
 questions left I have 800 points Matt has a thousand points Paul has 3,400

852
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:20,240
 points guys and none of those are off a daily double there's still a daily

853
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:25,520
 double out there could bring us could bring me to my knees real quick I'll try

854
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:32,240
 confusion remakes for 600 in 1998 Gus van Santen made a shot-for-shot remake of

855
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:41,920
 this 1960 Hitchcock film for reasons it had oh what's that guy's name that's in

 Austrian film funny games was made in 1997 by Michael Hankney Hankney Hankie I

859
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:11,280

860
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:21,520
 called this funny games I don't know is it the game I think it's the same title

861
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:33,080
 Matt you think the same title I think I'll pass Paul how much does he think

862
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:39,320

870
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:24,280
 series about murderer Charles Lee Ray comprised seven films the most recent of

871
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:29,400

875
01:25:53,260 --> 01:26:00,080

876
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:05,900
 English 800 the American version of this film came out in 2010 despite the

877
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:10,360
 original also being in English and coming out in 2007 Peter Dinklage plays

878
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:17,800
 the main antagonist in both films huh American version of this film came out

879
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:28,520
 in 2010 was this the station agent gotta be right I'll say the station agent now

880
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:33,640
 it's death at a funeral no I think the station agents older than that yeah I

881

01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:51,560
 say this is the shop but so I think we spend it before about explaining again we

896
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:54,360
 have to stop giving out discounts to the shop because they wouldn't give us codes

897
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:58,920
 that lasted long these are too many bots out there that comb the internet for

898
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:02,520
 codes and offered to people right I'm sure you all have an app on one of your

899
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:06,440
 computers that offers you to run a bunch of discount codes through and that's why

900
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:11,200
 we can't offer discount codes to their shop anymore I thought about that today

901
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:16,880
 I ordered something last night and I got that I got the thing today and as I was

902
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:19,300
 ordering it they had a little like oh here's here's where you enter the

903
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:23,960
 discount code oh this this never works I might as well try it and I looked up one

904
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:34,120
 and got a 40% off discount code this is why our shop can't do this yeah but we

905
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:37,760
 still have a shop available with all kinds of really cool stuff for sale check

906
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:58,280
 that out over at store jingle dot com yeah but basically like this podcast is

907
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:01,880
 awesome I mean you your podcast is something paid for very expensive

908
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:08,960

909
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:12,520

921
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:23,040
 passionate well thought opinions about bad bunny being the halftime show so we

922
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:30,800
 didn't get into that very passionate anything you should get tricked into a

923
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:34,560
 debate on online is whether or not you have very strong opinions about who's

924
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:41,760
 gonna play for 20 minutes in between a football game a football game being

925
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:47,400
 played by teams that are as of yet unknown I've started asking people who

926
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:51,520
 do say bad things about bad bunny if they know where the Super Bowl is

927
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:55,300
 actually being played this year so far the answer that question has been no

928
01:30:55,300 --> 01:31:02,040
 they don't know who's gonna watch the Super Bowl and want other people to

929
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:06,040
 watch too so they get people who bring in a different audience than some of

930
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:15,280
 his already gonna watch the Super Bowl it is almost like oh winner scoop in the

931
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:19,060
 chat says I guess JD Vance said the NFL should drop bad bunny and hire Lee

932
01:31:19,060 --> 01:31:24,760
 Greenwood yeah as someone who has seen Lee Greenwood play live a couple of

933
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:33,960
 times I'm just gonna tell you nobody wants that nobody wants that no no he

934
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:39,640
 doesn't want to have to play live in front man that ain't Paul McCartney he's

935
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:43,920
 like fuck this I'm retired yeah that it costs money to do like you lose so much

936
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:49,760
 money in the Super Bowl halftime show and I don't think Lee Greenwood has that money

937
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:54,960
 kind of jingle he ain't liquid like that all right well anyhow thanks for
