00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Oh, hello there. I am so glad you're here because it's time to thank the ice cream truck drivers.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Who are the ice cream truck drivers?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Why, these are the folks who deliver that ice cream straight to your ear holes.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Right now I'd like to thank Sarah Boyle, Richard Dunn, Pyro, Paul's brother, Mike, Malia, Leon Kasab, and Lori Ellsworth.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Here's the show.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social?

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Yeah, I'd love to.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Great, let's go.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 [Music]

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Just got a video message from my friend Alex Ramone.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Oh yes?

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Because he's out in New Jersey at something called ProfitCon.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Nothing scratches me wrong about that in any way.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Heading out the old ProfitCon in New Jersey.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 P-R-O-P-H-E-T?

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 No, no, no. I wouldn't have outed him if he was at ProfitCon.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Alex Ramone is the returned prophet for a group in New Jersey.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 If anyone could pull off a cult, it's Alex Ramone.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 That is true, that is true.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Let's not get it twisted, MJ can pull off the cult.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 He knows where his bread is buttered.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 MJ would be on all the merchandise.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Profit like money, profit like money.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Profit like money y'all, that's the name of this episode.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Profit like money.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 They should have just called the con Step 3.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Right.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 We could start doing a Step 3 con.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Super expensive tickets, nothing really happens, it'll be great.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 He said he was a magician.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 And the woman goes, "Do you know someone named Matt Donnelly?"

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 And he goes, "Yes."

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 And she goes, "Well, I know him, but I really know his wife Sarah."

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 I was really good friends with Sarah and her friend Jen.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 And so he pulled out his phone, they made a video, shot a video to me.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And it is the woman who booked Sarah and I on a Valentine's Day morning show when we were first dating.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Oh wow.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Yeah.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 She was a TV producer.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 I remember this.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Yeah, she was a TV producer.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Because SJ and I were supposed to, I don't know, this was a different thing, right?

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 I think I'm getting confused with something else.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 This was way earlier, this was back in New York.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Because there was another thing that happened like this in Vegas.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Didn't you and Sarah shoot like a Valentine's thing in Vegas one time?

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Yes.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 And Jimmy and Robin were in it.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 That's what I started thinking of immediately, Jacob.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 I was on your page, but then this is even earlier.

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 There have been conspiring forces all around you for decades to make sure you and Sarah are a thing, huh?

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 I think it's possible that's the only reason Matt and Sarah are together.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Because the universe forced Sarah into it.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Yeah, I mean the second one of her friends goes like, "Sarah, seriously?"

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 And then she might just like come out of it like a hypnotist.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Like, oh shit.

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Oh God, what have I been doing for all these years?

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 I have children.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 He's hideous.

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 No, no, so when we first started dating, we were hanging out, having drinks with our friend Jen.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 We're still very good friends with Jen.

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Jen and Andy, her husband hired me to do handiwork when I had that job destroying offices and painting walls.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Oh, right.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Yeah, yeah.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Oh, I thought you were referring to close up.

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 And Jen was in Miami with Sarah out here in Vegas.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 She later did Miami on Broadway, did Kinky Boots on Broadway, still lives in New York, good friend of ours.

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Definitely tried to cock block us on our first date, which I always think is very funny.

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Not like she wanted me, but she just wanted the date to get awkward.

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 She came and mess with us.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 She was at the bar and she got hammered.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 It kept being like, "So you really like Sarah?

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Are you going to mess with her?

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 What are you going to do?"

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 And really out loud in front of Sarah and I trying to destroy the date, all the chemistry.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Great.

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 And I doubled down and go like, "No, I really like her.

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Yeah, no, it's great."

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 And I just turned to Sarah and was like, "I really like you.

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 I really want to keep dating."

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 And so I just was like eating all of her things to destroy it and be like, "No, I'm going to stay confident."

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 And be like, "I like this gal."

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Yeah.

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 So then we ended up becoming all drinking buddies as I continued to date.

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 And then we had beers with this woman, Liz, who is a producer.

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 And she then goes, "Oh, I need couples for a thing on Thursday for Valentine's Day.

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 We need couples competing for a travel sponsor.

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 We want to do a getaway or whatever."

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 And so I was like, "Well, we're not close to married.

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 We've been dating about six or seven months or whatever."

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Right.

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Because we'd only been dating for six or seven months, we crushed it.

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Oh, because you just knew everything about each other.

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 We knew everything about each other.

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 We knew everyone's favorite colors.

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 And hadn't had time to forget it.

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Favorite movies, favorite whatever.

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Yeah.

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 All the things that you forget over time.

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 It went to my head.

104
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 I could not tell you Sarah's favorite color or favorite movie.

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 And she could not do the same for me.

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Oh, Sarah's favorite color is blue.

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Yeah.

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 And her favorite movie is being John Malkovich.

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 All right.

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Jacob, you and Sarah are going away to Maui.

111
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Maui!

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Ann's favorite color is red.

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 I don't know that she likes movies enough to have a favorite.

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 But I don't know.

115
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Maybe "Step Brothers" like me.

116
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 We both love "Step Brothers."

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 So we one tied with another couple.

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 And so we had a tiebreaker.

119
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 And I lost the tiebreaker because it's for a travel website.

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 And they asked how many destinations does the travel website go to?

121
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 And I was like, I don't know, 1,000?

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 And the sponsor was like, what?

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 And the answer was like 100.

124
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 I was off by an order of magnitude.

125
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Yeah.

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 I was automatically the sponsor.

127
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 I did.

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 I was automatically the sponsor.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 So instead we got like--

130
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 I don't know.

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 All of them?

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Spin the globe and just hit--

133
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Just three places in Arkansas.

134
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 It's only three places in Arkansas that our company goes.

135
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Oh my god.

136
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Throw a dart at a map.

137
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 I don't know who this guy is.

138
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 So we ended up with-- it was something like a $300 voucher or $500 voucher

139
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 or something like that.

140
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Oh, that's pretty nice.

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 In second place, yeah.

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 First place was like thousands of dollars in a real vacation.

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 But you probably had to pay taxes on that.

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Maybe, yeah, maybe.

145
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 All I know is that--

146
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 I think it was like $300.

147
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Because Sarah and I were so broke that we couldn't use the $300 as a base point.

148
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 We had to use $300 as our budget.

149
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Yeah.

150
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Right.

151
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 You now have a budget of $300.

152
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 You've gone from having a budget of zero to having a budget of $300.

153
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Exactly.

154
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 So we did a getaway to a hotel just outside of Philadelphia from New York.

155
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 And we spent a weekend in Philly.

156
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Perfect.

157
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 That's pretty good.

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 That's pretty good.

159
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 The Paris of Pennsylvania.

160
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

161
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Good Lord.

162
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 But it was fun.

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 It was fun.

164
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 We did have a good time.

165
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Oh, that's great.

166
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Yeah, yeah.

167
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 I miss the days of just like, well, we're going to do something.

168
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Yeah.

169
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 We don't have any money.

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 There's a hotel down the road.

171
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Let's go stay there.

172
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 I know.

173
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 It really is.

174
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 I do miss those days.

175
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 That was the plan in Vegas.

176
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 When you're living in Vegas, what else are you going to do?

177
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Just go get a hotel deal.

178
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 That's right.

179
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 Yeah.

180
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Staycation, baby.

181
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Yeah.

182
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Well, we were out last weekend.

183
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 It was one of my son's birthdays.

184
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Okay.

185
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 And he and his friend, when they were young, they used to always do joint birthdays because

186
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 our friend Danny and Jason, they're kiddo.

187
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 They're kiddo.

188
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 There's no popular person on earth than their child.

189
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 Like, every time they start saying a new expression, it's like, oh, you've been hanging out with

190
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Danny's kid again, you know, kind of thing.

191
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 And suddenly they want a new game.

192
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 And the best was, okay.

193
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 This is her, we're being coy about the names because it's people's children, but we know

194
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 these kids.

195
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 This is Danny's oldest son that you're talking about, right?

196
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 No, their youngest.

197
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 It's the same age.

198
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Oh, the youngest.

199
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 The youngest.

200
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Their oldest, they think he's cool as hell, but he doesn't spend a lot of time.

201
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 But he's a little older.

202
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 He's a little older.

203
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Yeah, yeah.

204
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 But their youngest son is the same as my oldest and they're only nine days apart.

205
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 And so they used to do joint birthday parties, then different schools, different whatever.

206
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 We finally decided like, let's do it.

207
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Let's get together and do a birthday party.

208
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 But I'm going to take a side note here to be like, I've now officially encountered my

209
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 first, like I've been out of touch with slang that we brought up on this show, but my kids

210
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 have now just started saying this expression that I am like, what?

211
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 And they won't stop saying it.

212
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 Are they saying for shizzle?

213
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 They're saying for shizzle?

214
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Can I, can I take a guess?

215
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Yes.

216
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Is it six, seven?

217
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Oh, they do that before every photo and I ask them what it means and they don't know

218
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 what it means, but they do say six, seven.

219
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 I love kids saying things that they don't know what it means.

220
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 It's my favorite thing.

221
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Yeah.

222
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Do you, do you know what six, seven is from Paul?

223
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 I have dug up a couple of things.

224
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Yeah.

225
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 So it's, it's Levar Balls height.

226
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Okay.

227
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Okay.

228
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Or LaMelo Ball.

229
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 LaMelo Balls.

230
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 LaMelo Balls.

231
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 LaMelo Balls height.

232
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Charlotte.

233
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 And then it, it's sort of like, oh, I would like to be that, you know, like, like to be

234
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 six, seven or whatever.

235
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Yeah.

236
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Like that would be cool.

237
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 But it's also can mean mid in certain situations.

238
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Okay.

239
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Like it's only six and seven out of 10.

240
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Yeah.

241
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Like that it's, it's been co-opted to that sometimes, but it, but it's, but also Jacob

242
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 more to the, mostly it's people don't know what the fuck it is.

243
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 They just say it.

244
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Yes.

245
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Cause everybody says it.

246
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 If it comes up like in a thing, six, seven, six, seven.

247
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Yeah.

248
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 They just yell six, seven.

249
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Like you guys take a photo.

250
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 They go, okay.

251
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 And I'm gonna go six, seven.

252
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 And they laugh.

253
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Yep.

254
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 And that we don't know why.

255
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Yeah.

256
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Yep.

257
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 It's a reference to basketball players height and some other weird meanings that have been

258
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 attributed to it.

259
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 There you go.

260
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 So they say bet.

261
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Oh.

262
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Oh, yeah.

263
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Bet.

264
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 That's back now.

265
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 That's back.

266
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Oh yeah.

267
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Bet's bet's back.

268
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Wow.

269
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 You know what else I heard that was back the other day?

270
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 I was watching a video of kids getting their hair cut.

271
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 What's that?

272
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 You know what this kid said?

273
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Getting haircuts has been around for a while, Paul.

274
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 Okay.

275
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 This is a viral barber shop where the kids on their summer vacation can spin a wheel and

276
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 get crazy haircuts.

277
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Okay.

278
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Oh, I like that.

279
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 And they dare their friends to spin the wheel and go for the crazy haircut, like half shaved,

280
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 half on, or old man, where they cut off all the back hair and just leave the horseshoe

281
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 rim and all that kind of stuff.

282
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 Good.

283
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Good.

284
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 So these kids, these young kids are getting these wild haircuts, this thing.

285
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 But this one kid spun it and he got the half on, half off, right?

286
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Yeah.

287
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Good.

288
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Right down the thing.

289
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 But then the fryer tuck, that's one of them they're getting.

290
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Yeah.

291
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 He's getting it done.

292
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 He's like, he's liking the look.

293
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 And he says, oh, that's tough.

294
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Tough is back.

295
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Whoa.

296
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Tough is back.

297
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Fucking greaser.

298
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 I haven't heard tough in forever.

299
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Sorry.

300
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 I have to go fight with the socias.

301
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Dude, like for real, tough.

302
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 That was such a thing when we were kids.

303
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 For me, anyway, everything was tough.

304
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Yes, it's from the outsiders.

305
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 No, but no, it's even before that.

306
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 It's like, oh, that's tough.

307
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 It was like, cool.

308
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Yeah.

309
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 I mean, it was written about in the outsiders though, in the famous book, The Outsiders.

310
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Oh, I guess.

311
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Yeah.

312
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 And it was kind of immortalized in that.

313
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 But yeah, I mean, it was around, the author wrote about a thing that was just around at

314
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 the time.

315
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Yeah.

316
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Yeah.

317
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 So my kids are saying, oh, bet.

318
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Like, yeah, good.

319
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Let's do it.

320
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 It's on.

321
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Yeah.

322
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 So they're saying dubs or W, like win, like that's a win.

323
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Yeah.

324
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 Uh huh.

325
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Getting some dubs.

326
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Yeah.

327
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 And also just going like dubs.

328
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Let's do it.

329
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Be dubs three.

330
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Then they start saying, oh, bet.

331
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Well, a couple of things about that was one was like, we had the quintessential what happens

332
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 with parents.

333
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,320
 Like, I couldn't believe like this conversation was happening because it's like, it's as written

334
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,000
 as every parent should.

335
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Yes.

336
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Yes.

337
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 So I said, when did you guys start saying bet?

338
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 And my oldest was like, I've been saying it forever.

339
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 No.

340
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Forever.

341
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 No, you haven't.

342
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 That is simply not true.

343
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 We're very aware of your speech.

344
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 We have paid, over the years that you have been alive, we have paid a lot of attention

345
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 to you.

346
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Exactly.

347
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 I was like, what?

348
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 No, you have not.

349
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 You have not.

350
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 That was 80s.

351
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 You weren't saying it yesterday.

352
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 That was 80s hip hop slang.

353
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Oh yeah.

354
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Bet's been back for a couple of years.

355
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Bet's been back in a hard way for a couple of years.

356
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Crazy.

357
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 And so anyways, we decided to do a joint birthday party.

358
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 We went out to Sandy Valley.

359
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Sandy Valley Ranch.

360
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Oh, not the strip club.

361
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 No, no, no.

362
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 I mean, it was just across the street.

363
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Yeah.

364
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 But it was actually driving up.

365
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 I was like, I did see like ranch, ranch, ranch.

366
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 And I was like, wait, where am I?

367
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 And I was like, oh, I'm in California.

368
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 So there's no bunny ranches.

369
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 No whatever here.

370
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 But you drive out the Gene Goodsprings exit off of the 15 on your way out of town.

371
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 And then you just drive forever out in the middle of the desert.

372
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 And then suddenly you pop a bunch of ranches.

373
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 And I think we would categorize it as glamping.

374
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Yeah.

375
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 All right.

376
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Yeah.

377
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 So there's a giant teepee where the kids all piled in and stayed there or whatever.

378
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Good.

379
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Sarah, Danny, and I have the covered wagon.

380
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 And we gave our friends, the younger couple with the two more kids a mini house, full mini

381
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 house for them.

382
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Great.

383
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Are these outdoor little like, you know, kitchenette areas where it's, you know, it's a gas stove,

384
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 propane pens for showers.

385
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 So these are pretty permanent structures.

386
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 They're not like tents.

387
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 No, no.

388
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 They're permanent structures.

389
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 That's it.

390
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 That's what I mean.

391
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 They have locking front doors.

392
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 No.

393
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 Oh, yes, actually.

394
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Yes.

395
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Not the teepee.

396
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 I can't lock down the teepee.

397
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Oh, really?

398
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Oh, not with that attitude.

399
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 No.

400
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 You're out, Paul.

401
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 If you can't lock the teepee, you're not going.

402
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 I can't lock my teepee.

403
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 I'm gone.

404
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 I'm gone.

405
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Because I used to have nightmares about, I used to have nightmares about that all the

406
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 time.

407
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 How about people breaking into your teepee?

408
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 No.

409
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Why?

410
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Well, one, people would break into my teepee and then break into my wigwam.

411
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 And I was like, and I was like, fuck, doc, what am I supposed to do?

412
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 And the doctor said, you're too tense.

413
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 You know who else was just made a little sad by that joke?

414
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,580
 The following sponsor.

415
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:42,880
 Today's show is brought to you by Bobby Butt Sticks Boulangerie and Lingerie Shop.

416
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,880
 That's right.

417
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,520
 From Dave Sorensen in 2024.

418
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,000
 That's Bobby Butt Sticks Boulangerie and Lingerie Shop.

419
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,120
 Boulangerie.

420
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,120
 What's Boulangerie?

421
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,120
 Boulangerie.

422
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,120
 I think it's a type of restaurant, but let me look.

423
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,120
 Yeah.

424
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,120
 Let me look it up for you.

425
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,440
 Let me look it up for you, Bobby Butt Sticks.

426
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,440
 Thanks.

427
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,560
 I'd like to advertise my establishment, but I need to know what I am.

428
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,560
 It's a Belgian bakery.

429
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,560
 It's a Belgian bakery.

430
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,560
 There we go.

431
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,560
 It's a bakery.

432
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,560
 Okay, great.

433
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,560
 Yeah.

434
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,560
 So it's a Boulangerie and Lingerie.

435
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:22,640
 Hello, I'm Bobby Butt Sticks.

436
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,400
 Where did this voice come from?

437
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,960
 It came from me, Bobby Butt Sticks.

438
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:36,720
 I started a French bakery years ago and I had nowhere to put my buns.

439
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:44,920
 So what I decided was I would also sell lingerie and I dress my baguettes in badonkadonk thongs.

440
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,680
 That's right.

441
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:58,080
 You can buy the finest loaves and titty holsters at my place of business.

442
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,560
 Bobby Butt Sticks, Boulangerie, come get it.

443
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,560
 Boulangerie shop.

444
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
 Yeah, that's right.

445
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,560
 That's right.

446
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,560
 You heard me.

447
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,560
 You heard it.

448
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,520
 You know what I said.

449
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,040
 So also I have sweet buns.

450
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,360
 I have hot cross buns.

451
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:25,120
 And if you're lucky and you buy something very tantalizing, you'll get sticky buns.

452
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,320
 That's the Boulangerie, Bobby Butt Sticks, Boulangerie guarantee.

453
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,600
 Yeah, oh wow.

454
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:41,580
 I'm getting notifications from the ugly old woman in the kitchen that something is cooking

455
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,580
 and done.

456
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,600
 Hello, ugly old woman in the kitchen.

457
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
 What do we got?

458
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,800
 Oh my God.

459
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:53,760
 The ugly old woman found the lingerie and she put it on and she's transformed into a beautiful

460
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,080
 lady.

461
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,000
 Oh, she's gorgeous.

462
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,840
 We're going to go and get married.

463
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,500
 I'm sorry, I'm closing the restaurant and lingerie shop to spend the rest of my life

464
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:11,520
 with the ugly old woman who was my cook who only needed some TLC and some nice lingerie.

465
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,040
 Oh boy, my life has changed forever today.

466
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:21,680
 Thank you me for selling the things that made the ugly old woman in my shop pretty and I

467
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,120
 can marry her.

468
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,120
 Happy Thanksgiving everybody.

469
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,120
 Don't enter Hayscoops at checkout.

470
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,120
 No, because we're done.

471
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,120
 Don't enter Hayscoops at checkout.

472
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,120
 The store's closed.

473
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,120
 The store's closed for marriage.

474
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,120
 We're turning it into a house.

475
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,120
 This was an odd commercial to pay for.

476
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,120
 We charge a lot of money for these commercials.

477
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:43,440
 It's weird that they're paying for this commercial just to tell us that the store is closed down.

478
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,240
 I'd like you all to meet Mrs. Bobby Butt Sticks aka the ugly woman.

479
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,240
 There she is.

480
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,240
 Hey, hey.

481
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,240
 How's everybody doing?

482
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,480
 Oh, she's so beautiful now.

483
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,800
 It's a real pleasure to be here.

484
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:01,040
 Now don't you give her sass because she's wearing lingerie around the town.

485
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
 That's how she does it.

486
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,640
 It's the only way I look good.

487
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,640
 That's right.

488
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,640
 If she takes off her sexy lingerie.

489
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,000
 Until this I was an ugly old woman.

490
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,720
 She takes off her sexy lingerie.

491
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,160
 It's like a magic spell.

492
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,920
 Did you guys watch any of the newest fight of the century?

493
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
 What?

494
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,920
 Is Canelo, Canelo Crawford?

495
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,200
 Canelo and Bud Crawford.

496
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
 Who?

497
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,440
 I don't get to watch any of it but it was the big fight that was on Netflix, big boxing

498
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,440
 fight.

499
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,120
 Yeah, it was the big boxing fight.

500
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:37,320
 So you had Canelo, the reigning defending champion and you had Crawford who came up

501
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,780
 in weight to match Canelo to do the fight at all.

502
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,780
 It was weird.

503
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:47,680
 They were talking about it because it's like the end of both of their careers but it's

504
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,520
 the biggest fight that Crawford has had to date.

505
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:59,000
 He's been a really renowned fighter and a crazy respected boxer but never had any star

506
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 power.

507
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 This was his third weight class.

508
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,760
 This is a fight that they've been trying to make this fight happen for a few years.

509
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,200
 It was the first boxing fight in years though that has actually lived up to the hype that

510
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
 came into it.

511
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,280
 It was actually a really good, fun to watch event.

512
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,280
 Yes.

513
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,680
 Well, I didn't watch the whole event.

514
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:25,280
 The whole event was like 6 hours long on Netflix with all the pre-fights and our friend Mitzi

515
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,660
 was texting us during the first fight and saying there were more people in the ring

516
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,760
 than there were in the stadium because it was in Allegiant.

517
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,760
 It was in the huge stadium.

518
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,800
 They set a new attendance record in Allegiant Stadium where the Raiders play, 70-some-odd-thousand

519
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
 people.

520
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,800
 Oh my God though.

521
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,120
 I really liked this fight.

522
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,040
 I watched the whole main event fight.

523
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:56,440
 You had all of this Saudi stuff and the Saudi Crown Prince got introduced before the fight.

524
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,880
 They did a special thank you to the Saudi Crown Prince who was in attendance at the

525
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,000
 fight because I think he had given a lot of money to make it all happen.

526
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,840
 I think he was part of it and the crowd of 70-some-odd-thousand people loudly booed the

527
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:17,460
 Saudi Crown Prince live on Netflix and it was pretty hilarious.

528
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:22,040
 This is a very strange thing that's happening.

529
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,800
 Did you guys see the announcement that WrestleMania 43 is going to Saudi Arabia?

530
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,800
 Yep.

531
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,560
 Dude, Tom Brady just signed a flag football thing to play flag football in Saudi Arabia.

532
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,560
 Good grief.

533
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,920
 I need a Saudi Prince to get into podcasting, improv and magic like yesterday.

534
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,920
 Yeah.

535
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,520
 Oh, it would be great.

536
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,040
 I don't know.

537
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,040
 It seems really scary, all of it.

538
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:51,800
 I mean, it seems like there is enough money involved that no one who is tempted by that

539
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,880
 money remotely gives a shit about the optics of it.

540
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,080
 Well, I mean, they got CM Punk, he flipped.

541
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,080
 Well there you go.

542
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,080
 There's the proof.

543
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,080
 I told you.

544
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,080
 What more proof do you need?

545
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,920
 No, but I told you about that a couple of years ago when he was out on the outs with

546
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:16,000
 WWE and he had an argument with one of the other guys who was going to go perform in

547
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:24,880
 the Saudi Arabian and he said, "Go suck a blood soaked dick in Saudi Arabia," and he

548
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,400
 had to apologize for it this year when he went.

549
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,640
 Because he's taking money.

550
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,400
 He went to hell with money.

551
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,400
 Yeah.

552
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
 It's weird.

553
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,880
 There is, there just simply isn't an amount of money where we don't care about the murder

554
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,040
 of a journalist.

555
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,520
 That's it.

556
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,520
 That's it.

557
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,920
 It is, "I murdered a journalist, but I would like to give you money.

558
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,400
 I'll give you 50 million dollars and you just won't mention that I murdered a journalist

559
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,400
 anymore."

560
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:02,560
 Well, I mean, I still go like, I can't believe that Dana White being on film smacking a woman

561
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,320
 did nothing to him, nothing.

562
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,280
 He didn't apologize, he didn't have to apologize, and it didn't stop him from being invited

563
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:15,640
 to speak at the Republican National Convention, to speak at like these higher, he gets these

564
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:21,160
 high paid speaking engagements, like it stopped, it thwarted him in no way from accomplishing

565
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,160
 everything he wanted to do.

566
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,760
 It's because his name is Dana and when your name is Dana, people feel like they can't

567
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,880
 pick on you about other things like beating women because you've already had too difficult

568
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,000
 of a life being named Dana, and so they just don't want to make it any more difficult for

569
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,220
 poor Dana.

570
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,640
 It's so strange to me, but yeah, that's it, is that like we cared about Jamal Khashoggi

571
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,680
 for like six months.

572
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,680
 Yeah.

573
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,680
 And then we're like, "Ugh."

574
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,680
 Like the same thing ended Ray Rice's career.

575
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,680
 Right.

576
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

577
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:59,000
 All pro football player did exactly the same thing that Dana White did, and it ended his

578
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 career.

579
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Yeah.

580
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 As it should, by the way.

581
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,280
 If you're saying this as something that should be an outlier, that's how that should work.

582
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,280
 Yeah.

583
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,280
 No way.

584
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,480
 You act like you still didn't draft Ray Rice on your fantasy football team in case he came

585
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,480
 back.

586
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,480
 Come on.

587
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,480
 Drafted him this year, motherfucker.

588
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,480
 This year.

589
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:25,400
 Don't call it a comeback, he's been here for years.

590
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,320
 But yeah, no, the fight was supposedly a great fight, I haven't watched it, but it apparently

591
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,320
 was very good.

592
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,320
 Yeah.

593
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,320
 It's really good, it's really fun.

594
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:38,640
 And watching the Crown Prince of Saudi, watching him get booed, and he got booed while he was

595
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,560
 standing in the middle of the ring, they had invited him into the ring, so the camera is

596
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:48,200
 just on him, and he's got this deadpan expression trying to ignore 70,000 people booing him

597
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,200
 really loudly.

598
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,960
 He literally whispered to someone, it's like, "How much to pay the people to applause?

599
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
 I'll pay it.

600
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
 $1,000 a person?

601
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,960
 Yeah, yeah.

602
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,960
 Let's write the checks right now.

603
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,960
 Let's do it.

604
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,360
 Yeah, I think for the ticket price that was at that event, I think it's more than a grand

605
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,360
 a person.

606
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
 Yeah, that's true.

607
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,360
 That's true.

608
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,440
 Based on how much those people paid to be there, it's more than a grand a person.

609
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,640
 There were so many people in town.

610
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:19,240
 Now, how many people were booing because of Saudi Arabia's policy towards women and other

611
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,240
 disparaged minorities?

612
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,240
 And people that they fuck with.

613
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,240
 Yeah.

614
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:28,280
 For some people, just out of racism, just saw a brown guy in a turban and were like,

615
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,280
 "Boo!"

616
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,280
 So, what do you think?

617
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,280
 What do you think?

618
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,680
 It's not 100% to 0%.

619
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,280
 I was saying, "Boo-erns."

620
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:44,120
 I was like, "Oh, oh, was anyone else saying boo-erns?"

621
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,120
 I was saying boo-erns.

622
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,560
 Nick Newman in chat says they were saying, "Bruce," because he was Prince Bruce.

623
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,560
 Prince Bruce.

624
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,760
 Prince Bruce from Saudi Arabia.

625
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,760
 Prince Bruce.

626
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,440
 I want to hear that version of my hometown.

627
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,640
 You know, maybe the solution is, the next time they introduce him, they start playing

628
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,600
 old Ray Stevens and he had the A-Rap.

629
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,600
 That's his intro music.

630
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,600
 That's it.

631
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,600
 Not just the streak.

632
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,600
 The Sheik of the Burning Sands.

633
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,800
 Oh my God.

634
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,160
 I had to – I didn't have to, but I did.

635
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,840
 I took my wife to the airport the next morning because she had an out of town gig and neither

636
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,020
 of us really thought about it.

637
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:35,080
 She had like a 7 a.m. flight out of Vegas and so driving her to the airport, there was

638
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:41,160
 suddenly a line for miles of cars trying to get to the airport the morning after that

639
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,160
 fight.

640
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,160
 Oh, jeez.

641
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,160
 That early, too?

642
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,160
 We pulled it.

643
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,160
 Yeah.

644
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,080
 And both of us were like, "Oh, oh shit.

645
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,080
 This is a thing."

646
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,840
 Did you do the old Mattingly Donnelly flip around?

647
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,160
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

648
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:59,520
 No, we did all the back things and we were in the truck so I could get off the road a

649
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,360
 little bit, the dirt patch and everything.

650
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,680
 Yeah, we did the whole thing.

651
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,760
 But yeah, go ahead and pick her up the next day.

652
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,760
 It was just as bad.

653
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,560
 And I was trying to get to the pickup area.

654
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,720
 I'm on the phone with her and now I'm stuck.

655
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,240
 Even now, I can't do any kind of flippy or go anywhere else because I'm stuck on the

656
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,040
 road.

657
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:23,120
 But I'm texting with her and she's like, "The passenger pickup area is empty.

658
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,680
 I don't know what you're talking about."

659
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:31,720
 And it was all people going to like long-term parking in the valets and all of the wealthy.

660
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,920
 People getting out of town.

661
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,920
 Muck to mucks.

662
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,920
 Yeah.

663
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,920
 Just getting out of town.

664
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
 Yeah.

665
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,920
 Yeah, yeah.

666
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,920
 That happened the same.

667
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,920
 Yeah, went to pick me up and I was like, "Passenger picker, there's no one here."

668
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,920
 She's like, "I cannot get in there."

669
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,920
 And I was like, "Weird."

670
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,920
 Yeah.

671
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,080
 And it was just, I was coming in on a day where most of them were leaving town.

672
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:53,880
 So all the locals were clogging up the affordable rates of overnight parking at the Vegas airport.

673
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,880
 That's right.

674
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,800
 The very affordable rates.

675
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:02,240
 The bad thing is there's one road that leads to passenger pickup in the A terminal, the

676
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,240
 main terminal.

677
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,400
 There's one road that leads to passenger pickup, but that road also leads to long-term parking

678
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,840
 and economy parking and valet.

679
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,600
 And then there's one fork off that goes to the departing flights.

680
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
 Yeah.

681
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,600
 I mean, that thing was designed for when we-

682
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
 When you got all those things going.

683
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,800
 We were still calling Vegas Hotels carpet joints.

684
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,800
 Do you know what I mean?

685
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,280
 Like that's how long ago that place was designed and it's not-

686
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,280
 Yeah.

687
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,280
 I will never-

688
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,280
 Modern traffic.

689
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,280
 I will never understand.

690
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:36,480
 I mean, I understand it, but man, they should have put that modern rail to the damn airport.

691
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,720
 And now it's Elon Musk is taking on the cab union.

692
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,720
 Of course.

693
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
 Yeah.

694
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,760
 He's trying to get the boring company to make it to the airport.

695
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,200
 Well, are there like two people left in the cab union now?

696
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,200
 That's it.

697
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,200
 But they are mad.

698
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,200
 Well, I mean-

699
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,280
 Those two people are really pissed.

700
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,380
 Maybe the power has shifted.

701
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:57,120
 Maybe they are coming back because I know there's been a lot of backlash with Uber and Lyft

702
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,120
 too.

703
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,120
 Nah.

704
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,120
 So I don't know.

705
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,120
 We're not going back.

706
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,120
 That's not how things work.

707
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,120
 chaotic is right.

708
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,120
 You got to play Vegas parking weather.

709
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,120
 We're crushing it right now.

710
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,120
 Oh, that's true.

711
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,120
 Vegas parking and weather.

712
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,120
 No one does it better than ICS.

713
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,120
 Oh, speaking of weather-

714
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,120
 You know who else knows everything about Vegas parking and weather?

715
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,120
 Hold on.

716
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,120
 We're going to come back to that.

717
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
 And that is the following sponsor.

718
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,120
 Today's show is brought to you by- Nope.

719
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,120
 That's me looking up the laundry.

720
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:20,600
 Today's show is brought to you by Henry's Hobo Cafe from Dead Laszlo in 2024.

721
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:37,200
 That's Henry's Hobo Cafe.

722
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:51,240
 Yeah, alright, uh huh, all night.

723
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,680
 My name is Henry.

724
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,560
 I'm a hobo.

725
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,040
 I got hungry sitting on the street.

726
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:05,040
 I said, Henry, time to grab some gumbo and find a place to eat.

727
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:11,960
 So I grabbed my gumbo and my bendle and I went on down the road to find a spot.

728
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:18,560
 I happened upon this old abandoned hotel full of ghosts and a cooking pot.

729
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,880
 So I asked the ghosts, you want to work for me?

730
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,880
 My name's Henry.

731
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,320
 They said, we'll work for free.

732
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,380
 So now you can come into my house.

733
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,720
 That's not really a house.

734
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,400
 It's a place on the middle of the street.

735
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,920
 It's full of ghosts and me.

736
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,700
 You can get some old cooked meat.

737
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:39,480
 Come on down to Henry's Haunted House Hobo Havel.

738
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,480
 That's right.

739
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,000
 It's full of ghosts and also garlic toast.

740
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 Come on down.

741
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,800
 Get your fill.

742
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,400
 Henry's got ghosts that will kill.

743
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,400
 That's right.

744
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,440
 I didn't mention, but they're deadly.

745
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,940
 These poltergeists will eat your soul.

746
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:59,640
 They also make you into food and you are what becomes in the bowl.

747
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,760
 You're what we serve for lunch and dinner.

748
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,020
 If you come to eat, you get eaten.

749
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,000
 Do you understand what I'm saying?

750
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,920
 Anybody who comes to my place is killed and eaten.

751
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,920
 That's what happens.

752
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,920
 I'm a cannibal.

753
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,920
 I'm Henry the Cannibal.

754
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,920
 Henry the Cannibal.

755
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,920
 Henry the Cannibal.

756
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,840
 Come on down and get eaten up by me and the ghosts.

757
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,840
 One of the ghosts is little girl.

758
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,840
 Do you think she'd be fine?

759
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,840
 But she's not.

760
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,840
 She's mean.

761
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,840
 She's meaner than anybody.

762
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,840
 Oh no.

763
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,840
 I hope it's not the girl.

764
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,640
 I'm just here for lunch.

765
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,800
 Can I get seated for lunch please?

766
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,800
 Come on in.

767
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,800
 I'll be happy to seat you.

768
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,800
 Oh no.

769
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,800
 Now it's a little girl ghost and she's murdering me.

770
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,800
 Oh, she's eating me.

771
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,800
 She's starting to get my feet and eating her way up.

772
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,800
 Oh no.

773
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,800
 Oh man.

774
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,800
 Enter Hayscoops to check out.

775
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,800
 There you go.

776
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,800
 What were you saying, Paul?

777
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
 Oh, I was saying, speaking of weather.

778
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,800
 Uh-huh.

779
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,800
 Speaking of the biggest weather.

780
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:58,800
 How's our outlook looking as we approach Scoop Hatchery?

781
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,800
 Oh, I think we look great.

782
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,800
 I think we're looking really great.

783
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,800
 Yeah.

784
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,800
 Here.

785
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,640
 I'll pull up the actual Vegas parking and weather.

786
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,640
 Let's do it.

787
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,640
 Yeah.

788
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,640
 We're in the middle of it.

789
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,640
 So yeah.

790
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,640
 Actual Vegas parking and weather.

791
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,640
 Uh, yeah.

792
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:18,240
 No, it looks like we are, oh, mid to low nineties, mid to upper eighties.

793
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,640
 That's great weather out here.

794
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,640
 That's gold out here.

795
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,640
 Yeah.

796
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,640
 No, we're going to be perfect.

797
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,640
 Sunny.

798
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,640
 Sunny the whole time.

799
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,640
 It's going to be so nice.

800
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,640
 Very, very nice.

801
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,640
 It's not too late, by the way.

 It is going to be a blast.

810
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:48,280
 I was talking to, uh, a performer last night that is going to be performing at part of

811
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,640
 Scoop Fest and they were super excited about it.

812
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,520
 It is going to be so cool.

813
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,520

814
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,520
 Uh, head over there.

 Come see us.

817
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,040
 It's only going to take a week and a half.

818
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,360
 I don't know.

819
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,360
 It's soon.

820
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,760
 It's soon enough that, uh, I am no longer getting anxious when someone mentions Scoop

821
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,560
 Fest to me because I am already in that anxious cloud.

822
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,560
 There you go.

823
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,560
 We're in it.

824
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,560
 We're dialed in.

825
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,560
 Yeah.

826
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,560
 Yeah.

827
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,560
 I just live in it now.

828
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,560
 Yes.

829
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,560
 Same.

830
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,560
 Um, yeah.

831
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,560
 Yeah.

832
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,560
 It's going to be fun.

833
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,560
 We have some surprises on top of the surprises.

834
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,560
 It's going to be great.

835
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,560
 It is.

836
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,560
 It's going to be so fun.

837
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,560
 Jacob, hold my calls.

838
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,560
 I'm doing a podcast.

839
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,560
 Sorry.

840
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,560
 I'm busy right now.

841
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,560
 He's doing a podcast.

842
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,560
 Professionals, everybody.

843
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,560
 Pro aficionados.

844
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:38,480
 We were laughing the other morning, the whole family were having breakfast and, uh, my wife

845
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,160
 told a story about her dad doing the pull my finger gag.

846
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,160
 Yeah.

847
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,160
 Oh yeah.

848
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:57,440
 She said she pulled his finger, he farted, and she was shocked and upset as a nine-year-old

849
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,520
 girl was just furious.

850
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,520
 Like, why?

851
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,520
 Absolutely not.

852
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,520
 That is not appropriate.

853
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,520
 You monster.

854
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:14,320
 We were laughing cause I said, you know, it's funny now that we're older, you know that

855
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,240
 later on he was like having a beer with a buddy going like, man, daughters are different

856
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,480
 than sons, man.

857
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,480
 Yeah.

858
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,520
 Daughters just don't.

859
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,760
 Not the same thing.

860
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,200
 Like she was not, she didn't think it was funny.

861
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,200
 No.

862
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,200
 Yeah.

863
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,360
 Well, did she think she caused it?

864
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,360
 I think so.

865
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,360
 I think she didn't want that responsibility.

866
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,360
 Yeah.

867
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,400
 I think she was like, I don't want to have this power.

868
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,400
 Yeah.

869
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:43,640
 And, uh, I mean that also, I think, uh, for girls, again, I can't speak with any kind

870
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:50,600
 of authority or experience, but I, you know, girls have a whole different road to go down

871
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,960
 when it comes to discovering bodily functions.

872
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,040
 Yeah.

873
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:00,400
 And if you suddenly throw into the mix that the pulling of a finger can cause a fart can

874
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,400
 trigger.

875
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,400
 Yeah.

876
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,400
 It's like one more thing.

877
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:09,620
 It's like, what the fuck is this flesh cage that I am trapped in?

878
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:13,880
 What kind of disaster area have I been born unto?

879
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,680
 How many booby traps are in this thing?

880
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,180
 You think this child was upset because she had learned something about the human anatomy

881
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,520
 that she didn't know previously.

882
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,520
 Right.

883
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,520
 This is just too much.

884
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:30,820
 This is one more fucking thing, one more fucking thing that can go wrong with human bodies.

885
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:36,920
 This is just, add it to the list of the terrible shit that goes on with these meat puppets.

886
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:43,000
 Chaotic and clumsy.

887
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 Chaotic and clumsy.

888
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,480
 What the fuck is the flesh cage I'm trapped in is when I yell every time I'm in a store

889
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,480
 changing room.

890
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:56,120
 No, that's not even what we were talking about, the reputation of women and wives watching

891
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,600
 true crime and true crime podcasts and true crime documentaries.

892
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,600
 Right.

893
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,760
 And I was like, let's just straight up staying coached up on their most likely natural predator.

894
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,760
 This is all it is.

895
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,760
 Yeah.

896
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,560
 This is all just, it's just absolutely just staying on top of, it's like why men watch

897
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,960
 Shark Week, the same exact reason, we're just staying coached up on our predators.

898
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,800
 That's all.

899
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:27,320
 That's why we watch Shark Week.

900
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,120
 That's all we got.

901
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:34,160
 When I get in the water, when I put one toe in the water, I am no longer at the top of

902
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,160
 the food chain.

903
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:44,000
 I need to, I need to educate myself to watch Shark Week.

904
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 Or in the case of that little girl, Shark Week.

905
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 Yeah.

906
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 Shark Week.

907
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 Shark Week.

908
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,280
 But I was like really, like really meditating on this pull my finger gag.

909
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,640
 I was like, wait, someone did it first, right?

910
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,640
 Right.

911
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,920
 Like someone was like, oh, I got to fart.

912
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,960
 I can't come up with a noise.

913
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,880
 Let me just, let me, if I come up with a joke, I can fart in public, no problem.

914
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,800
 This is, it's a, it's a, it's a little known fact.

915
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,360
 It is the second most famous thing that the Earl of Sandwich did.

916
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,880
 He invented the sandwich and he invented this bit.

917
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,880
 But that's it, right?

918
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,880
 How old is the gag?

919
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,880
 Right.

920
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,920
 Because that guy could be very old.

921
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:36,920
 I just saw a crazy TikTok with this lady talking about, she came home and her husband said

922
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:42,800
 he had a surprise for her and the afternoon before she had eaten a bunch of beans at a

923
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,800
 taco joint.

924
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,800
 Oh no.

925
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,800
 And she knew she shouldn't.

926
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,120
 This is the kind of humor that my wife does not enjoy.

927
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,600
 She knew she shouldn't, but she did it.

928
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,640
 She ate a bunch of beans.

929
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:58,480
 And he blindfolds her and sits her in a chair in their, in their dining room.

930
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,960
 And she's sitting there and the husband says, oh, I, I'll be right back.

931
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,120
 I forgot something and she can hear him leave and she's like, oh, I gotta let one go.

932
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:16,320
 So she lets out a toot and then, and she's like, oh boy, that's a, that's a, that's a

933
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,560
 real winner there.

934
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,440
 That's a woof.

935
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,840
 And then she does another one and she still doesn't hear him come back yet.

936
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:27,520
 And then she has like three or four and she's like, oh geez.

937
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:34,560
 So she keeps the blindfold on, stands up and gets like a pillow from her chair and starts

938
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:41,780
 woofing it around to try and dispel the stink, you know, and then sits back down.

939
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:45,680
 And then finally her husband comes back in, she's still worried that he's going to smell

940
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,680
 it or whatever.

941
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:53,160
 He takes a blindfold off and it's her whole family there for a surprise birthday party.

942
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,160
 Yep.

943
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:05,000
 What is this unsliced cheese doing here?

944
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 Oh my Lord.

945
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 Can you imagine?

946
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,520
 Can you imagine?

947
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:16,000
 Oh, according to this, the first time the pull my finger gag happened on film was in

948
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 1959.

949
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 Oh, right.

950
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:25,840
 But I'm saying we're going to get some like, you know, half ape, half man out of ice one

951
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,840
 day, revive him.

952
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,200
 Someone's going to do the pull my finger gag in front of him while they're studying him

953
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,200
 in a cage or something.

954
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,760
 And he's going to be like, you guys are still doing that gag?

955
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,760
 Yeah.

956
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,760
 Is that gag still alive?

957
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,440
 And we'll be like, yes, unfrozen Brendan Fraser, it is still alive.

958
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,240
 No, like we, we, we as comedians, we don't, you know, we say like, oh, we do is silly.

959
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,240
 It doesn't matter.

960
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,240
 We don't change the world or anything.

961
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,640
 We just make the, make the day a little easier for everybody.

962
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,640
 Right.

963
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,200
 That guy changed the fucking world.

964
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,080
 That guy created a fart joke.

965
00:40:55,080 --> 00:41:02,160
 For better or worse, just as, as just the world is a different place from the one that he

966
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,160
 found.

967
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,160
 It's the truth.

968
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,160
 Yeah.

969
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,160
 He left it better than he found it.

970
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,160
 Yeah.

971
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,160
 And Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

972
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,160
 Yeah.

973
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,200
 I put the right neck and neck.

974
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,480
 Totally the same.

975
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:27,240
 So I've been watching, I've been watching a lot of a weird reality TV lately, especially

976
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,080
 bad reality competition shows.

977
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:34,880
 This has become my late night watch while I'm, you know, sending emails and half paying

978
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,260
 attention to it.

979
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,480
 But it is, it is fantastic.

980
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,480
 Okay.

981
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:44,020
 I've been watching one, I finished watching it now on Netflix called Outlast, which is

982
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:50,080
 they just take a bunch of people and drop them in the Alaskan wilderness and they have

983
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:55,760
 to form teams and they, and they survive out in the Alaskan wilderness until the other

984
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,080
 teams give up.

985
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,520
 And so it's an open-ended game.

986
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,920
 It lasts as long as it lasts until enough people give up.

987
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,120
 And then there's a group that wins.

988
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:15,040
 There is one dude who was on this show though, that all I could think of the entire time

989
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:23,400
 watching him was if Paul Mattingly were really good at outdoor survival, this would be him.

990
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,400
 That's a big capital I, capital F pal.

991
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,400
 It sure is.

992
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,400
 It sure is.

993
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,040
 It's a whole big old if, but I'm telling you, if Paul Mattingly had made a couple of different

994
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:39,080
 decisions in his life and we're now just an outdoor survivalist guy, this would be him.

995
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,400
 And I'm going to tell you why.

996
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,480
 So to win the game, one of the rules, one of the only rules is to win the game.

997
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,160
 You have to be on a team.

998
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:53,080
 So a team has to accept you in to be, to be even for it to even be possible for you to

999
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,080
 win this game.

1000
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,360
 Got it.

1001
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,360
 So at one point he is changing teams.

1002
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,740
 He all of his team is gone.

1003
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:05,200
 He's the last person remaining on his team and he's going to change teams.

1004
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:11,080
 And he knows that one of the other teams is going to come along and loot his camp that

1005
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,640
 he and his team had built up for themselves.

1006
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,960
 They're going to come loot his camp and get his resources and everything after he leaves

1007
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,240
 taking what he can to the, to the new camp.

1008
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:28,900
 And so this motherfucker in, I believe what would be the ultimate Paul move burns his

1009
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:33,240
 house down so that the other people can't come in and get it.

1010
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,560
 Now hold on, you think that's what I would do?

1011
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:42,000
 I think if you had made the turns in life to become this person at all, I think you

1012
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,760
 might have a little bit of this in you.

1013
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,760
 Oh, I don't know.

1014
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,880
 I think you'd be, I think you'd be like, because it's a game.

1015
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,760
 So it's all, it's all a game and it's a game that now people are taking a little too seriously

1016
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,960
 because they're in it and they've been doing it for weeks and they're starving and they're

1017
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,400
 outside and so they've, you know, part of their brain has forgotten that it's a game

1018
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,560
 and that it's not really real.

1019
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,560
 I don't know.

1020
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,400
 This guy just struck me as, I didn't dislike him either by the way.

1021
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:12,920
 Was he a, when I watched him burning his house down, what made you think of me?

1022
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:18,800
 It was, it was his mannerisms and, and just everything about him that it was, cause it

1023
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,960
 really wasn't, there wasn't an A to A line to draw between the two of you because you're

1024
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,640
 so, you're so very different.

1025
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,160
 You just think this is alternate universe me.

1026
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,800
 I think this is just alternate universe you.

1027
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:36,640
 And he was, I should say too, I should say too that I liked this person.

1028
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,640
 Okay.

1029
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,400
 So he was, he was burning his house down.

1030
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,400
 I got it.

1031
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,440
 I understood why he was doing it.

1032
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,440
 Everything about it.

1033
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,160
 I was like, this is, I like this guy, but he is on a different wavelength entirely from

1034
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,160
 where I am.

1035
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:56,200
 And I'd like to think that if I really put my mind to it, I could survive in the wilderness.

1036
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,800
 Oh, I think you could.

1037
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,880
 With a couple of tools and whatnot.

1038
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,280
 I don't think you're a useless person.

1039
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,280
 I would hate it.

1040
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,280
 Yes, you'd be so mad.

1041
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,280
 I would hate it so bad.

1042
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,280
 You'd be so mad the entire time.

1043
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,280
 That was just it.

1044
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,680
 That's why I quit Boy Scouts after getting Life Scout.

1045
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:14,040
 I was like, I can't in good conscience even go through with this Eagle Scout shit cause

1046
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,320
 I despise the out of doors.

1047
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,720
 I can't in good conscience.

1048
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,720
 Not really.

1049
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:24,480
 As a kid I was just like, I was like, this is like, this goes against who I am as a human

1050
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,240
 to even purport to enjoy camping in the least.

1051
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,240
 I don't.

1052
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,240
 I hate it.

1053
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,800
 I hate everything about it.

1054
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,480
 So I want you to watch this show, Paul.

1055
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,480
 It's outlast.

1056
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:39,600
 Oh, I'm sure I'd have a great time.

1057
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,840
 Paul is a clamper.

1058
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,680
 Temperature controlled covered wagon.

1059
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:52,040
 I don't think I've been camping in 30 years.

1060
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,440
 Yeah.

1061
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,440
 I could say.

1062
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,040
 Is it 30 years ago you drowned that kid in the lake?

1063
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,040
 Was it that long ago?

1064
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,040
 Holy shit.

1065
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,240
 I didn't consider that a camping trip.

1066
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,760
 I didn't consider that a camping trip.

1067
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,760
 Okay.

1068
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,760
 That was just an afternoon.

1069
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,760
 That's true.

1070
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,760
 Yeah.

1071
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,760
 It was just an afternoon.

1072
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,760
 Yeah.

1073
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,760
 It's true.

1074
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,760
 You didn't sleep outdoors then.

1075
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,760
 You just were outdoors.

1076
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,760
 I was just working.

1077
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,760
 Yeah.

1078
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,760
 That's true.

1079
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,760
 That's true.

1080
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,760
 Yeah.

1081
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,960
 My wife asked me to take out the trash, so here I go.

1082
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,480
 That's a good Saudi money, man.

1083
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,480
 You can't pass up that Saudi money.

1084
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,840
 I didn't realize she hated that neighbor kid so much.

1085
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,360
 Saudi Prince was like, "Drown that kid."

1086
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,360
 You got it, Paul.

1087
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,360
 I was like, "No way."

1088
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,120
 He's like, "Here's a dump truck full of cash."

1089
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,120
 I'm like, "Okay."

1090
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,000
 Do I get to keep the dump truck?

1091
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 Yes.

1092
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 I'm in.

1093
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,840
 It's a tax write-off.

1094
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,000
 You had me a dump truck.

1095
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,200
 I don't know.

1096
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,280
 I don't like camp.

1097
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,000
 I don't like anything about camping.

1098
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,880
 Well, when we got home, we borrowed sleeping bags from my neighbor, Gary, who loves to

1099
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,880
 camp.

1100
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,640
 He takes his own tent and sleeping bag on a motorcycle and just goes out in any direction

1101
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,800
 and just finds places to camp.

1102
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,800
 He loves it.

1103
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,160
 I've got a sleeping bag you guys can borrow.

1104
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,040
 I've got a big double, like a two-person sleeping bag if you guys ever need it.

1105
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,040
 We did.

1106
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,040
 We should have gotten it.

1107
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,040
 Yeah.

1108
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,040
 It's zero degree, too.

1109
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,040
 It's fucking hot.

1110
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,040
 Okay.

1111
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,040
 Yeah.

1112
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,040
 Perfect.

1113
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:19,920
 I'm really surprised Paul hates camping.

1114
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,920
 Leon Kassab.

1115
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,680
 Leon, he's talking to that.

1116
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:26,800
 It's the only time I've ever been able to read sarcasm in the chat.

1117
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,800
 No problem.

1118
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,800
 Yeah.

1119
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,800
 Yep.

1120
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,960
 Now, do you know what I do like?

1121
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:33,960
 What's that?

1122
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:40,360
 The idea of having a sleepover in the house.

1123
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:47,320
 I like the idea of people setting up sleeping bags on a nice cushioned floor, watching TV

1124
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,760
 until you fall asleep, playing video games until the wee hours.

1125
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,760
 I like that.

1126
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,760
 Speaking of camping, I was just talking to somebody the other day about Airbnbs and they

1127
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,920
 were saying that they had had some bad luck with Airbnbs and I said, "Yo, Matt and Paul

1128
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,240
 and I had bad luck with an Airbnb one time.

1129
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,240
 I think it was in Jersey."

1130
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,240
 Yes.

1131
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,000
 And it had been listed as like a three-bedroom.

1132
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,040
 Yes.

1133
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:15,960
 And we got there and one of the bedrooms was just a child's room with a pair of like Ninja

1134
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,000
 Turtle bunk beds or something.

1135
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 Yes.

1136
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,220
 Now, that was Austin.

1137
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,120
 We would have been so aggravated.

1138
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,120
 Was that Austin?

1139
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,120
 Oh, there you go.

1140
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,120
 Yeah, because Brushwood came back.

1141
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,260
 We would have been so aggravated if it wasn't for the fact that Paul was there and was more

1142
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,560
 than happy to sleep in the children's bunk beds.

1143
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,560
 Oh, yes.

1144
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,760
 The Turtle bunk beds were in Austin.

1145
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,540
 We did have bad luck with Airbnbs in Jersey.

1146
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:37,840
 We had a weird Airbnbs in Jersey.

1147
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:38,840
 I think I'm conflating you.

1148
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,240
 We were on the third floor of a house and the people were definitely living in the house

1149
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,240
 below.

1150
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,240
 We were trying to leave.

1151
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,520
 Oh, that was just the three of us.

1152
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,520
 Yeah.

1153
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,560
 We were in and out of that place in like seven hours.

1154
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,560
 Yes.

1155
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,560
 Yeah.

1156
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,280
 We used that place to barely sleep and take a shower.

1157
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:59,120
 That's because we took an overnight red-eye flight home on Spirit Airlines on their deck

1158
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:02,280
 chair that they got in first class.

1159
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,280
 Yeah.

1160
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,280
 Yeah.

1161
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,280
 Oh, yeah.

1162
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:12,040
 We were trying to leave to go to Tierney's and it was like they had like a birthday dinner

1163
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,040
 or something, like one of their kids or something.

1164
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,040
 Yes.

1165
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,040
 We couldn't leave.

1166
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,960
 We felt like we were going to their backyard.

1167
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:20,960
 We had to leave.

1168
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,680
 We had to walk through their children's birthday party to get to our car.

1169
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,160
 We had to walk through the party.

1170
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,160
 It was terrible.

1171
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,160
 No good.

1172
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,160
 No good.

1173
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,160
 Oh, so funny.

1174
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:35,560
 Oh, we returned our sleeping bags to Gary, he goes, "You like it?"

1175
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,560
 And they both go, "Yeah.

1176
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,560
 Yeah.

1177
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,560
 We love it.

1178
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,560
 It was our first time camping."

1179
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,560
 And I was like, "Oh.

1180
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,560
 Oh.

1181
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,560
 Bad dad alert.

1182
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,560
 Bad dad alert."

1183
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:50,320
 It did not occur to me that that was the first time camping at all.

1184
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:54,800
 And that the first time camping was this really nice Sandy Valley Ranch glamping.

1185
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,480
 I was going to say you have ruined your kids now.

1186
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,840
 That's not bad dad alert.

1187
00:49:58,840 --> 00:49:59,840
 What are they?

1188
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,840
 Eleven and ten?

1189
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:01,840
 Eleven and nine?

1190
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,840
 What?

1191
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:03,840
 They're twenty-four.

1192
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:04,840
 No.

1193
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:05,840
 No.

1194
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,240
 You take kids much younger camping.

1195
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,480
 You risk a hawk stealing them.

1196
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,480
 It's not, you know, this is not-

1197
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,480
 That is true.

1198
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,480
 Yeah.

1199
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,480
 That is true.

1200
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,480
 Good dad alert.

1201
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,480
 Good dad alert if you ask me.

1202
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,480
 Exactly.

1203
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,480
 Snakes could eat them.

1204
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,480
 Hawks could snatch them.

1205
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,040
 How many of your children got stolen by hawks, Matt?

1206
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,400
 That's zero.

1207
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,400
 Good dad alert.

1208
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:32,120
 I mean, seriously, you watched some of these, what was it, the missing 411 stuff?

1209
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,760
 All the people that go missing in the woods?

1210
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,760
 That's scary.

1211
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:35,760
 Yeah.

1212
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,760
 All those hawks.

1213
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:37,760
 Paul's drawing from experience.

1214
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,160
 He went to drown that kid and a hawk took him away and Paul was like, "Fair dinkum.

1215
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,160
 Fair dinkum."

1216
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,160
 Well, he pulled the-

1217
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,160
 And dinkum.

1218
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,520
 The kid grabbed him out of the water thinking he was a fish, I guess.

1219
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,280
 And the kid wasn't drowned.

1220
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,520
 So I was like, "Ah."

1221
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:56,000
 So I had to train on the hawk until it got high enough that I was like, "All right.

1222
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,520
 This fall is going to be fatal."

1223
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:04,200
 So then I shot the hawk, he dropped the kid, bam, done and done, done and done.

1224
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:08,920
 You know, that was the original ending for Lord of the Rings.

1225
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:09,920
 Almost exactly.

1226
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,720
 It was Gandalf up on the eagle, bang.

1227
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:14,720
 One shot.

1228
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,080
 There's stories like that that make me think you could run UFC, Paul.

1229
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,080
 No problem.

1230
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,080
 Oh boy.

1231
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,680
 Oh boy.

1232
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,680
 Oh boy.

1233
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,680
 Oh boy.

1234
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:28,640
 Well, I guess you get that government contract, do the big fight on the West Lawn.

1235
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,640
 Oh, right.

1236
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:30,640
 What the fuck?

1237
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,640
 What are you talking about?

1238
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,640
 That is actually happening.

1239
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,640
 That is going to be ... That's the thing that's so fucking crazy.

1240
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:38,640
 That's a big part of why I'm-

1241
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,640
 Yeah, that's it.

1242
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:40,640
 Well-

1243
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,800
 That's the one thing.

1244
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,760
 I can't really watch wrestling anymore.

1245
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,400
 I've stopped listening to my wrestling podcasts.

1246
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,000
 I don't really watch live.

1247
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,160
 I watch Botchamania and that's about it.

1248
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,720
 But it's just, you know, it's too crazy.

1249
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,440
 It's the same ... It's the government.

1250
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,440
 That's our government now.

1251
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,440
 It's the government.

1252
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,440
 It's WWE.

1253
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,440
 Yeah.

1254
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,440
 It's fucked up.

1255
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,440
 It's fucked up.

1256
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,440
 That's them.

1257
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,440
 Yeah.

1258
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:15,560
 Well, on our way out, we knew one of the women who lived in that area, she came by to visit

1259
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:20,120
 on a golf cart and the kids took turns driving the golf cart.

1260
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,120
 Oh, fun.

1261
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,120
 Now, that's fun.

1262
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,120
 Good.

1263
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:27,920
 And I was like ... I turned to Sarah and I was like, "This is all they're going to remember.

1264
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,920
 This is all they're going to remember."

1265
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:29,920
 Yeah, yeah.

1266
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,360
 They're going to be like, "I love camping because we drove a golf cart around."

1267
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:39,120
 In a couple of years, your youngest son in the middle of a conversation is going to mention

1268
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:43,800
 that he's a really good driver and you're going to be really confused why he's talking

1269
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,160
 about that and then he's going to mention the golf cart and you'd be like, "Motherfucker,

1270
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,520
 you're talking about that goddamn golf cart."

1271
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,520
 Yeah.

1272
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,520
 We got to feed.

1273
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,520
 They were feeding the horses.

1274
00:52:52,520 --> 00:53:03,760
 We fed donkeys, goats, chickens, pigs, and there are these horses that look like cows.

1275
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,720
 They're fat horses?

1276
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,000
 Are they ponies?

1277
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,640
 Like it's a cow patterned skin, you know, a cow patterned hair bone.

1278
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:12,640
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

1279
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,640
 It's like a mottled, a mottled-

1280
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,640
 Palomino.

1281
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,640
 Palomino?

1282
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,640
 No, no.

1283
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,640
 Is that what it's called?

1284
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,640
 That's the club, Paul.

1285
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,640
 They're called-

1286
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,920
 That's the club that you love going to, Paul.

1287
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:23,920
 You're confused again.

1288
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,920
 It's called a palomino, right?

1289
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,920
 Isn't it a palomino?

1290
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:27,920
 No, I believe so.

1291
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:28,920
 Newman says, I don't know.

1292
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:29,920
 He says, "I quit."

1293
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:30,920
 It's not a palomino?

1294
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:35,880
 I was going to say, we're getting palomino and of course, anti-cheat guest horses, which

1295
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,920
 is also a great name for them as well.

1296
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,360
 Is it a calico?

1297
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,360
 It's a calico horse.

1298
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,360
 Calico horse?

1299
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:47,760
 Palomino is a horse breed characterized by a pale, creamed, golden coat or a white and

1300
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,960
 silver mane and tail, so that's not it.

1301
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:50,960
 It's not a palomino?

1302
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:51,960
 No, no.

1303
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,840
 Nick Newman's saying we host a horse podcast together.

1304
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:55,840
 It's true.

1305
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,400
 Yeah, but I don't know from a fucking palomino.

1306
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,920
 That don't mean we got any horse since.

1307
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:01,920
 Okay, I don't think-

1308
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,920
 El Camino.

1309
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,920
 It's an El Camino.

1310
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,920
 I just saw a cow for the first time in my life.

1311
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:07,920
 It's an El Camino.

1312
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,200
 There's an El Camino because of big cow-sized horses.

1313
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,200
 Yeah.

1314
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,200
 Newman, unmute yourself.

1315
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,200
 There's one.

1316
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,080
 There's a swayback El Camino right there.

1317
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,080
 Yes.

1318
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,080
 There you go.

1319
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:22,760
 Is Newman, if this is what you can, unmute yourself or no?

1320
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,760
 Who can say?

1321
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,760
 I can unmute myself.

1322
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,760
 Hi, guys.

1323
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:26,760
 I'm not mad.

1324
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:27,760
 I'm just disappointed.

1325
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,760
 Newman, tell us about these cow-looking palominos.

1326
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,760
 The front is like a horse.

1327
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,760
 Those are beautiful.

1328
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,760
 The back is like a truck.

1329
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,760
 The front is like a horse.

1330
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:33,760
 The front is like a horse.

1331
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:41,120
 The back is like a truck.

1332
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,120
 The front is like a horse.

1333
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,120
 The back is like a truck.

1334
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,120
 The front is where you ride.

1335
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:47,040
 The back is where you fuck.

1336
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,680
 Is the picture in the chat what you saw?

1337
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,680
 Similar.

1338
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:58,480
 It was maybe more brown and black skin-based, and it was more of a ... It wasn't a race

1339
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,040
 horse, but it looked more athletic-looking than that.

1340
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:06,280
 Oh, a horse with spots is most commonly called an Appaloosa.

1341
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:10,600
 You either saw an Appaloosa or you saw a good old-fashioned American paint.

1342
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,600
 Oh, yeah.

1343
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,600
 American paint.

1344
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:16,080
 And that's not because they actually paint it.

1345
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,080
 It's because that's what they call it.

1346
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,080
 No.

1347
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:21,080
 That's a Sherwood Williams, they call it.

1348
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:25,240
 That is an American ... Probably what you saw was an American paint.

1349
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,240
 Okay.

1350
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,560
 That is ... Okay, because what I didn't get into is that I met a guy who'd been working

1351
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:35,240
 around the ranch for 27 years who called himself Bones, and-

1352
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,240
 Yeah.

1353
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,240
 Okay.

1354
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,800
 Oh, I need to know everything about Bones.

1355
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,680
 Everybody shut up.

1356
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:44,160
 This is the rest of the show.

1357
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,160
 We're going to talk about Bones.

1358
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,120
 I need to know about this man.

1359
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,720
 And he was like ... So I said, "Oh, we've got to head back to Vegas."

1360
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,020
 He goes, "Sorry to hear that.

1361
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:53,120
 I got out of that city 27 years ago and never went back.

1362
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:57,920
 I came out here to help my friend move and never left."

1363
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,840
 Oh my God, my spirit animal is gunning Bones.

1364
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:07,440
 Well, she was an American paint, had a face like Sarah Jessica Parker.

1365
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,480
 Oh, jeez.

1366
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,920
 Harry on bread chop.

1367
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,160
 He was joking around with me so much.

1368
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,640
 You know when someone has so many bits in their head?

1369
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,960
 And then I laughed at one of his bits so that it was something that he was rapid fire, but

1370
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:22,960
 it wasn't-

1371
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:23,960
 Now it's on.

1372
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:24,960
 Yeah.

1373
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:29,560
 And in a hurricane of information, he'd used the word paint.

1374
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:32,240
 And I literally was like, "Are you saying paint like paint?"

1375
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,120
 And he was joking like, "Yeah, we paint them or whatever."

1376
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,400
 And he was like, "Hey."

1377
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,560
 And I couldn't get to pass his crazy-

1378
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,520
 You were like, "No, no, I needed the real answer."

1379
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,120
 I couldn't get him to stop doing bits.

1380
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:48,560
 And so when he said paint, I was like, "I think he's fucking with me and I don't know

1381
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:49,560
 what he's saying.

1382
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,240
 And I can't believe ... I now can't believe any information he's telling me about this

1383
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,240
 horse."

1384
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,240
 But he was saying what it's called.

1385
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,240
 It's called an American paint.

1386
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,240
 That's what it was-

1387
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,240
 Ah!

1388
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:01,880
 And here's where it gets more confusing.

1389
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:07,840
 Different breeds can also be classified as paint horses by the American Paint Horse Association

1390
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,360
 based on their coloring.

1391
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,360
 Okay.

1392
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,160
 So it doesn't have to be the caliphate.

1393
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,160
 Yeah.

1394
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,800
 So we had a thoroughbred named Marketry.

1395
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,280
 Okay.

1396
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:26,080
 And Marketry's coloring on his leg went above the knee, which is part of their requirements

1397
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:32,020
 that the judges for this paint horse thing have.

1398
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:37,840
 So he actually was dual certified as a thoroughbred and a paint horse.

1399
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:38,840
 Wow!

1400
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:39,840
 I know.

1401
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:46,280
 His name is Marketry and it was a bad joke because that is a French woodworking term

1402
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:50,800
 for when you use glue made from horses to do inlays.

1403
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,800
 Boo!

1404
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:52,800
 Boo that name!

1405
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:53,800
 That's fucked up!

1406
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,800
 Yeah.

1407
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,800
 Isn't that bad?

1408
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,800
 We didn't name him that.

1409
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:57,800
 I like it.

1410
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:58,800
 I like it.

1411
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,800
 It's macabre.

1412
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:05,680
 I was like my buddy who had a rabbit named Hassenfeffer.

1413
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:11,960
 I dated a girl that had a rabbit in a room in a cage.

1414
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:15,440
 And first of all, there's an odor.

1415
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,680
 It's mostly cedar chips, but there is an odor.

1416
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:30,560
 This, Nick, was this one of those things where as I've heard in apocryphal Aerosmith songs

1417
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:36,960
 that she perhaps utilized this rabbit for pregnancy tests.

1418
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:37,960
 The rabbit done died.

1419
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:38,960
 That's right.

1420
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:50,480
 Was she so promiscuous that she had several bunnies by her bedside to test whether she

1421
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,600
 was pregnant?

1422
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,280
 Is that what's happening?

1423
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:59,080
 If I made it up them stairs to that bedroom, I'm sure I wasn't blazing any trails.

1424
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:03,160
 That's what I'm saying though.

1425
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,160
 But so do you think that's what was going on?

1426
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,160
 She kept the rabbit.

1427
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,360
 Yeah, that's what was going on Paul.

1428
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,760
 That's definitely what was happening.

1429
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:16,740
 I have not read nor have I seen, and still to this day, a work called Watership Down.

1430
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:18,640
 You've never seen Watership Down?

1431
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,640
 No.

1432
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:23,920
 It's a book and an animated movie.

1433
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,080
 And it'll break you.

1434
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:30,200
 The name of the rabbit was a reference to that.

1435
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,400
 Was it a number?

1436
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,400
 It was a number.

1437
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,400
 Okay.

1438
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,400
 It was a number?

1439
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,400
 Fiverr.

1440
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,400
 This is my rabbit.

1441
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,160
 Unban scooped and the chat says fiverr.

1442
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,160
 That's fascinating.

1443
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,160
 Do you know that girl?

1444
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,160
 Siege?

1445
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,160
 I wasn't the first.

1446
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,160
 There it is.

1447
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,160
 No.

1448
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,160
 Okay.

1449
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,160
 He knows that girl too.

1450
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,160
 Yeah.

1451
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,160
 The chat knows everything.

1452
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,000
 You all got those rabbit girls.

1453
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,800
 And she was kind of shitty that I hadn't seen this.

1454
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,800
 Yeah.

1455
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,460
 She's right to be shitty on that.

1456
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:02,120
 You need to see that, and then you need to see plague dogs, and then you'll never have

1457
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,120
 to smile again.

1458
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:06,080
 I'll save a lot of time.

1459
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:10,880
 No, I just listened to that REM song everybody hurts on repeat in my car.

1460
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,680
 Seriously though, plague dogs is the same animation house that did Watership Down, and

1461
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:20,160
 it is the most devastating thing I've ever seen on film.

1462
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,400
 Plague dogs?

1463
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,400
 Plague dogs.

1464
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,400
 Yep.

1465
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,400
 Okay.

1466
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,400
 That's how much I...

1467
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,400
 Devastated!

1468
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:27,400
 Thanks for having me.

1469
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,400
 All right, buddy.

1470
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,400
 Thanks, Nick!

1471
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,400
 We appreciate your horse sense.

1472
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,400
 Well, let's do a little Scoop Mail.

1473
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,480
 Message for you, son.

1474
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,920
 We got one here from the Salt Lake Scoop.

1475
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:42,600
 Hey guys, I thought I would share something from a recent Vegas trip to let you comment

1476
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,600
 on it.

1477
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:48,340
 We went to Brad Garrett's Comedy Club recently, it's over in the MGM Grand.

1478
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:50,400
 Just a quick summary of the format of the show.

1479
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,440
 Brad comes out and tells some jokes, then he introduces the first comedian.

1480
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,640
 Then Brad comes out and tells a few more jokes, then he introduces the second comedian.

1481
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:02,120
 Brad told a few jokes indicating that he was not a big fan of Trump, he did a Trump voice

1482
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:06,600
 and did the Trump dance and said it looks like he's jacking off two guys.

1483
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:10,520
 Brad made a few other jokes at Trump's expense, he did more Trump material than I thought

1484
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,200
 someone would do at a Vegas show.

1485
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:18,800
 Yeah, Brad is a very anti-Trump fella.

1486
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:23,040
 We were at the show two days after Charlie Kirk was murdered during Brad's second set,

1487
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:26,000
 a woman across the room stood up and addressed Brad.

1488
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,960
 I thought I heard her say, "Can we have a moment for Charlie Kirk?"

1489
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:30,960
 Is this Brad Garrett?

1490
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:31,960
 Brad responded...

1491
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:32,960
 Is this Brad Garrett?

1492
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:33,960
 Yeah.

1493
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:34,960
 Okay.

1494
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:39,060
 Is Brad Garrett on stage at the Brad Garrett Comedy Club?

1495
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:41,160
 I thought I'd say, "Can we have a moment for Charlie Kirk?"

1496
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,720
 Brad responded by saying, "A moment of silence for Charlie Kirk?

1497
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,920
 You know this is a comedy show, right?"

1498
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,360
 But then he quickly followed up.

1499
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:51,160
 It is tragic, everyone should be able to say whatever they want without that happening

1500
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,300
 to them.

1501
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:58,980
 With that comment, about 70% of the crowd applauded and Brad had won the crowd back.

1502
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:02,120
 At this point, the staff began to move toward this woman.

1503
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:05,760
 Brad said to the staff, "No, no, no, she's okay, just leave her."

1504
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,600
 Indicating that he didn't want her kicked out.

1505
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:12,640
 Brad then went on with his jokes, his show was almost completely derailed by that woman

1506
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,320
 and he got the control back so quickly.

1507
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:15,320
 It was fascinating.

1508
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:19,400
 I went from cringing to applauding and back to laughing in less than a minute.

1509
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:24,120
 A few questions for you performers and Vegas insiders, was there any chance that this was

1510
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,120
 staged?

1511
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,120
 No.

1512
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,120
 No.

1513
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,120
 No, no, no.

1514
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,120
 No way.

1515
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,120
 No way.

1516
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:34,160
 You're just looking at a guy who has dealt with this shit.

1517
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:44,180
 I just saw Mark Maron talking about hecklers and crowd work in general.

1518
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:51,500
 I can't recall who he was talking with now, but he was talking about crowd work as it

1519
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:56,280
 being something that's currently hot right now.

1520
01:02:56,280 --> 01:03:03,800
 A lot of comedians are being praised because they do awesome crowd work.

1521
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:11,720
 Maron was like, "Hey, it's important to the degree that you're able to quickly address

1522
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:15,260
 a heckler and get your shit back on track."

1523
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:24,680
 I don't think making your career on crowd work is really that laudable per se.

1524
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:32,920
 I think what you saw there was a very experienced professional who was able to very quickly

1525
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:40,040
 turn it around and get it back on track and reset the mood.

1526
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,040
 That's experience, man.

1527
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,800
 I mean, that's the goal too.

1528
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,360
 It's just a reset.

1529
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:45,880
 And the brevity of it.

1530
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:50,120
 That's the other thing, able to do it quickly, just like, done.

1531
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,120
 You don't even realize.

1532
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,120
 Yeah.

1533
01:03:52,120 --> 01:04:00,680
 No, I mean, it's a weird ... The internet makes things change so fast, and so at first

1534
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:07,280
 standups felt like they were really hampered by social media because they couldn't put

1535
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:12,360
 their best material online so they consider it burned, something they can't do again.

1536
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:16,680
 And so then they started realizing that younger people started realizing faster.

1537
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:19,960
 They just did crowd work and put crowd work clips up, then they could protect their best

1538
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:23,160
 material and just do crowd work.

1539
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:28,560
 But then crowd work clips just became so much more popular and so much more viral, then

1540
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:32,960
 all of a sudden you had all these people purposely putting comedians on the spot and doing those

1541
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:33,960
 kind of contests.

1542
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:38,040
 There was crowd work shows and all kinds of other examples of it.

1543
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:42,280
 And so crowd work just has become this version of it, and even stranger, and I've talked

1544
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:46,440
 about this with magicians and comedians, is how much an audience now is just prepared

1545
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,560
 to talk to the person on stage.

1546
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:49,560
 Right?

1547
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:50,560
 Yeah.

1548
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:51,560
 Right?

1549
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:52,560
 Oh, it's amazing.

1550
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:56,800
 They're ready, like, back in the '80s and '90s and even early 2000s, if a comedian started

1551
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:00,160
 talking to someone from stage, that person would be embarrassed.

1552
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,160
 Yeah.

1553
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,160
 Yes.

1554
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,160
 They would recoil in fear.

1555
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,160
 It was a conversation.

1556
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,160
 No.

1557
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,160
 And now it's just like, "Yeah, yeah, I'm ready to talk.

1558
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,160
 What are we talking about?"

1559
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,160
 No.

1560
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,040
 That's why they're going to comedy shows to become part of the show.

1561
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,040
 It's...

1562
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,040
 Right.

1563
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:13,040
 ...fucking weird.

1564
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,520
 Krista Hendrix, who's crushing it, right?

1565
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:15,520
 She figured it out.

1566
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,560
 This is something that happened to her.

1567
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:20,440
 She wanted to do crowd work, so she went with the burner magic tricks, and people liked

1568
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:23,720
 her crowd work so much, she had to keep eliminating magic tricks in her show.

1569
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:24,720
 Right.

1570
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:25,720
 She had to do less and less magic tricks.

1571
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:30,240
 And you can watch now in her more recent clips, when she goes to talk to the audience, they're

1572
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:31,240
 just ready.

1573
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,240
 They're ready to talk to her.

1574
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:33,240
 They're ready to give her the answers.

1575
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:35,600
 They're ready to talk about their occupation or the specifics of the situation they're

1576
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,600
 writing about.

1577
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:39,200
 They have no problem talking to people now.

1578
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,280
 They know their job.

1579
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:41,280
 It is...

1580
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:42,280
 They know their part.

1581
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:43,280
 It's wild.

1582
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:44,280
 It is bizarre.

1583
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,280
 Nope.

1584
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,280
 That's from Saltlick.

1585
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,280
 Thank you.

1586
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,280
 Thank you, Saltlick.

1587
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,280
 Scoop.

1588
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,280
 Did Newman plug his podcast before he went?

1589
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,360
 Sorry, I had to take his call, and I was gone for a minute.

1590
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:55,360
 Oh, no.

1591
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,360
 He did not.

1592
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:57,360
 He's relaunching...

1593
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:58,360
 What's Newman's new podcast?

1594
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,720
 He's relaunching his podcast, Newman Unleashed, on September 25th.

1595
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,480
 You can start listening to his solo podcast.

1596
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:04,480
 There you go.

1597
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,480
 Check it out.

1598
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:08,480
 You can listen to Newman, if you hate yourself.

1599
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:09,480
 Get that horse sex.

1600
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,480
 Wait a minute.

1601
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:11,480
 Here's some Jock vs. Nerd.

1602
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:12,480
 You wanna do a little Jock vs. Nerd action?

1603
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:13,480
 Oh, am I?

1604
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:14,480
 Fuck yeah.

1605
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:15,480
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1606
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,480
 Expunge.

1607
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,480
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1608
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,480
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1609
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,480
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1610
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:20,480
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1611
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:21,480
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1612
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:22,480
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1613
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,480
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1614
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,480
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1615
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,480
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1616
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,480
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1617
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,480
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1618
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:31,880
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1619
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:36,680
 We got an old school Jock vs. Nerd coming at us from Nesticle, Scoot.

1620
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:37,680
 Oh, nice.

1621
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,800
 Nesticle sent this in a while ago.

1622
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:42,640
 He reconstructed it for me because I missed it back then.

1623
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:49,000
 Here are a dozen episode titles from our show, from our very own beloved Matt and Mattingly's

1624
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,280
 Ice Cream Social.

1625
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:52,160
 Here are a dozen episode titles.

1626
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:57,440
 The question is very simply, figure out which of these titles are real and which ones Nesticle

1627
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,720
 Scoot made up?

1628
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,600
 That's it.

1629
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:02,600
 That's it.

1630
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:03,600
 Easy game, fellas.

1631
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,600
 Easy game.

1632
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:05,600
 I'm going to tell you a title.

1633
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:11,040
 You're going to tell me, is that a title of our show that the three of us produce and

1634
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,040
 put out on the air?

1635
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:16,800
 You're just going to tell us, is that a title that we produced or is that just a made up

1636
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:17,800
 thing?

1637
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:18,800
 First one.

1638
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:19,800
 Paul, I'm thinking of a number.

1639
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:20,800
 What is it?

1640
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:21,800
 Two.

1641
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:22,800
 That's it.

1642
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:23,800
 That's exactly right.

1643
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:24,800
 You're first.

1644
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:28,320
 Bleach Thy Crevices, Bleach Thy Crevices.

1645
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:31,040
 Is that an ICS title or is that made up?

1646
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,040
 Made up.

1647
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:35,640
 Matt, is that an ICS title or is that made up?

1648
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:38,080
 Say it again?

1649
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,080
 Bleach Thy Crevices.

1650
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,640
 I think it's made up.

1651
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:42,640
 It is made up.

1652
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,040
 Good job, both of you.

1653
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,040
 All right.

1654
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:52,920
 We've played a game like this before and I have an unfair advantage that I go back and

1655
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:58,400
 forth with Slaking Fool about titles for each episode before they go up every time, and

1656
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:02,800
 I'm the one who uploads the episode, so I type it twice before I put it out into the

1657
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:06,640
 ... This is on a curve.

1658
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:09,960
 I usually retweet it and I usually see it, so you know.

1659
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:10,960
 That's true.

1660
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:11,960
 That's true.

1661
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:12,960
 Oh yeah.

1662
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:17,120
 I usually pay some measure of attention to it.

1663
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:21,200
 Rich Men Knit, Rich Men Knit.

1664
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,960
 Real or fake?

1665
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:23,960
 Rich Men Knit.

1666
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,960
 Matt, you want to go first on this one?

1667
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:27,600
 Rich Men Knit.

1668
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,560
 Rich Men Knit, K-N-I-T.

1669
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,560
 Fake.

1670
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:31,560
 Paul.

1671
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:35,920
 It sounds real to me.

1672
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:36,920
 Point for Paul.

1673
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:37,920
 Point for Paul.

1674
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:38,920
 That was episode 602.

1675
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:39,920
 All right.

1676
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:40,920
 Rich Men Knit.

1677
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:41,920
 Rich Men Knit.

1678
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:42,920
 The Twerking Disaster.

1679
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:43,920
 Real.

1680
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:44,920
 Shout them out.

1681
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:45,920
 You know them.

1682
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:46,920
 Real.

1683
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:51,920
 Twerking Disaster.

1684
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:58,040
 I'll say fake.

1685
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:59,040
 It is fake.

1686
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:02,040
 Two points for Paul.

1687
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:08,380
 Pete, Pete Seging Missiles, S-E-E-G-I-N-G.

1688
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:09,480
 That's real.

1689
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:10,480
 That's real.

1690
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,480
 That's episode 780.

1691
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,480
 Yeah.

1692
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:13,480
 Chilele leg.

1693
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:17,920
 Paul's up by two now, yeah?

1694
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:18,920
 I think so.

1695
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:19,920
 I think Paul's plus two.

1696
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:20,920
 Yeah.

1697
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:21,920
 Chilele leg.

1698
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:22,920
 True.

1699
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:23,920
 Yeah, that's a real one.

1700
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:27,360
 That's a real one, 733.

1701
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:29,520
 The Moist Horizon.

1702
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,120
 Oh, that sounds like us.

1703
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,120
 It does.

1704
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,120
 It really sounds like us.

1705
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:35,760
 But it doesn't ring a bell.

1706
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:36,760
 Yeah, right?

1707
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:37,760
 I'll say fake.

1708
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:38,760
 Okay, Matt.

1709
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:43,640
 I still say fake.

1710
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:44,640
 I should do it for gamesmanship.

1711
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,640
 I should change it up, but I think it's fake.

1712
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:48,640
 It is fake.

1713
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:49,640
 It is fake.

1714
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:50,640
 Good call, buddy.

1715
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,640
 Good call.

1716
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,120
 The Androgynous.

1717
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,440
 The Androgynous.

1718
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,440
 Fake.

1719
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:59,640
 Oh, I think that might be real.

1720
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:00,640
 It is real.

1721
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:01,640
 1081.

1722
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:02,640
 That's lazy.

1723
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,640
 Ah!

1724
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:04,640
 That's a lazy title.

1725
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:08,840
 That's exactly what I thought when I saw it.

1726
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:10,040
 I was like, "The Androgynous?

1727
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,040
 That's not real."

1728
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:16,120
 I scrolled down and said, "We have a show called The Androgynous?"

1729
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:18,120
 The Gospel of Jacob.

1730
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,120
 Hmm.

1731
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,480
 The Gospel of Jacob.

1732
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:25,680
 I mean, on a chat GPT level, we must have, right?

1733
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:26,680
 Right.

1734
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:27,680
 Right.

1735
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:30,760
 That just seems like at the end of a thousand episodes, we must have done that.

1736
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:31,760
 The Gospel of Jacob?

1737
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:32,760
 Yeah.

1738
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:33,760
 The Gospel of Jacob.

1739
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:37,000
 Did you say real, Matt?

1740
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
 I said real.

1741
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,960
 I'll say real.

1742
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:40,960
 It's fake.

1743
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:41,960
 It's fake.

1744
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:42,960
 We never did The Gospel of Jacob.

1745
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:43,960
 Out of town.

1746
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:44,960
 Let's call this episode that one.

1747
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,680
 The Gospel of Jacob and the moist horizon.

1748
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:50,800
 We didn't use both of those.

1749
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:51,800
 Chili Chilis.

1750
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:52,800
 C-H-I-L-L-Y.

1751
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:53,800
 C-H-I-L-L-I-'s.

1752
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:54,800
 Chili Chilis.

1753
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:55,800
 That's real.

1754
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:56,800
 That's real.

1755
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:57,800
 Oh, that is fake.

1756
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:58,800
 What?

1757
01:10:58,800 --> 01:10:59,800
 That is fake.

1758
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:00,800
 Stop it.

1759
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:01,800
 I know.

1760
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:02,800
 That's fake.

1761
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:03,800
 I know.

1762
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,280
 That's three that we have to use now.

1763
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:06,280
 My brain is confusing.

1764
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:07,920
 Porn sniffing dog.

1765
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:08,920
 That's real.

1766
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:09,920
 That's real.

1767
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:10,920
 That's definitely real.

1768
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:11,920
 Yeah.

1769
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,120
 That's episode 679.

1770
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,920
 The fifth nugget hits rock bottom.

1771
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:22,160
 I'm already upset with how poorly I'm doing on this, by the way.

1772
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:23,160
 Three wrong is unacceptable.

1773
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:28,240
 Matt, it's not like you gave a speech talking about how you had an advantage in this game

1774
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:29,840
 at the beginning of the game, though.

1775
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:30,840
 I think that's real.

1776
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:31,840
 Exactly.

1777
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:34,320
 I was putting myself on blast on purpose.

1778
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,760
 I wanted to stay sharp.

1779
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:36,760
 Yeah.

1780
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:39,000
 I'll say real on the nugget.

1781
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,480
 What is it?

1782
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,520
 Oh, Paul says real on the nugget.

1783
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,480
 The fifth nugget hits rock bottom.

1784
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,640
 I'm going to say false.

1785
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:47,640
 It is real.

1786
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:48,640
 Episode 1133.

1787
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,520
 I'm running away with it, Matt.

1788
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,520
 I'm running away.

1789
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,520
 That's a recent one.

1790
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:53,520
 Yeah.

1791
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,520
 Paul's destroying me on this.

1792
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:55,520
 1133.

1793
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,280
 You say recent, Matt.

1794
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,400
 That's like three years ago.

1795
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,400
 Maybe four.

1796
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,400
 It's a year ago.

1797
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,760
 No, it's like six months ago, right?

1798
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:04,760
 It's a year ago.

1799
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:05,760
 No, no, it's not.

1800
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:06,760
 It's not.

1801
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:07,760
 I don't know what number we're on now.

1802
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:08,760
 What number are we on now?

1803
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:09,760
 What number is this show?

1804
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:10,760
 We're on 1240 something.

1805
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:11,760
 Yeah.

1806
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:12,760
 So it's been about 100 episodes.

1807
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:13,760
 Yeah, it's been a year.

1808
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:14,760
 That's a long time.

1809
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:24,680
 This is the last one, and of course, as tradition dictates, this one is worth 18,000 points.

1810
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:27,920
 Don't leave me gross.

1811
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:28,920
 That's real.

1812
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:29,920
 That's real.

1813
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:30,920
 That's real.

1814
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:33,800
 We both get 18,000 points, but Paul wins by three.

1815
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:39,880
 That was episode 454, and that is from the Nesticle Scoop.

1816
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:44,120
 Thank you so much, Nesticle Scoop, and thank you for rebuilding that Jock vs. Nerd that

1817
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:45,480
 you had made a while back.

1818
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,960
 We really appreciate it.

1819
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:51,320
 If you want to send us a scooperty or a Price of Skryte Jock vs. Nerd or an Obelisk Jock

1820
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:56,120
 vs. Nerd, or just send us an old school Jock vs. Nerd like Nesticle Scoop just did, or just

1821
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:59,320
 go over there and send us some Scoop mail, you can do all those things over there at

1822
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:03,000
 Hayscoops.com, head over to Hayscoops.com, do all those things.

1823
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
 It's going to be great.

1824
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
 Buy yourself tickets to ScoopFest.

1825
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
 Yes.

1826
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
 You don't have to hear us.

1827
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,200
 Plug ScoopFest a whole lot more coming up in the next couple weeks, so get them now.

1828
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,200
 Do it.

1829
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,720
 You're going to miss it.

1830
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:15,720
 Awesome.

1831
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,720
 Who sent that in?

1832
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:18,720
 Nesticle.

1833
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:19,720
 Nesticle Scoop.

1834
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:22,920
 Thank you, Nesticle Scoop, for making me doubt myself.

1835
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:23,920
 Really now.

1836
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:26,720
 I'm a terrible podcast host.

1837
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,120
 I don't think that's why you're a bad podcast host.

1838
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:30,120
 Thank you, Jacob.

1839
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:31,120
 Those were great, though.

1840
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,360
 Even the made-up ones were really tricky.

1841
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:37,400
 Oh, there were, like the made-up ones, I'm just upset that we haven't already used them.

1842
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:38,840
 Jacob, you're right.

1843
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:45,000
 Why I am a bad podcast host is I muted my Zoom because I had to take a call, but then

1844
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
 I didn't mute my recorder.

1845
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
 Oh, no.

1846
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:53,080
 So, in the middle of the Newman interview, you have to figure out, bro.

1847
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,080
 It's where Newman's talking, right?

1848
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1849
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,080
 Yeah, yeah, I got you.

1850
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,080
 I got you.

1851
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:02,320
 I'm just going to make a note about that right now.

1852
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:06,840
 It'll be fine to just hear Matt's rando conversation in the middle of the interview.

1853
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,560
 With my corporate magic booker.

1854
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:09,960
 That'll be great.

1855
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:11,920
 Yeah, that'll be great.

1856
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:12,920
 Professionals.

1857
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:13,920
 That's right.

1858
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,360
 Nicholas Newman in the chat.

1859
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:16,800
 Great time to take a call.

1860
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,760
 Yeah, yeah, Richard wants us to leave it in.

1861
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:22,200
 Thirsty Scoop wants us to leave that in.

1862
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:23,200
 There's a Patriot level.

1863
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,200
 There's a Patriot level.

1864
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:28,200
 I do notice, and I don't know what to do about it because I don't know how to mute the recorder,

1865
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,200
 so I just leave the room.

1866
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:33,200
 So, it's only the beginning of the conversation before I leave.

1867
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:37,200
 It will not be hard to find.

1868
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:43,200
 When you hear a different voice on the phone on my audio, you'll know.

1869
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,200
 That's it.

1870
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:46,720
 That's it.

1871
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:50,840
 And that's why I'm not a good podcast host.

1872
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:51,840
 Other reasons.

1873
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,640
 I want to thank Ben Jalef for creating this podcast.

1874
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:55,840

01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:42,080

1895

 very soon again.

1896

01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,760
 Like Matt said, that is how we do the show, it's what makes the show possible.

1921
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:52,340
 So if you think this show is worth more than $0, PreachingFun.com, fartsinabag.biz, those

1922
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:56,080
 are the places that you can go to support this show and get some cool stuff.

1923
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,560
 Like you get to hang out in the Zoom with us.

1924
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:06,500
 Our Zoom attendance today got full on spoilers for ScoopFest this year, just in the pre-show.

1925
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:10,120
 So there is something worth coming over and hanging out in the Zoom chat with us if you

1926
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,360
 are on Patreon, so do that.

1927
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:17,000
 Look at your Patreon messages, we send out the Zoom link twice a week, every week, no

1928
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
 matter what.

1929
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,440
 Well, unless we're not going to do it and then we wouldn't send the link out.

1930
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:22,520
 But other than that, no matter what.

1931
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:23,520
 Yeah.

1932
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,520
 Right.

1933
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:25,520
 Right.

1934
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,520
 All things considered.

1935
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:27,520
 Pretty much all the time, though.

1936
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:28,520
 Alright.

1937
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:29,520
 Usually.

1938
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,520
 Thanks for listening, everybody.

1939
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:31,520
 Stay safe out there.

1940
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:32,520
 We love you, and we'll see you soon.

1941
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:33,520
 We'll see you soon.

1942
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:33,520
 We'll see you at the cone!

1943
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:58,480
 Jeff Loomis points out that the phone call was probably not that entertaining since Matt

1944
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:01,480
 came back on the show after the phone call was over.

1945
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,160
 We're Preaching Fun!
