 I'm the guy at the Olive Garden. I'm the old man at the Olive Garden family thing
 You remember that commercial I do when the grandpa always go

 Who knows?

 Yeah
 Here's a show
 Hey, Johnny. Do you want to go to an ice cream social?
 Yeah, I'd love to great. Let's go
 Guys it's my little season
 Are you using proper math this time?
 Oh
 Boy have you started walking already? I have and I'm trying to keep up the thing where I run a little bit
 Okay, I'm gonna start running again, and I'm embarrassingly sore from very little running again
 Running's not good for you Matt
 It's definitely not good for me. I think it's good for other people, but it's not good for me. I don't know
 It's probably good for someone. It's hard on the joints, especially men of size
 Not that you're a man of my size, but still I'm I don't know. I'm certainly in the plus category
 Yeah, but I don't know but still yeah, I can't I I would die if I tried to run at this point
 I think well
 I was walking the other day and I saw someone running and they were like barely moving like they just simply have their elbows up
 And it was like this very it was almost like they were more like tiptoeing than running
 Do you know I mean where they just holding their elbows up? No, no, no like
 You know, you know, like when you when you know, I don't know I know I'm trying to describe it for the audience
 It doesn't help our listeners. It's like this
 It's like that ball
 Paul is doing me like lazy deep masseuse right now. Just the two sharp elbows. Just I'm very lazy deep masseuse
 Lazy deep masseuse. Let me elbow your caboose
 Yeah, I do like a nice elbow in my caboose
 My elbow slipped in your crack oops
 Feet you're not above right? I mean that's what it's all about. Really? That's why I go to the massage parlor
 For the possibility of something inadvertently slipping into my crack
 It just comes close to cracking use your paw whisper, please
 Well, it's it's like a prehensile tail back there. It's just it grabs it whatever might come near. It's like an antlion
 Sir let go of my elbow
 I can't I can't control it. It has a mind of its own
 It's like quado from its prehensile, but I can't control it. That's right
 Like moving their arms back and forth like almost like a dance move and they were kind of just shuffling their feet along and
 I thought to myself. Well if that counts as running I
 Can start running more power walking?
 Yeah, yeah
 Yeah, if that counts if that counts then I should start going from walking to lazy
 lazy running or
 Lazy, I can do that power walking is fine
 I think the run it's it's the it's the coming down hard and putting the bumps on the joints kind of thing
 Well, I was because I was reading an article and they were like, oh, you know like a specific style of power
 Walking is in vogue right now out of Japan, which means of course, it's book. Nothing is happening
 and
 But I simply referenced a mile time of like, you know power walking and like doing a 15-minute mile and I went like gulp
 I don't want a mile in 15 minutes the power walked it for 50
 15 minute mile per walking walking
 Huh, they just pop that out in the area like it was nothing and I was like wait
 I'm at like an 18 19 minute mile when I walk I don't walk a 15 minute. So the best is like three minutes, right?
 running
 Just just the best like nobody's gone faster than like a three minute mile. That's correct
 I don't even know if anyone's done a three minute mile
 Okay. Yeah, I don't think so. Yeah
 If only there was a way I could find out no 3 4 3 13 pondering. What is it three three? What three?
 343 point 13 seconds challenge accepted Jacob. Okay
 Was that that guy was that Pretoria's with the spring legs was he able is that how he got it?
 No, no, they don't set the records with with that. Yeah. Yeah, and then he accidentally trampled his ex-wife
 It is a man whose name I'm not going to try to say it starts with a G but he's he's from
 Morocco give it a shot Jacob. Give it your best shot
 Girl
 First of all the barge first syllable Jacob had to take a timeout
 G you e rr. Oh you jay el garage
 El garage, I think is that it's pronounced Baton Rouge
 His Moroccan name means the red stick I actually got a good laugh
 I was doing a card trick, you know the Spanish Spanish poetry card trick in San Antonio
 I said it San Antonio, of course is French for the red stick
 And then I said, oh wait, that's Baton Rouge. It's Spanish for the good land
 Nope, that's Milwaukee and I need more of us. I need more of the I need all the translations. Yeah
 Oh, yeah, what does that mean? What does the main mean?
 The moine it's Spanish for the boy. No, it's it's it's a it's Italian gangster for the moine
 Hey, you've got the moine what's a boy, huh?
 You don't got mine answering if French is still fine
 I'm playing an ignorant. I'm playing an ignorant jerk
 All languages are up for grabs right da moine da bears
 Well, I just had another zoom meeting with the skit crew
 Mm-hmm. I don't know if I said already but steel city improv theater still city improv theater. We are starting a
 new
 class session
 Sadly, I did not get enough registrants in my class for my class session to move forward for the first four weeks
 Seems to be a continuing theme in the
 Aegis
 We gotta get we gotta get you out there doing shows buddy, it's not a just it's not a just it's just a matter of
 I'm teaching level one and then we got to get some level ones to get the further thing, you know, so hopefully
 In October, we'll get things leveled out
 Rich Tellurico is coming out to do a workshop in October. So that'll hopefully help too. We'll see how that all goes
 Yeah, but we're just discussing
 Getting to know the faculty and yeah, we're gonna hopefully start doing some performances
 For the student body and building up something of a community again, you know
 Yeah, I don't think you should ever try to start anything. I just happen with the foolers tour
 I don't like anything on the East Coast during the first weeks of September is a good idea
 I think well transitioning from August
 I need I need you and a time machine to come back and have a nice long conversation with Justin a few months ago
 I can provide one of those two things you need. Okay, one of the two things great. Okay, it's a time machine
 First time foolers tour we were dragging ass and then by October picked up I agree and that's that's seems to be what happened
 With my last free class too as I went down to six students from 12 the previous time
 Yeah, so it's just it is it's a busy time and it's just a weird time
 And August and September is a nasty transition from people doing the summertime things to whatever their fall is gonna be I guess that's true
 Whether you do or don't have kids, I think it's just a big transition time
 well, hopefully
 That'll change up. We'll see speaking of transition
 Yesterday and had a little bit of time I
 was off and so
 She has been desperate to convert a corner of the bedroom
 the big the big
 bedroom
 into a reading nook
 Okay, is this for you is she is she trying to encourage you to read she's like my husband can't read no
 I'm going to teach him. No, she sees me in bed with a comic every night. I am I am reading
 I'm not reading, you know, anything's too profound, but I'm reading a shitload of comic books now
 I read almost every night. I read some more Fantastic Four again last night
 No, she's uh
 What do you think would be the recipes required for a reading nook?
 What's the the recipes what do you what do you put in a reading nook? Oh, oh what a chair
 Aha
 Jacob gets the gold star. That's the big requirement a chair
 I play my zoom delay for not tying Jacob. I said what did you say chair as well?
 I said come back here specific Matt Matt also said comfy chair. I'll give you a star to Matt comfy chair
 Anyway
 We went to the one and only value city furniture
 down in cranberry
 Nothing better for the for the spine than the tailbone like value city furniture. Well
 You'd be surprised this chair
 you found is
 D-lux so she found one that was pretty nice has some you know power
 Let go primarily for you or for Anne. This is for Anne, but this is the funny fans look
 This is Anne's look, but this is the funny. Okay. She got this one
 It's just I all this will do can I get it in this color and they're like, no
 Can you not get it in this color you can go fuck yourself now well
 Well, it was gonna be like months you specifically know we save this color for special children, right?
 Don't you have a lot of this color though? We do we have we so much of you can't get this you can't have this color
 This is only for people who have the higher rankings of the Autobot Society and I know that you
 Just short of the highest ranking and McPheeters underachiever
 Clipboard do not sell to and McPheeters
 They got a Polaroid up a man
 So she quickly set that chair on fire just to teach them a lesson good about not selling her the chair
 No, then the sales lady goes well
 Very almost exactly the same price we have the prime model up front. Oh
 And I'm like, oh shit and we go up there and
 This thing this fucking chair. It's got this thing called. It's the same thing as the other chair had they call it zero
 Gravity if you heard about this. Oh, yeah. Yeah gravity get your legs up above your heart
 Makes you feel like you're gonna fall the hell down, but they don't but it's all automatic and this fucking chair
 Not only does it have zippy zip up and down legs above the heart
 it has
 Massage in the
 lumbar
 It has heated seat
 It has neck support up be downy. I don't need a heated seat in the house
 No, and does and always is she is forever cold. Oh, she's always caught. She's one of those always cold. She's it's got a hidden
 drink holder in one arm
 the other arm
 Holds the master controls
 Forget this
 the
 integrated Bluetooth sound system
 This chair is basically a high-fives terrier and
 She would never have have gone for this but as soon as she got in it felt how comfy it was
 Realized she could get the color she wanted and then started thinking about it
 She was actually she said
 We were going to buy the thing she said
 You know, I was thinking about getting a little
 Radio or something to put in the room so that I could do like
 Bluetooth stuff to listen to listen to music and stuff and and I was like well now you can just hook it to your
 Your chair your chair is basically your
 Your stereo your radio. It's all you need
 Yeah, and and it can just play stuff even when you're in bed
 You can just be listening to your chair and I was like that that radio was gonna cost you probably upwards of $50
 This is you're getting this thing for free at this point
 So yeah, it was funny but but she gives me guff because I don't know if any of you have experienced this
 but going shopping with me I
 Will just be like yeah get that. I'll get the better one get the really nice one. Go for that. Oh, yeah, you need that I
 I am similar. Yeah, except when it comes to basic technology being included like I don't need my free
 Yeah, yeah, I don't get the things like that. I don't have the things like the speakers
 I don't like the idea that a program of a washer and dryer for my phone. I don't find them more convenient in any way. I
 I would normally agree 100% but the speaker in the chair
 Think about this. This is your reading nook
 You can just do audiobooks
 Right and that's part of it or you can have just soothing music while you're reading and with all the neck paint
 I have for putting on headphones and
 That's right. I given myself
 Well wearing goes that for me
 That's true
 Like how much nicer would it be to just turn on your side and fall asleep without having to have headphones in or anything?
 Now we're getting now we're getting to what you actually want out of this chair
 I'm not getting anything out of this chair. Although she was like don't you think something out of this chair?
 Don't you think you'll ever fall asleep in this chair? I'm like, yeah, I might fall asleep in this chair someday
 But the other thing yeah, she was really concerned about was
 She wants it very close to the wall because she got specific measurements for the room, you know
 You pardon me I am fighting a terrible cold
 She says, you know, I I I want it to kind of hug the wall and the sales lady is like four inches clearance
 And she's like what it's like
 Four inches away from the wall. It can fully recline
 That's it. Oh, yes. Oh, that's that's amazing. Yes. That's yes
 Are you think so? But what it does is it like it moves the butt part forward as it does. Yeah
 It's incredible. It's an incredible chair
 So this is the part of the show that you want to be on zoom or on twitch to see because now you can see the hand
 You sit in the chair and just slides down. It just slides. It doesn't recline
 Look at Paul and Jacob look like bad breakdancers from the 1980s with their slides
 Bad breakdancers, we're as good as that crazy bitch from Australia. Yeah
 Is breaking out yeah, oh
 I had no idea
 Well, each she was so bad. They eliminated breakdancing, huh?
 Each host nation can eliminate games and add games
 Well, they did it
 Well, that doesn't make any sense though cuz the next one's gonna be in LA supposedly right correct
 Why in the hell wouldn't you do breaking in LA?
 Because no one does that
 We don't have competitive breakdancing in this country doesn't bug a little fish still live out there. How about how about who else is out there?
 The decision for the 2028 sports that would be at the Los Angeles Olympics was made before
 breaking debuted in Paris
 So it was not our friend ray gun
 Who who got rid of breaking it was already before ray gun dance
 So I last got access to the time machine Paul requested earlier. Ah, that's true
 You know
 it's possible that someone has now invented a time machine because a couple of people have said things to me in the last couple of
 Days about going back in time machines to do just silly little tasks like this
 So I think I think we're living in the timeline now
 Is around and we're just gonna use it for a little for tedious little tasks like this. They're like boogaloo shrimp
 Mr. No bones who are some of the other ones turbo? Oh
 There were great names. Yeah, the names were amazing. The next there should have been a medal ceremony
 Just for the just for breaking names. Yeah. Nah, I'm just I'm sad to break it isn't there. But anyway and getting a
 Wonderful chair soon for her reading nook. And so that's coming to fruition
 Which I'm super happy for her this nook. What makes it a nook your house already has a nook
 It's just a corner of the bedroom that we've we've cleared out
 So it used to hold the TV in the bedroom and never watches TV in the bedroom
 okay, so we took the TV and the TV stand out to her in-laws and
 That's where that lives now, where do you watch TV on your phone? I have it on my phone
 Well, I'm usually sleeping in a separate room most of the time
 Because my crazy 2 a.m. Wake-up call is a little jarring
 so yeah, a little jarring so yeah, so we're switching stuff up with
 all that stuff and
 Sleep I
 Sleep in the guest room right next to her in the reading nook
 Okay. Okay. Yeah, and you know, he's gonna be sleeping reading nook in there. I have I've it is the whole thing's a reading
 No, you should demand a reading nook in the guest. No, no, no, no, no
 Don't even say that no and would be like one two for one climbers
 It's it's two twin beds in this guest room and the one twin bread twin twin bed
 I sleep in it's made of bread. You told us
 It's all bread I do I lay in bed just whoops all bread
 Little snack little snack before bed. Oh crusty
 Just like pudding skin I've got a I've got a
 little side table stacked high with trade paperbacks and comics and
 The second twin bed is equally stacked high with trade paper back
 Where do you sleep in the bed without the comic books on it? But I also I also it serves another purpose. I
 take
 giz
 To bed with me. Yeah, little lady Elizabeth who is the troublemaker?
 She's the old queen who always likes to start shit with the other dogs
 So I take her to bed with me so and can get some decent sleep
 Some of the time. Yeah
 Some of the time
 Dog could use a recliner. Yeah, well, that's that's the other thing. That's the other reason that that dog read
 She reads at the foot of the bed
 With her little with her little she does get a little snacky cake every time she comes to bed
 Well, she's got me trained forget about it
 I take I get a little biscuit for her if I don't drop a biscuit on the end of that
 Biscuits oh man, you joke night biscuits is where it's at and in the morning night biscuits night biscuits
 This morning, this is my routine I get up I let giz out
 Ted wakes up in her bedroom and he wants out too
 So I get everything squared away
 I bring giz back into Anne's room and let her snuggle with Anne because she has to keep them separate and
 then
 After Ted and sometimes Adora goes out Bill hardly ever goes out at 2 in the morning
 He's just sleep in the bed. But when they come back, I have to have I get four doggy biscuits
 Get everybody back in the room close off the little gate and that's my ritual in the morning and in the more
 It's it's it's 2 in the morning and all you hear is
 Four dogs crunch are the dogs making any noises my favorite R&B band from the 70s was Otis Doughboy and the night biscuits
 Their first single was
 Otis Doughboy and the night biscuits

 You can hear it's really hard to do my masturbatory
 Mucus membranes
 Masturbatory

 In the driving rain of Chicago to the forts of Summertown
 all the way to Ohio and the valley down below in the depths of
 Milwaukee all the way to Georgia town
 Let's go all the way to San Francisco and then go back to Nepal. Yeah
 Masturbatory
 Mucus membranes because this is definitely a peets. This is definitely a Seeger song and not
 Bob Seeger, not even Pete Seeger
 Well, I was abandoned by the night biscuits, but that'll happen
 You'll have more success with Paul singers silver bullet band
 Can't wait to listen
 Listen to that book in my in my new nook recliner
 Abandoned by the night biscuits a tell-all
 Biscuits the the dark side of what's-his-name again?
 Boy, Otis, don't know boys the dark side of Otis Doughboy abandoned by the night biscuits
 When we come back Otis Doughboy hits rock bottom, I
 Kept singing about masturbatory membranes and
 The night biscuits were done
 next on VH - in front of the music I
 Got really really drunk off of
 Hefeweizen and
 Put the tour bus in a tree
 And three three of the night biscuits died on impact I
 The other eight just left voluntarily that's right
 There were 11 night biscuits
 I told you
 The show I did where I handed someone my knife for the rope trick and said you believe in the power of the magic wand
 And she said I believe in the power of the Lord Jesus Christ, right?
 Right a follow-up here. Yeah, I didn't realize I say do you believe in the power and twice in my show?
 so oh I
 Was doing a show in San Antonio and I had some up to the signature. I believe you believe in the power of your your own signature
 And I forgot that I say it the same exact way
 And a woman goes why believe in the power of the Lord Jesus Christ for a while?
 Wow
 Polite applause yeah
 Wow
 And I said, okay, and then we did the whole trick and it worked and everything went great
 And then I said really sarcastically well of course every magic I pull off of course is also because of Jesus Christ
 and I got a
 rousing round of applause
 amount of applause
 That I like froze like as if I didn't want to be seen by a reptile
 Like sure clapping and I literally was like you melted into the background. Don't don't make a move
 You can just like buddy. I made a small joke and you reacted like it was a large joke and now you've startled me
 No, it wasn't a joke at all. No, and that I was actually giving
 Credit for my entire show to the Lord are my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. They were just they were genuinely applauding
 Yeah, yes, they were given credit to Jesus. Yeah. Yes, and then I was fascinated
 So awkward that I froze because I was like if I make a move, they'll know
 That I I don't that I was being smart. Yeah
 The Lord and then they're gonna turn on you like wolves. I was like and if they Google me I'm dead. Oh, yeah
 It's good that we don't say godless in the first two words of our podcast description. Yeah, right. Oh shit, we do
 You know what's funny Matt are you considering changing your wording now I am
 Are you considering changing your religion now both? Yeah, okay good. I mean, I just want to go wherever the money is
 Boy, it's the same thing that happens. We're gonna go religion. That's where the money is
 It's the same thing that happens with Star Wars fans
 when you say may the force be with you and
 Then and also with you exactly that becomes the response. It's just turn a phrase
 It's just clocked. Yeah, you know, yeah. Yeah, I
 Mean that's just dead. Laszlo in the chat says preaching whatever you believe in is the ICS moniker
 Which I think is just true
 Yeah
 Moniker is basically do what you want. I wasn't like angry that it happened
 I wasn't like you all just confused you idiots you shape
 Good job sheeple and not do that
 Are you guys didn't think that trick was too bad
 That's right, you're a bunch of sheep let's get him booked in next week
 But yeah
 But back home from here now through scoop fest, which is exciting good
 My dude, I was thinking about leaving right before scoop fest
 Carton of milk or a pack of smokes
 Yeah, that's it
 Hey, I've got a I've got a conundrum. I want to run by you guys. What is that? Oh good
 That is conundrums are a specialty
 okay, so
 I'm scheduled to do my shift tomorrow at the old Tarja and
 Then after that I'm not scheduled at all next week. Ah
 But I am scheduled the two days before I leave for scoop fest
 Okay, so I think they just
 Forgot to schedule me for next week. Oh jeez. Now. Here's the thing. You're scheduled in the future past that exactly
 Now I asked Dan about this because I did want her opinion and I came back from a managerial standpoint saying
 She she schedules people all the time. She said I would probably like someone to bring that to my attention
 Just to you know, cuz people make mistakes things happen. Yeah, and it has happened before where I haven't been scheduled and
 The bosses are like why isn't Paul here and they're like he's not scheduled
 That's kind of like but they discover it on the day right it's like dummies they discover it at 4 a.m
 Yeah, when they'd love to have things going their way, right?
 so
 but I
 personally am
 cool with just
 taking this week as a
 zilcher
 counting on
 the little bit of funds that will probably come in through our
 Bucket show right I will I will almost guaranteed make as much at Bucket show as I would
 For whatever a couple of days. I'd be doing at the old Tarjay. Oh
 You think so do you I guarantee? Yeah, so we already spent your thousand dollars, Paul
 You think I make close to a thousand dollars
 Anywhere between 15 and 20
 Basically a week give or take
 There you go. Yeah, good. How many how many days is this gonna be?
 It's usually a three or four usually usually three or four
 so three and or four
 three and or four
 You know doesn't like this bit my cat, but let's keep going
 Shmoopy hates this and then multiply those hours by diddly and squat as far as my payments
 Again, you should be on zoom and twitch Matt. Just showed his very annoying cat camera
 He showed the cat annoying annoyed annoyed her head shut up. She was napping. It was like the fuck
 Yeah, no, that's straight up. No fun annoying at all annoyed. That's so funny
 Okay, go ahead that that sounds like my paycheck right there
 But two bucket shows

 Things coming in there you always get HJ's out front of it McMullin's so you always got that going for you, right?
 Right little walking around money
 Yeah. Yeah, my portable
 privacy tube

 Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, get my get my tube here. Come on. Come on over here. Great. Let me just
 Is this is this marked privacy tube? It is. It's a privacy tube. Yeah
 I wrote on the side with a marker. It says

 Except from the government's that yeah, that makes it legal
 In fact, have you see my license plate? It just says I'm not traveling in a work vehicle
 Yeah, half of the tube is a modified Gaston flag and instead of a snake. It's a curled penis
 Good good. So don't jack on me. Don't bite on me. Don't
 What
 What's this empty bag of economy 12 pairs of socks? What's this? What's this wrapper from?
 That is my XL
 Improvised condom that I have to use. I can't magnums don't even work for me
 I have to use so much worse than where Matt was going with these old. I have to use old sock bags
 You know you think I could use like
 Grocery bags, I can't
 The grocery bags don't have the plastic doesn't have enough rigidity to maintain
 But yeah, I always complain about my condoms. It's not enough rigidity old
 12 to 14 pack sock bags are my condom of choice and honestly
 They only cover about half of what I got going on down there. Yeah
 girth and
 Circumference wise both
 Deal yeah deal is right. Yeah, no search and seizure
 So for Canadian scoops out there in October, yeah land in st. John twice
 Once with princess and once with Virgin
 Okay, and I'm also gonna go to
 Boston and
 Charleston, South Carolina on Virgin
 And so maybe we can do some kind of scoop meetup situation there
 Interestingly enough. I'm going to like Eastport, Maine is a big cruise stop on the Canadian circuit. Huh? I was like, oh cool
 I have a bunch of old friends. I haven't talked to in Portland, Maine in a long time, man
 Large state turns out pretty big. Yeah. Yeah
 That's the same thing with the Pennsylvania. It's crazy. Like you can't really it's four hours from Portland, Maine. Yeah
 It's not a lunch
 It's not a meetup for coffee kind of situate. Yeah, so
 I'm actually closer to most it's like that's only two hours from Boston
 But even that's like not please don't travel two hours to have a cup of coffee with me. I don't think that's worth it. Yeah
 Yeah, although any excuse to get out of Boston
 I should go there. You're right. I should get out and go there. Oh
 No, I meant the people who are in Boston probably want to get out for an hour or two
 Just give them the excuse. Let's get away from that smell of beans
 Oh so many beans. It's all baked beans out there. That's what crack the Liberty Bell. I went to
 all them beans
 They're beans though

 Hello
 My god, it's the eight remaining night biscuits I
 Thought I defeated you in that bus accident. That was no accident. That was me driving you off the road

 Tried to kill all of you, but only succeeded in killing three
 I can't resist the funk
 We're we need a place to stay we left Otis, okay
 I've got a nice room for you here. It smells really funky. Oh
 Covered in comic books, don't ask questions, you know what I just do
 I
 Went to the the Westgate this week, they had the big blues bender. Oh the Westgate resort this week
 You know that used to be the Hilton where they use to have
 The what did you ever see that? Oh
 God, I just got a flurry of stuff in my messages because
 September 8th is the anniversary of the closing
 So a lot I thought I felt just good that day. Oh
 Just woke up feeling happy
 No
 Star Trek the experience around him sort of a bitch. So what was that the Westgate this time?
 The big blues bender the the big blues festival that happens in Vegas every year. It's happened at the Westgate for a few years
 But it's a it's a huge blues festival
 They do I think it's either three or four days and it's like noon to 3 a.m
 Every day. Well, it is this all held in that of Elvis theater. Is that where it all is?
 Well, that's one of the rooms so it they've got the Elvis theater. They've got another huge theater set up in the convention area
 They've got an outdoor stage. They use the the lobby stage and they have the the shimmer cabaret
 Or I don't know if it might be called something different now, but that that theater that's in there as well
 So they have five different spaces. Oh, yeah, the shimmer cabaret former home of menopause the musical
 Quite a few different things have been in the shipper. Yeah, I saw
 Sacred halls sacred hall. I saw Gilbert Gottfried performed several times in the shipper cabaret. I thought Gilbert the shimmer and it was awesome
 It was Gilbert in that room was so good. That is that such a good room
 It's a nice intimate space stand up is great. Oh, it's so good
 I saw I was in the I was in the Westgate for this this big blues festival
 We were we were outside some friends came in town in conjunction with this
 And they were getting married in Las Vegas. So we were we were hanging out with some friends that had just gotten married
 We had some family in town. They were they were hanging out the blues bender. So we were we were there
 we're watching music and I say I
 Need to go to the restroom. So I excused myself and go to the restroom there in the Westgate Resort and
 I'm standing there at the urinal guy comes up to me at the urinal
 Oh, he starts peeing old older guy old guy at the urinal. He comes up and
 Just lets out the biggest fart
 You have ever heard in your life
 In a pseudo public space, do you think it was prehensile back there was he trying to grab it was
 I don't think I don't think there was any control happening back there at all that explains the symbol crashes
 That's the loose caboose the symbol crash
 I was out there rocking a zildjian with his hinder
 He almost fucking got it too because I was real close
 Turning and vomiting right?
 This guy is gonna make me fucking yeah, what is she's yelled you got a bell? Oh, no, it's smelled
 It was the worst thing that's happened to me in a month
 Bad bathroom luck the scoops are commenting you have this is my second
 This is my second urinal story on this podcast 12 years. Come on, but but still no no
 I was jacking it was yeah
 Yeah, that was more than weeks ago
 I just thought you were you weren't counting that as a bad story
 I've had one bad bathroom experience
 The other one I took as a compliment
 I was like this is I just looked at him. I was like what the
 What are you doing? And he just oblivious of course fucking oblivion of course
 I mean, I really thought I was gonna yak on him, but that is it was that is the really hard do it
 Sure, no, no if you're gonna rip one the bathroom is the is the most appropriate place
 But it is tough here in that close of proximity
 Also the Westgate bathroom that I was in I didn't I didn't properly explain the layout of the restroom
 What is the Westgate to you? Was this the one inside the old space quest?
 It's the one next to it. It's one right next to the old space quest
 It was not the one inside space quest not the one inside now the futuristic urinals. No, no, not all that
 Do they still talk? I?
 Don't know when you used to ask Jacob when he definitely specified
 He did not go into the bathroom you just described just ask him facts about the bathroom
 We didn't go I sure did I sure did Matt because it's me precisely what happened
 I'm going I'm going into the space bathroom
 Even if I don't have to go space bathroom space bathroom
 I'm gonna go revisit it that guy was trying to get there, but as he was jet propelled in
 You know if he'd done that in the void of space that could have propelled him infinitely towards the outer rims. Oh, yeah
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah. No, he's basically warp speeding right through that bathroom
 Oh, but the but the urinals you would piss in them and
 It was dumb because we were right next to the Star Trek experience, and it wasn't it wasn't you know
 They were like, let's spacey theme it
 But when you pissed in it, it would go
 detecting luck levels
 And it was like yeah, it would go detecting levels. Yeah
 L-U-C-K luck levels and now it's very similar now. It just says detecting hepatitis is what it says. Yes. Yeah
 We are so sorry. You got you got hep C. Oh
 bad luck
 And then then when you when you left when you were giving it the old the old shake
 It would go may the look be with you
 It's better way the fuck is the lock exactly may the force be with you was may the luck be with you
 And I was like first of all
 wrong space thing
 Yeah, it should have done, you know should have done other stuff should have been like luck long and prosper
 The only difference now Paul is Las Vegas offers that urinal, but it says would you like an enhanced urinal experience pay six dollars?
 Oh, oh and then does the Borg head come out
 Jake you were there does the Borg head come in?
 After I ate one of the hot dogs I worked there
 started peeking out I
 Would pay six dollars to have the 4d Borg head pop out
 Give me
 Just so our listeners are clear because some people some people you know, some people watch us on zoom
 Some people watch us on twitch some people watch us on YouTube some people just listen to this as an audio experience
 It's for those people. I want to make it very clear that what Paul wants specifically is he wants to stand
 urinating at a urinal and then have the head of a Borg alien come out and
 Felaciate him felicitate urinal felaciate
 They will blast you with the felicitate or resistance is futile we're getting through the shields captain
 We're almost to the balls
 Think about space baseball think about space baseball think about space baseball. Oh, no
 There is such a thing on DS 9 the Niners
 Cisco was a baseball fan and he would play games of baseball in the holiday
 I thought you meant there was a toilet that would suck you off as you were peeing
 what I
 Thought that was really weird thing to have on this Star Trek show, but there is one in Japan
 That's true standards and practices fell asleep at the wheel does
 Does the thing in the in the space shuttle can't you know what this is on me guys?
 I I was the one in charge of checking this episode
 That we were what if we were in the in the guardrails, I mean
 I I fucked this up you'd be pretty close if you put if you if you tape some googly eyes to that space shuttle one
 You'd be pretty close
 right
 Yes, sorry
 I know just getting off just just laying out the argument. Go ahead. Keep going
 Okay, it's gonna take a lot to craft
 Molded pork head and then incorporate it with a sucky offy thing
 Sure, but if you've already got the space shuttle one that goes on your Hoover to our English listeners
 The philatator is a real thing in the space shuttle, right?
 What do you mean Destro you've lost
 I
 Tried to tell you Cobra commander someone came in the middle of the night and stole the philatator
 Snake eyes
 It could have been I doubt it though. He's a ninja. He doesn't have a need for a philatator
 It was probably no. No, it was it was me. Actually. I I definitely had that need for the philatator
 That's that's it's me. Oh snake eyes. I got it. It's fine. Now you talk now. I do. Yes
 This is this is the reason I haven't talked up until now is this is what I sound you were blocked up. I see, okay
 Yeah, I'm just a little stopped up. I am so glad that we could help you out. Mr. Snake eyes
 Thank you. Thank you. Oh
 Cobra commander you are an ignorant poppin. J
 What you heard me?
 However, my what still stands you my one is not because the words themselves
 You ignorant poppin J
 That was popular TV writers didn't have the internet so they had a that was back when every TV writer was still 70
 That's what's going on and and had a thesaurus. Yes
 Yep, the source from 1962
 Yeah, I believe it means like someone just obsessed with their appearance and very preening and prissy
 That's what a poppin J is. Well, thank you. I appreciate that Paul. Yep night biscuits of the philatator says scooper Nova girl
 I think you have a philatator on the night biscuits. Oh
 Yeah to lady 80 are on the night biscuits not too it's not too late
 It's not too late to get your scoop costume to get there to be a urinal sprung boar head
 If somebody comes to the fucking costume ball as a urinal with a boar head on it
 my fucking shit, I
 mean
 That's a contender right there. I've had a few scoops write me to be like, hey, is anyone ever dressed like this?
 And I'm just laughing. I'm like, nope
 We got some wild shit coming this time it's been a pretty it's been a pretty rich meaty vein of
 ridiculous characters
 I
 I'm dressing up. This is the fart that Jacob described. That's what I'm dressing
 I will vomit on you. I
 Will just vomit on you. I think I need to be the Borg head urinal equip
 That's crazy. I don't know
 All right, Jacob do you have a scoop mail? Yeah, we do let's do some scoop mail
 Message for you
 We got a scoop mail from monod knock scoop in episode 1240 Paul talked about anime and manga and
 Referenced go which he claimed is what we would call Othello
 Go is not Othello
 Othello and reverse II are similar but go is completely different go is said to have been created at least two
 Hundred years ago and we have evidence of it from around 500 BC
 Reverse II was only invented in 1883 and Othello was in 1971
 I could go on but I'll just stop here and say that Paul was wrong on this one. That's what not not scoop
 I was close. You can look it up. It's close. I
 Agree Paul that you were close. I won't take the I won't take the full L
 Thank you rain. We're in chance that you were for me in the comment. You were really edging on that one. No, it's not that far off
 It's not I mean, there's a I think there's a difference in size of the board and that kind of thing
 But it's not right size of the board. Yeah. Yeah
 Motion of the ocean and whatnot. Oh, no ranch has not sticking up for me. No, it's not
 You walk alone I
 Do walk I walk alone full journey walk alone into the urinal with the Borg head on it
 Paul just took a full journey there
 Me I don't have people supporting. I have no one no one in my corner on this one
 But it's better because I'm alone with my Borg head. So that's what we got one for mom and a scoop
 It finally happened. Oh, it has been a few years of trying to obelisk my fiance
 But it was Paul's hot dog story in
 1241 which did the trip. I did it. Yes
 conversion hey, hey
 My hubby my hubby to be looked right at me straight-faced and said if you can
 Microwave it then that's what I'll do. I
 Naively thought about listening to the podcast together was the new part of our love story
 But now I only see it as grounds for canceling the wedding
 My future ex-husband then told me that during his bachelor days
 He would microwave three hot dogs and eat them with bread as a special treat
 His favorite though was to microwave the raw
 Crumbed chicken patties and then put them in between two pieces of buttered white
 home brand bread the super cheap stuff and
 Would put some shredded lettuce in if he was feeling fancy
 Now now I can recreate that fart for Jacob I
 Would like to add here that this time he was having his
 Delicacy he was making very good money. So this was a choice. Yes
 It's a choice. It's a great choice before wrapping the hot dog
 You would dip the bread in the Lord and let it absorb it like a fun. Oh
 I am 150% on this guy's side. I
 Read this out to the visionary chef to make sure that he was
 Comfortable with me sharing this and he wanted me to add that if he was feeling ultra fancy
 He would add in some shredded cheese some pre shredded cheese specifically when question about the kind of cheese
 He said I don't know the cheapest one
 Fuck you all in the faces, but only after I've heavily disinfected it. That's the ominous scoop. Boom ominous scoop
 I'm so happy for you. You have found a keeper
 This man knows what's up on the culinary tip for real for real
 Oh, I like that. That's fantastic. I love me a breaded chicken patty
 To this date to this day Mike, but a microwave of course
 No, I don't want crisp I want I want it to be rubbery
 You are a monster, no, I'm not I just was raised on garbage food
 Climbing you guys gonna have a microwave built into the right by the right by the thigh that new recliner
 I'm gonna hook up into the Bluetooth. It's gonna go get out of the chair you chicken brisket filled bitch
 You if you bring one more hot dog to this chair, I'm gonna come alive and eat you
 No, I'm not gonna use that chair very often
 Dedicated games and twitch says that they don't care if they're not married yet. It's time for a divorce
 I agree. No, I agree. You have found the one
 You have found the one that's it now. I had three microwave hot dogs for lunch today. I'll have you know, what that's what I had
 Chaotic don't sometimes the universe sends you signs before you marry a person and this scoop has smashed their face on this sign and
 Still didn't notice it. Let me tell you. Yeah. Yeah. No the signs. They're the right signs
 The signs are go move forward and enjoy
 That's not a science
 Versus right now. I microwave three hot dogs today and
 The one in the center was the only one that still retained its hot dog essence the other two
 Became very much
 You know
 Burn unit victims, but but there was still fine. So fine. Well, how long do you microwave a hot dog for?
 I usually go for about 45 seconds per dog. I'm a minute a minute for two and
 It was three. So I went 130
 Okay, it was a little too long
 But and you say the the side ones the two on the outside on the outside
 They came a little well done. They came in a little hot at the center one was pretty much perfect
 So your microwave three hot dogs you had one that was better than the other two, but you still ate all three
 Do you own a toaster oven?
 don't
 Okay
 patreon.com/a scoops
 Honestly, the problem is we don't have any space in our fucking kitchen our kitchen is so small. It's like a Nats
 It's like a Nats ass so it is so small
 It's so small that when I'm in it and can't be in it and vice versa and we often get angry at each other if we're
 Both trying to be in the kitchen at the same time
 It's so small if you have one of the utensil drawers open you can't open the refrigerator
 That's the fucking truth one more one more. It's so small that it's so small that
 If it's a cold night, you can just go ahead and turn on the oven and that's gonna heat the whole kitchen
 Not a joke just a fact, you know, what happens is the same company that makes that recliner it makes refrigerators
 So when you only need four inches from the wall and the whole fridge is true lay out on the bottom for you
 You could recline on the refrigerator
 My kitchen is so small that Bilbo Baggins was like the fuck am I supposed to do to cook in here?
 My kitchen is so small that a Smurf came up in that bitch and was like this some fucking bullshit
 I need room. I
 Mean I really don't know I'm back to the I'm back to the chicken patty
 I'm back to the breaded chicken patty. What what's the problem with the breaded chicken patty getting microwaved?
 It's just gonna be mushy. It's gonna be it's gonna have a little mush to it
 But the trick is you do it half and half
 Do it you flip it half and half you do it with 30 and you flip it for 30 flip it and then it's okay
 But it's not gonna be crispy or anything
 Well, if you do that, it's still gonna be mushy if you do it one side full-on. It's gonna be runny
 Do one side full-on, okay, but if you do that, you'll be all right. Yeah. Yeah. I
 Grew up on that shit, man. That was the I have not seen a single person in either chat defend
 Microwave chicken patties. Look, I'm not looking for defenders
 I'm just looking for like-minded individuals who are into freedom and taste
 You have another ranch and just points out the oven yeah
 Winter scoop winter scoop defends you quiet winter scoop. Thank you. I'll tell you the oven like I said, it's a it's a damn
 Gas oven so it takes forever in a day to heat up and then once it's hot it's hot and our house
 It just heats up the upstairs really bad on a hot day. Yeah, so it's not something we want to use
 Wrap the hot dog in a paper towel. What are you talking about ranch slunk?
 You're gonna get all kind of fibers in it
 Yeah, that's the problem. That's
 That's my bits of paper towel my concern is bits of paper towel
 I know what kind of paper towels you buy that are just disintegrating in microwaves. I'm gonna get you a brulee target brand
 That's what I get you for your birthday Paul. What are you gonna get a brulee torch?
 So I could just like brulee my my hot dogs over the torch a hot dog over the sink
 you just put it on a stick and just
 You know what? I would actually really love but I I think it would just I know it would go on it would end my marriage I
 Would love to have a 7-eleven roller
 So I just life any time like that that has respect for the the cooking the outside in
 But nature of how how but can you imagine designed for but it would end my marriage?
 The house would always smell of hot dog
 No, I don't know what in your marriage ball or the yeah, the glass dome will do it. That'll keep it the smell contained
 But but also I now see I'm sitting here thinking of mine nook
 I can get those planner you can't get a hot dog. I could get those I think
 Time Paul, this is this is the time in in a married couples life
 We're one of the one of the couple wants a thing and this is your opportunity to be like look
 I have always hated reading nooks, but I'm letting you have a reading no
 You have always hated 7-eleven hot dog rollers
 But you could let me have my 7-eleven hot dog roller honestly little of the living room in the house honestly
 I'm the one who would not like the 7-eleven hot dog roller in the house because it would be too much of a headache to clean
 Up. I'm gonna get you one of those
 Trask areas all those beat skewers spears for outside. Yeah, the giant meat rack for outside
 Oh god, I want to track any animals at all
 And Teddy Teddy is on rabbit number five this season
 He ate a bird the other day
 It just doesn't end with that guy and heaven forbid. I have hot dog rollers going out there
 The animal kingdom would come for me at some point
 That's not like I like the idea of you outside defending your meat skewers
 Like a night like a gladiator there is no defending those meat skewers
 And you're not supposed to clean the hot dog rollers it ruins the flavor says Scoob Jesus
 I think you're probably right now. I don't I don't want anything to do with that device
 Honestly, yeah, cuz you just want to keep on
 Microwaving your hot dogs. The reason I microwave is for ease and
 Convenience the hot dog roller is not easy or convenient
 Listen unless I go to the convenience store where someone else's trick is getting your own bacho cheese
 I
 Is I know you don't have room for toaster oven, but I'm just saying in the event that maybe you you find one
 Okay, we used to have one at the old place finishing a microwaved item in the toaster
 Gets back the crisp. Yeah. Yeah, if that's if that's what you're looking for
 You have to be looking for that Paul
 Paul I need you to look for that
 As a friend as a friend no, thanks
 Come to scoop fest. It'll be at the end of September
 Come watch Matt and Paul finally settle this grudge match style
 We're gonna have a taste test contest of chicken patties. We both have five minutes to cook it. Oh
 I got you licked man
 Done in 250. I I get things done just as bad. I cook for children all the time
 Okay, so I can cook for you because I cook for my kids. You do the air fryer thing
 Yeah, exactly. I have an air fryer air fryer solid and we used to have an air fryer, too
 Yeah, yeah air fryer. She took a lot of room. It's an awkward. That's true. That's the only that's it, man
 We got a spot for our dishes. I wash the dishes in the sink. Ah
 Do you have
 ambitious
 My brother my brother. Could you do a top mounted toaster oven hanging hanging right below a cabinet?
 No, we have that with the microwave. It's about it's above the oven already and there's no there's no other space
 You don't have any other can you in the kitchen because you're not turning on the oven
 Could you put the toaster oven in the case you put it inside the oven?
 Listen think my it'd be so well insulated. I think I've told you guys
 Just yeah, just let it melt into the oven that'd be fine
 You never turn it on that oven let's just call that a loss
 No, we use the oven
 Okay, ah and we we the royals we uses the oven. I use the oven
 To hold things. No, I use it to cook
 Fair enough
 We forgot about the frozen pizza. Oh, I you know what I did. You know what I did. This is my this is on me
 I take full responsibility on this one
 that makes one I
 got a
 fresh
 Pizza from Walmart the other day
 Okay, not throw
 Okay, so they they they put it like like Papa Murphy's they prepare a
 A pizza doughed thing that you just buy and put in the oven put in the oven for a few less minutes and good to go
 Right. It was so nasty
 Whole thing the Walmart ready to bake pizza. Yep was not the best pizza you've had I
 Didn't say it was not the best pizza. I had it might have been one of the worst pizzas
 I've ever had like this podcast. We have a history of very terrible pizza. Are you sure that's right?
 It really reminded me of that trunk pizza vibe
 Especially especially with the the herbs whatever herbs they put on that shit. I heard herbs, you know
 Aromatics, you know, they're covering up. They're covering up bullshit is what's going on. Yeah, Paul likes the aromatics of a nice sausage
 I like the aromatics of Chuckie fucking cheese pizza. Like I don't give a damn. Give me cheese plain simple
 Yeah, he says over he says this podcast in quotes you Matt. It was you, right?
 But if Paul can say we use the oven then I can say this podcast
 I use the oven for french fries. I make french fries in there sometimes. Oh
 Do you have
 Stone or pizza or like one of those special pans? No. Oh, I have a guess I go right on the rack
 Haven't got some Paul has a pizza stone. This is not look. I'm not a Walmart defender
 But the pizza stone makes a difference
 Definitely you can get this pans. Do you put it on top of it?
 No, what happens is so that so that you get because the truth is if you're to make pizza at home
 They say the key is to just bake the dough first and then add the pizza toppings in the second phase and put it back
 In the oven, right?
 Interesting you get that that gives you the best pizza crust quality for an at-home pizza
 But if you're talking to make your own crust, no, no, I'm saying I'm just letting you know the logic here
 I'm asking how do I get this crust that is separate from ingredients that I then cook first
 You can buy like a pizza dough. You can buy like a like a like a Bertolli that's already cooked up
 No, no, no, no, not one of those like like a canned pizza dough a
 Canned pizza dough or like a but like I could preformed but a raw pizza dough raw pizza dough
 Yeah, you need to be raw. It can't be the pre the pre-cooked Bertolli or however you say that one. All right
 And then at home if some people want to make their own pizza dough, which you're not gonna do
 But we don't have to worry about that
 But then you you you you basically do around where you cook in the oven on its own as if it's a loaf of bread
 Like a fright of a bread you just bake it and then you go ahead and add and add it before it's fully
 With you you add your okay. I'll just put it back in and that's what gives you the best
 Pizza now to circumvent that there's this pan
 That has like almost like a screen on top of it's like a metal on the bottom and like a metal screen on the top
 it's like a two layered pan and
 You can buy that and you put that pizza that you bought
 On there and that screen allows the oven to cook the bottom of the pizza crust really well
 While you I could show it to you, but it doesn't help our list. Well, I mean I put it right on the rack
 I don't I don't put anything in between it. We should
 Okay, you should all right cool
 Just think about it. Yeah. Yeah, no the pizzas the pizza stone just helps like it distributes the heat and all like no
 I'm sure I'm sure it's better. I'm sure it's better. But honestly, it was just
 The toppings it was a pepperoni pie and it was just not good
 Yeah, I mean I'm definitely like clocking out I'm done defending Walmart pizza right now you
 Know that maybe was an upset that could help you but I'm also fine with you calling it a loss for the rest. Yeah, I'm yeah, I'm out
 I'm out. I'm out. I'm gone. I'm gone
 Yeah. All right. There's a pizza buddy. I see. Okay pizza dough. All right. Okay got it
 Sorry, I'm sending an email here
 Oh
 Hot dogs and microwaves. Yeah
 Hello Jim Cruz and scoop here from Delaware. I feel the need to apologize
 publicly to Matt Donnelly for wreaking havoc by passing along rumors that
 Spellbound on Princess Cruises was shutting down as it turns out princess is simply revamping the experience
 So is not to include dinner and will now be a cocktail speakeasy experience with a magic headliner act Matt
 Matt, do you know anything about this or do you know anything about the apology?
 I brought this up on Africa babble and not here
 But Chris is a listener of both and he wrote me saying I don't know what the hell this is about and I panicked and wrote
 My agent being like hey
 Fuck and spread my availability out if this is gonna fuck up my dates that I have in princess
 Like let's look around and my agent basically wrote me back being like
 Chill out chill
 Like no when they say they're revamping it's the experience of September it's because they're revamping the experience of September
 Everything's fine, buddy
 Everything's fine. Andy cheek just put a picture in the chat Paul the pan I'm talking about. Oh, okay. Oh, I see now
 Okay, cool. All right. I'll look about getting one of those
 Yeah, my wife and I will be on board the brand new star princess on February the 14th
 2025 this is I guess from the past
 And I will be checking out the spellbound venue that if any scoops would want to go with us, but there's all the stuff
 Yeah, oh, they have a web. They have a website though. We've talked about this before go with Lisa
 Comm my wife owns the travel agency and as a bonus for any scoops
 We will happily provide you with some onboard credit to defray a pretty potentially our right cover
 The cost of checking out spellbound as a consolation to the boys
 I humbly offer you a price is scryte that I created three years ago and never made it to air
 I'm excited to hear the questions since I have no idea what they are cruise and scoop. That's aka Chris
 So just real quick over here. Just just to people if people want to go through that website, I'll be on the brilliant lady

 707 yes, I'm saying say it's it's gotta be a hundred seven. Wow, uh
 a
 Kenksha. Yeah, they killed Ming to age. It says winter scoop. Of course they did. This is the life we live
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, I do remember that I vaguely remember that god damn it. This is oh
 stupid shit
 It's okay Paul. No, it's not it is. No, I'm sad. I know but it's still okay. No

 What he told me in u.s. Dollars of a Taylor ham sandwich from Tierney's Tavern in Montclair
 New Jersey menu accessed on July 18th 2022. Oh Matt
 This is way up from when you were a young lad servant. Oh inflation inflation. Yeah
 Yeah, I should on salted weird pork product that you slide. I have deli meat
 On a cooking show the other day they were making a
 Taylor ham sandwich, they were doing a good Jersey bit making a Taylor ham sandwich. Yeah. Oh my god
 It looked horrible and I still wanted it
 It looked salty on as they were slicing it and putting it in the pan it looked salty somehow
 These are all designed to get people to drink right everything served in these certainly. Yeah, certainly
 I mean, I think it was designed to survive the Great Depression as well. Well that too. Well, yeah. Well, it's coming back, baby. Let's go
 Let's go
 Let's see. So I think the price is
 This is Tierney's in 2022. I think the price is six dollars and 38 cents
 Paul
 Jersey money doesn't go as far
 That is true
 And plus not compared to the metropolis of
 Pittsburgh they're not gonna have a lot of change on the in this cuz it gets thrown at him
 Overgoes guessing 1399. What do you get like a party sub?
 I'm gonna go
 Five eighty six
 five eighty six
 I was going to say six dollars, but then you guys are right in that range
 Well, but there's there's room. There's you can squeeze right in there. It's dollars. Yep. Yeah
 Here's the things we really get a Taylor ham sandwich
 He's gonna tell her him and cheese sandwich, but he's this Taylor ham sandwich, which means you ah, you'd add whatever
 50 cents for cheese
 Don't remember those days when it was just 50 cents for added cheese
 Here's the really hard part attorneys we just charged whatever we never got corrected and so
 It was like once a year I'd look at the menu bag. Oh really
 Possible that Matt has never known what this cost
 the Taylor Swift ham sandwich it speeds right through you
 I'll split the difference. I'll go six bucks six bucks
 Matt was exactly right look at you Matt and you know what? That's how it should have been
 That's that's how that question the man the man worked there. He should get it exactly right
 That's I'm actually impressed that Paul and I were as close as we were well
 You know what though? I should have trusted my gut and I should have said six because I was right
 They don't want to put any change in it cuz they don't want to get that fucking shit
 What change thrown at him they got to make everything even dollars
 Yeah, just doing it for their own safety. Yeah, I mean they could still get pelted by some sack of joe is but ain't nobody
 don't knows

 Norma this time we thank people who support support our patreon this podcast will be possible without patreon support
 absolutely among the numerous benefits as you get notifications and links for our
 Live episode recordings that we're doing on twitch as we hunt for a new churn. I was missing the churn
 yesterday, I was feeling like you know, just
 It kind of set my week where I would I do miss the churn driving to the churn and going home
 Kind of yeah, help me really keep like a mental calendar in my head. Yeah of like what's going on Paul
 You moved to Pittsburgh. You can't meh me you know, I said I said no I said yeah, I was agree
 I was a yeah, not a man. Yeah
 No, I was nodding my head. Yes, uh, let the record show I agree I
 Know I'm ending the record to a decide that Paul was nodding his head
 Thank you. No, I got down here to my little uh, my little mini churn and it's very
 It's very reminiscent of the churn honestly with all the tchotchkes that I have around here, right? Oh, yeah everywhere
 You look there's there's stuff scattered everywhere. So it I've recreated the churn to the best of my ability
 Yeah, that's what I need. I need a better physical churn space, but we don't have any so that'll be well
 You've got two kids that makes it hard. That's it. That's it. And the answer is move out
 But I could do it very easily, but then that means my life is sad
 No life's gonna be so much fun when the kids are gone and this is all you have left in your life
 All right, Matt. We're gonna do a test right now. Yeah, and everybody at home with kids
 You can play along with this test. I want you to think right now
 It's right if you have young young children that still live with you. You can play along with this test Matt
 I want you to think about these two scenarios
 The first scenario is the one that you just mentioned your children have left home. They have they have gone
 They have spread their wings. They no longer live with you now, then here's a second scenario
 They're both 34 years old and still live with you
 I bet I bet it'd be one of those really like delightful like dysfunctional parents for like I don't want to talk about it
 Like like other parents are back your kids still at home, and I think
 I think you're gonna be okay cuz I think that's gonna happen to a lot more people as time goes forward here
 I do the show
 Said I said we do for living. She goes arm retired. I said, oh
 Millennials put your fingers in your ears. Don't listen
 No, and so yeah anyhow we get all that because people find it find the time to head on over to preaching fun comm

 And of course, you know, we converted our
 Our our scoop fest to robe time, right our scoop fest. Yeah, it's a robe time

 Kudos to Matt and Jacob for all the legwork
 Always, you know, no, seriously, it really does. I really do appreciate it Jacob. Yes, let's go
 I really do appreciate all that you guys are doing out there in the location
 I've done little bits here and there nothing like what you guys are getting done. So I really really appreciate it
 But it's gonna be magic for you. I reach out to perform for the variety show. Yeah
 Some we haven't noticed that I'm just like there's some of we've we have you and I have brought up Paul that we've forgotten to
 Include in the past. I was like, I'm not gonna forget this year wrote it down wrote the person saying do you want to do?

 That's totally fine. Yeah, that's totally fine. Now. I will I would are coming to see Chris angel perform
 He won't be performing who will not I I would argue but you're gonna tell me that he invented scoop fest before we did
 hilarious
 Clearly, which is true. Whoever this is and I'm not clear on that, but whoever this is
 Is not aware of the community and is not aware of what scoop fest really is
 Well, that's that's I've made this mistake before with reaching out to people who I thought I was closer to than I was and then
 Understanding our podcast and going like what?
 No, thank you. Right, right, right. Oh, I'm sorry. You don't understand the you don't know what's going on
 I don't know what this is gonna be no one has ever no one has ever regretted doing scoop
 No, I was gonna say to to a to a man everyone that has performed and come to our our spot has been
 Gracious and not only have people never regretted doing scoop fest
 performing at scoop fest they they have people have come to me after scoop fest is over with people who were set to perform and
 Yeah, like they didn't get to perform for whatever reason and then they have been mad for years
