9
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,120
 Hey, Johnny. Do you want to go to an Ice Cream Social?

10
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,120
 Yeah, I'd love to. Great. Let's go.

11
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:10,160
 A man was arrested in New Jersey recently. Here come the Hawks. Get your tickets today,

14
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:29,800
 For a road rage where he shot a woman in the face. She's fine, but he shot her in the face.

15
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,860
 He's fine. Yep. It's time for Matt Maddly's Ice Cream

16
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,340
 Social. Sitting over there with a confused look on his face. That's Paul Maddly. Sitting

17
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,760
 over there with an understanding look on his face. That's Matt Maddly. We're PreachingFun.

18
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:51,700
 I just saw this. Apparently, he's a Sopranos guy, a couple of others.

19
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:58,920
 He's a bit actor. His role on The Sopranos, his character name on The Sopranos was Thief.

20
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:07,940
 Oh. Yeah, yeah. He's a Sopranos actor the same way that the guy who walked in the back

21
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:15,080
 of the scene is a Sopranos actor. Right, but to say she got shot in the face

22
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:23,600
 and is okay, that's not right either. It apparently grazed her nose. It hit her in the nose, but

23
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:30,120
 it went across her nose. So she went to the hospital and everything, but she was not in

24
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,640
 any full recovery. I believe so. I don't believe there was any life threatening injury.

25
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:42,620
 It was a flesh wound, as they say. Yeah, but he is facing 31 counts in connection

26
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:49,140
 with the violent rampage, including first degree attempted murder and aggravated assault

27
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:56,280
 with a deadly weapon. Apparently, they were both trying to get into the same lane at the

28
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,080
 same time. She absolutely had the right of way. Yeah, right.

29
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:09,740
 She got just enraged and shot a gun out of the window of his car, which just goes to

30
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:18,440
 show you how advanced Matt Donnelly is for a New Jersey driver. Man, just calm, mellow.

31
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,320
 The amount of people that'd be surprised if my death or someone else's death involved

32
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:29,560
 my road rage would be zero people, zero. It would be sad, just not surprised.

33
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:35,040
 Not surprised. I'd say it's the one benefit probably, I don't know if it's even a benefit

34
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,480
 of the surveillance state that we live in, is that they're going to have plenty of footage

35
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:47,640
 of this from the cameras everywhere. I got into an Uber the other day and the Uber driver

36
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:56,560
 pointed out the inside and outside cameras to me as I got in and he definitely was doing

37
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,240
 it in a way to be like, "I've had trouble in here before. Here are the cameras. Please

38
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:08,760
 don't be an asshole." I'm a Las Vegas local. I'm just going to my house. He was like, "Oh,

39
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,640
 thank God." Please ignore the hair. Oh boy, what a hassle.

40
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:21,120
 Well, I'll pile on the bad, sad. I don't know if you guys heard about this. Noted YouTube

41
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,800
 vlogger Adam the Woo passed away. Oh goodness. I did not. What was he known for?

42
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,600
 He was known for Disney parks reviews and haunted attraction reviews. He did a daily

43
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,600
 blog, daily vlog. He was good friends with a lot of other creators that I'm interested

44
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,760
 in like Jacob the Carpet Bagger and a couple other people. He went to all kinds of theme

45
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:51,680
 parks and stuff. He even did Paris Disney recently. He was very prolific with his work

46
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,880
 and just apparently natural causes, almost exact same age as me, bit the dust. Really

47
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:08,120
 a heartbreaker. Yeah, everybody's really sad about it. It's one of those deaths that makes

48
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:16,220
 me look at it. You look at the breadth of his creative output and you look at the reactions

49
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:21,840
 from the creator community as well as the fans and you see a person who lived their

50
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:28,440
 life well. You see nice results from their life.

51
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:35,120
 Negative thing to be said. Yeah. If anything, lots of positive things. Fan interactions,

52
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,600
 people. He treated everyone very kindly, remembered people. He would go to many of these fan events

53
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,040
 over and over again, these horror nights and horror conventions. He would see people who

54
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,360
 go to the horror convention regularly and he could recognize them in costume and stuff

55
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:59,800
 like that. Seems to have been a general all around good guy.

56
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,420
 Good news though, Paul. I've looked him up here. He's actually going to be now haunting

57
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:10,080
 the Disney parks so people will be able to do his style of show now about him. It's the

58
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,440
 circle of life. There you go. Well, they are suggesting that

59
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,600
 he be buried or at least have the funeral ceremony somewhere near the Disney parks.

60
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:25,800
 That was his favoritest thing. Who knows? Disney don't get into that shit. Disney is

61
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,680
 like, if you want to do that somewhere on private property and say that it's close to

62
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,020
 our place, that's fine. If you want to do that shit on our property, you can go fuck

63
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,760
 yourself. You know how many times they've had to clean

64
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,120
 up human remains out of the haunted mansion. Oh yeah. I think that's the entire reason

65
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,260
 that they don't want to fuck with any of it. Bring their cremated loved ones and dump

66
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:51,300
 them in the dune buggies. Please don't do that. It's the public service announcement

67
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,160
 for the 19 year old that has to clean up your loved one's remains. Please don't dump their

68
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,920
 ashes on the haunted mansion ride. It's a ride.

69
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:06,400
 We are advocates of the Throshen option. Throshen is the best.

70
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,540
 Throshen is out there. It's the most environmentally clean option

71
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,120
 if you're not a fish. People keep suggesting that Throshen be the best option for the current

72
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:21,200
 resident of the White House as otherwise talk about clean up services being required.

73
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:28,920
 No, I'm sure it's all fine. Well, regardless, yeah, just tragic. You know,

74
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:36,840
 the other side too, when I would go to Kings Island as a kid, this was still rural Ohio

75
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,680
 back in the day. It's been somewhat more developed as it goes along, but it was still country-ish.

76
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:49,040
 Yeah. And there was a tiny graveyard just outside

77
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,920
 of Kings Island. As you were walking towards the front gates and even in the parking area,

78
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,880
 you could see a small graveyard. These were the people that died on the beast.

79
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,600
 I don't know who exactly, I should look it up. It's a known thing. It's a bunch of gravestones

80
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,840
 and grave markers right outside of Kings Island. Okay.

81
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:14,940
 And I always thought what a great place to be buried because I loved Kings Island so

82
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:20,400
 much as a kid. And even as we know, Annie is a listener of the podcast. So take some

83
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:27,360
 notes here. Maybe it's a little arrogant to assume that

84
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,800
 Annie will outlive you, but I don't know if it's very arrogant to assume Annie will outlive

85
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,000
 you. I would just have to, oh no, Anne's already

86
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,200
 got us grave plots secured. Did she have one for both of you or just

87
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,960
 you? No, two of us.

88
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,420
 She's not going to bury you at Kings Island then?

89
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,760
 She's not going to bury me at Kings Island, but I've told her I don't want to burial.

90
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,720
 I'm going to get cremated and then whatever. I don't know why I was calling her Annie.

91
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,520
 I was calling her Annie because we're reading on an email from our Annie.

92
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,520
 We're thinking about Annie. Yeah.

93
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,920
 Anne, I think Anne should take note that you want to be buried at Kings Island.

94
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,160
 She knows. The cemetery outside of Kings Island, known

95
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,160
 as the Dog Street Cemetery, is a historic but forgotten burial ground.

96
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,080
 Not forgotten. We're talking about it right now.

97
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:16,040
 Well, the people who are in it. No, people don't know I guess the people who are in it.

98
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,920
 I think it's the dead people who have been forgotten about that.

99
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,640
 Oh, got it. Got it. Got it.

100
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,840
 So are the graves unmarked in that way, at least?

101
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,320
 They're marked, but they're marked with things like Missouri Jane.

102
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,200
 Ah, okay. Yeah. And it still sits quietly within the

103
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,600
 park's property near the main entrance. Yep.

104
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,520
 Yeah. No, you'd walk by it every time. Oh, and apparently it was, the cemetery itself

105
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,640
 was forgotten about and was rediscovered in the 1890s.

106
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,440
 Okay. Yeah. Yeah, you can't miss it.

107
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,840
 They found an overgrown cemetery that had been reclaimed by the woods and everything

108
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,480
 in the 1890s. Yeah, you can't miss it when you're going

109
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,320
 into Kings Island. It's kind of a nice little memento mori, you know, it's like, because

110
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,480
 not everybody survives the bat. Not everybody makes it off Top Gun.

111
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,000
 Yeah. Lindsay and Chad says, go ahead and dump me in the Haunted Mansion. Don't cremate

112
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,960
 me. Just weekend at Bernie's meet through the park.

113
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,240
 Just remains, not cremated remains, just remains.

114
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,280
 What would be the legality and what would be? It's not. It's not legal.

115
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,640
 No, but hear me out now. Hear me out. I believe it falls under an illegal dumping

116
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,120
 statute. No, okay. Yeah. I'm not talking Disney anymore.

117
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:38,040
 Let's get away from the Disney affiliation. How much would it take? What kind of legal

118
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,840
 red tape, given that we are in the Wild West again, as far as if you've got the money,

119
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,320
 you can do the thing. This has probably been done. Now that I'm saying it, this has probably

120
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:54,240
 been done, but you could have people who are horror fans volunteer to have their corpse

121
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:02,640
 is utilized in a haunted attraction and you just go through on a little scooter and see

122
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,320
 rotting dead people, maybe put some animatronics in them, maybe make them jiggle around a little

123
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,320
 bit. This next body is actually Zach Baggins. He

124
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:17,160
 founded this museum back in the 2000s. Right. I mean, if Scoop Jesus is talking about how

125
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,360
 bad it would stink. Yes, Scoop Jesus. Yes, it would stink.

126
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,280
 If Epstein was as enthusiastic about haunted houses as he was about child rape, then it

127
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,720
 would have already happened. It would have already been happening. It would have been

128
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,240
 already a feature of his island. To be fair, we don't know for sure that it's

129
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,120
 not unless... Oh, Matt, have you been to the island, Matt? Are you at the island right

130
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,200
 now? I'm glad we're recording on a Tuesday because

131
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,680
 you do not want to record with me on Thursday. I'll tell you that much right now. And those

132
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:51,760
 files come out. Just one very small haunted hole on Jeffrey Island.

133
00:11:51,760 --> 00:12:01,440
 Just a small haunted hole. He calls it his boo cave. He does. Don't go to the boo cave.

134
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,240
 That's worse than the tickle house, y'all. Stay the fuck out of the boo cave on Epstein

135
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,560
 Island. The haunted hole.

136
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,680
 I figured out how to get Trump's name off of the Kennedy Center. Have I told you about

137
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:17,840
 this? Oh, no. How you do it? All you have to do is show up with an even larger Donald

138
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,520
 J. Trump sign. And so when you go to take the one off, they'll go, "Hey, you're not

139
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,720
 supposed to take that off." You go, "No, no, no. The president said his name wasn't big

140
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,640
 enough." And then that'll allow you to get it off because everyone will believe you that

141
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
 he wants a bigger name. Oh, that is true.

142
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,640
 Yeah. Yeah. That's true.

143
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,880
 So just do it that way. If Vandals showed up with a giant Donald J. Trump sign, I mean,

144
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,680
 no, no, we're going to put this one on after we take this one off.

145
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,400
 That's it. And then you're going to clear. Everybody would leave you alone. Yeah. This

146
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,280
 is the ultimate wearing blacks and carrying a ladder.

147
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,960
 See you tomorrow. Yeah. Right. And then boom. I look forward to seeing this new, enormous

148
00:12:52,960 --> 00:13:01,960
 Donald Trump sign tomorrow when I do my rounds. Oh, that security guard is going to be embarrassed.

149
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,680
 But he'll say, "They said they're going to put a bigger sign up." And everybody's like,

150
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,360
 "Oh, makes sense, Terry. So sorry, buddy." Oh, I would have fallen for it too, Terry.

151
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,160
 That would have gotten me. That really sucks. And they were in like coveralls. Oh, yeah,

152
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,680
 yeah. No, they were wearing coveralls. In hindsight, they definitely got those at Walmart.

153
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:28,920
 But they were, they looked really official. They had a wagon, a big wagon, a ladder.

154
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:39,640
 He said he was a big fan of that Kirk guy. I figured that he was okay. What was it? Our

155
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:45,200
 friend, Miss Zula pointed out that the Arizona Cardinals haven't won a game there since they

156
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:51,480
 did the Charlie Kirk Memorial. Yeah. That's, I mean, they've won away games, but not games.

157
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,320
 It's a unique way to look at it. The Cardinals aren't very good at football. So it's not

158
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:03,440
 the hardest thing to, you know, stretch the truth on. That's it. Yeah. Jacob. Yes, Paul.

159
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:13,600
 I saw that you had an actual vacation. I mean, in the sense that we went places out of town,

160
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,520
 it was a vacation. Oh, heavens, what happened? In the sense that it was relaxing in any way

161
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:29,160
 at all. It was not. Oh no. It wasn't bad. It was just so fast paced. We went down south.

162
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:34,200
 We went all over the place. We flew into Austin, Texas. There was your first mistake. Yeah,

163
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,760
 exactly. Saw some of SJ's family outside of Austin, went further east in Texas and saw

164
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,680
 some more of her family and then drove to Louisiana and saw some of my family. And then

165
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,800
 we flew out of Jackson, Mississippi. So we did Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Oh,

166
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,400
 goodness sakes. That's a lot. And I think we did it in four nights, five days. No, no,

167
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:00,480
 no. That's okay. So, but we saw the whole family. We had Christmas every day in a new

168
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,120
 location with the kids and the family members in that location. So it was really nice. It

169
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:14,920
 was a really nice trip. We were just fucking exhausted. Yeah. And one of the more embarrassing

170
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:21,240
 things that I've had to do happened on the flight back as well. Oh no. And that was situational

171
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,520
 awareness territory. No, no, no, no. Thank goodness. That is not where I'm going. All

172
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:36,920
 of my pants are fine. All of my clothing is not in the garbage. So we had a layover in

173
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:42,160
 Nashville and the Nashville airport. If you've never been through that Nashville airport,

174
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,240
 it's really cool. They have a bunch of live music stations set up all over the place.

175
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,800
 Like in the gates and everything, they'll just have little stages ready for somebody

176
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,440
 with a guitar to sit there and sing some stuff into the microphone there. It's really nice.

177
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:04,040
 And so we were hanging out. They have an Ole Red, an Ole Red in the Nashville airport there.

178
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,540
 So we said, Oh, we'll go get some dinner in Ole Red. We'll sit there and we'll listen

179
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:14,120
 to some music before we get on the flight back to old hometown Vegas. And so we're sitting

180
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,960
 there at the bar in the restaurant and we're listening to the live music. It's really good.

181
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,800
 We're talking to the bartender. Everybody's really nice. And this fella comes and sits

182
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,760
 down at the bar stool next to me. He asks if anybody's sitting there. I say, nope. And

183
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,480
 that is the extent of our interaction. I said, no, no, it's all you. I had a bag that was

184
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,320
 kind of in the way, so I moved from a bag. I said, no problem. You enjoy it. And then

185
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:43,360
 we sat there and we did not interact anymore for about an hour. And then he turned to me

186
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:55,200
 and goes, so you're a podcaster, huh? Yeah, I am. Yeah, that's right. And now I'm sitting

187
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,160
 there racking my brain. Did SJ and I say anything? Like have we been talking about the podcast?

188
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,880
 I don't think we have. I don't think we've mentioned anything about any of it. Turns

189
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,240
 out he thought I was a different podcaster and just asked me if I was a podcaster and

190
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,000
 I said, yes. And then he realized that he was talking about a different person entirely

191
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:20,400
 that he thought that I was. There's a couple of us now. He thought that I was a Theo Vaughn.

192
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:27,640
 Get the fuck out of here. I mean, I can see it. This man believed that I was a podcaster,

193
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:33,920
 Theo Vaughn. Hilarious. At which point I had to explain to him that I was not Theo Vaughn,

194
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,960
 just a different middle-aged white guy with a podcast. Right. Yeah. Did you give him a

195
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,480
 chip? Because that solves it all, Jacob. I didn't have a chip. I didn't have any bags

196
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:49,880
 with me, so I did not have a chip. But I believe that he is a new scoop now. We did chat. We

197
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,280
 had a real nice chat. I hope so. Well, I think he said his name was Dave. So shout out Dave

198
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,800
 from Old Red at the Nashville airport. I keep two chips in my wallet at all times as last

199
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:07,040
 minute. I don't carry a wallet. What the fuck is going on? I have like the little card holder

200
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,440
 that I keep in my front pocket, and that's it. I keep a little cash rolled up in it.

201
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,840
 Well, you wear jeans, right, with the little front lippity upper pocket? I do. I suppose

202
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,080
 I wear pants with a little lippity upper pocket. A chip fits perfectly in the lippity upper

203
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:28,760
 pocket. Two is great, too. So I would just suggest tuck one in between cheek and gum

204
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:36,320
 for emergency situations. Well, good. I hope we did get an obelisk off of that. I think

205
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:42,300
 I'm over the course of an hour. Obelished one person. Great. It's not an efficient system

206
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:47,760
 that we're not. We're not an efficient system. I'll tell you who else does not have a very

207
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,400
 efficient system that they run on. And somehow they also base their entire business model

208
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,720
 off of it as well. And that is the following sponsor. Today's show, man. Manley's ice cream

209
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:03,360
 social is brought to you by the wearable blanket, a blanket with sleeves so you can nap better

210
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:10,160
 on your couch. That's from Smitty Scoop in twenty twenty five. Hey, everybody, it's me,

211
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:16,160
 Captain Crunch. I'm here to advertise a wearable blanket. I don't know what I like. I like

212
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,560
 a blanket with sleeves. It lets me eat my cereal and warmth and contentment and keeps

213
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:27,400
 me away from the soggies. Those motherfuckers are always ruining my fucking cereal. God

214
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:33,840
 damn it. Eat my own asshole all the way, you soggy fucks. Now you can't get to me because

215
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:40,860
 I've got a wearable blanket on. And if I drop my milk on me, it doesn't matter. The soggies

216
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:46,320
 can't get me. You know, the horrible thing about my existence is I can't live without

217
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:53,080
 the soggies. I need my milk on my cereal, but I hate them and they try to destroy me

218
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,480
 and my product at every turn. But they're a necessary evil if I want to have my cereal

219
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:07,200
 eaten. Oh, boy. Look, catch twenty two. Fuck these bastards. I hate them all. I catch them

220
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:17,080
 on the open seas. It's on international waters. I got love to see on my side, bitches. And

221
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:24,880
 that was how Captain Crunch became a pirate. Look at me, soggies. I'm a captain now. That's

222
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:36,960
 Captain with an apostrophe in. SJ had a show at the Silverton the other day. We had a fun

223
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,720
 Taylor Swift show the other night. Oh, nice. And a big free show. They did it as part of

224
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:48,400
 the rodeo. And boy, was it fun watching all these little kids up there dancing around.

225
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:55,240
 It was so good. I was exhausted by the end of it. Just run around talking to people,

226
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,160
 just kind of socially exhausted by the end of it. Sure. Walk through Silverton. There

227
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:05,880
 was a Johnny Rockets. Oh, yeah. Motherfucker. Did you want a chocolate shake? That's exactly

228
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,920
 like Johnny Rockets. A Johnny Rockets shake. I'm gonna go get me a Johnny Rockets shake.

229
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:15,040
 I'll go up to the Johnny Rockets counter and say I would like one chocolate shake to go

230
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,880
 please because everybody else was going over to a restaurant to go meet up after. I said

231
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,020
 I'm gonna go. I'm gonna show up with a chocolate shake. I'm not eating anything. I'll have

232
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:31,640
 some beverages in my chocolate shake. This is gonna be great. And the guy at the counter

233
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:45,280
 told me how much the shake was. And he said it was $13.22. What? $13.22. Where was this?

234
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,960
 The Johnny Rockets. Yes. In the Silverton casino. Oh, my god damn. I mean, McDonald's

235
00:21:51,960 --> 00:22:01,360
 shakes are $5 now, so. I exclaimed for a moment and said, you know, that is a very expensive

236
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:07,480
 chocolate shake. And then he handed it to me and I took a sip of it. I know that is

237
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:15,520
 very good. I don't know if it's $13 good though. He said, well, he goes, it doesn't matter.

238
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,880
 You already paid for it. Oh, Jesus. And I said what? He goes, you instantly tapped your

239
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,720
 phone on the thing because I was standing there thinking that I hadn't paid for it yet.

240
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,440
 And I had just completely spaced and without meaning to had just like tapped my phone on

241
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:34,040
 the little card reader and be like, yep, there we go. You had a very, I was still complaining

242
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:39,760
 about the price having already paid for it. A very pulp fiction moment there. Yeah. Yeah.

243
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,960
 And that was the $5 milkshake where everybody's like, what the fuck? $5. It was five at Jack

244
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:53,400
 Rabbit slims. Holy shit. $5. That's outrageous. Yeah. Well, you know, the, you know, being

245
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:59,920
 able to like bring the dairy cows in Montana down because of drought now and stuff like

246
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,560
 that, you know, milkshakes have gotten very expensive. Well, that's the fucked up thing

247
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,840
 within our lifetime. It ain't getting cheaper for a milkshake. So drink them up now boys.

248
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:21,520
 Enjoy them. Enjoy them now. And chocolate cows are harder to move too. To move. I did

249
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:29,840
 a corporate show in Sexton, Missouri. Oh, this is, this is the, this is the one, right?

250
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,400
 Two hours outside of St. Louis. This was the, you had to jump away from your regular gig.

251
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,520
 Yeah. Got it all cleared. I loaded into Chicago, do my first show in Chicago, pack up, go to

252
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:46,160
 the airport, fly to Missouri to show Missouri pack up, fly back to Chicago, load in again

253
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:52,280
 and finish up my run in Chicago. This was pound to flesh. This was not, uh, not going

254
00:23:52,280 --> 00:24:00,600
 to be easy as per your management. Yes. Possibly. This was for drunken businessman was the pitch.

255
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:07,200
 It was, and it was not that I, that it was, it was mispitched that way. Okay. Cause the,

256
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,840
 the guy that booked you told you this was going to be blood money. Yes. Is this going

257
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:17,640
 to be a real pain in the ass? Yes. Um, it was, it was, it was a Christmas party for

258
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:25,000
 a company that specializes in like, um, uh, basically like a gas tank, uh, compatibility.

259
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,840
 So whether you have like ethanol or butane or whatever, like, uh, it basically is like

260
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:35,240
 a, a tank company, like different types of gas tank company. It was a family party. So

261
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,840
 it was all the workers and their husbands and wives. Uh, and it was held inside that

262
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:49,040
 paintball, uh, place, uh, like kind of like amusement park area. This town, this town

263
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:55,560
 was small. Like it drove through town. No, no lights, no traffic lights, you know, no

264
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:00,840
 sidewalks, you know, uh, literally had one gas pump. What, like the gas station had one

265
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:08,640
 pump. Oh shit. Uh, it was, uh, you know, like that's a small town. The firehouse had like

266
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,340
 a little Christmas tree outside of a decorated, you know, that's, that's the little activity

267
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:20,200
 scene. That's the, that's it's Christmas time. And, uh, inside it did, it had, it had, you

268
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,360
 know, uh, you know, everything's for a dollar else. The freshmen stand at the, at the, at

269
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,560
 the, uh, it wasn't open. I was there for a closed event, but you know, like I was like,

270
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:34,200
 oh, they still sell sodas and water for a dollar and snacks for a dollar in places.

271
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:43,880
 That's cute. It was very nice. Yeah. Um, but no, uh, they, uh, they just don't go to shows

272
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,600
 often, right? So the idea of like putting on a show was just something that was kind

273
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:54,160
 of like, okay, now the funny thing that happened was the woman who was supposed to Duke you

274
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:59,560
 my intro, like she went over all the intro with me and I was like, yep, that's the intro.

275
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:04,360
 And then, uh, they had to show a video and then break down the screen and take everything

276
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:11,480
 off stage to make room for me. Uh, and after the intro, well, this is it. So I thought

277
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:17,320
 my intro would be after the breakdown of the screen. Oh no. The video finishes and she

278
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,360
 just calls from, from the audience, not from stage, from the audience, just turn to the

279
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:29,920
 microphone. He goes, uh, the man of the hour, Matt Donnelly, just like that. Yeah. Man of

280
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:38,120
 the hour, the man of the, the event was there to honor you. That's what I mean. Like man

281
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:43,560
 of the honor, as you're like, Oh, I don't know. A man of the honor, like man of the

282
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:51,600
 hour. I mean, like what, like we're not there for me retirement from magic. This is his

283
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,400
 last show. Everyone, Mr. Matt Donnelly, the mine noodler. That's the, that's the comedian

284
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:04,240
 coming up and go, you guys ready to laugh? Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Oh my, what a great

285
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:10,560
 prank. How about some fantastic jokes? Everybody it's giggle time. If we gathered everyone,

286
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,080
 Matt, take your ear, take your earphones out. Okay. All right. So here's what we're going

287
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,640
 to do. We're going to, we're going to gather everyone that has been important in Matt's

288
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:23,200
 life and in his professional career. And we're just going to put together a last retirement

289
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,160
 show for Matt, but he's not going to know about it. We're just going to hire him. He's

290
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:32,060
 going to come in. It's going to be billed as Matt Donnelly, the mine noodlers last show.

291
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:37,220
 That's the way to go. Speeches. It's going to be great. Lonnie Hamilton out in Vegas,

292
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:42,180
 the brain surgeon. Oh yeah. He had a crazy house that you could tour for a while. I got

293
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:48,360
 to go one time. Just, you know, no, nothing even remotely close to an HOA. He had crazy

294
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:54,880
 shit in there and he planned and held his own funeral. And yes, cause you want to hear

295
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,280
 what people said about it. Yeah. And I think he's still kicking. He did this several years

296
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:06,040
 ago and he's still alive. So I believe so. Yeah. So good for him. Yeah. Uh, I guess that's

297
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:10,040
 what Matt's going to do, but it's good, but he's not going to know about it. It'd be great

298
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:15,320
 if Richard was a, ladies and gentlemen, the man who will do a bat an hour, Matt Donnelly.

299
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:21,880
 Yeah, that would, yeah, that's what you needed. The man who promised to do an hour comfortable

300
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:28,080
 for an hour ish. It's Matt. After that uncomfortable intro, how did things pick up during the show?

301
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:34,320
 Well, I had to wait for them to break down the stage. Oh, they weren't done. No. So the

302
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,560
 video finishes, she introduces me. This is great. This is great. Three or four minutes

303
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:45,320
 of total silence as they break down the screen and move everything off of the stage. Start

304
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:50,000
 your final show while they're still breaking down. Right? This is the way you do it, man.

305
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,040
 Yeah. Ice them. Yeah. Ice them cold. And I literally just went over to the side of the

306
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:59,680
 stage where she had moved to and said, uh, are you, are you, is that, are you going to

307
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:08,800
 introduce me now again? Or yeah. She goes, Oh, uh, no, just, just, no, just go, just

308
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:14,000
 do it. And I go, but that's it. So I go, so then I go out on stage right now and just

309
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:25,320
 start. She goes, you just want me to do it. Yeah. Uh, yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Perfect. One

310
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:33,280
 gas tank, everybody. I started, uh, I started the show and it wasn't, honestly, people weren't

311
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:37,640
 heckling me. A lot of people were like, no, I don't want to go on stage, which is annoying.

312
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,200
 Sure. Okay. And it wasn't like a lot of people were clapping. A lot of people were laughing.

313
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,960
 I was getting to my stuff. It just felt like I was doing one magic trick after another.

314
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,920
 It didn't feel like a show. Do you know what I mean? I got you. I was like, I'm just going

315
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:54,480
 to keep going. And I got another one. And here's another Diddy. Uh, how many were in

316
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:01,460
 the room? Your last show was, uh, was that bad? About 150, about 150. Okay. Yeah. Uh,

317
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:05,840
 but I went out doing what I loved, you know, and I had to call magic lounge and say, sorry,

318
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:11,160
 this was it. This is it. How did the, uh, the trip out to the, to the random gig went

319
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:18,000
 well and everything. There were no hiccups in the, in the travel. Uh, funny. I get there

320
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,360
 and, uh, I take my little shuttle to, okay. So do you have any, what is your tactics for

321
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:31,880
 renting a car when you travel? Jacob? I usually pre pre book before we get there. Uh, if I

322
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,360
 can check in before getting to the rental car place, if I'm able to check in before

323
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:43,800
 getting to the desk, then I will. And hopefully there is just a, a key pickup spot somewhere

324
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:48,560
 or the keys are in the car and we, we load up, get in the car and, and head right out.

325
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:53,640
 This is, this is where I need to get more savvy. I'm not, okay. I'm not good at figuring

326
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,920
 out like how to be one of the guys that walks past the counter to the directly to where

327
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:03,280
 the cars are. Right. The only tactics I have been using, and this used to be very successful

328
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:09,120
 and now it's not. And I'll tell you why I used to book the third or fourth cheapest

329
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:15,240
 option because it's usually a difference of like $5. Uh, uh, and so I would, I would choose

330
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,000
 that because basically sometimes there's a rush at one rental car counter when you get

331
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,560
 there and the lines like out the door. Yes. And so I've been, I was always, I always book

332
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,100
 like the third or fourth cheapest rental car because usually that means like, I won't,

333
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:37,680
 I won't be on that same line. Okay. And this used to be a successful tactic until now this

334
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:42,440
 happened when Paul and I, when we went to Jersey, uh, and this happened, uh, and now

335
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,720
 when I came here, all these rental car companies are now just run by the same, by, by the same

336
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,720
 people.

337
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,440
 Like when you get, when you get to the counter, everybody works for all three rental car places

338
00:31:52,440 --> 00:32:00,640
 at that counter. Like nobody like budget thrifty and Avis are all the same company. They're

339
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:06,140
 all just, no, there's no merger. They're just running the, yeah, it's just like the guy

340
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:10,560
 at the desk at thrifty. Yeah. If there's nobody at the desk at budget and he doesn't have

341
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,280
 anybody in line at thrifty, he just stands up and moves over to the desk at budget. It's

342
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:20,360
 budget cuts like, oh, so he's only getting paid one salary and working three jobs. That's

343
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:26,000
 right. Fuck man. I don't know. I don't know how that guy is being paid, but yes, he's

344
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,840
 definitely working three jobs. He might be making $700,000 a year. I don't know. I'm,

345
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:38,840
 I'm guessing not probably not. If I made $700,000 in one year working for a rental car company,

346
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:43,360
 you would never see me at the rental car company again. Yeah, that would be it. I'd be there

347
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:49,640
 until they figured it out. Are you kidding? This guy, this guy's been working here for

348
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:59,760
 28 years, rivaling Elon Musk, a higher threshold for pain than I ever will. If I saw 700 K

349
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:07,440
 in my bank account today, I would disappear. Disappear, poof, gone without a trace. I'd

350
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,360
 keep doing this show. This is where we find out that Paul and I are different people.

351
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:23,200
 Fair enough. So I get there and the line is like out the door. I am like the 40th person

352
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,380
 in line and there's two people working there and like one guy's wearing like a Santa Claus

353
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,960
 hat to be like festive because it's a Christmas weekend. And I was like, yeah, it's a freaking

354
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,440
 Christmas weekend. Maybe I have more than two people at the rental car counter. For

355
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:45,600
 sure. No, he's like, absolutely not. So I am nervous because I'm supposed to be there

356
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:54,320
 at like four. Okay. And, and I didn't, I didn't account for an hour of waiting for the car.

357
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:00,600
 No, I sarcastically brought up Netflix on my phone and started watching the new knives

358
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:06,640
 out movie being like, I'll never get through this. Cause it's two 40. That's a long and

359
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,560
 I was like, I was like, so it's like timing each person. I was really getting myself really

360
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,240
 angry and anxious and I was like, Oh yeah. I was like, I need to like check out. Like

361
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:20,600
 I need to like be gone and podcasts are not doing it because I'm still looking around.

362
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:25,600
 So I started watching. I started watching knives out. Took me an hour and 15 minutes to get

363
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:32,400
 my car. That's a bit of a holy shit. It took me an hour and 15 minutes to get my car. That's

364
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:39,400
 a wait baby. That's crazy. Yeah. It was maddening. It was really bad. And what airport was this?

365
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:46,080
 St. Louis. It's a major airport. Uh, it's a major airport. Not the smallest little

366
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:50,600
 podunk airport that you've ever seen in your life. Yeah. No. And like cause it's run by

367
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:56,600
 those St. Lunatics. That's right. And you know, they had enough desks for eight people

368
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:05,280
 to work. Um, well that's it, Matt. They spent all their money on desks. They can't get desks

369
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,360
 and employees. I, uh, I got through an hour. Somebody asked me if I finished the film.

370
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,040
 I haven't finished it yet. Uh, it seems, it seems to be the better one of the knives out

371
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:21,600
 movies. It seems to be like the best one. Really? Oh, we should watch it at scoop fest.

372
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:28,960
 Oh shit. For people who don't remember, we tried that at the scoop fest one time. Didn't

373
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,920
 work well. We did a different, we have murder on the orient express. It was my call and

374
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:38,040
 it was the wrong call. Um, it was your call, but we were all excited about it. You had

375
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:45,640
 the idea, but all three of us were very excited about it. And it was a bad idea. Yeah. Uh,

376
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:50,840
 so, uh, yeah. So anyways, I ended up getting like late to the gig, which is not great,

377
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:56,560
 but they were, it ended up being fine. They had rental car trouble in Austin as well,

378
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,800
 but different type of rental car trouble. We, we breezed through the line that that

379
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:05,200
 wasn't an issue. We got in the car and went to drive away and SJ was driving and, uh,

380
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:12,920
 she goes, Oh, there's a, uh, a tire pressure warning light on and sure enough, the, uh,

381
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:18,720
 the passenger front tire, uh, according to the car was supposed to be 38 pounds per square

382
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:27,320
 inch, 38 PSI. And it was at, uh, like 16 or 17. It was, it was quite low. It was quite

383
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:34,320
 low. Whoa. So we went back into the office and we're like, Hey, the, uh, the, the car

384
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,880
 has a low tire light on it. Um, y'all, y'all want to do something about that. And she said,

385
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:45,360
 I shit you not. She goes, Oh, well you can feel free to fill that up like a gas station

386
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:53,120
 or something when you're, when you're, after you get the car out. But if, if the tire has

387
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:59,640
 a leak in it, then I'm in more trouble than I am now. She was like, Oh, it's just the

388
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:04,720
 cold weather. I was like, no, no, no. The cold weather knocks it down like five or six

389
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:12,800
 or seven PSI. This is like 20. Yeah. Like it might just be going flat. Like if you're

390
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,120
 telling me it's fine and just need some air in it, then put some air in it and I'll take

391
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,760
 it out and I guess we'll deal with it. But like we were going out into the country to

392
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,480
 visit my in-laws. Like, well, I'm not, I'm not trying to have a flat tire out in the

393
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:31,720
 fucking woods somewhere. No. And so finally they go, well you can do a, cause we had paid

394
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:38,960
 for it with, with points. And so, so we had gotten like the, the premium, the premium

395
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,160
 level car or whatever. Yeah. It shows, she goes, Oh, well you can take this other, you

396
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,480
 know, basically just like the low level, you know, the, the budget, the budget car. Yeah.

397
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:54,360
 We were like, Oh, well, okay. That's fine. But do we get a refund on? No, no, there's,

398
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:59,120
 there's no refunds. Yeah. And so that just went back and forth for a while. And finally

399
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:03,480
 I was like, just cause she goes, Oh, well you can cancel the reservation as well. Oh

400
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:08,440
 boy. So what, what do you mean? We were here. We, we have to have a car. I'm waiting here

401
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,800
 after to see where you can get me a car with, with all four tires. That's all. That's the

402
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,840
 only you guys don't have an air compressor. You don't have just somebody that could come

403
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,960
 out and put air in the tire and someone does a check, right? Don't they do a check on the

404
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:26,240
 cars as they're cleaning them up and whatnot? Yes. And then she goes, Oh, well, you know,

405
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,520
 we can, we can get you some, we can get you a different car, but it's going to be a big

406
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:38,160
 car. So they finally, they finally give us like a nice car, like a Tahoe, like something,

407
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,880
 something that if the three of us were going somewhere and I had rented a car and I rented

408
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,840
 this, at least one of the two of you would be like, Jacob, why'd you rent such a big

409
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:52,120
 fucking car? Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. This was like eight people could fit in this thing

410
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,360
 plus luggage and yeah, it was stupid. It was very nice though. Or you can have whatever's

411
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:01,400
 in this box and just put this box, this three box up on there, gave it a tap or you're going

412
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:09,760
 to ride on this goat, ride this goat all the way through the country. And when you open

413
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:18,480
 the box, there's just a dildo inside that said, go fuck yourself. Oh boy. It was such

414
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,960
 a pain. It was so weird. And we were both on like no sleep at all. I think I had slept

415
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,280
 for maybe an hour and a half the night before and literally no sleep. What a load. I'm just

416
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:35,920
 standing there in this car rental office with that like sleep deprived confusion. Yeah.

417
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:43,200
 Yes. I'm like, I don't understand why we don't have a car and why we aren't leaving already.

418
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:51,920
 You have so many cars here and that the one you gave us has a flat tire. So what is what?

419
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,640
 So dumb. And then like she goes, Oh, well you can, you can take this Tahoe, you can

420
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,280
 take this Tahoe. And I go great. And then they tell us the parking spot and we go out

421
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:07,680
 to it and there was a large Tahoe type SUV in the, in the parking spot, but it says Denali

422
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,680
 on it. And so I was like, well, that's not a, is that a Tahoe? I don't know if Denali

423
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:18,520
 is a Tahoe. And so I go back in and I was like, Hey, the, the thing in the spot there,

424
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:22,820
 it looks like a Tahoe, but it says Denali on it. She goes, yeah, that's the type of

425
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:29,240
 Tahoe it is. It's a Denali. It's a nice one. Oh, okay. Okay. I was just asking. I was making

426
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:33,120
 sure we were taking the right fucking car. Don't yell at me. She went back to blowing

427
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:40,960
 up your other tire by, by my mouth. Like, like, like, like a clown with a balloon animal.

428
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:50,720
 Just like, I will tell you, I will tell you one of the things that I do really love about

429
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:59,040
 living out here in old Western PA. I can drive to the sheets, gas station. I can pull up

430
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:04,960
 next to an air compressor machine. I can push that baby to where I want it to go. Pressure

431
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:12,040
 wise. I can stick that tube on my tire and go and then be done all for fucking free.

432
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:19,900
 Done. None of this charging bullshit. My God. I had, then Paul pulls out his dick and pisses

433
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:24,720
 all over it so that no one else will be able to enjoy it. I had to have like three different

434
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:31,840
 locations in Vegas because either someone would rip the fucking nozzle off and steal

435
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:37,480
 the copper gas users are a disaster here. They really would. Yeah. Or they would tear

436
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:44,520
 up the e-reader so you couldn't use the machine or as only quarters and you, the only place

437
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:49,840
 you ever still had to use quarters was that fucking air compressing machine. There is,

438
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,640
 as I always said, when you did live here, I said, Paul, when you're at my house, just

439
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:59,760
 tell me I own an air compressor and we can put air in your tires. Never did that though.

440
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,960
 We never did. On quarters. I just kept carrying around quarters because it doesn't happen.

441
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,840
 Yeah. When he goes to the sheets, he finishes off with a happy ending. He, he, he, he suitcases

442
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:16,400
 it at the very end and gives a little rate up the keyster. Just, just wake it up. I just

443
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,520
 wake it up a little bit. I offered that I offered that he didn't take me up on my happy

444
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:27,240
 end to get the sheets as a fountain drink for Ann. That's what that is. She loves a

445
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,160
 sheet fountain drink and I can't blame her. They're quite good. I got to take a sheet

446
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:36,880
 fountain drink to Ann McPheeters. You better have a poncho on. I got some diet. I got a

447
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:43,400
 diet Pepsi fountain drink for her the other day. It was primo top notch. I, yeah, I, I

448
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:48,700
 sheets is pretty good. So, uh, I've got to give a shout out to Ann. Poor thing. She's

449
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:55,360
 trying to get home. She's supposed to be off today. She worked a 14 hour day yesterday.

450
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:00,760
 She's supposed to be off today. She's been at work since six o'clock. It's a nightmare.

451
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:06,600
 People just keep calling off and she's too good to not just let the place burn in hell.

452
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,960
 So it's not something terrible happening. It's just people calling out. Well, it's just

453
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:14,680
 holiday schedule type stuff. Yeah. It's bullshit. Yeah. But she's supposed to be off. But anyway,

454
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:19,000
 it's like the milk frothing machine is raging out of control or anything like that. Nothing

455
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,440
 like that. But she's been dealing, she's been putting out fires for weeks now and it's just

456
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:28,040
 a bunch of bullshit and I hope things clear up soon. So yeah, I'm going to give a shout

457
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:34,400
 out to the people of Chicago. Oh, I had a blast at Chicago Magic Lounge this weekend.

458
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,960
 I really fun shows. It was really great. I love Chicago audiences. I always have ever

459
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:47,200
 before magic. It just took improv in Chicago. I just have always loved doing shows in Chicago.

460
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:53,480
 Good theater town. And good entertainment town. They know how to behave in a show. Yeah.

461
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,560
 I want to show where a guy was just messing up and I was like starting to get frustrated

462
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:02,760
 in a way that everyone thought was funny, right? I said he was being, it was on a really

463
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,940
 hard time giving me straight answers. And then finally I did the whole like think of

464
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:10,360
 any animal. And he, and he said, I go, yeah, I want to go see that. He goes, what is it?

465
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:18,520
 He goes, seven. What was it? Was he on something? Was he, was he just pulling your leg? He was

466
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:24,440
 not sober. He was not sober. Okay. But this is what I love Chicago audiences where I go

467
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:29,400
 like, what is happening? What world are we living in? Did I enter a vortex? You know,

468
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,920
 whatever. And I just turned and I turned, I was like, I gotta find somebody else. And

469
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:43,460
 I was like, you, what's your name? And he's like, Dan, I was like, Dan, are you an asshole?

470
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:47,960
 And everyone laughs, including the guy. Yeah. The guy goes, I don't think so. And I go good.

471
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:53,480
 Name any animal. And he's like, good, good, good. I did boom, pulled out a fish as squirrel.

472
00:44:53,480 --> 00:45:01,720
 And I said, just see how hard that is. It's so good though. When the, when the drunk guy

473
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:07,840
 laughs along, he goes like, I'm sorry. And I was trying to explain this. I got through

474
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,400
 the whole weekend with Mike Mills and Mike Mills. I'm about to go out with jokers and

475
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,760
 magic. And as I explained to him, I was like, you know, my clips that do best on my Instagram

476
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,400
 feed and stuff like that and tick tock and all that stuff are ones where I am frustrated.

477
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:26,300
 And the problem is the comments in the thing are some of them are like, boy, this guy's

478
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:31,960
 an asshole, right? Right. And it's hard to explain. It's like, no, no, no. Like from

479
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:41,320
 your family. And I was like, you know, the firehouse could still use volunteers and um,

480
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:46,400
 like everybody was laughing. I was frustrated, but jokingly frustrated. Like I was playing

481
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,080
 it up. Right. And the whole audience was laughing, including the guy who I was messing with the

482
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,560
 whole time. You know, right. Oh, it's the best. And I was like, but, but if that clip

483
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:59,040
 runs social media, like they'd just be like this magician's being a dickhead. And so it's

484
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,960
 really hard. Even the one that's the most famous for the more is really busting the

485
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,640
 guy's ball and threatened him to leave and that kind of stuff. Yeah. Uh, we hung out

486
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:11,200
 after that show and talked for 20 minutes. We, we, we, we, he was happy. He was happy.

487
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,460
 You know, he was happy with his show experience. Yeah. And so it's just hard. It's just hard.

488
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:19,760
 But I had a blast in Chicago. It is always weird. I see, I see people doing this, not

489
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,640
 just on your social media, but on many of my friends, many of my performer friends, social

490
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:28,800
 media, people will critique the, you know, eight seconds of performance that they saw

491
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,240
 on this slip. I'm like, guys, this is not, I know it's hard. This is not what this is.

492
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,240
 And on the other hand, I'm going to put it out, right? Like it's really, it's really

493
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,040
 hard. It's, it's difficult. I can't pitch too much scoop is making the announcement.

494
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:46,880
 That guy is Matt's apprentice now. Uh, I do the bit, uh, scoop it over glass. If I do

495
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,640
 a six, seven joke, I had it in my show briefly because I always say, what's our connection

496
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:56,880
 scale of one to 10? I pull a number out of my pocket. Uh, and I can pull it out and it's

497
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:03,920
 six, seven. It's a really, uh, polarizing, polarizing joke. It's a polarizing joke. Some

498
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:09,400
 people really love it and some people go like, Oh God. And then I hate that. It's the devil

499
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:15,840
 makes my children say that. And the risk is, uh, that I look like an old guy trying to

500
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:21,200
 look hip. That's why I don't do it. I was about to ask if you like that joke, I could

501
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:26,760
 give a shit. Yeah, exactly. I mean, you don't care about that joke. No, look, I got soccer

502
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:31,720
 jerseys made for my kid and for this Christmas tournament. And, uh, uh, boy, we didn't talk

503
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:36,200
 about that. Did we end down? No, we didn't talk about your kids, Christmas soccer tournament,

504
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:40,360
 the three on three. Oh, I feel bad because I'm one, I don't know if everyone listens

505
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,160
 here. This is a Penn Sunday school, but I have this conversation at Penn Sunday school,

506
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:47,640
 but you guys reactively, then Penn does everything. So it's, it's fine by me. Uh, but I got shirts

507
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:53,800
 made up for it. You know, my brother designed a logo for the jingle ballers. I had everyone's

508
00:47:53,800 --> 00:48:00,360
 jersey number six, seven, uh, and, uh, every kid was loving as we walked by in our shirts

509
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:07,600
 with a six, seven, because I was amongst children and that's what the joke is for. Yes. Um,

510
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:11,200
 but uh, uh, yeah. So the show, I don't do it because it just looks like, I could look

511
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,800
 like an old guy trying to look hip and that that's dumb. And it also slows things down.

512
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,640
 It's a, it eats the, cause it's right. The number joke is a quick bit that leads to the

513
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:24,520
 fish reveal. So it kind of really clunks it up. Rhythm wise, if it takes up too much,

514
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:28,200
 I was going to say, cause then you have to get back and do the actual joke. Yeah. Yeah.

515
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:35,160
 Yeah. So it, it reads as a recovery and that's not funny. Right. But, uh, yeah, guys, hey,

516
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:43,840
 uh, you are talking to a now retired soccer coach. Yeah. Just in and out. I, uh, you know,

517
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:49,600
 I, I gotta, I gotta go out on top, you know, you're going out on top, huh? Uh, look, let's

518
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:56,800
 just say mistakes were made, uh, for the three on three. Yes. Did, did the, uh, did the athletes

519
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:02,040
 on the field not follow your instructions to the point that they should have thus losing

520
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:07,040
 the game, uh, via no fault of yours coach. No, it's not even, we're not even like, we're

521
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:12,680
 not even, it's not even, I wish, I wish that was a problem. Oh no. The mistake I made was

522
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:18,280
 you could check a box. You either be recreational team or competitive team. Oh, okay. You check

523
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,680
 competitive. Correct. Cause my kids have been playing together for seven years and that's

524
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:29,640
 right. They had a really good coach and they're going on. And so we go off our first game

525
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:34,360
 and we crushed the other team. Five, nothing like really, really great. Like great. We're

526
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:37,920
 riding high. We're feeling good. Sounds like Donnelly's on the sideline. You're like guys,

527
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:43,360
 I checked the competitive box. How come you're not bringing me competitive teams. And even

528
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,480
 the old coach whose kid is on our teams showed up and he was like, Hey, maybe we'll do a

529
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:51,880
 barbecue at my house when this is all over. Like we're feeling good. All right. It's an

530
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:56,280
 all day event. So we've got to wait like an hour and change between each game. Okay. And

531
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:00,680
 the next game we go up against the games are really quick games are like 12, 12 minute

532
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:08,480
 halves. The whole thing's over an hour. Oh, that's fun. Oh, okay. Yeah. And so you do

533
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:15,640
 first thing first batch around Robbins and then you do a semifinal and final of the best

534
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:25,560
 teams from the round Robin. Okay. So then we go up against a team that is the, yeah,

535
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:29,440
 it's the split team of the traveling team in town. Like the main traveling team in town

536
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:34,580
 split into different teams and we're playing one of the, one of the very Brazilian national

537
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:42,560
 team. They beat us eight, nothing. And, uh, and it was hard. They scored fast. They're

538
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:47,560
 up for nothing. Like very fast. Yeah. And same age as, as your team, right? Yeah, same

539
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:51,060
 ages, same ages, but just, you know, these are guys are practicing year round three times

540
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:55,600
 a week. They're going at it. They're going at it. Yeah. Yeah. Playing well or playing

541
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:02,560
 dirty. Uh, Oh, so good point, Paul. So it turns out we play in a rec league when you

542
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:08,120
 play club team, it turns out a physical contact is not a refereed as closely as recreation

543
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:13,040
 rec, a lot of shoving. Right, right, right, right, right. And the competitive, uh, travel

544
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,820
 teams, they allows, they allow a lot more contact. So yes, indeed my kids are actually

545
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:20,960
 getting pushed around and then it's hard to watch. That's what I figured. And they want

546
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,920
 to complain. And I'm saying like, you got to just play through it. Right. Now here's

547
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:29,480
 the problem. This whole thing, you can't do that in, you can't do that mid game. You can't,

548
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:33,120
 you can't shift that, that thought process. There's no adult to be. No, no, no. And that's

549
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,720
 why I know this. Like my only thing is I just try to like not raise my voice and just like,

550
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:41,560
 we got to keep playing. We got to keep going. All you can do is be the calm example at that

551
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:48,400
 point. This whole thing was because my youngest kid had a nightmare soccer season because

552
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,560
 what happens when you play rec is that the, the, whatever core group you have will stay

553
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:57,400
 together, but you always don't have, you know, it's rare to have like 12 core group people.

554
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:03,840
 And so you get five or six new kids each season. And this particular season, my kid got a bunch

555
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:09,260
 of kids who didn't show up. Uh, one kid like broke his arm and like, uh, and we just lost.

556
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:14,080
 So we were playing luckily at soccer. So you don't need your arm. We were playing shorthanded

557
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:18,440
 the entire season. My son had to play the entire game of every game. That's right. Yeah.

558
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,200
 Yeah. He was just out there all the time. Yeah. And sometimes one kid short. So they're

559
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:26,840
 getting their butts kicked through it by, by playing, you know, seven on six or whatever.

560
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:31,520
 Right. And so I just want to one last fun event for these kids to like not have it so

561
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:38,880
 hard and then I've marched them into a buzzsaw. Yeah. You should have gone home after the

562
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:44,240
 first game. Exactly. We should just, well, we won. We should have been like barbecue.

563
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:49,280
 Let's go. Yeah. Barbecue sounds great. That's the plan. So because we beat that other shitty

564
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:57,960
 team five, nothing, we got extra points higher. Yes. Extra points for a shutout. So you're

565
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:02,600
 going against the gods. Yep. So we qualify for the finals and it's three of the travel

566
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:09,880
 team teams and our team. So you played a third game. Yes. Because we're the number four round

567
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:14,520
 Robin. So it goes into a quarterfinal. It's one versus four. So we have to play an even

568
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:20,840
 better team than the team that just kicked our ass, ate nothing. You had to keep playing

569
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:26,360
 with this Paul again. You think you're just bringing up a philosophical point and you're

570
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:36,160
 reading the story. So, uh, this next team just destroys us. I mean, just like it is

571
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:41,200
 16, nothing in the first 12 minutes and literally like a minute into the second half, like this,

572
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:47,760
 you know, 14 year old kid walks over to me. He's the ref, you know, no, it's going to

573
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:54,240
 hurt down. We'll just be the user. He's like, here he's like, there's a mercy rule. You

574
00:53:54,240 --> 00:54:03,760
 can just call it, you know? Yeah. And I was like, and no, I'm not calling. I'm not calling.

575
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:11,360
 Oh no, Matt, you got to call it. You got to call it. Did you ask the kids? Did you, did

576
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:15,400
 you propose it to the kids at all or no? No. Cause they were, they would just confirm it.

577
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:19,960
 Like, like that's, that to me is more demoralizing. You think, okay, all right. I mean, you're

578
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:25,040
 having the option for the mercy rule is demoralizing moment. It is a demoralizing moment, but if

579
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:30,880
 the ref is telling you, Hey, we can, we can put a gun to this horse's head. Yes. I take

580
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:36,640
 that option, but I mean, that's me, but you're not out there playing a rec league soccer

581
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:42,200
 game in the first place. I just wanted my kids to score. I want to see it. I want to

582
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,200
 see if my kids could score another goal or something. I just want to see if they could

583
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:50,240
 just find something, some fun moment or whatever. And they weren't getting shut out in the,

584
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:55,120
 in the no, no, we scored a couple of times. We scored, scored on them. We actually scored

585
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:59,840
 first, which got things way too exciting. We were, we were, we were briefly up one nothing

586
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:07,480
 and then down a lot to one, uh, which is a terrible, uh, cause it even gave a moment

587
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:14,760
 of false hope. Sure. Right. Like, Oh, maybe we are good enough. We're not. It's more

588
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:21,280
 self-examination that you don't want. Now, as you know, this, this, uh, this, this, this

589
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:28,000
 show is familiar with the term Italian air show. Sure. Yeah. So worst to worst. So the

590
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,120
 Italian national team showed up. This is where, this is where we, this is where, this is where

591
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:40,000
 we take my Italian soccer team to Romstein. And, um, so I, I look on my app, like there's

592
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,520
 a giant thing that's taking place all over the field with all these different age groups

593
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,760
 and everything else. And so every time you go to the desk for help, they're like, look

594
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,600
 at the app, look at the app, look at the app and the refs just record the scores and the,

595
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:56,120
 and the app naturally populates your next matchup. And I see on the tournament thing

596
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:02,400
 that underneath the finals, it says consolation game. So I assume that that means that the

597
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,240
 loser of the two finals teams play a consolation game. That's the way it looks like on the

598
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:11,900
 app. Okay. Like a third place game or something. So after we lost, I don't know, a million

599
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:18,680
 to two, I'd be like, Hey, this is where I do offer the mercy role. I'm like, Hey, I'm

600
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:23,160
 according to the app. We can play one more game, but it's against the team that we, you

601
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:28,280
 know, we two games, we lost two, two games ago or whoever lost to them, but it's another

602
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,820
 club team.

603
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:38,320
 My son is out. He's like, no, yeah. He's like, no, I'm done. And I was like, yeah. And I

604
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:48,480
 had my hand like, I hear you. Cool. I hear you. And the other four kids say, yes. No.

605
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:53,220
 And then I'm looking at the thing and it says, did you give your son an opportunity to talk

606
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:58,960
 the other kids out of it? Did you squeeze into the tightest Jersey fit you've ever done?

607
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:09,640
 Yeah. I'm a jingle baller. If that were the end of this story, it'd be if you, if you

608
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:15,720
 shaved and put on like a beanie and did a dwarf, did a dwarf on your knees out to the

609
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:22,600
 field thing. I've been fucking hilarious. No, my kid and I have a very emotional conversation.

610
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,520
 He's mad because he doesn't want to play, but he can't quit. He won't quit. And so if

611
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:32,960
 his kids are in, he's in, but he has to play. And I'm saying, you can go home if you want.

612
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,880
 Don't worry about it. And he's interpreting that as like me, like admonishing him. And

613
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:41,960
 I'm like, no, no, this is not like a sarcastic or teach dad moment. For real. If you want

614
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:47,240
 to go home, it's fine. Dad agrees. This sucks. If you want to go, go. I'm only finishing

615
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:52,760
 my obligation as coach to these other kids. And we don't have this obligation. I do. You

616
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:59,180
 can leave, but he doesn't have much of a choice there. He can't leave. No, it sucks. It sucks.

617
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:03,620
 It just sucks. And in my head, I'm like, I want to be like, buddy, I already failed.

618
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:07,680
 Like no matter what this day is a fucking failure for what I wanted to have happen today.

619
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:12,300
 It's already gone. I don't even have a silver lining for what today is. Not a single part

620
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:15,600
 of this went according to my, I was trying to put an extra little pep in your step or

621
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:20,400
 your five core players that, that you committed with for seven seasons. And all I did was

622
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,320
 make you just put an exclamation point on the shit that was this season. That's all

623
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:32,160
 I did was facilitate an extra a hundred kicks to the balls, right? Like, what the hell I'm,

624
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:37,520
 I'm just feeling like a terrible person. I would also like my day to end. I sure would

625
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:42,200
 like to go home to these other kids want to keep playing those. So I have to stick around.

626
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:49,880
 I misread the app. The constellation game is for the winners of the losers. So all the

627
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:54,500
 losers that didn't make the, the final tournament went to their own bracket, a bracket I'm sure

628
00:58:54,500 --> 00:59:00,120
 we would have loved to have been in. Sure. And so the, what they called the fun bracket,

629
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:05,900
 the two winners of the losers got one last game on another field. And I had to then turn

630
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:09,680
 around after all that fighting, I just did with my son and all of the, all the pep talks,

631
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:14,280
 all the parishes gave to their other kids and go, just kidding. I misread the app game.

632
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:24,960
 Go home. Oh, what a headache on the text thread. Like, are we still doing a picnic? Right.

633
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:31,440
 Barbecue. Where's the barbecue motherfucker? Let's rain check on this one and we'll do

634
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:37,680
 it some other day. Yeah. It's been a day. It's let's try. Trying is the first step to

635
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:52,480
 failure. Oh, that's awful, dude. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Kids into the holiday spirit though.

636
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:59,240
 Maybe a good lesson in sports bullshitness. Well, I found myself like going through all

637
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:03,720
 these things in my head. Right. And then I was reminded of America's got talent where

638
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:08,440
 like when I crashed up on America's got talent, I kept it like, Oh, if I ever do this next

639
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:12,280
 time. And then my brain kept going like, there is no next time. And then I would still swim

640
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:15,360
 and swirl and beat myself up and stuff. And my brain would go like, you're never going

641
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:21,200
 back. And so that's what's happening here. I keep it like, Oh, if I next time we'll do

642
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,440
 the recreation league, there's no next time. We're not rallying this back together again.

643
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:28,160
 We're not, no, no, no. We're not getting the old gang back together next year. We're not,

644
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:32,560
 I'm not going to call these parents again. Hey guys, remember that tournament we played

645
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:36,480
 last year? You want to do that again? Remember when you put your trust in me to march your

646
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:46,400
 kids to an awesome afternoon of soccer and I just got there. It was more of a death march.

647
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:51,320
 I was like, I saw like, yeah, all these adjustments in my head. You gave me your kids and I got

648
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:55,920
 up these really cute jerseys. They said six, seven, the jingle ballers was a whole thing.

649
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:02,760
 And then the other team made them dig their own graves. Execution style. Yeah. That's

650
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:07,880
 also, I will call them all next year in December and be like, are your kids feeling a little

651
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:15,320
 too arrogant or cocky? Could they use another lesson in humility? How are your kids doing

652
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:20,960
 to get knocked down a peg? Send the link for the three on three. Boom. Let's go.

653
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:29,840
 It's humility train. Get on board. Everybody on board the humility train. It's the opposite

654
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:34,080
 of like a ropes course where they build kids' confidence up over, you know, whatever. It's

655
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:38,440
 like, you call me like your kids are arrogant. Don't worry. I will sign them up for a three

656
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:45,440
 on three soccer team. No, no, no. You're not so great. 12 year old. Oh man. Like, you know,

657
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,940
 we're sitting around before the games. So this kids are just playing soccer with other

658
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:52,160
 random kids and just, you know, plan on random, you know, just, just fucking around right

659
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:57,240
 and playing. Yeah. And so I guess other kids that were on that team that, that beat us

660
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:00,160
 eight, nothing. We're like playing around with them and literally like was like, Oh,

661
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,520
 we're playing you guys next. And then one kid was like, Oh, we're going to beat them.

662
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:06,000
 Like, and so like, you want to be like, Oh, we'll show them. And then they did. And then

663
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,280
 just as like, Oh, it's like everything from a terrible movie and there's no, there's no

664
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:15,880
 second act. It's just, it's just the first act of the terrible movie.

665
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:22,120
 It's a more realistic movie where the, where the rich, tough team comes in and just beats

666
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:26,800
 the shit out of the upstart team. But you're done coaching now. That's cool. That's great.

667
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:31,600
 That's what I said. I said, if you want to, I said, if you guys want to start an improv

668
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:37,200
 group or play basketball, you let me know. There you go. You're done until then leave

669
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:49,640
 me alone. Are you done walking yet? What you like in general, the milers shit, an intervention

670
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:55,800
 from Paul, any kind of physical activity bail on everything. It doesn't lead to anything

671
01:02:55,800 --> 01:03:03,920
 positive. It just doesn't give him one hip replacement. He's like, quit walking, not

672
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:11,680
 take it off. This is my strutting around cock of the block. Here I am. Ambulatory as fuck.

673
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:21,640
 Look at me. Do to do to do king in the castle. Are you guys talking about Matt Donnelly?

674
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:27,640
 You talk about the guy who walks. Yeah. Fucking walking guy. The ambulatory flex is annoying.

675
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:36,200
 He can't even get to a thousand miles dip shit. He can't count. He can, he can walk.

676
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:43,440
 They can't fucking count. Yes. Kids can count. They don't play soccer well, but that one,

677
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:48,000
 that one, it was my failure. Not theirs. They achieved their goals. Right. And so it was

678
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,120
 like a joke of the family for my kids to make fun of me failing. So I got to really lean

679
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:54,600
 into that and own that. And that was this one. You just kind of had to eat shit. You

680
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:58,560
 don't feel like you're going to lean into this one in the future. It's going to come

681
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:03,000
 up on new years. It's a big funny joke. That's what I mean. Jacob is like everywhere I look

682
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:09,200
 at them. Like, no, it's just an L it's just a total fucking loss. It's just a total sucks.

683
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:14,120
 I just failed and it's over. Like there's nothing, there's no way to point at it. There's

684
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:20,800
 a silver lining. Here's the silver lining. Oh, okay. Those jerseys. You got them. Yeah.

685
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:25,240
 With the six, seven gang. Yeah. Every time they hear the six, seven shit now it's going

686
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:30,520
 to be like, Oh, fuck that. So you may have started a kind of underground rid of the six,

687
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:34,360
 seven, six, seven, at least for them, at least for your kids are not going to enjoy it. We

688
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:40,520
 have neighbors who are more religious. They really do think it's some kind of devil practice

689
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:45,080
 and they did. They said this. Oh, I wasn't joking when I said it's a devil ritual. That's

690
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:50,040
 what these fucking people think. They're crazy as fuck. We know this. Their kids have said

691
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:56,880
 to our kids, like, can you not make six, seven jokes around us? My parents say it's satanic.

692
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:03,640
 So fucking stupid. This country is getting what it deserves. And I had, I am like, do

693
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:08,920
 they believe that or do they just hate that joke so much? They want it to stop. They believe

694
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:14,200
 it. If it's the second, then I'm with them. This is one of those things I am all for.

695
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:18,680
 I'm all for lying to children. No, no. If it accomplishes getting rid of a joke, that's

696
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:25,160
 really annoying. No, this is, this is the dumbest thing. It is, it is the same as rock

697
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:30,240
 and roll. It is the same as underground comedy. It is the same as anything that the younger

698
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:38,240
 generation has ownership of and understanding of that the older generation can't comprehend

699
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:43,280
 fully. And nothing makes the older generation go crazier than when their kids are doing

700
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:50,780
 something that they don't understand. And it makes them fucking nuts. K-pop in general

701
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:57,360
 makes me feel old and out of touch. See? And I love it. Anytime I see, no, I love it. It's

702
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:02,680
 great. But like every time I see or hear anything related to K-pop, I just feel old. Well, I

703
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:06,720
 feel old and out of touch. And you should. We are. Yeah. I think it's just correct. I

704
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:11,080
 think it's the correct feeling. But it doesn't mean the devil made it to poison and kill

705
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:16,160
 your children. It's the dumbest shit. It's all, it's all just, and it's all just control.

706
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:20,080
 I don't think K-pop is of the devil. It's all control. I do believe that 6/7 is. It's

707
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:23,960
 all control. It's all misogyny. It's all racism. It's all tied together in this bullshit that

708
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:29,560
 this country is doing constantly. No, it's probably fine. This country's had it fine.

709
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:34,900
 It's good. Sure. It's nailed it. I'll tell you what else is brought to you by racism

710
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:41,560
 and misogyny. No, no. And that the United States of America. Today's show is brought

711
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:53,320
 to you by, um, yeti brand ice creams, sitting cones, yeti brand, yeti brand ice cream, sitting

712
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:58,600
 cones. This is a, this is a real thing. Who's this from? This is from the microscope in

713
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:06,640
 24. Microscope. So this is from an, a classic episode of the electric company. Oh, you ever

714
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:15,120
 seen this? So it's a spider-man episode where there's this yeti running loose in New York

715
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:20,920
 and Spidey has to trap him. So what he does is he buys ice cream cones. Cause of course

716
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:27,760
 the yeti is attracted to cold and he makes this trail of ice cream cones and the yeti

717
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:36,940
 incredibly suggestively sits on every ice cream cone as he follows the trail of ice

718
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:45,120
 cream cones to the trap that spider-man has set for the yeti. So I don't even know microscope

719
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:51,160
 what commercial I can do here that comes close to just telling people to go on YouTube and

720
01:07:51,160 --> 01:08:00,340
 look up the yeti episode of spider-man from the electric company and watch the yeti suggestively

721
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:10,080
 keister a ton of ice cream cones up its ass. It's, it's beyond disturbing. And when it

722
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:15,960
 does it, it makes like a, a hiss sound, you know, like when you, when you throw a hot,

723
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:24,120
 hot, like a, a little bit of water on a hot griddle and it's all that's the yeti hot griddles,

724
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:36,080
 all these fucking ice cream cones and just, and like really loves it. Like the yeti, the

725
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:43,200
 yeti really loves it. Yeah. So go watch the yeti get off on sitting on a bunch of ice

726
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:50,120
 cubes. Oh God, there it is. Speaking of getting off, you're about to be getting off with some

727
01:08:50,120 --> 01:09:16,960
 jock versus nerds. Oh no. Ladies and gentlemen, it is time. Time for jock versus nerds. Explosion

728
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:24,000
 of sexually gratified yetis. It's, it's live action. Scoop and overgrowth. I was animated.

729
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,760
 No, it's live action. And the live, the guy who played the live action, spider-man just

730
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:36,000
 passed away, uh, like a week ago, Toby McGuire. No, this was technically the, he was a Henson

731
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:43,280
 guy. I think I don't remember, but he, uh, he was the technically the first live action

732
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:49,400
 spider-man. And it's really, yeah, kind of sad. I wanted one more quick little announcement

733
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:56,760
 of what I did last week. Uh, Matt and Malia are, are my dear Pennsylvania scoop friends

734
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:04,200
 were kind enough to invite me out to Christmas vacations put on by the bricolage, uh, production

735
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:11,320
 company. They did a midnight radio kind of thing. They do a radio play version of national

736
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:17,680
 Lampoon's Christmas vacation with tons of Pittsburgh references in it. Oh, that's fun.

737
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:23,120
 It was kind of cute. So lots of Foley work going on through the whole thing and them

738
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:28,720
 just, and so you just sit and you watch performers standing and reading through the script, but

739
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:32,880
 doing all kinds of Foley work at the same time. It was really funny. Uh, a couple of

740
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:37,440
 things went over my head cause I haven't been out here long enough to know all the, uh,

741
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:45,600
 the ins and outs. Oh boy, I got it. But, um, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

742
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:51,000
 Well, we've got a scooper to come and ask today from rune scoop, uh, who sent a nice

743
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:56,080
 email to about, uh, seeing Matt at the Chicago magic lounge. So, uh, the room scoop really

744
01:10:56,080 --> 01:11:01,160
 enjoyed Matt's performance at the Chicago magic lounge. Uh, so you got that going for

745
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:10,240
 you, which is nice. Hey, my last shows the retirement shows. It was great. Yeah. The

746
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:19,440
 categories are every breath you take un-camouflaged animals, 50 50 and run it back. Oh, and let's

747
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:25,800
 see, uh, team sling here. I hear your fresh stats. Matt has 2,800 all time. Jacob has

748
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:30,600
 2000 all time. Paul is in the rear with negative 2000. I'm always in the rear. So that's, that's

749
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:36,800
 on the rune scoop games here. Every breath you take is a category all about the polices.

750
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:42,960
 Every breath you take. Uh, I love the concept from Eric Dittleman's, uh, of, uh, camouflage

751
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:48,120
 animals. So I present that to you with my own twist un-camouflaged animals, uh, find

752
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:53,240
 the animal 50 50 where the odds are forever in your favor and run it back questions from

753
01:11:53,240 --> 01:12:00,280
 my last scooper D. Uh, Paul, you're up first. What do you want? Okay. Uh, I'll try un-camouflaged

754
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:14,640
 animals for 200, three, two, elephant blast off. Un-camouflaged animals, right? Uh huh.

755
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:20,040
 Three to elephant. There's a number three, a number two, the word elephant and blast

756
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:36,680
 off three, two, one. I mean, goodness, my dog is over here just going crazy about something.

757
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:39,920
 I'll be right back. Talk amongst yourselves. The dog is like, it's obvious. The answer

758
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:50,480
 is obvious. Right? Well, what one as like the answer as a, I don't know. What do you

759
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:57,840
 think, Matt? Three, two, elephant blast off. What's the category? Un-camouflaged animals.

760
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:09,720
 Uh, I wonder if it's just elephant trunk. Oh, you might be right. There you go. It's

761
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:14,680
 a give me, it's a give me, uh, I think he's making fun of the Dittleman category instead

762
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:19,440
 of, you know what I mean? We're like all the now I get it. Now I get it. You're right.

763
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:25,840
 That's exactly what it is. Elephant is the answer. It'd be weird if this was the time

764
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:30,240
 where Jacob's dogs decided to take over and eat him. I don't know if anybody saw the follow

765
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:38,720
 up that Dittleman posted on our Insta, but he would have given me credit for Roo and

766
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:42,120
 then it would have not given me credit for Holy cross. So I should, you should have won

767
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:46,920
 and I should have lost. I should have won, but Hey, yeah, water under the bridge. All

768
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:51,360
 right. Jacob's back with a pupper. Now our views are going to go up. Views are going

769
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:55,560
 to go through the moon. So it's elephant, Jacob. It's elephant. That's, we figured

770
01:13:55,560 --> 01:14:01,680
 it out. It's a, it's a play on, on Dittleman's game of hiding the names. There's no hiding.

771
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:05,560
 So it's elephant. Do you think the answer is elephant? They think so. Yeah, there we

772
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:16,920
 go. It is elephant. Matt, I'll do un-camouflaged animals for 800, please. Let's try it. Your

773
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:22,040
 left shoe is plotting a coup against reality. Oh, he did it. It wasn't, it wasn't going

774
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:40,160
 to be that fun. Okay. You got diddled. I got, I got diddled. Let's see here. Your left

775
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:45,760
 shoe is plotting a coup against reality. Damn it. I don't see it. I'll pass. That passes

776
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,520
 to me. I don't, I don't understand what's happening in this category. What's the category?

777
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:58,480
 This is the Dittleman one, the un-camouflaged animals. I had a delivery come to my house

778
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:13,560
 and my dog is furious about it. I get it. Huh. What do you think? I feel like pigeon,

779
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:21,800
 but I'm going to pass. Cause I don't know. All right. There is no animal. It's just a

780
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:28,120
 sentence. Wow, sneaky, sneaky. He promised me it would be unhinged and he is delivering.

781
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:33,560
 All right. There you go. I'll do un-camouflaged animals for 600. The chef told us if we wanted

782
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:51,040
 to be average to work elsewhere, it's be average. The answer is beaver. Be average together.

783
01:15:51,040 --> 01:16:00,540
 It's beaver guys. Beaver is what I'm going with. Beaver. Beaver. Boy, I'm glad I got

784
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:06,200
 that one right. Paul. Every breath you take for 800. I'm going to shoot them. Ooh. Paul

785
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:18,720
 knows all about the police. This is where I next saw you, a venue. Oh my goodness. This

786
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:25,720
 is where I next saw you. See, now this is clearly one that I needed to do in order.

787
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:35,320
 Paul, pass. Clearly. Matt, pass. Pass. The Turner hall ballroom jokers tour. Okay. That's

788
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:43,940
 who's going to see me next. See if I'm playing near you. Go to jokersofmagic.com. Un-camouflaged

789
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:53,440
 animals, 400. Daily double. I bet it all. I have zero points. I bet it all. Hey kids,

790
01:16:53,440 --> 01:17:00,840
 quit monkeying around. Monkey. Ooh. It is monkey. It's in monkeying. You probably couldn't

791
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:07,640
 see it earlier. The word monkey is hidden cleverly inside of the word monkeying. Pretty

792
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:14,940
 fucking sneaky. It's me. I'll try 50/50 for 200. The odds you get this question right

793
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:28,760
 are 50/50. True. True. Hey, look at that. So now wait. I'd say the odds are 100%. Yeah.

794
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:32,500
 I guess if I picked false, they wouldn't have been. Paul. This is that riddle of the twins

795
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:37,760
 at the window like that. Yeah, exactly. Everything I say is a lie and you can't believe anything

796
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:43,080
 I say or something. I don't know. Yeah, yeah. I only tell the truth. I only tell lies. Something

797
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:52,600
 else. Run it back for 200. What is my favorite word? Hint. It's six letters, three of which

798
01:17:52,600 --> 01:18:01,920
 are Y. Definition, a conjunction or opposition, especially of the moon with the sun. What

799
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:18,760
 is my favorite word? Six letters, three Y's. Wow. Y Y Y. Yeah. Conjunction or opposition

800
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:30,320
 of the moon. Yak moon. No, what's that called? It's not an eclipse, not an eclipse, not a

801
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:46,520
 ellipse. I'll pass. I don't know. Matt. Pass. Pass. Z Y G Y. Sijiji. Sijiji. Sijiji. Sijiji.

802
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:57,680
 That's a hell of a word. I'll do 50/50, 400. The odds you get this question right are one

803
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:07,160
 in 25. False. It is false. Well done. Knock that math out of the park. I'm going 50/50

804
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:12,520
 for 800. I'll take the burn this time. Whoa. The odds you get this question right are one

805
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:20,000
 in 100. All right, let's see. I'm going to say false. Oh, it's true. It's either right

806
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:29,560
 or it's wrong. Oh man. Wait, the odds you get this question right are one in 100. True.

807
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:34,760
 It's right or it's wrong. I don't get that at all. I don't get that at all. Somebody

808
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:39,280
 explained that to me. I got it wrong, but somebody explain it to me. Yeah. Paul. Run

809
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:49,400
 it back for 400. Free square. Yay. Reaction or response must feature a reference to bingo

810
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:56,320
 to get points. Oh no. I said yay. You only said yay. I thought yay might be enough.

811
01:19:56,320 --> 01:20:04,960
 It wasn't. I'm sorry, Paul. You got that wrong. That's fair enough. Matt. Oh man. Now I'm

812
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:10,280
 trying not to step in a landmine. This is a sneaky fucking scooperty. Every breath you

813
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:22,240
 take for 200. All right. This is where I first saw you on platform. Also, this is just a

814
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:27,480
 police style. Every breath you take category just to Matt. Stalking you. Yeah. It's gotta

815
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:32,640
 be fool us, right? Matt. No, no, no. He came and saw me live and he told me when I saw

816
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:38,680
 him and I'm trying to remember, I think it was when I was opening for PIF in Chicago.

817
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:43,080
 I think it was in Chicago when I opened for PIF. Do I know the name of the club? I thought

818
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:49,240
 this was going to be like, I thought the platform meant like Twitch. Oh, I'm just wrong on all

819
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:56,920
 of this. I think I don't know. Okay. Uh, pass. There you go. That's the solve. That's where

820
01:20:56,920 --> 01:21:07,200
 did runes scoop first see Matt Donnelly? Um, fuck it. Twitch. You too. Good job. Good

821
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:16,000
 job. Jacob. You got it right. Good. It's me. I'll try, um, uh, run it back 600 to protect

822
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:23,040
 his new wealth. A young, uh, the Greek freak Janice, uh, I'm not going to try and say his

823
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:31,840
 last name. That's it. Kept in, kept in the NBA, kept in the NBA, kept his money at the

824
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:41,080
 FDIC limit in this many banks hint plus or minus, uh, plus or minus two. It's the first

825
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:47,560
 year of his rookie contract. Oh, wow. So he just so money insured up to the FDIC amount

826
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:53,720
 in every many banks. Wow. Oh, I see. God, how many, how many, I mean, well first time,

827
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:59,080
 how much is FDIC insured? Well, I believe that is the, uh, half of this entire question.

828
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:04,560
 Okay. And I don't know his rookie contract. I'm telling you that there are two halves

829
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:10,440
 of this question. I don't know either. Well, educated guesses. How much do you think banks

830
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:16,080
 insured 25 K? I think it goes higher than that. I think, no, it's going to be, I would

831
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:21,680
 think it was million. No, it's at least a million. Who's your pastor, Jacob? That passes

832
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:36,840
 to Paul. Okay. I'll guess, uh, I'll guess four. No, I'll guess 25 banks, 25 banks. Let's

833
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:45,880
 see seven. Seven is the answer. And does it make more sense this time? Paul, did it make

834
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:53,560
 more sense this time? Nope. Not right then. Not to me. Paul, you're wrong. Run it back.

835
01:22:53,560 --> 01:23:04,560
 For 800. Expand the window as you read from the category. Let me see here. Hold on. Can

836
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:11,320
 I do this? What do I have to do here? Uh, from the category, I don't know if I can expand

837
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:17,960
 this window because I have the thing. This is truly outside the box. The category spaces

838
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:25,600
 category spaceless potpourri. Oh, it keeps going. Oh, here we go. Although owned by the

839
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:32,680
 Mars corporation, M&Ms were co-invented by the son of the president of this chocolate

840
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:40,780
 company and filled with their chocolate owned by the Mars corporation. M&Ms were co-invented

841
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:45,840
 by the son of the president of this chocolate company and filled with their chocolate. Gotta

842
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:54,040
 be Hershey. Let's try Hershey. Oh man, this is off the rails. I love it. It is Hershey.

843
01:23:54,040 --> 01:24:01,800
 Hey, I'm back to zero. Fuck yeah. Matt, you're up. Back on the board. I can't see it anymore.

844
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:11,320
 I can't see the board. No, uh, I would take every breath you take for 600. Daily double.

845
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:19,040
 Now it's for 800. This is where I third saw you. Chicago magic lounge. It's the Chicago

846
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:25,560
 magic lounge. Nice one. Was that this time? This was the third? That's correct. All right.

847
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:29,320
 Score check with two questions left. Matt now has the lead with 1600. I'm in second with

848
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:32,680
 200. Paul's in third with zero. There's no more daily doubles left. There's an every

849
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:38,320
 breath you take for 400 and a 50-50 for 600. I'm going to do that 50-50 instead of trying

850
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:44,160
 to figure out where Rune Scoop saw Matt Donnelly at different times. Anybody's game. Paul,

851
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:52,200
 is that squirrel in your background? Is that the squirrel in your background? No. Paul,

852
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:58,680
 is that the squirrel in your background? No, thank God. I'm going to say yes. Okay. Points

853
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:04,680
 if Paul looked, did you look Paul? Nope. Did you see me? I didn't see you look. That's

854
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:09,240
 why I asked. No, Jacob got that one wrong. Paul closing out the category. Every breath

855
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:15,960
 you take for 400. This is the game. Uh, this is where I second saw you. What venue did

856
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:21,880
 Rune Scoop see Matt at the second time he saw Matt? I will pass. I don't know. Oh, interesting

857
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:29,640
 hat. That passes to you. I am trying to remember. He told me when I say opening for PIF, I don't

858
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:40,440
 think that's right. Okay. I think maybe came and saw a foolers tour show. Um, I forget

859
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:47,080
 though pass. Oh, that passes to me. Uh, that would be Matt's house through the second story

860
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:53,320
 window at Matt's house that Rune Scoop was looking through. Oh no, it's the paps. Yeah.

861
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:59,000
 The fuller store. There you go. I got that one wrong and that is the game. Matt wins

862
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:04,360
 with 1600. Paul is in second with zero and I am in third with negative 800. That's from
