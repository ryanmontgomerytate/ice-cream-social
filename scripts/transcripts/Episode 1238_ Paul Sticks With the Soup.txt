 Hey Johnny, do you wanna go to an ice cream social?
 Yeah, I'd love to!
 Great! Let's go!
 Oh yeah! Matt Mattingly's Ice Cream Social! Coming to ya! From three different locations
 around the globe! It's time for Matt Mattingly's Ice Cream Social! Sitting in Pittsburgh, that's
 Paul Mattingly! Sitting in Los Angeles, that's Matt Donnelly! Sitting in Las Vegas, it's
 me, Jacob the Audio Guy. We're PreachingFun! Hey guys!
 Very exciting, very exciting stuff guys.
 Yeah!
 What happened?
 Um, I'm being sarcastic, but uh, no, I'm in LA doing a little run at the Magic Castle.
 Nice!
 Nice!
 Have you already started that or is that coming up soon?
 No, I started it. We did it on Wednesday night and Thursday night so far.
 What room are you in?
 The Peller Theatre, which is funny because it's a theatre that features duos, so people
 think Peller is a combination of Penn and Teller, but it's not true. Just by coincidence,
 the guy who pwned it up the cash to make it happen was a guy named Albert Peller, got
 the theatre named after him. And uh, yeah, it's-
 But you know the interesting thing about Albert, right?
 Go ahead.
 Did you know Albert?
 No.
 I don't know if you knew Albert or not, but he actually changed his name to represent
 Penn and Teller. He was such a big fan of Penn and Teller that he changed his name to
 celebrate Penn and Teller, and then by coincidence, that theatre was named after him.
 Originally, his last name was Angel Field, but then he found more magic people to change
 his name to, so-
 His name used to be Shithouse!
 He changed it in the third century.
 But yeah, and so I'm playing with my buddy Nick Paul, a very funny guy, and one bit we
 always do in the show is we say we have an improv background, and so we do improv during
 a magic trick where I basically just try to mess with him while he does a magic trick.
 I love- I still haven't seen this idea live. I love this idea.
 It's really fun. It's really fun. Last night, I was messing with him and I actually messed
 up the trick.
 Good!
 You got into it so you're playing the bit too hard.
 Exactly.
 I'm honestly not interested in you fucking with him during the set if you've never fully
 messed up a trick while fucking with him.
 No, and I did this bit during my magic live show, so when I messed up and he really had
 to reset, I go, "Don't worry. I can handle this. I'm an improv guy, a master of crowdwork.
 Sure, I mostly work cruise ships, but crowdwork is universal. Hands up, who's celebrating
 their 50th wedding anniversary?"
 Crowdwork is the same no matter where you go. Quick!
 Who's celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary?
 Where are my people who are turning 100 right now? Hey, there they are. There's always a
 group of them no matter where I go. There's always a group of people turning 100.
 Look at that. There's the man himself, Arthur Peller, at 110. There he is.
 How old is he? He dead?
 Little is known about him. Little is known about him. He's an enigma.
 No one knows. No one knows.
 Is that right? No.
 It depends on how wide you want the scope to go.
 No one on this show knows. Yeah, no one playing the Peller Theater this
 week knows. That's what I know. Yeah, but we're doing a show. I have a new bit. I put
 a new bit in the show with Ray Applethorne's fine craftsmanship again, but I'm not going
 to give too much away because I'm going to perform it at ScoopFest. We'll talk about
 it after. I'm sure we'll be talking about it after ScoopFest, so there you go.
 Look at us. We're talking about it now. It's super fun. It's a super fun bit. Yeah, it's
 been a great run so far. It's always fun to be back out here.
 Nice. Yeah. Nice, nice, nice.
 I've had a comic booky week. You got exposed to radiation and now you can turn green at
 will. Well, I told you guys I saw Thunderbolts, yeah?
 Oh yeah. Yeah, you needed that.
 Didn't really like it. I just saw Superman.
 Any better? What did you get, the soup or the man?
 I stuck with the soup and I don't regret it. Waiter, there's a man in my soup. That's
 Superman. Has that been done before? That's a good one.
 I know. My brain went to the same exact thing. That's a good joke.
 That's just a simple turn. That has to be done before, but it's really nice.
 That has to have been done before by somebody. Yeah, that's Superman. Oh, okay.
 It's all right. It's okay. It's fine. I'm a Marvel guy, not a DC guy.
 I was going to say, some people are finding it very emotional seeing that movie.
 Really? Yeah.
 The last couple minutes, the old James Gunn heart string machine fires up.
 Oh, that's right. It is a James Gunn one, isn't it?
 It fires up on full cylinders in the last couple moments.
 At some point in the movie, there's a baby raccoon that they're torturing and he's crying.
 He throws babies, dogs, squirrels, everything. He throws everything at the fucking screen.
 He hates automatically his emotions. No, no, no, it's fine.
 Waiter, scoop and chat with a bold opinion that this man was a lot better than the Snyder
 Man. Wow. Wow. Whoa. The famously bad Snyder Superman.
 I was going to say, so is everything. Yeah.
 So is me just telling you about Superman. Jesus. So bad. But yeah, it's all right.
 But I don't know. I don't see how they're going to build the franchise off all this,
 but we'll see. Now, we'll see. Yeah, I don't care about that, though.
 But that's the whole thing. No, no, no, no, no. James Gunn's in charge
 of making new DC films. Fact. This, this supposed, you know, the Superman has to be responsible
 for every single movie that's going to come out after this. I think it's just not something
 that has to happen. Okay. All right.
 I think the DC is fucking up timing wise bigger than bigger than just will they be able to
 do a sequel or universe around this? I think everybody is ready to take a break from superhero
 movies. I think that I think yes, the majority of people around are ready to be done with
 superhero movies for a little while. I know, which, which I know leads me to why DC is
 such a terrible company. The best movie they've made recently is just too little too late.
 Yeah, it is. Like a good superhero movie. Everybody's
 tired of watching superhero movies. Shit. And it really is a matter of timing. Like
 you say, Jacob, and I think it's more to the point of at least for me, my personal self,
 not only am I a little bit done with the whole onslaught of superheroes, but I think more,
 more for me, I feel like I can't even, I can't even believe in this shit at all at this point
 because no one's stepping up to do shit. When did you believe in the end? The Superman?
 Oh, I, I don't believe in the Superman. I believe in the spider-man. Ah, there it is.
 But just leave sticky webs everywhere, everywhere that you go. But I don't know. It's just,
 it's just hard to, to, to get your gumption up for that, uh, you know, truth and justice
 stuff when truth and justice is under such direct attack in a lot of places, name one
 place that it's not going the way you think. The fucking Smithsonian? Uh, no, uh, yeah.
 I mean, it's, it's preposterous. That's the thing. And I just kinda like, well, all right.
 Listen to this podcast though, that I was trying for a while to have a no sarcasm rule,
 uh, when I was talking about things and it's just too overwhelming. I can't. Agreed. I
 can't. Agreed. 100% agreed. I can't. I can't be genuine all the time, people. You don't
 want to hear us speaking earnestly about this. And I don't want to, I don't want to speak
 earnestly about it at this point, but I want to, I want to make my opinion known to a point,
 but I mean, I, yeah, hold on. I'm going to take a moment and just speak earnestly about
 it. You know, Vern, I'm really tired of the Smithsonian getting changed around to show
 what other people are. That's right, Vern. I'm super tired of it. I'm going to say Christmas
 and go to jail. Vern. I went to the convenience food Mart the other day and they done changed
 it up. They called the Super Gulp the big sipper. Damn it, Vern. And they're racing
 our history, Vern. Anyone young listening to our podcasts, uh, sorry. That means under
 40. Yeah, just did a, a very good Jim Varney, a pull there. Uh, Jacob, I like that. Yes.
 Ernest goes to camp was a thing. Yeah. And then Ernest does anything became a thing.
 And Ernest goes to jail where he got electrical superpowers. Ernest goes to camp crocodile.
 That's the new one. Uh, I remember actually, I remember watching this movie. I remember
 watching Ernest goes to camp. Uh, we would have different, uh, different, different families
 would step up sometimes, take care of, uh, take care of us, you know, uh, give my dad
 a break when he was just raising us as a single dad. And, uh, I remember being at the Chadwicks,
 uh, they were lovely family that would take care of my, my little brother and I for weekend.
 And um, uh, they had, uh, a daughter who was like eight years older than us. Yeah. Oh man.
 She was, she was gorgeous in taste of like, uh, you know, whatever. And so you were all
 in love with her. Yeah, exactly. And everybody was in love with the daughter and we're sitting
 there at, uh, you know, 11 and 12 being like, you want to want to hang. And I remember,
 I remember torturing her, um, as, uh, uh, me loving and pointing out every single joke
 I loved. And Ernest goes to camp to her. Like she was trying to like, just for minutes on
 him and be like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. She was
 trying to like leave the room and I was like, no, no, the golf cart came back. That's the
 same ghost golf cart from the beginning. Amazing. That's amazing. That daughter name was Sarah
 Lowe. His name was Saint Mother Teresa. I mean like all she's thinking is like these
 poor kids with their dead mom, I guess I can sit here and listen to the fucking breakdown
 of Ernest goes to camp. Is this what dead moms do to kids brains? I can turn them onto
 this Jim Varney shit. Jesus Christ. He got mushed out in the head real quick. I either
 volunteered as a boy soup kitchen, or I guess listen to this drivel for an hour. Let's just
 do that. Oh damn it. Well, Saturday, uh, keeping on my comic book theme, my local guy, he's
 moving soon and he's having a, he's having a big sale on a bunch of his, uh, dollar books
 and what, what have you. And, uh, so he's got his cheap bins and then, uh, he, he made
 them all his dollar books. He sold them for a dime a piece for this one day sale. Yeah.
 That's less than a dollar. I got 160 some books for like 16 bucks. It was amazing. That's
 awesome. Uh, so yeah, I, I, I had a real good sweep there. Got a bunch of X men and X force
 and a bunch of little Nicky nacks, all kinds of weird stuff. Uh, some, somebody swooped
 in before me and got all the Spider-Man, but that's all right. Uh, I've got a lot enough
 Spider-Man, but, uh, yeah. So it's been very, uh, very comic book heavy week for me here,
 which is nice. Um, and then I went to, and let me go to another comic book shop. We went
 together out at the Pittsburgh mills, the Pittsburgh mills. Have I told you guys about
 the fucking Pittsburgh mills? No baseball team. So the Pittsburgh mills is an almost
 abandoned mall. Okay. They've got, it's a dead mall, but it's got like three stores
 still left in it. And currently it has a spirit Halloween, a Macy's and a giant comic book
 shop. And that's about what it's good. Then I say giant comic book shop. I mean, giant
 comic book shop. It is huge. Takes up like five storefronts, ginormous anyway. Uh, when
 because there's also a lot of eateries right there around the Pittsburgh mills mall. That's
 where we go to Chili's sometimes. So we were going to go, if you do a Google search for
 the Pittsburgh mills mall, the first thing that comes up is why did the Pittsburgh mills
 mall close? Yeah. And it's, and it, exactly. This mall is closed. Go ahead and look up
 Pittsburgh mills mall potholes. Because as soon as I suggested, let's drive out to the
 mills and Anne agreed, I said, I'll drive if you're not going to give me guff about
 the potholes. And she's like, I'll drive because there are God sized cracks in the earth that
 await await your vehicle. And Anne just can't, she's like, ah, anytime I hit one the wrong
 way, it's like, forget it. She will drive around the whole parking lot. So the, the,
 the place closed quote unquote, the mills closed and everything's in this weird litigation
 space, right? And it comes down to the stores that are renting their quick timeout aren't
 just clear. You said I'll go if you don't complain about the potholes. And her answer
 was I'll drive. Yes. So yes. And was like, no, no, I'm going to complain about the potholes.
 So I guess I should drive. That's it. Like, yeah, she's like, I'll just, I'll just drive.
 She's like, here's the other thing. She's like, I'm going to complain about them. That's
 a non-starter. You know, you can't put that on the table. I wouldn't, I'm going to veto
 that right away. That was done. If the only way that my husband can drive me is if I don't
 complain about the potholes, I suppose I'll do the drive. That's what she said. And I'm
 like, okay, fine. Now I heard that conversation happen. I accepted it and I moved on because
 I have been a part of that conversation word for word. Absolutely. And to, to her credit,
 she's been having to go from store to store all around this district, right? Yeah. So
 she goes, there's a cup, there's a store out by the mills that she goes to. So she knows
 these streets. So she knows where the killer potholes are. So she has some sense of the
 navigation of the streets and I don't knows the streets. Don't ever question it. Don't
 ever question it. Anne McPheeters knows the street. It was like, uh, I think it's called
 like a Harbor pilot or whatever, but basically, um, when you bring big ships into, to ports,
 they, they, they, they take a small boat. They shepherd out a guy who knows how to navigate.
 Yeah. Yeah. The tugboat to get you away from the rock. Yeah. I like that. And they could
 fucking use that out there. And as the Harbor pilot of potholes getting to this thing, like,
 no, no, we're going to, we're going to go sideways here for about 25 feet. We're going
 to drift for a while. Look up the fucking potholes. I'm crazy. The Pittsburgh mills
 mall is currently experiencing a significant pothole problem with a recent lawsuits filed
 by the mall's owners, uh, and even by neighbor, uh, neighboring businesses due to the poor
 condition of the roads on the private property. Yes, it is terrible. We, we finally got and
 went long ways around to go to the chilies. And then when we finally got out of the chilies,
 we, we, we had our dinner and then we're heading out of the chilies. She waited for traffic
 to stop to be done. They were still in the mall complex. She pulled out into the wrong
 side of the street, drove down the wrong side of the road for about 90 feet. I know these,
 I know these streets like the back of my hand. She's just like, she's like, we're not even,
 I'm not even playing that game today. She's like, I'm not even doing it. Oh, and the dance
 we have to do all around. It's insane. You know, like, uh, it was like the, they'll tell
 like, uh, some of, you know, if someone's as late with their, their pregnancy, like,
 like, like they're nine months and it's just so, oh no, they'll tell you to go get on a
 rough road to go on a wagon ride. I'm saying we should, we should monetize this on the
 rough road. They say going like a hay wagon ride. You're right. The Pittsburgh mills pregnancy
 popper, the labor maker, labor maker, the labor maker tour, the baby bringer, the Pittsburgh
 mills pothole baby bringer tour, the baby popper router. Come on over. My God. I can
 only imagine driving around, riding in a wagon, being pulled in that parking lot. You would,
 you would injure your spine. You would not come out of that without serious injuries.
 Yeah. You know, who else is willing to rattle babies out of mothers? And that is the following
 sponsor today's show. Man Manley's ice cream social is brought to you by Roald Dahl's guide
 to writing about abnormally large objects. That's right. That's from boson scoop pronounced
 a boson scoop in a 20, 23. That's when he gave it to us. This is Roald Dahl's guide
 to writing about abnormally large objects. Hello. It is I famed children's author and
 raconteur Roald Dahl. You may remember me from such wonderful child's tales as James
 and the giant peach. Well, that was my final draft after I experimented with several other
 large objects before I landed on James and the giant peach, there was Kevin and the gargantuan
 grapes. And there was also Stephen and the abnormally rotund orange. I also wrote one
 called Bethany and the big old snowball. Catherine finds a fucking huge quarter. That last one
 turned out to just be a silver dollar. Silver dollar the dumb lady. She was just a dumb
 person. He was a dumb person. I went on to write more dumb stories later. But finally,
 of course, I landed on James and the giant peach. Yes. Now, if you want to come up with
 your own person and the large thing story, I encourage you to do so. But don't you dare
 use the name James? Don't you dare use the adjective giant? Don't you dare use peaches?
 Those are my intellectual properties. Hi, I'm Jimmy the large nectarine. And I would like
 to tell you guys a sort of tale. Go ahead, Jim. Jimmy the large nectarine. Yes, that's
 right. I feel you may be dangerously encroaching upon my IP. In what way? In what way? Rolled?
 How do I say your name? Say it how you want, you philanderer. I'll see you in court. Listen,
 what you've done is you've gone around my idea of having an individual involved with
 a large object. Yeah, no, I am the large object. And you yourself have become the personification
 of the object. Yeah. So you have anthropomorphized. That would be like me having a book called
 James the giant peach. I'm just hearing dollar signs. That's all I'm hearing. That's absurd.
 And you are your Jimmy the giant nectarine. That's right. Originally, it was me and the
 giant nectarine. But the book, not to spoil it, is about us finding a device that combined
 us into the giant object you see before you now. Like the fly. Yes. Like the modern adaptation
 of the fly. So you're Brendal, Jimmy. Yeah. Yes. Oh, I like this. Say, would you like
 to come to my writing cottage that I have out in the back of my house? Sure. But just,
 you know, there's a lot of odd things to being a giant nectarine that maybe your house is
 not prepared for. What do you mean? Every time I sit down, I squeeze juice everywhere.
 Oh, yeah. Do go on. Oh, that seems like a feature of the book to you, Ralt. Oh, we're
 about to have some sweet, sweet times, I think, you and I, James. Mr. Jim. Mind if I dip a
 finger in that peach pit of yours? My gosh. My gosh. Sure. Enter a scoops of checkout.
 And if I put a finger in your navel orange? That's just upsetting. Yeah. Just upsetting.
 Nectarines. I went to a music gig the other night and there was a fan there. There was
 a woman who is a fan of this music group and I guess follows them around from different
 gigs and had made them all baked goods, had made the entire band baked goods. The fan
 cakes as the fan cakes. Tiff likes to say. But I mean, brought them a veritable buffet
 of baked desserts. It was so much. It was so many cookies. There was a cake. It was
 all this stuff. And yeah, I was like, I am a little jealous of this right now. There's
 a fan of this band who brought in enough baked goods for at least 10 people. Oh, wow. Dedication.
 Yeah. Well, what were the things? Did you eat it? What's going on? Oh, I ate some of
 it for sure. I definitely ate some of the fan cakes. You know me. I eat the fan cakes.
 You know I eat the fan cakes. So then you can't be jealous. There were cookies. There
 were brownies. I can be jealous. I can be jealous of what I want to be jealous of, Paul.
 Don't tell me what I can be jealous of. You got the benefit. That's true. That is true.
 I did get the benefit. It was like lemon bars. It was really good. Oh yeah. Real good lemon
 bar. Oh yeah. Real good lemon bar can be great. We got the Wagner's market right up the street
 from us, right? On an unrelated note, my stomach is completely pregnant now. Oh no. Swallowing
 so much sperm. I got a I got only fan cakes. Wait a minute. Clumsy. Oh God. Only fan cakes.
 Well you know what we got to do, Jacob? We got to get you on a wagon. We got to get you
 on a wagon in the Pittsburgh Mills parking lot real quick. Rattle something loose. Get
 that get that cake baby out of you. Time to rattle it loose. Do it. Do it. Do it. Oh man.
 That same night I discovered that several of the Fremont Street performers are now trying
 you know when they when they shut all the lights down on Fremont Street and they do
 the shows on the canopy. They do like the video shows on the canopy above there. Right.
 So I guess several of the street performers have now instead of taking a break while the
 canopy does its thing, they try to dance along to it. Okay. Because I guess they're not allowed
 to do their act while the canopy is playing, but they can just dance along to the canopy.
 And so they stop doing several people stop doing whatever act they're doing on Fremont
 Street and just start awkwardly dancing along with whatever is happening on the big Fremont
 Street canopy. And they expect people to continue tipping them and or stay at their location
 to watch the show restart after the canopy stops doing its thing. That's like y'all
 have the wrong idea on what to do with this situation. I appreciate y'all trying something.
 This isn't it. My heart goes out to those poor motherfuckers. Oh my god. That is the
 worst gig on planet Earth. I think I did stop yesterday and watch a street magician though
 on my on my stroll of the strip yesterday. There was a street magician in front of Bellagio.
 And so I saw that guy. Oh, maybe he Yeah, he made my faith in humanity disappear. He
 wasn't that bad. No, no, no, no, no. I'm just saying in the general that the poor performers
 have to be out there. Oh, Huskin and buskin. Oh, man. Oh, Jeff Loomis points out that the
 top five Fremont Street performers pull in some bank. There is sure there is a real cottage
 industry that happens in Las Vegas with the street performers, especially down at Fremont
 Street. Yeah, we don't know whether the guy used to get paid 20 bucks to get kicked in
 the balls. We don't know whether he stopped that for medical reasons or whether he's now
 retired to a lavish island. We don't know. Yeah, I think or because he died. They did
 some kind of ordinance on it. I think they actually I think that guy that Matt's talking
 about died. Oh, really? Oh, the nut kicking guy. I think he did from a nut kick. I someone
 kicked his nuts into outer space, just fucking Thanos did just. The legend of moon nuts.
 Your testicles are like planets. Boom. No, I think I don't I don't I don't know. I don't
 remember anything about him dying, but I did think that I think they stopped him doing
 that. Yeah. Oh, you think they probably died because he had because he stopped. That was
 the only thing keeping his balls from growing out of control over his body. Secretly restarted
 his heart every time. It was the it was the only way he could keep his balls from becoming
 so big that they would keep him in his house. They found him in his house stuck. He woke
 up one morning like Kafka and he couldn't get him like he's like Gregor Samsa. And he's
 like, Oh shit, it happened. The balls got too big. I can't get out the door. And I left
 my phone in the kitchen. Like, what would you do if your balls were too big to get through
 the door? Yeah. And you left your phone in the kitchen. You're dead. Yeah. Yeah. You're
 dead. Because you're not over. You're not gonna What are you gonna pull your balls off,
 make them? No, no, you're right. I'm dead. It's the only option. Chaotic. But Chad says,
 Sure. But if I make a living kicking men in the nuts, I'm a sex worker, quote unquote.
 Right? Well, someone was a savior for that man to keep his balls in check. Because otherwise,
 they were gonna just keep going. Yeah. Oh, according to chat GPT, the the guy on Fremont
 Street who got kicked in the balls has indeed passed away. Wow. Oh, no. Yeah. But we don't
 know what from what? I don't know what from. Yeah. I particular torsion. That's it. I passed
 away after hospitalization, according to a social media claim. No mainstream, blah, blah,
 blah. Not allergy. This is a good time to mention the zoom chat. If you are a patreon

 fun.com and you can too. Oh my god. That's all it takes. Jacob cloud on a brothel on
 the chat is pointing this out. Now I can't let's see it either. He was really thrown
 because your Las Vegas hat. If you look at it differently, that logo, the LV can look
 like a four seven. And he thought you were wearing a Donald Trump. Oh, yeah, totally.
 It totally can look like a 47. It really does. I don't see it at all. So look with the L
 and the V connect that can be the four and then the that's a four outer crop of the V
 cover up be a seven up the far side of your of your set of your V. Okay, cover the far
 side of your V. There you go. You see the four? Okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah. See the four.
 Okay. And then he said if you let that go, you see that one's got the little thing of
 it. So it looks like a seven. Oh, and that looks like a seven. It kind of does look like
 a 47. Another reason to be in the zoom chat. Preaching fun.com. I can't unsee it now.
 That's really fun. Who said that first cloud on a brothel? Who is the person that I'm angry
 at for ruining that? Man, I like this. All you got to do is black out that little dot
 at the top of the V. All I've got to do is put a piece of tape over the hat and not wear
 it ever again. That's all I've got to do. Set this cap on fire. Easy peasy living squeezy.
 Nothing that kerosene in a match can't fix. No problem. Oh, shit. You know who else is
 going to show up and ruin things that I previously liked? And that's the following sponsor. Today's
 show, Matt Madley's Ice Cream Social is brought to you by Corey the Camel's Bail Bonds from

 the old four bar hospital, the old, what are the other nicknames for the jail? The slammer?
 Yes. What else they call it? The crossbar motel, huh? The stinky place where you go
 when you're in jail. What's the other nicknames for the jail? Dr. Hassan Pfeffer's Fart Box?
 You know, those classic, classic nicknames. Oh, I am going to Dr. Hassan Pfeffer's Fart
 Box. Oh, well then you're in need of my services. I am. If you end up in Dr. Hassan Pfeffer's
 Fart Box, all you got to do is call me and I'll get you out lickety split. Oh, I don't
 want to get out. I've been waiting for months to go in there. You've been trying to get
 into Dr. Hassan Pfeffer's Fart Box for a while. I love the smell. Yeah. Not a lot of people
 do. It's the hottest club in town. I can vouch for, I can vouch for the bail bondsman, Corey
 here. Thank you. I was, true story, wrapped up in a Las Vegas sexting rig and as an Israeli
 citizen, I got bailed out and then just got on a plane and flew the country. All right.
 And that was shortly before he became president of Israel. Another success story, everybody.
 This happened last week in Las Vegas. Wait a minute, what happened? All right, commercial
 over. Hey, he's good to check out. Matt, go ahead. Oh, also Dr. Hassan Pfeffer's Fart
 Box. That's a great costume idea. Oh, yeah, yeah. Because that's open to interpretation.
 There has to be a Dutch oven costume on Amazon. No, there was a child sex ring arrest. They
 arrested like eight people in connection with a child sex ring here in Las Vegas. There's
 a big- Eight children? Eight people, eight- They didn't arrest them fucking kids. They
 arrested those children. It wasn't ICE. Those kids are still running the streets. It wasn't
 ICE. It wasn't ICE. They weren't arresting- These are actual police. Okay. These are the
 police that don't arrest children. Yeah. But yeah, so one of them was an Israeli citizen
 and they put his bond at like, I don't know. I don't know the amount, but it was a low
 amount. So he just paid it. He just paid it and went to the airport, got on a plane and
 just left the country. Okay. You know, he probably didn't realize that he wasn't technically
 allowed to do it. So there's a bit of a dust-up over, you know, with all the people involved.
 Be like, how the hell did you let that happen? It's a big controversial story here in local
 Los Angeles. Oh, Leon Kassab is saying this was not just an Israeli citizen, but a government
 official. Ah. So that makes it a little more sticky. And I don't guess we have any kind
 of extradition deal there. Oh, you know, if anything Israel does, it's played by the rules.
 So- Right. Holy, an Israel government official was arrested in Las Vegas earlier this month
 on charges of luring a child for sex. Yeah. Like full on. Yeah. Like with a straight up
 fishing pole. Yeah. Candy bar. There was a bobber and everything. Wow. You know what
 I mean, Vern? Yeah. If we're going to make bobber jokes, I might as well go back and
 make earnest jokes too. It was Lake Mead. A lot of people stock their ponds with fresh
 fish. We stock Lake Mead with children, hungry children. Let's see. Oh, he had a $10,000
 bail. He had a $10,000 bail. He posted that, uh, that standard amount for the charge. Didn't
 appear before the judge was not required to surrender his passport and returned to Israel
 two days later on a pre-scheduled flight. They could have just looked at flights he
 already had scheduled. The chat is filling in the mad details here. Winter scoop says,
 we do have an extradition treaty with Israel. They're claiming he wasn't the right guy.
 They're claiming and then Newman comes in and says, this is an earnest Lexington, Kentucky
 native. Wow. This guy was from Kentucky. Oh, this is really government official, but he's
 from Kentucky. He's originally from Kentucky. Apparently. Well, that's what Newman's saying.
 Yeah. Right. Well, I trust Newman. I, you know, if it comes, if it's, if it's a Kentucky
 history thing, Newman knows it. That's what we know. That is true. Well, I mean, we know
 how to fish for children. Right.
 Speaking of children, this is a good segue, right? Um, so I was recently, uh, haunted
 with, uh, what, what, you know, nature versus nurture genetics versus whatever as, uh, one
 of my children, one of my children has started wearing a gold chain around his neck. Oh,
 you took the kids out of Jersey, but you can't take the Jersey out of the kids. I like to,
 I, I was, I bit my tongue because I wanted to be like, Oh my God, you look so Jersey
 right now. You fucking T neck reject, get that shit off of you. Have you seen the South
 Park where one of the boys finds out he's originally from New Jersey and, uh, and the
 mother goes full New Jersey for him. Oh my God. I was doing a show last night and I brought
 up San Antonio and the crowd all cheered for San Antonio. And I said, are you all from
 San Antonio? And they go, no, or whatever. Like they're just for cheering or whatever.
 It's just a nice place. Next girl gets up. She says she's from Jersey and no one applauds
 at all. Not, not a single clap. One boo from the back. I was like, wow, we just love hearing
 the word San Antonio that we burst into applause. But you know, Jersey just kills it. Kills
 the mood. I get it. I get it. There are rules. And then, uh, my other child, this is really
 daunting. Wait, wait, younger, younger, worse than a, you're still in a gold chain. Olders
 were in the gold chain. Great. What else is, is there anything on the gold chain? No, that's,
 that's what makes it simple and elegant. Yeah. Slow your roll. I got questions. I got questions.
 Am I going to start giving gold chains to Matt's oldest son? Yes, I am. Has he been
 watching the A team? Uh, no, he's just been watching, uh, I rock Z for furbishing videos
 on YouTube. Okay. Well he's coming by it natural. You know, this one has the tee tops on it.
 A lot of people don't like the tee tops on it. I tell those people, go fuck yourself.
 That's what I tell people. If they tell me they don't like the rock with the tee top
 on it, you can fuck yourself right now. Come down to the shore and say, you don't like
 the tee top. Oh shit. No. Okay. So if that channel doesn't already exist, somebody hates
 money. Oh, I'm sure it does. If fucking is this situation from Jersey shore is not doing
 I rock Z restore videos on YouTube, then the situation hates money. Let's go down. Let's
 take a drive out here to the dump. Okay. Let's go to the dump and let's see what we can get
 on our I rock mission. Hey, look at this piece of shit over here. It looks like a flattened
 piece of garbage. Looks like your mom's boy. I got to, but what do you know? It's an old
 Iraq that's been through the crusher, but we can dig some gold out of these here Hills.
 Look here, friend. Look at that. Oh, we got ourselves a volume knob. That's a legit factory
 Iraq volume knob. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Weren't you on the Jersey shore? Was I ever, I am
 the fucking Jersey shore. Yeah. I wrote, I wrote shampooed on Snooki. How about that?
 How about that? I still got the other name. I couldn't think of all I can think of the
 other. I still got basically a shroud of Turin on my belly from where that lady went to town
 on me. I got the Snooki shroud of Turin on my Fupa. I got the Snooki shroud of Turin
 blazing on my Fupa forever from a fake tan juice and her hay scoops at checkout. Oh,
 that is upsetting. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Matt. Yes. Is this the beginning? Is this, is this
 the end? Is this, is this it? Or is it now I gotta get a bracelet. Now I gotta get a
 hearing. Now is this just, are we testing the waters? What's happening? His ears pierced.
 He wants, he wants two sleeve tattoos. Wait, on one arm. Is this for real? He wants two
 sleeve tattoos, but on the same arm. No, no, no. Uh, no. What, what do you, has he asked
 for a tattoo? No, I wouldn't put it past him, but no. He has asked for a lot of tanning
 lotion though. What do you, damn, I need a bunch of self tanning lotion. Latter day scoop
 found the fucking shroud of, shroud of Snooki. Oh, no. Oh, that's, that's as upsetting as
 the story. That's exactly what it looked like. Do, do you think, what do you think his tattoo
 request might be? Um, he would probably get a Spider-Man tattoo or, uh, uh, uh, something
 with, with the band or something like that. He's really into music. All right. Drumming.
 The Spider-Man is the way to go. That's eternal. Yeah. All right. The naked lady, uh, mud flaps,
 uh, the, the, the silhouette naked lady on the mud flaps. He did say he wanted, uh, three
 different tribal symbols on his lower back for peace, tranquility and, uh, and money.
 But from different, but from different tribes, three different tribes. The mud flap tattoo.
 That eliminated the, that, that area of the tattoo, right? Like you don't get tattoos
 in your lower back anymore, right? Like that, calling it tramp stamp eliminated. I think
 the tramp stamp is out. Yeah. Yeah. The cleave sleeve is what's coming through now. The cleave
 sleeve is in for sure. I see a lot of cleave sleeves, but I don't see a lot of tramp stamps.
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've also started seeing a lot of, uh, a lot of ladies here
 in Las Vegas walking around in the, in the very short dresses with the, uh, with the
 leg tattoos, like the leg sleeve. Oh, leg sleeves. What do you, what do you call the
 leg sleeve tattoo? Is there a name for that? Somebody in the chat tell me if there's a
 name for that. But it's where they do the whole leg, just like you do like the sleeve
 of the arm. Hot? The gam glam. Where the scoop just says milk leg. I'm sorry, that's scooper
 Nova girl. That's the milk leg. Pant leg. The ink leg. Ink leg. Ink leg. Ink leg. Or
 just leggings. Gam glam. Actually the unconsolidated. Gam glam. That's it. Gam glam. It's a gam
 glam. Glam, gam, gam, glam. Yeah. Yeah. A mistake. The mistake. Yes. That's pretty handy. Uh,
 and my youngest son, we have like, uh, this is, you know, this is going to sound a little
 bougie guys, but we have, we have, we have toaster tongs. Do you have toaster tongs? Toaster
 tongs. Yeah. They're like basically like wooden. To take your thing out of your toaster? Yeah,
 like wooden, like little wooden tongs. They're smaller than like classic tongs. They're wooden.
 Yeah. They're almost like, like, uh, people who can't use chopsticks, you know, use fake
 chopsticks. Oh, I got you. I got you. But why would they go with wood for a hot thing?
 It doesn't conduct electricity. Yeah. So if you jam it. You can stick that all the way
 down the toaster and not kill yourself. Yeah. I see. Yeah. Okay. And, um, uh, there's two
 because I one time used it to get food out of, uh, some other object and my wife got
 angry that I use the, the toaster tongs on another food object on the improper thing.
 So I was never in the toaster and a bit of like, you know, 20% rage, 50% sarcasm bought
 a second pair of toaster tongs. Good. Okay. To be like, I'll use these however I please.
 And, um, uh, my son spontaneously grabbed both toaster tongs and started moving around
 my kitchen like a crab. Oh, no. And I was like, it was like, I saw a ghost. I was like,
 wha, what are you? Have you, you've never done that for, right? He does not know my,
 my, that I was the crab at Starbucks. I was, when I worked at Starbucks, I used to move
 around the whole store and cower into a corner with the two pastry tops. Nurture versus nature.
 That memory straight up came out of your ballsack. That's just, there's just nothing else to
 that. Yeah, it's science. Your tongue. Yeah, it is science. It is science. Well, you know,
 they're finding out more and more of that crazy shit about just how much, yeah, how
 much DNA memory there is and how much, and I mean, you know, cause like, like with, with
 women, uh, they're born with, uh, easy now we're going to be in a Sarah Hester Ross clip
 right now. We're three guys talking about women. Right, right, right, right. Uh, how
 about, uh, female presenting individuals? Okay, go for it. Okay. Okay. Male presenting
 individuals are, are, are born with the microphone that that, you know, that's from there, you
 know, they have them in the womb. All right. I mean, yeah. Like as the, as the zygote develops.
 Yeah. Yeah. No zygotes develop into babies, into a fetus. Yeah. Like early on you've got
 that genetic material that's going to make the next generation and they're discovering
 more and more that events that occur during pregnancy to the mother can translate genetic
 information habits, different stuff. Like, uh, like they did a study on like, uh, groups
 of people who are experiencing famine and how their progeny were affected by that. And
 not even that first generation, that second generation sometimes too. I don't know. It's
 interesting. It is interesting. I mean, I'm always blown away by animals learning behavior,
 right? Or like all of a sudden all these animals, like, no, like crows in a certain region all
 know how to like navigate traffic lights and things like that. Right. Or like, yeah, things
 with it. And, and the light fly over them. That, but by the way, that's how they navigate
 the traffic lights. Yeah. Yeah. They've, they've, yeah. Whereas crows in the past would just
 fly right into them. Right, right. They've, they've evolved, but, uh, uh, they're learning.
 Did you, did you see not, they are evolving now, Jacob, did you hear about that? I'm being
 stupid, but I know what's actually happening too. No, no, no, no, no. Did you, did you
 read this article, uh, Matt, about the crows that have all gone mute? No. Yeah. So there's
 this whole region, uh, of crows that have gone completely mute and the scientists are
 looking for the cause, the cause, the cause, the cause. Oh, it's over. Oh, I killed Jacob.
 I killed Jacob, everyone. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. There's just sad emojis coming in on the chat
 now. Just depression. Uh, let's just go live feedback in the chat. You got some LOL, some
 laughing faces, you got, but you didn't get one side. Andy said I murdered that one. So
 thank you. You have three sad faces. This is looking like a 60% hit of a joke. We've
 got it. We've got to see you at the cone. Hey man, I'll take 60% any day. That joke
 is for the birds. Yes. I'm raving about it to my wife. Leon. See, now we're rolling.
 Now we got it going. Oh, Mr. Head Scoop thought that it was a real fact coming through. Yeah,
 Mr. Head Scoop, that is your fault. That's just on you. I, I hate to blame the victim
 on this, but that is your fault. Brogan says 60% of the time I'm funny every time. Yeah,
 that's generous. Thank you Brogan. That's generous. I don't give a flock. Boo. At any
 rate, I will submit my youngest son for genetic studies for comedy transference. Good. Oh
 my God. That's so crazy. I've never been a prouder dad. I've never been a prouder dad.
 That's pretty amazing. That's pretty amazing. Yeah. Has all of the strife about you getting
 the wrong thing out of the, with the toaster tongs, has all of that been settled or is
 there still tension in the house? I don't know. I never see my wife. I don't know. I
 don't know. Oh, I saw her yesterday. She was angry. She was mad about something. I couldn't
 tell what, but she was hot about something. But yeah, yeah, yeah. You should do Cisco's
 the tong song. Oh, tong to tong tong tong. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, someone already memed you Paul slaking
 fool. It's not a murder of crows unless there's probable cause. There you go. Oh, slaking
 classic. Now I'm mad at you too. Now I'm mad at you. So, uh, one of my kids is now in middle
 school. Uh huh. They start middle school at seven a.m. Because they hate you. That's it.
 Wait a minute. They say, they say cause the bus schedule. So like grade school starts
 at nine a.m. And middle school starts at seven a.m. And they say it's now busing. This is,
 this is something where I legit have beef with the way they do it because there are
 tons of studies that say this is terribly detrimental. And it's especially detrimental
 to children in that age range. I know what beef is. I have had beef experience. I know
 adolescents need more sleep. They've proven that man. It's fucked up. Oh, I, I agree.
 Uh, it's, it's, it's a real, I know you do. I know it's not on you. It's a real game changer.
 Uh, I would be so awkward if this is where Paul found out that Matt was the one who set
 that rule up. I was like, look, it's the buses guys. You the one? You son of a bitch. I'll
 never forgive you. This podcast is finished. Uh, it was even worse. What's up with them
 not looking out for kids is, uh, middle school, they had signups for cross country. And so
 Mike signed up for cross country and it is 105 degrees out right now. Yeah. And so I
 figured they can't be, they must have them inside of the gym or they must like, you know,
 take it easy or do something different. And I go to pick up my kid from after cross country
 and his face is just bright red, like a tomato, like absolutely. Oh no. Your son is a, uh,
 a fair skin young man. Yes. Also anyway. Yeah. He is porcelain, uh, skin. Yeah. And, uh,
 it was a bright red tomato. And I was like, I said, is that sunburn or from exhaustion
 of running? And he says, I combo. He says, I don't know that I don't, I honestly don't
 know. Probably is the answer. Probably. Oh, this was like, I don't know why I look like
 I'm a tomato right now. That's horrible. I said, why are they having you run when it's
 above a hundred and, uh, five degrees. And he said, Oh, cause you know, we're, we're
 part of the national program. And so we have to, we have to compare what we're doing to
 all the other schools who are doing it. And most schools don't, uh, aren't in a hot area
 like ours. And so it's like a false sport on the national. Oh, I got you. I said, that's
 not a good enough answer for me. Just so you're just so we're clear. I don't care. I don't
 care how you fare nationally. My child. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care how
 you fare nationally in this thing that I already don't care about. I don't care about children's
 cross country running. So why would I care about how you line up against other kids from
 Milwaukee? Yeah. I just, I was like, what are we doing? And even, uh, my youngest son
 was like, uh, we did recess indoors. Cause the principal said we won't, we won't go do
 recess outdoors if it's, uh, if it's a 102 or above. And I said, somebody at the school
 has figured it out, but I said a hundred and two, who gave that two degree variance to
 like, I was thinking a hundred degrees. That's the official number, Matt. That's the number
 that you want to pay attention to is the one oh two. That's really crazy. Amateurs pay
 attention to a hundred professionals pay attention to one Oh two. It's a, it's 101 boys roll
 out the soccer balls. Let's go. We got an iron thermometer. If it, if it takes up to
 one Oh three, we're heading inside and it's madness. I mean, they're, uh, the soccer practices
 start next week. And I'm like, it is still August. Why are we pretending like it's not
 August in Las Vegas? Why are we like, why are we doing this cargo cult of education?
 It's still October. It can still be October in Las Vegas and be that hot. Um, Oh my God,
 that's awful. It is, it is ridiculous. That, that is why when I joined the cross country
 bear jamboree, I didn't fuck around. I just, I just did the animatronic jug band. I was,
 I was an animatronic jug band, a fat bear that sat down. I was like, Oh, can I just
 sign up for cross country bear jamboree? Paul ran cross country a couple of times in the
 suit. It didn't end well. No, that was awful. Yeah. I have an update for some of the scoops
 who told me, uh, basically there's a, there's a, a K-pop Disney show where they do K-pop
 versions of different Disney songs and stuff, because my kids have ever since they went
 to that concert have not stopped listening, just cannot stop listening to the soundtrack
 to zombies and descendants movies. Oh, so you're trying to switch it up on them. And
 so they said some people said the music from the K-pop one's actually pretty good. And
 uh, so I try to turn my kids onto that and they saw it coming a mile away and they were
 like, no, no, no, thanks. Have you tried black pink? I was like, Hey, I heard there's like
 a K-pop show on Disney. Maybe we should watch that tonight. And they were like, no, fuck
 you old man. Did you try black? Nice try. Nark. Do some like black pink concert footage
 on YouTube and stuff. I bet they'll like that. All right. Yes. I think keelers of the age
 where I think black pink will turn his head. Okay. Yeah. Black pink is good. He'll be like,
 and they are, and they are legit good music too. Yeah. Yeah. You'll like they are. They're
 really, all right. I'll, I'll, I'll do my best. I'll do anything to stop listening to
 throw on black pink and throw on some fucking baby metal, dude. Like some baby metal concert
 footage is awesome. As you know, uh, early in the summer, you know, we took them to MJ
 the musical. So Michael Jackson was pretty prominent and the thing now we have mixed
 emotions about Michael Jackson's legacy, but separating artists. I don't mind some Michael
 Jackson music in my car. Um, his propofall from Michael Jackson, uh, Michael Jackson
 no longer played at all. Alive, uh, no longer alive, but also no longer played in my car.
 And I guess I can't complain. It'd be like, I, what happened? I want my kids listening
 to Michael Jackson. I can't really, can't really, can't really pound that. No. Chaotic
 clumsy. If Jacob could wear a 47 hat, you can listen to Michael Jackson. What has this
 podcast? So man, that does just look like a four. God damn it. God fucking damn it.
 Jacob, are you like now retroactively looking back at a couple of weird thumbs up you've
 gotten walking to Caesar's, you know, walking about a lot of people just yelling things
 about, uh, like January 6th to me. Peaceful protest. Am I right? High five. Yeah. Oh shit.
 Uh, let the protesters out of jail. A lot of people say that to me. Fuck the Smithsonian.
 Huh? Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's come up a lot. Man, it all makes sense now. Wait, like,
 okay, here's what that's like. Seriously. We've lost the plot. We can not, we can not care
 about a Cracker Barrel logo. We just can't. No, you just can't. We can't. We can't. By
 the way, how weird was it that I called this weeks ago when I was in Mesa, Arizona, I made
 a joke that it was going to be just called barrel after. Yeah. And, uh, and I, I, I predicted
 a dust up with, with manga and, uh, and Cracker Barrel. Of course. Just, just like the Simpsons,
 we predict everything. That's right. They're looking, they're looking for anything to distract
 from a certain dead pedophile. What? Uh huh. Uh huh. But Maxwell died? Like it wasn't even
 like they changed the name to something like, you know, like General Mills and like Antrimima
 and all other stuff. Like they changed, they changed stuff. They just took off the weird
 guy that you couldn't really see that kind of looked like a shotgun, but kind of looked
 like a person leaning against barrel. So here's the thing. It just says Cracker Barrel now.
 With that logo, as a kid, I always thought that that was a big strapping man, man spreading.
 You thought he was straddling a barrel. I thought he was straddling, side straddling
 a barrel. Yeah. Only in my later years, I really looked at it. He's got, it's, it's
 not, it's not one leg. It's both his legs and they're withered. See, I look like, it
 looks like he's straddling a barrel. You're right. I always saw him as a straddler. Yeah,
 yeah. No, he's, he's, he's an old grandpa. He's a withery old grandpa with both his legs
 on one side. And so taking, taking away the weird old white dude that you can't quite
 see, just going with the actual name of the company, created chaos. I mean, the, the loss
 as it should, the company lost hundreds of millions of dollars. Shit. Really? Yeah. So
 dumb. Yeah. And people are just mad that they changed the logo. But you know what? Also,
 that shit is just fucking straight up stock manipulation. Yeah. Yeah. When you get right
 down to it, all this shit is just, they're just playing these games. I, okay. I work
 for a certain company that has several concentric circles around it. Uh, that the head of that
 company just, uh, stepped down. Yeah. Oh, right. This, the CEO just stepped out. That's right.
 Yeah. But, but he didn't leave the company. He's in a pole works for the Olympics. Several
 concentric circles. Yeah. He works for, he works. He still works there. He's just in
 a different role. So it's all just optics and games, man. Ain't nobody losing nothing
 except for us. Exactly. I got over that woman was like, we, uh, the viral clip of the woman
 saying, look, you got a lot more in common with these immigrants being picked up off
 the street than you do with the billionaires causing this mess. Oh, yeah. Hey baby. That's
 the goddamn, there was, but I'm stepping down. You won't hear me anymore. I'm going to be
 right over there. That's why guys. So you cannot talk to me. I'm going to be look. Yeah.
 Uh, I've been doing this role shittily for 11 years. I'll take my golden parachute now.
 Thank you very much and continue to work here. Perfect. That's, that's trying to make what
 two bucks off of, uh, Brogan. That's it. Yeah. Five. Yeah. Thank you. We get, I do. I get
 the PayPal emails. You play spawn and Brogan Paypal's us and then the spot tax. I get the,
 I get the, uh, the emails. Um, anyway. All right, let's get into some scoop mail or something.
 Let's do it. Let's do a little scoop mail. Oh, we don't have any physical scoop mail.
 We just have regular scoop mail from Valerie. Good morrow churned denizens. I haven't written
 in a while as life has gotten in the way. The last thing I wrote was about the lady
 wanting a CSI team to investigate the mysterious shit in her shed toilet. I'm a little behind
 in on episode 1234. Uh, there was a proposal to add, see you at the cone as a sign off.
 This reminded me that I hadn't actually written in to propose an alternative use of cone.
 My partner's work life doesn't allow him to be a scoop. However, he's very supportive
 enjoys the bits and stories from ICS that I curate for him. And he knows a few of the
 running gags. What do you mean? Your partner's work life? Does it allow him to be a? Wait
 a minute. What's going on? What's the conflict of interest? We present, we pose your partners.
 Does it allow your partner to listen to podcasts? Well, I don't know. There must be something
 going on there. Uh, he also enjoys meeting scoops. Everyone will be known for, uh, known
 or met thus far has been amazing, kind and fun as my partner supportive and scoop adjacent.
 I have taken to referring to him as my cone in a few of the scoop gatherings that we have
 been a part of. I would like to propose the cone be used for a non-scoop supportive partner
 and that the new sign off be one of the following. See you in the parlor, wink and tap on nose
 optional or see you at the soda fountain jerk, optional handshake like pulling a soda. That's
 the fountain jerk. I like to see at the set of fountain jerk is good. Yeah. I like that.
 I think there's room for all of these things and I love that you've got, I've already gone
 ahead and just started calling your supportive partner, your cone. I do like that. Let's
 hope they don't waffle. Just coming through. Ka-ching. Brogan's the best. Oh, we got one
 from Andy. Hi churn. It's just a short one today. I wanted to write to ask for a trophy
 or statuette or merit badge or whatever it is that you give out to improvisers for a
 chanting outstanding achievement in improvisation. Here's the scenario. My wife and I had been
 married for a little while now and we have been meaning to update our wheels. I came
 home one day, Kevin carrying heavy grocery shopping bags and walked straight past her
 into the kitchen to dump them on the table. My wife followed me into the kitchen and from
 behind said in a bright and proud voice, Hey honey, I got my new will signed off and finished.
 So now you will get everything. Before she could even finish her sentence, I turned on
 her and used a piece of produce to pretend to stab my wife directly in the heart. Somehow
 she didn't see the funny side of this and I was sleeping on the couch. That's Andy.
 Oh no. Andy? Good bit. That was a good bit. Good timing. It sounds like you were fast
 too. I think she was mad that you were fast. Yeah. Well, was it a banana? Ooh. Was it a
 cucumber? Was it celery? Could have been the type of produce. The type of produce. A piece
 of raw chicken. Just poultry. No. Salmonella. A piece of raw chicken. A flappy old chicken
 breast. I challenge you to a duel and you smack them with chicken breast. Ow. That really
 hurt. I just saw that episode of the Simpsons the other day where Homer goes around slapping
 people and challenging them to a duel and gets in a gunfight. Well, that's what we used
 to do on this show. Now we just do Jock vs. Nerd. Oh yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, it is
 time for Jock vs. Nerd. Explosion. Explosion. Of chicken breast that will slap you. Whoa.
 Oh, we got a Price of Skrite today. Let's see. Matt, the Magnum Scoopus wrote this Price
 of Skrite for us, said that they know that Matt really hated all of the Jock vs. Nerds
 where there were the infinite wrong answers. So we made the Price of Skrites. Apparently
 Magnum Scoopus made this Price of Skrites specifically so that Matt would hate Price
 of Skrite by the end of this game as well. Wow. So let's see what happens. This is some
 fucking saw shit right here. Yeah. What number is the fourth law of thermodynamics? Hint,
 it isn't four. What are you? I'm first. I don't even know what this question means.
 What number is the fourth law of thermodynamics? Hint, it isn't four. Yeah. I don't even know
 what that means. Means it's not number four. It's got to be number five, right? Yeah, I'm
 going to guess number five. Paul, what's your guess? I'll guess number three. All right.
 Matt? Four. Let's try it. Zero. Oh, well shit. Huh. All right. Oh, we were all over. At
 what temperature in Kelvin does all motion stop? I mean, absolutely stop. Paul, you're
 first. Absolute zero. Absolute zero. Matt? Negative one. Oh, that might win. I'll say
 one. It's zero. Paul got two points. Hey. A blank day is a vulnerability in software
 or hardware that is typically unknown to the vendor and for which no patch or other fix
 is available. Matt, you're up first. Zero. Zero. A zero day. Oh, a zero day. That's pretty
 good. Right. I think you're right. That's a Jack Reciter. I'm going one. Paul, what
 are you going? Not two. Matt, do you hate this yet? It's zero. Matt got two points.
 It's all zero. That's the bit. Oh, yeah. Yeah, we got it too. Okay. This year predates the
 birth of Jesus, which is one AD or one CT, et cetera, and is used for astronomical calculations.
 I'm first. I'm going to guess zero. Paul? I'll guess. Well, no. Oh, what was it? No.
 What was the BC? What did it go up to? I don't know. I know what you're talking about, but
 I don't know. I'll guess 230. 230. Chinese dentists, please. One. One. Good guess. Good
 guess. Jacob was exactly right. Zero. Two points. All right. Jacob, what's the scores
 now? We're all tied at two. And here is the fifth question. Paul is first on this one.
 This numerical nickname was given to school-aged Samuel Joel M. Well before his Tony award-winning
 performances. Oh, zero. Mustel, right? Great. Zero. Zero. Matt's going to guess one. The
 M stands for Mustel. Paul was exactly right. P-31, P-38, B-17, B-29, Spitfire, Mosquito.
 These are all well-known WW2 aircraft of the Allies. But what is the most famous Japanese
 aircraft, Matt? Zero. That's the zero. I'm going to guess one. Paul's going to guess
 two. And Matt was exactly right. In Pulp Fiction, the rapey pawn shop guy had a chopper with
 his name on the key chain. His name can sometimes mean a number in British English. What was
 his name if it was a number? Hilarious. That's the best question in this Price is Right right
 there. His name was Zed, which is zero. Paul's going to guess one. Matt's going to guess
 two. And Jacob was right. It's time for the bonus round. We all have four points each.
 It's me first. I'm going to wager all four. I'm going to do a high-powered spin. If you
 can hear my dogs barking, it's because the yard guys are here. Oh, yard guys. The yard
 guys. Oh, yard guys. And I lost the wager. Oh my God, Jacob, what a catastrophe. I'm
 down to zero points. Paul, what are you betting? I'll wager it all, Bill. Wager? No, it's Jacob.
 My name is Jacob. All right. Let's go. Mid. Mid spin. Oh, Paul is a medium-paced kind
 of spinner. We all know that. You know me. And Paul, I almost lost his wager, but he
 got two times the wager. Oh, shoot. Two times my wager. Look the fuck out. Paul's got eight
 points. Matt. I wager all my points. Betting it all. Low, please. A low pace. A nice lack
 of daisical spin. A lazy spin. And Matt gets four points. You know what that means. Matt
 and Paul are tied. Eight points apiece. Jacob wins. Oh no. Cats game. Jacob wins. Oh, traditional
