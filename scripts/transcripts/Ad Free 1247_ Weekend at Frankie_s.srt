1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
 Now we're recording.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,220
 We're starting now?

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,220
 Now we're recording.

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,880
 Classic Jacob fakeouts, classic Jacob fakeouts, fake in your ass.

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,760
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social?

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,760
 Yeah, I'd love to!

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,760
 Great, let's go!

8
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,760
 It's the night before a scoop fest, and all through the house, Paul's already half-asleep,

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,760
 and Jacob's falling apart.

10
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,760
 Jacob's got a busted eye, everything's fine.

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,760
 Paul, keep his eyes open.

12
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,760
 I'm rolling.

13
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:34,060
 Paul can't keep his eyes open if I don't bloodshot.

14
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,040
 It's time for Matt and Matt in his ice cream social, sitting right across from me is Paul

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,040
 Manley.

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,040
 Right next to me is Mr. Matt Donnelly.

17
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,480
 Over there on his own damn couch is Jacob the audio guy.

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,480
 We're gonna go.

19
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,480
 We're preaching fun.

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,480
 Here we are!

21
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,320
 And we brought in Mitzi here.

22
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,320
 Mitzula's here!

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,320
 Hello, hello, hello!

24
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,920
 I had a couple of scoops reach out to be like, "There's no churn, right?"

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,800
 I was like, "That is correct."

26
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,480
 I didn't think it was right to invite people both to Jacob's house and Paul's bedroom to

27
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,480
 record tonight.

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,720
 Because those are the two places that we are right now.

29
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
 It's a little much.

30
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,920
 Yeah, I couldn't handle other people tonight.

31
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,720
 I had to bribe Paul with noodles.

32
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,720
 Paul is reclined.

33
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,720
 Paul is supine.

34
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,200
 We actually had to push to record because we were losing Paul before recording.

35
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
 I mean, yeah.

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,560
 You were falling asleep on that couch up there.

37
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,040
 Well, it's midnight.

38
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,640
 It's midnight, my time.

39
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,280
 And I go to bed at nine now and that's late.

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,280
 Yes.

41
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,760
 I think I just might need you to sit up.

42
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,800
 I think I might just have to have you sit up at some point.

43
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,800
 You can ask.

44
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,560
 Could I make a formal request that Paul Mattingly sits up?

45
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,240
 You may file form B13.

46
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,240
 I'm attorney for Paul.

47
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,360
 File some forms.

48
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,200
 I'm attorney for Paul Mattingly and your motion is denied.

49
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
 There you go.

50
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
 Sorry.

51
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,200
 I was afraid of that.

52
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
 I decline to incline.

53
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
 Unrecline.

54
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,280
 I decline to incline.

55
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,360
 I will remain declined.

56
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,360
 Supine.

57
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,360
 Supine.

58
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,360
 And so fine.

59
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,360
 Oh yeah.

60
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,360
 Oh, lupine.

61
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,360
 He's a werewolf.

62
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,360
 Roux.

63
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,080
 Je suis le loup garou as the French would say.

64
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,400
 That means skin changer, ladies and gentlemen.

65
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
 Loup garou.

66
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,880
 Look, I don't want to change the mood too quickly here, but let's pour one out for Terry

67
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,880
 Fader, shall we?

68
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,880
 Oh, baby.

69
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,960
 No, you know what?

70
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,960
 It's so funny.

71
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,960
 We were talking about this at the restaurant.

72
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,960
 We went and got some noodles.

73
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,960
 The effort you just put into sitting up was pretty amazing.

74
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,960
 We went and got some noodles.

75
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,840
 That entire sentence that you just heard, listening audience, was Paul sitting up.

76
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,760
 That was like a 15 point K-turn with your body you were doing to just try to sit up.

77
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,760
 There are so many elements.

78
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,880
 You remember that scene from Boston Powers when he's turning the golf cart around in

79
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,880
 the tunnel?

80
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,520
 So many elements are on their way out in this apparatus.

81
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,080
 And this is good hit, Paul.

82
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,280
 Paul is pointing at various places on his body.

83
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,280
 Hip is fine.

84
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
 It's now shoulders.

85
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,280
 Yeah, and he was on a plate.

86
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
 Boy, are his shoulders tired.

87
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,600
 Well, I was on a plate, but the shoulders are real bad now.

88
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
 But whatever.

89
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,120
 No, but we were talking about this Terry Fader, the famous ventriloquist.

90
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,840
 Well, the first winner of America's Got Talent.

91
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,560
 Yeah, winner of season one of America's Got Talent.

92
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,600
 He's the one who made NBC learn that they had assigned those people to binding contracts

93
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,000
 before they got famous, because it became much more difficult for them to negotiate

94
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,640
 with Terry Fader after he signed a hundred million dollar deal at the Mirage.

95
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,080
 That's why some people are saying, oh, really, I've never heard of him.

96
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,000
 That's because America's Got Talent never brought him back.

97
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 That's right.

98
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Never put him in a montage.

99
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 They didn't.

100
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 They don't mention it.

101
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 He does not come up.

102
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,020
 He was the first winner.

103
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,740
 He has never fainted from memory.

104
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,160
 And what we think, what I think.

105
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,560
 So it's a big news story in Las Vegas because it was abrupt.

106
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,480
 He just was like, Oh, by the way, I've done my last show.

107
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,480
 Right.

108
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,680
 It came out earlier today that tonight was going to be his final performance.

109
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,640
 He was in the theater at the Strat.

110
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,920
 Paul has a theory.

111
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,920
 It's not a theory.

112
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,920
 I think it's legit.

113
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,760
 Well, let's let's go ahead for legal sake, call it a theory anyway.

114
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
 All right.

115
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,760
 Allegedly, it's legit.

116
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,760
 Does not make it so.

117
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,160
 I'm pretty sure Terry Fader thought he was going to get raptured just like a rapture thing

118
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,160
 happening right now.

119
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,960
 OK, OK, I this was I've there's been numerous rapture, rapture rumors in my lifetime.

120
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,960
 Yes.

121
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,960
 Different religious apocalyptic.

122
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
 Yeah.

123
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
 Yeah.

124
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,960
 Predict it in my mind.

125
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
 One, the mind calendar.

126
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,960
 We're not talking Debbie.

127
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,960
 This was so late.

128
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,960
 OK.

129
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,960
 So it came on like a day before.

130
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,960
 Yeah.

131
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,960
 Tomorrow.

132
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,960
 So so late to the party.

133
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,960
 Pretty abrupt.

134
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,960
 Next time there's a rapture.

135
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,080
 OK, here's what we need to do or someone needs to do.

136
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,520
 Mitzi, actually, you might be able to help us with this.

137
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,760
 Someone needs to ahead of time figure out what sports teams will be most affected.

138
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,880
 Oh, you should go around to every professional basketball team, every football team and figure

139
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,000
 out how many real big Jesus Christians there are on each team and talk about who's going

140
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 to go in the rapture and how that will affect the team going forward if they don't have

141
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 them.

142
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Right.

143
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Over, under, number one, better.

144
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,120
 So like for instance, like Baker Mayfield is probably the biggest heathen quarterback

145
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,120
 we have.

146
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,120
 Right.

147
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,120
 OK.

148
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,120
 I'm just saying I'm guessing.

149
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,120
 OK, good.

150
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,120
 I'm guessing just by his energy.

151
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,120
 OK.

152
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,120
 I don't know.

153
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,120
 Maybe I'm wrong.

154
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,120
 Correct me on this.

155
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,560
 But I think be hilarious if I don't have any counterarguments, Baker Mayfield just looks

156
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
 left and right.

157
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,560
 Oh, shit.

158
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,080
 I'm like one of three starting quarterbacks left in the league.

159
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,480
 So Paul, don't tell me what you're telling me already.

160
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,040
 I didn't know that any of this was happening.

161
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,520
 So it is people doing it has come up real quick, but apparently through many different

162
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:28,640
 channels within the social media forums and whatnot, people really think the shit's hitting

163
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,640
 the fan.

164
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,680
 If you go on Facebook Marketplace right now, it's a goddamn fire sale.

165
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,840
 People are just putting everything and everyone up for sale because they think they're about

166
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,840
 to get rapture.

167
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,840
 People are selling their houses.

168
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,840
 You want to know why?

169
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,840
 I do.

170
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,840
 Yes.

171
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,840
 They think they're.

172
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
 What is it?

173
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,840
 They're going to get rapture.

174
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,840
 Yeah.

175
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,840
 Tylenol.

176
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
 Tylenol is what's causing people to believe they're going to get rapture.

177
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
 It might be.

178
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
 Or is Tylenol causing people to get rapture?

179
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:58,720
 Is it possible that Tylenol has both created a god and has made that god rapture?

180
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,480
 Guys, I bought a pill from Dr. Oz that makes me rapture proof, so it's okay.

181
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,360
 They're like, "If Kimmel's coming back on air, get me off this planet."

182
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
 Maybe.

183
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
 Jesus, take me away.

184
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,360
 Maybe.

185
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,360
 They're afraid this is the second coming.

186
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,040
 Like, "Shit, that's what I meant the whole time."

187
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,160
 It was three days.

188
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,160
 You know what?

189
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,400
 It could have been deeper than we even think.

190
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,480
 You know, old Orangey Borgie had a little trouble getting the words out the other day

191
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,600
 during the Tylenol debacle.

192
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
 I won't hear it.

193
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
 He's sharp as a tack.

194
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,400
 Well, he may have actually had something going on.

195
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,400
 You are saying that this Tylenol could be responsible for rapture-type stuff?

196
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,840
 He might have actually been trying to say, "A-send-a-med-a-fin."

197
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
 Oh.

198
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,840
 Send-a-med-a-fin?

199
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,840
 Send-a-med-a-fin.

200
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,840
 Send-a-med-a-fin.

201
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,840
 Yeah.

202
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,840
 There you go.

203
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,840
 Not a-see-da-med-a-fin.

204
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
 A-send-a-med-a-fin.

205
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,840
 Yeah, yeah.

206
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,840
 Let's ascend together.

207
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,840
 It is.

208
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,840
 Yeah.

209
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,840
 I feel like that's all the funny that our listeners can handle today.

210
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,840
 It's more than they fucking deserve.

211
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,560
 It's more than they fucking deserve.

212
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,480
 Eat all my ass all day.

213
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,480
 Wow.

214
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,480
 Yeah.

215
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,480
 What?

216
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,480
 Yes, we heard it.

217
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,480
 I think he means Trump, not our listeners.

218
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
 Yeah.

219
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,480
 Oh.

220
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,480
 I thought you were talking to our listeners, and so did some of our listeners.

221
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,480
 Well, some of them too.

222
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,480
 They know who they are.

223
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,480
 You know who you are.

224
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
 They know who they are.

225
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
 Well, it's easier to do the Jack vs. Nerd today.

226
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
 Fine.

227
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
 Paul, I'll leave.

228
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,480
 You don't have to be out.

229
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
 That's right.

230
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,480
 I just wanted to be a little...

231
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
 You don't have to yell into that mic.

232
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
 Come on, Mitzi.

233
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,480
 We can do the Christian...

234
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
 We can find out how many Christian athletes are on each team, right?

235
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,480
 No, you're doing great.

236
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,480
 But, yeah, definitely we can find out how many Christian athletes there are on these

237
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,480
 teams.

238
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
 We just have to be on top of it next time.

239
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,480
 Are we talking...

240
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
 Yeah.

241
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,480
 It's the only way I want to discuss the Rapture.

242
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,480
 Did you hear anything?

243
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
 I did.

244
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,480
 I heard about the Rapture this morning...

245
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,120
 Performative Rapture.

246
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,120
 That people were, you know, thinking about that the Rapture might happen.

247
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,680
 And I saw like an atheist TikTok.

248
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
 I was like, "Great."

249
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,680
 Exactly.

250
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,680
 Exactly.

251
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,240
 But Paul was saying like people were leaving notes and stuff for their neighbors.

252
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,880
 And I was like, "These people think their neighbors are just heathens.

253
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,360
 Are they going to get Raptured?"

254
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,360
 All of my neighbors...

255
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,360
 Are you kidding?

256
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,120
 My whole neighborhood is like, "Guys, I'm surprised we didn't just have a bunch of keys

257
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,120
 in our mailbox."

258
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,200
 That's exactly it.

259
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,000
 These jabronis are like, "Oh, yeah, here's the instructions to how to get into my basement

260
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 and how to...

261
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Here's my key...

262
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,320
 Two gay pride flags on our little sign in the front yard."

263
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,280
 They're going to be feeding so many of their pets.

264
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,280
 Yeah.

265
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,280
 Oh, exactly.

266
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,280
 Yeah, yeah.

267
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,280
 We have to take care of so many animals.

268
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,320
 All of us are going to be left here just raising dogs.

269
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,320
 Yeah.

270
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,800
 I guess, you know, we've been, you know, joking around.

271
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,800
 I guess we should say wholeheartedly, that's fucking nuts.

272
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,160
 That's really fucking crazy.

273
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,160
 But it's just...

274
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
 That's really crazy.

275
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,920
 That is one stance that we could take.

276
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,680
 And I agree that that is a viable stance that we could take.

277
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,760
 A different stance, though, that we could take is give us your shit.

278
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,760
 Par for the fucking question.

279
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,960
 You're going to get... because you know we're not going to get raptured.

280
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,480
 Literally, the second word in the description of this podcast is godless.

281
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
 Yes, godless.

282
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,480
 Well, that's the other fucking...

283
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
 We're not getting raptured.

284
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,480
 Leave us your shit.

285
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
 Yeah.

286
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,480
 Just give it to us.

287
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,480
 That's the fucked up thing.

288
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,720
 There's straight up preachers who got their flock to give them everything.

289
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
 Oh, yeah.

290
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
 Of course.

291
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
 And they are in Barbados.

292
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
 They are all left.

293
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
 They did get raptured.

294
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
 Wait.

295
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
 So straight up religious cons?

296
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
 Yeah.

297
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,720
 Straight up con jobs.

298
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
 There have been a lot of con jobs happening.

299
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,880
 Is this job a side effect or the actual inspiration for this?

300
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,880
 Side effect.

301
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,880
 Side effect.

302
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,880
 Side effect.

303
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,880
 Side effect.

304
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,880
 Because from what I understand, again...

305
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,880
 So how did this rapture ever get started?

306
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
 Exactly.

307
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,880
 Everybody's laced up right here.

308
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,880
 We can't pin this one on the Mayans.

309
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,880
 I heard this was one fucking guy.

310
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,120
 One guy on the TikTok somewhere started this up, and everybody just started going, "Oh,

311
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,120
 okay.

312
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,120
 That sounds right."

313
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,120
 One guy couldn't have started this.

314
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,120
 Oh, no?

315
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,120
 No, no.

316
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,120
 I've got it right here.

317
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,120
 No, no.

318
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,280
 And then you undertake one religious rapture, and then you have them give him stuff.

319
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,480
 Nah, it doesn't work out.

320
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
 Jacob.

321
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
 The math doesn't check out.

322
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,120
 I think you'll find that one guy did change a lot of things.

323
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,320
 He had some pretty far out ideas about where we go after we pass on.

324
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,960
 We're long hair, you know, walked everywhere, had a lot of people following him, had a lot

325
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,400
 of people hating him.

326
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,400
 Huh?

327
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
 Yeah.

328
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
 It's like an evolution.

329
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

330
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
 That guy?

331
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
 Yeah.

332
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,400
 Just pretend.

333
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
 Fuck you all.

334
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,960
 Fuck you all in the face and mouth forever.

335
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,160
 Bullshit fairy tale that someone pulled out of their dick hole.

336
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,160
 No, no, no.

337
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,200
 He was a beautifully pasty white Middle Eastern.

338
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
 Sure.

339
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
 You're right.

340
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
 You're right.

341
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
 Golden-haired Middle Eastern.

342
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
 Golden-haired blue-eyed.

343
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
 Shredded.

344
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
 White guy.

345
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
 Yeah.

346
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
 Super shredded.

347
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
 And if you don't believe Jesus.

348
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
 If you don't believe Jesus was beautiful and white, then I've had it.

349
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,860
 What has happened to this country?

350
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:49,200
 Every crucified Catholic Christ has five-minute abs for days.

351
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,800
 Just fucking washboard.

352
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,280
 In fucking Belize a couple of months ago, we went into a church from the 1800s and they

353
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:01,360
 had a painted Christ on the wall there, literally painted on like bright blue eyes.

354
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,360
 And there's like stone relief coming out of this, this thing from the middle or like early

355
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,360
 1800s.

356
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
 I think it was like 1813 or something.

357
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,000
 It was just all so fucking stupid.

358
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 And now we see it.

359
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,560
 If you want to sell a religion, you got to have some sex appeal.

360
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,440
 We're seeing it all writ large here in our own country where it's all like fuck history,

361
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
 fuck truth.

362
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
 Oh, I thought you were talking about the sex appeals thing.

363
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
 Oh, that too.

364
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,200
 Well, people do draw this president in like all kinds of heroic handsome poses all the

365
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
 time.

366
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
 People sure do that.

367
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
 They sure do.

368
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,160
 Definitely not for any reason other than truth.

369
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:37,520
 But this goes, this goes back to when we, you know, we went a little, we got a little,

370
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,160
 a little heavy, real, a little heavy in our last episode.

371
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:49,080
 And maybe you did like that moment of silence was Paul searching for remembering the last

372
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,080
 episode.

373
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
 I know.

374
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,600
 I remember a second ago, it was great because I got to watch him in the eyes, decide whether

375
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,440
 or not to just say Jesus was fake or to name another long haired celebrity person that

376
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
 he could have been talking about.

377
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,720
 I was going to say something real dumb and I was trying to think of nothing's funny to

378
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,720
 joke about.

379
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
 I was ready for Axl Rose.

380
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,720
 I was ready for Axl Rose, but who am I going to throw into the bus?

381
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,720
 I was saying that was a good joke.

382
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
 I was saying.

383
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,720
 I was ready for it.

384
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,720
 Who am I going to even throw into the bus at this point?

385
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,280
 Who am I going to say like, I don't know, the lead singer of Mr. Big?

386
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,480
 It can't be Axl Rose because he's on that steel horse.

387
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,360
 He was the lead singer of Mr. Big.

388
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
 All right.

389
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,360
 That's pretty good.

390
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,200
 That should have been the one I went with.

391
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
 Jim Morrison.

392
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
 More than words.

393
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
 Could have been Jim Morrison.

394
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
 Jim Morrison.

395
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:42,360
 Long time ago, there was another guy who chose to go a different route if you know what I

396
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
 mean.

397
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,640
 You know, shake things up a little bit, move to the beat of his own drummer, a little left

398
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,640
 of center.

399
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,640
 He beat up his own drummer?

400
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,200
 He beat up his own drummer.

401
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
 I mean, probably.

402
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
 I mean, that's how you get into the top of the industry.

403
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:02,160
 That guy was Peter Gabriel and he got into a big fucking fight with Phil Collins and left

404
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
 Genesis.

405
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
 And that was the Genesis.

406
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,480
 That was the Genesis of the Book of Genesis.

407
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,480
 That's right.

408
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,480
 Yeah.

409
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
 Sledgehammer.

410
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,480
 I know it was old, but I didn't know it was as old as Phil Collins.

411
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,480
 Sledgehammer.

412
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,880
 That also explains why the drummer had to, the gorilla was the drummer.

413
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,880
 That's right.

414
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,880
 Yeah.

415
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,880
 Because they got into a fight and the drummer couldn't go.

416
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
 There it is.

417
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,880
 Yup.

418
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,360
 This is how things go.

419
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
 My right eye is filled with blood.

420
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,360
 Yeah.

421
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,880
 We're all, we're all old hobbling into the scoop.

422
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,360
 Jacob, nothing has been stressing you lately, has it?

423
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,960
 Old damaged men.

424
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,440
 I literally had this thought multiple times, Sucre, I was like, "Churnouts are just easier."

425
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,440
 Churnouts are just easier.

426
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,240
 I was like, "Go somewhere else."

427
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,240
 Holy shit, are they?

428
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,240
 Do it for a day.

429
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,240
 Holy shit, are they?

430
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,240
 All right.

431
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,240
 Everybody enjoy the last Scoop Fest.

432
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,240
 Hope you had a good one.

433
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
 No, no, no, no.

434
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,240
 See you at Churnout.

435
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,360
 We love doing Scoop Fest, but it is just so hard.

436
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,840
 And when it's over, it feels so much cooler to pull off than at Churnout.

437
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
 Yeah.

438
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,840
 Oh, certainly.

439
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,840
 Oh no, it's so much more rewarding.

440
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,840
 Totally.

441
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,840
 Everyone.

442
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,400
 We can actually, what a great, terrible segue, but we actually can announce something pretty

443
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
 cool that's happening.

444
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
 Oh yeah.

445
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,400
 Oh yeah, that's true.

446
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
 Yeah, yeah.

447
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,320
 So for people who missed out on Scoop Fest, I had this event that's happening in New York,

448
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:19,160
 and so I asked Paul if he wanted to join me just for fun.

449
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,200
 This is a total coincidence, but we're doing just a, I'm calling it random comedy night

450
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,560
 for no reason.

451
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,240
 But Paul is going to come out to Tierney's.

452
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
 Yep.

453
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
 Paul and I are going to do a show at Tierney's.

454
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,240
 This will be great.

455
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,040
 Recreate the magic of the first pre-Scoop Fest, Scoop Fest.

456
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,040
 Yes.

457
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,800
 October 23rd, we're going to be out there.

458
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,760
 And part of it is because my buddy, Kurt Braunler, who also performed at one of the Scoop Fests,

459
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,120
 he got hired by The Tonight Show.

460
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,960
 Oh, good for him.

461
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,760
 And The Tonight Show doesn't film on Fridays.

462
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:54,040
 So Kurt Braunler, I said, when he told me he's moving back to Jersey, I said, "I'm so jealous."

463
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,480
 I said, "But I'm going to come back to Jersey, we're going to do a show at Tierney's."

464
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,820
 He's like, "Yes."

465
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,000
 So Kurt's going to do Stand Up.

466
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Great.

467
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 Fantastic.

468
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Paul and I are going to do Improv.

469
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Perfect.

470
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 I'm going to do a little magic.

471
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,240
 And I reached out to my buddy, Dion Flynn, who plays Barack Obama and other characters

472
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,240
 on The Tonight Show.

473
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,240
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

474
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,560
 Because he told me he moved to Montclair.

475
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,480
 I said, "Well, Kurt and I and my buddy Paul are going to come out to the thing."

476
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,480
 And he goes, "I'm in."

477
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
 Yeah.

478
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,480
 I go, "This is hilarious."

479
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,480
 Fucking A.

480
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,480
 So I have Dion Flynn.

481
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,480
 This is a no-joke phase.

482
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,480
 This is a real thing.

483
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,040
 So then I reached out to my buddies from Possible Side Effects to live in Jersey.

484
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,680
 And I said, "Just so you know, I'm doing the thing with Kurt and Dion, and Paul's coming

485
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,680
 out."

486
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,680
 I said, "I'm mad I'm not going."

487
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,280
 Why aren't you?

488
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,240
 So now, Digery Douche and Pat Shepard from Redbaker are all coming out.

489
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,240
 Because all there was before was you and Matt going and hanging out in tyrannies for a night.

490
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,960
 And that seems like a lot of money for me to throw away to just go hang out in tyrannies

491
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,960
 for a night.

492
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,960
 Here's the thing.

493
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
 Here's the thing, Jacob.

494
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,460
 You should just want to hang out with me and Matt to start with, and then your dick wouldn't

495
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,360
 be caught in a wringer like it is now.

496
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,360
 So if you go to...

497
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,320
 Hopefully this is in the notes, but if you go to HeyScoops.com/ComedyNight, you will

498
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,600
 find tickets available for it.

499
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
 There's just a-

500
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
 Not for long, motherfuckers.

501
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
 There you go.

502
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
 Probably not.

503
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
 It's not a huge venue.

504
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
 Get on that shit.

505
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
 It's coming up.

506
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,600
 It's soon.

507
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
 We're charging 20 bucks.

508
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,840
 30 bucks if you want a guaranteed seat because it's tyrannies and there's like four tables.

509
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,840
 Sorry, I just bought them all.

510
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,840
 They're now $50 on the secondary.

511
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,840
 No.

512
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,840
 On the secondary market.

513
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,840
 BintzyTix.com.

514
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,840
 BintzyTix.com.

515
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,840
 BintzyTix.com.

516
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
 BintzyTix.com.

517
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,840
 BintzyTix.com.

518
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,840
 BintzyTix.com.

519
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,840
 BintzyTix.com.

520
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
 BintzyTix.com.

521
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,840
 So it's a total random tyrannies comedy night, October 23rd, Thursday.

522
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
 Yes.

523
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,040
 It's like I'd be losing money, not going.

524
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,040
 We're just, yeah, I'm just picking up Paul at the airport and we're going to head over

525
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,040
 to Montclair.

526
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,040
 It's easy.

527
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,040
 This is hilarious.

528
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
 Yeah.

529
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,040
 So it is-

530
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
 It's hilarious how much it's blown up.

531
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
 I know.

532
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,040
 It's like exploded.

533
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,560
 There's actually another name of a person I want to reach out to.

534
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,360
 I won't say it now because I think someone might say yes if I reach out to them.

535
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,360
 I think they will.

536
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,360
 Is it Letterman?

537
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,360
 It's Letterman.

538
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,360
 Well, I mean, no.

539
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,360
 It's David Letterman.

540
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,360
 It's already lining up, so yeah.

541
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,360
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

542
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,360
 I feel like that.

543
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,360
 Frankie Valli?

544
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,360
 Frankie Valli.

545
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,360
 It's Frankie Valli.

546
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,360
 God damn you, Bintzy.

547
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,360
 I told you.

548
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,360
 I'm not going to do it.

549
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,360
 Sorry.

550
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,360
 That was Tony Coven and Dan.

551
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,360
 I feel like we could make Frankie Valli happen.

552
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,360
 Danny DeVito.

553
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
 Buzz Aldrin.

554
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,360
 I think I can get Buzz Aldrin to stop by.

555
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,360
 Okay.

556
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,360
 If you get Buzz to come, I'm at it.

557
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,360
 It's like, "God damn it.

558
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,360
 I could have hung out with Buzz Aldrin."

559
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,360
 I could have punched people with Buzz Aldrin.

560
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,360
 If I could have hung out with Buzz Aldrin.

561
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:26,360
 If I could have just gotten drunk with Buzz Aldrin, I'll be so mad.

562
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:34,040
 I may be a mannequin who can't sing.

563
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,360
 I forgot what Bitt Paul's doing.

564
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,360
 I'm standing barely still.

565
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,360
 He's Frankie Valli.

566
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,360
 I'm standing barely still.

567
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,360
 I'm almost motionless.

568
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,360
 Can't someone put a mirror near my nose?

569
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,360
 To see if I'm breathing.

570
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,360
 Hey, man.

571
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,360
 He's someone who keeps one of our listeners kind of employed.

572
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,360
 We've got to be careful with our Frankie.

573
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,360
 I've got nothing but love for Frankie Valli.

574
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,360
 I've got nothing but love for Frankie Valli.

575
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,360
 I've got nothing but love for Frankie Valli.

576
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,360
 I've got nothing but love for Frankie Valli.

577
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,360
 I've got nothing but love for Frankie Valli.

578
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,360
 I've got nothing but love for Frankie Valli.

579
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,360
 I've got nothing but love for Frankie Valli.

580
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,360
 I've got nothing but love for Frankie Valli.

581
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:57,360
 I've got nothing but love for Frankie Valli.

582
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,280
 They're coming out with a new movie, Weekend at Frankie's.

583
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,960
 No one doubts that being true.

584
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
 It's true.

585
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,960
 It's true.

586
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,960
 No one's like, I have time to get shoelaces.

587
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,400
 They should just as my shoelaces right now.

588
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:15,440
 They should just call it Jersey Boys 2 and steal the plot of Weekend at Bernie's.

589
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,060
 That would be a hilarious thing to film for just the cast.

590
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,160
 They should get Kenny's with a direct that one too.

591
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
 Yes.

592
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,280
 I've swallowed my body out and fucking Teddy Ruxpin'd me.

593
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,280
 For that one would they also ignore the fact that they're a movie?

594
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,280
 I've got a cassette tape in my belly and I just play the hits.

595
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,280
 I'm the fucking Teddy Ruxpin.

596
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
 Frankie Valli Ruxpin.

597
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,280
 Then the tape gets caught.

598
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,280
 You wouldn't.

599
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,280
 You wouldn't.

600
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,280
 I went to Sam's Club today.

601
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,280
 You liar.

602
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,280
 I went to Sam's Club today.

603
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,280

 I went to Sam's Club today.

609
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,280
 You liar.

610
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,280
 I went to Sam's Club today.

611
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,280
 You liar.

612
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,280
 I went to Sam's Club today.

613
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,280
 You liar.

614
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,280
 I went to Sam's Club today.

615
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
 You liar.

616
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,280
 To buy some stuff for Scoop Fest.

617
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,280
 How deep are we at?

618
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,280
 Should we do an ad?

619
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,280
 Oh, sure.

620
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,280
 Before your transition.

621
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,280
 Yeah, let's do an ad.

622
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,280
 Not to be.

623
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,280
 A following sponsor.

 It's going to be a long week, folks.

626
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,160
 If you had two eyes you would have nailed that.

00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:13,680

1693
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,880
 That's right.

1694
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,880
 Everybody love it.

1695
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,880
 It's a party when the confetti spaghetti come out.

1696
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,880
 It's always al dente when I crash into the wall.

1697
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,880
 You're right.

1698
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,880
 I drive pretty good.

1699
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,640
 I make a joke.

1700
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,560
 But it's no joke when you're hungry for colorful pasta shapes and you want something to fill

1701
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,760
 your belly.

1702
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:32,400
 Go ahead and order up a big plate of Yeti and Andretti's confetti spaghetti.

1703
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,600
 Put 10 minutes in the pot and mom, you're going to love how it tastes and dad, you're

1704
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,640
 going to love how it feels.

1705
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:50,160
 And babies and kids, they're going to love how it looks because it's colors like a rainbow.

1706
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,160
 You're right, Yeti.

1707
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:57,880
 I forgot to mention it's loaded with protein and low in saturated fat now.

1708
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:07,560
 So go ahead and eat your pasta confidently, Yeti and Andretti's confetti spaghetti.

1709
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:16,320
 Come and get it before it goes cold.

1710
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,200
 And red number five.

1711
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,200
 Thank you.

1712
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,320
 Hey, scoops, a checkout chat.

1713
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,080
 GPT can't find any credible evidence that Terry fader quit his Las Vegas show because

1714
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,480
 of the rapture.

1715
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,640
 He gave no reasons, though, no, it didn't return phone calls.

1716
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,640
 No, it's the rapture because he had been raptured.

1717
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:43,840
 No, it's just for Vegas style, like typical Las Vegas stuff is that usually you want to

1718
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:49,000
 get a last minute boost to announce that you want to announce the show is closed and get

1719
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,240
 a little bit of that last minute that final wave.

1720
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,560
 Yeah, here's the here's the thing.

1721
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,600
 It wasn't him, but he's in those circles.

1722
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,720
 His fans were getting raptured.

1723
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,600
 He was worried he was going to have tickets, maybe not famous, but possibly family.

1724
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:06,200
 You know, could have been like Terry, I'm getting ready to go meet the Lord.

1725
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,960
 It's like, well, I better go down to go see Grandma one more time because she's going

1726
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,320
 to be jumping off the roof.

1727
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,720
 No, the rapture is on the twenty sixth to twenty seven.

1728
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,920
 I think he thought I think if anything, I think it's more credible that he thought he

1729
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,560
 was going to be rapture two days today and tomorrow.

1730
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,560
 Yeah, right.

1731
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:25,200
 So he wouldn't have like quit the show just to go visit somebody who was going to go get

1732
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
 raptured.

1733
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,200
 Maybe.

1734
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,200
 Maybe he did.

1735
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:34,120
 No, no, maybe he did because he knows down in his heart he's a sinner and he's not going

1736
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,280
 to go because remember, he got caught up in some shit.

1737
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,120
 So you think he he quit his show because he's a sinner and isn't going to get raptured?

1738
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,880
 Maybe because he's like, I bet so he better clean it up.

1739
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,560
 Maybe he's going to take this in the course of the last thirty eight minutes.

1740
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,740
 Yeah, he's going to go on from he quit his show because he's getting raptured to he quit

1741
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:54,040
 his show because he is not going to get raptured.

1742
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,040
 But others.

1743
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,800
 But I'm sorry, Paul, did I answer that question?

1744
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,800
 I'm his attorney.

1745
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,800
 I like that.

1746
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,800
 I like that question.

1747
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,800
 Stricken from the record.

1748
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:06,440
 Your client, I said to be fair, I'm pretty sure I got past his first issue.

1749
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:14,000
 I said at the top, I said he quit the show because of the rapture point and Matt.

1750
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,760
 So I think I honestly do think like I bet, you know, because I all the religious shit

1751
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,760
 is about guilt.

1752
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:29,120
 If it comes out that Terry Fader considered the rapture in any way when quitting this

1753
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,120
 show.

1754
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,120
 Yes.

1755
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,120
 How much money?

1756
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,120
 I think you're just right.

1757
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,520
 OK, I think I think Paul, a hundred percent correct.

1758
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,520
 All right.

1759
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,080
 If he even consider for a moment that the rapture might might play into a part of this,

1760
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:44,200
 I I'm very I'm very happy with this theory only because the other answer is only that

1761
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,600
 like this Vegas entertainment is becoming a hellscape and that all of these things that

1762
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,600
 we know and love are going to go away.

1763
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,600
 I hope you can program LED lights.

1764
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,600
 Right.

1765
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,600
 Exactly.

1766
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,720
 I hope you can work with an AI program.

1767
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,160
 By the way, Dorothy appear huge.

1768
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,200
 I just did with Paul's my favorite bits.

1769
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,320
 I think it's so funny.

1770
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:09,000
 I love when on television or movies, lawyers yell, don't answer that.

1771
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,960
 I was doing a show in San Antonio and I forgot to put bullshit in one of my pockets, so I

1772
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,960
 went to do a bit.

1773
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,960
 I was like, oh, shit, there's nothing in my pockets.

1774
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,280
 And I had an audience member on stage and go, quick stall, I got to put things in my

1775
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,280
 pockets.

1776
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:26,600
 And I ran off stage and that thunder you just heard as she's car starting things sound like

1777
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,600
 thunder thunder.

1778
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,600
 And I was like, what the fucking hell?

1779
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,600
 That was that.

1780
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,600
 And it's speakers.

1781
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,600
 I'm sorry.

1782
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,100
 S.J. Can you hear my air quotes?

1783
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,100
 It's an electric.

1784
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,100
 Vivian.

1785
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,100
 I mean, S.J.'s car.

1786
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,100
 It's an electric and it makes that startup noise.

1787
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,100
 That's so funny.

1788
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,100
 It's just from the speakers.

1789
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:46,920
 It's just it's got a Tesla coil in it, just fucking rattled.

1790
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,580
 So he I go, be funny.

1791
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,580
 Tell a joke or something.

1792
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,160
 And I left and I went on stage and I put stuff in my pockets were small venues.

1793
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,820
 So the stage is right there and I just put some of my pockets and he got comfortable.

1794
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,800
 Like he said a couple of things and got a laugh.

1795
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,020
 And then he just started talking and someone yelled a question at him and he was like starting

1796
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,020
 to feel himself or whatever.

1797
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,680
 And I go, do not answer that.

1798
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:11,920
 Do not answer that question.

1799
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,040
 And I went on with a bit like that.

1800
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,040
 But yelling, do not answer that.

1801
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,240
 You don't have to answer that.

1802
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,240
 Yes.

1803
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,240
 From any from anywhere across the room.

1804
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,240
 It's a good bit.

1805
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,160
 My favorite bit of your still always be my pearls.

1806
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,160
 My pearls.

1807
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,160
 Yeah.

1808
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,920
 If the lights go out anywhere, my pearls, my pearls, the best, it's a it's a good bit.

1809
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,920
 The best.

1810
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,920
 Yeah.

1811
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,080
 I haven't had an opportunity to do it because lights never go out.

1812
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,080
 We talk about Paul.

1813
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,080
 You lose power all the time in Pittsburgh.

1814
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,080
 Yeah.

1815
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,080
 Yeah.

1816
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,080
 But it's just me and the dogs.

1817
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,080
 The dogs don't laugh at the my pearls bit.

1818
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:40,960
 They don't think they roll their eyes and they go, no, they hate it.

1819
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,960
 They hate it.

1820
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,240
 They all pee instantly.

1821
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,120
 They're like, fuck you, dude.

1822
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,480
 That's fucking cheesy.

1823
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,920
 They're like, you got pearl money and we're still feeding us this shit.

1824
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,920
 Yeah.

1825
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,920
 What do you do?

1826
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,920
 What?

1827
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,940
 I just ate a Caesar's dinner for the umpteenth billionth.

1828
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,560
 They love Caesar's so much.

1829
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,080
 God, they love those little Caesar's dinners.

1830
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,080
 You don't.

1831
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,640
 This is make dog dinners.

1832
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,780
 Caesar's is a brand of dog food made by the bars company.

1833
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,920
 I thought the little Caesar's pizza company as well.

1834
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,560
 No, because the Starbucks has those weird like lippy lick cups.

1835
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,560
 They have like the dog cup thing.

1836
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,560
 No, these are.

1837
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,560
 These are pup cups.

1838
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,560
 No.

1839
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,560
 Pup cups gross me out, man.

1840
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,560
 It's just a, it's just a cup full of whipped cream.

1841
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,560
 They're ordering them.

1842
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,560
 I mean, it tastes so good.

1843
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,560
 You don't have dogs.

1844
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,160
 I just look so disgusting when I watch myself eat it.

1845
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,160
 The boys love them.

1846
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,160
 So he just gets them every time.

1847
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,520
 He's just covering your beard.

1848
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,120
 Did I get three pup cups?

1849
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,120
 You got a dog?

1850
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,120
 No.

1851
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,120
 He got a big old white spot on his nose.

1852
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,120
 What do you have to have a dog?

1853
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,120
 Yeah.

1854
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,120
 To order a pup cup.

1855
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,120
 Don't answer that.

1856
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,120
 Nazi Germany?

1857
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,120
 I live as a dog.

1858
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,760
 Not sure you can tell me I can't order off the kid's menu because I don't have a kid.

1859
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,880
 My pronouns are bow wow.

1860
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,560
 They do tell me I can't order off the kid's menu.

1861
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,560
 So I actually, I ordered the kids at Chinese.

1862
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,560
 I do the kids.

1863
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,560
 Oh yeah.

1864
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,560
 The canes.

1865
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,560
 Two fingers is plenty.

1866
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,560
 Not a Chinese guy.

1867
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,560
 Do you see the Japanese guy who lives as a dog?

1868
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,560
 Have I?

1869
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,560
 Yeah.

1870
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,560
 No.

1871
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,560
 He has.

1872
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,640
 Listeners, you'll notice that I had to do it that way or as Paul would just repeat that

1873
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,640
 five times.

1874
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:11,180
 He has a custom made multiple thousand dollar fursuit that makes him look like Lassie.

1875
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,180
 For real?

1876
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:16,240
 And it looks so real.

1877
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,240
 Okay.

1878
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,240
 It will scare you.

1879
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,240
 He lives as a person.

1880
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,720
 He does this as a bit.

1881
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,840
 He lives as this dog.

1882
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,840
 Okay.

1883
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,840
 As much as he can.

1884
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,840
 Okay.

1885
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,360
 He has people take him to parks.

1886
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,560
 Oh my God.

1887
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,440
 And be like I'm their dog.

1888
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:38,280
 And he'll play with kids and shit and have other people come up.

1889
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,280
 No he will not.

1890
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,280
 Have people come up and pet him.

1891
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,280
 No he will not actually.

1892
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,280
 Oh yeah.

1893
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,280
 Oh yeah.

1894
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,280
 It's kids birthday party entertainment.

1895
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,560
 Dad went to the park and this guy just like a dog started playing with us.

1896
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,840
 Don't ever go to that park ever again.

1897
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,840
 We are moving.

1898
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,840
 Today.

1899
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,280
 You remember what it was like when you were playing games on.

1900
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,560
 It's better if I kill you now.

1901
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,000
 You were playing games on the PlayStation.

1902
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 That's him?

1903
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,360
 Sorry, Mitsy just showed me a photo and I'm seeing a picture of a dog.

1904
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,360
 That's him.

1905
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,360
 Dude, that's what I'm saying.

1906
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,360
 From that distance you won't be able to tell.

1907
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,360
 Oh wow.

1908
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,120
 That's what I'm saying.

1909
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,120
 It does look like that.

1910
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,320
 When you see it in motion.

1911
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,960
 It's like you're playing a PlayStation game.

1912
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,820
 Like an original PlayStation game.

1913
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,840
 The graphics are right.

1914
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,280
 The internal skeleton is off.

1915
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,720
 The mocap is fucked somehow.

1916
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,720
 It's just.

1917
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,720
 It's just.

1918
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,720
 Just a little off.

1919
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,720
 It's uncanny valley to an nth degree.

1920
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,720
 But for dogs.

1921
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,760
 For one fucking guy.

1922
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,760
 Paul.

1923
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:41,600
 You have to surprise Ann by getting this guy to be your fifth dog.

1924
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,600
 Poor Ann.

1925
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,600
 He doesn't have a corgi costume.

1926
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,600
 She.

1927
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:49,360
 There is a Patreon level scoops if you want to be Paul's fifth dog.

1928
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,360
 No, seriously.

1929
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,320
 I think it's like a $20,000 outfit.

1930
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,320
 Anyway.

1931
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,320
 Sorry.

1932
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,320
 Right now.

1933
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,320
 Go fund me.

1934
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,320
 It's above that.

1935
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,320
 Yeah.

1936
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,320
 Go fund me.

1937
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,320
 Well, poor Ann.

1938
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,320
 I mean, it's already.

1939
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,640
 Today's her first day alone.

1940
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,520
 Did you get any calls from Ann about anything going on in the basement or anything?

1941
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,520
 Oh fuck.

1942
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,880
 I got a squirrel in the basement again.

1943
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:09,880
 You do not.

1944
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,880
 I think I do.

1945
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,880
 What did Ann call and tell you?

1946
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,280
 She told me there's a bunch of stuff falling off my shelves.

1947
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,760
 I'm like, no, that's, that's a squirrel.

1948
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,760
 Yeah.

1949
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,760
 But you.

1950
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,760
 But Ann is.

1951
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,960
 And it's clearly going to go down into the basement and take care of this squirrel problem,

1952
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,960
 right?

1953
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,960
 No.

1954
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:27,640
 I'm going to come on here.

1955
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,280
 I just got off the phone with Ann.

1956
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,160
 She said some DVDs and some figures and got knocked off a shelf.

1957
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,220
 The squirrel's back.

1958
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:38,040
 She said she's going to leave it down there until I get back, so I'll have to deal with

1959
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,040
 it.

1960
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,800
 Well, it's got to get, it's getting your time.

1961
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,800
 They got to come back inside.

1962
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,800
 You had a guy.

1963
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,800
 Didn't you?

1964
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,800
 Didn't you call a guy?

1965
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,800
 No, I did it all myself.

1966
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,000
 Did you consider dressing up as a squirrel?

1967
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,500
 I called people, but they were like, oh, I can't really do anything.

1968
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,860
 Good luck.

1969
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:56,860
 That's what they say.

1970
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:59,360
 But you, the last time you had a hole in the wall.

1971
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,360
 We still do.

1972
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,360
 Okay.

1973
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,360
 Maybe that's the culprit.

1974
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,360
 What?

1975
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,360
 No shit.

1976
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,360
 Oh, bad.

1977
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,360
 That hole is structural.

1978
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,360
 No, this is.

1979
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,360
 Now we call that hole off limits.

1980
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,640
 We're getting the house.

1981
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,040
 There's a sign with a no squirrel, a big no strike through it.

1982
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,040
 They can't figure it out.

1983
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,760
 The house is going to get repaired in like three weeks.

1984
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,360
 They're coming out to fix the book.

1985
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,360
 Okay.

1986
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,840
 But of course, three weeks and here comes another fucking score because it was raining

1987
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:27,740
 so hard now and thinks possibly the sump pump kicked on and it was enough vibration to shake

1988
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,840
 stuff loose.

1989
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,280
 But we know, we know that's not true.

1990
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,520
 It's maybe that sub pump vibration.

1991
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,560
 It's maybe, but I, I don't know.

1992
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,120
 I don't think so.

1993
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,120
 Nope.

1994
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,120
 Squirrel.

1995
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,000
 I guess we'll see.

1996
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,520
 Is it possible that this squirrel only wants to be on this podcast?

1997
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,540
 This is not the same squirrel.

1998
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:50,540
 We thought that.

1999
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:53,760
 I do.

2000
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,760
 We caught that squirrel.

2001
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,320
 We drove him five miles away.

2002
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,680
 This is how long it took him to get five miles.

2003
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,680
 No way.

2004
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,680
 A squirrel could travel five miles.

2005
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:01,680
 Yeah.

2006
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,680
 You might be right.

2007
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,680
 I don't know.

2008
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,920
 Do you think it's a Japanese guy dressed up like a squirrel?

2009
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:12,080
 If it is, I got, I got a very sexy night ahead of me when I get back home.

2010
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,080
 Exactly.

2011
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:17,760
 Speaking of sexy nights and problems that Paul can't solve.

2012
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,840
 It's time for Jock Versus Nerd.

2013
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:30,560
 Ladies and gentlemen, it is time.

2014
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:41,800
 Time for Jock Versus Nerd.

2015
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,600
 Explosion.

2016
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,640
 Rapture Teens.

2017
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,920
 Rapture Teens?

2018
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,520
 Teens, yeah.

2019
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,400
 That's the only fancy account that has SJ's face on it.

2020
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,400
 Oh, shit.

2021
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,400
 RaptureTeens.org/rapture.

2022
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,400
 Sorry, guys.

2023
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,400
 I can't do this.

2024
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,440
 I've got to go check a website out real quick.

2025
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,440
 At your computer.

2026
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,440
 Mitzi is here.

2027
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:10,480
 We were going to have him come on Zoom, but he's here in person because he's been touting

2028
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,560
 this version of Price is Right to us for quite some time.

2029
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,560
 Yes, that's right.

2030
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:18,520
 He, and he learned what everyone else learns, which is like, just do it, and we'll say yes.

2031
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,840
 I saw, this is not hard.

2032
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,800
 This is borrowed from Dropout TV on the internet.

2033
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,080
 Shout out Dropout TV.

2034
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,080
 Great.

2035
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,120
 They had an episode and it was very tilting and fun to watch.

2036
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,560
 Dropout TV is, Emily Gillette called me and was like, "You have to get these shows on

2037
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,560
 Dropout TV.

2038
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,520
 They're layups for you and Paul would crush on them."

2039
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,520
 And I was like, "Emily, we're old."

2040
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,520
 I was like, "Dropout TV is for young people."

2041
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,520
 20 years ago, it would have been perfect for you.

2042
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,520
 Yeah.

2043
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,520
 Young people were on that.

2044
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,320
 Young people at the UCB Theater were on it.

2045
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,320
 So they have ...

2046
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:48,720
 My students who became teachers taught, those students became teachers and those teachers

2047
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,440
 taught the people who were on Dropout TV.

2048
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,440
 Right.

2049
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,640
 So you're like the great, great, great grandfather of Dropout TV.

2050
00:49:54,640 --> 00:50:01,060
 Look, you know, when Ben Schwartz was like, "Yeah, I mean, you guys really paved the way,"

2051
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:05,760
 and put me in a generation above him comedically, but I was like, "You would sit in on my show

2052
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,760
 all the time.

2053
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,560
 Why am I old?"

2054
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,560
 We graduated together.

2055
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,480
 And then I was like, "Oh, I guess he's right."

2056
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,480
 Yeah.

2057
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,280
 I looked back and I was like, "Wait, he's right."

2058
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,280
 Sometimes they're just right.

2059
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,080
 We still have a fun podcast.

2060
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:23,920
 Paul, thank you for waking up in time to say that.

2061
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,160
 All right.

2062
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,520
 So this is second closest scooperty.

2063
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:32,160
 The point is not awarded to who gets the answer correct.

2064
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,840
 The point is awarded to who gets second closest to the actual answer.

2065
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:36,840
 Okay.

2066
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:37,840
 More importantly, there's no price is right rules.

2067
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,360
 There is no price is right rules.

2068
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:44,320
 The only time that factors is if two people are equally wrong, the person that's lower

2069
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,320
 gets the tie break.

2070
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,320
 Gotcha.

2071
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,320
 Okay.

2072
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,800
 So if you're both five off, if Matt's five over, Paul's five under.

2073
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,800
 I'm so happy.

2074
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,800
 I've never been happier with a game already.

2075
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,800
 There is.

2076
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,140
 I did add a wrinkle.

2077
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:57,560
 If somebody gets it exactly right, second closest gets a bonus point.

2078
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,560
 Oh.

2079
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,560
 Hilarious.

2080
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,560
 That's really funny.

2081
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,560
 I like that rule.

2082
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,560
 Yep.

2083
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,560
 I like it.

2084
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,560
 All right.

2085
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,560
 So these are all numbers.

2086
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,560
 Even when they're exactly right, second closest is still right.

2087
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,560
 Yeah.

2088
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:08,560
 So even if you're right.

2089
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,560
 It's still going to be numbers.

2090
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,560
 Yes.

2091
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,560
 Everything is going to be a number.

2092
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,560
 Great.

2093
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,560
 Maybe.

2094
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,560
 I could find a way.

2095
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,080
 I mean, you could find a way, but it's going to be really hard to input into the spreadsheet.

2096
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:22,920
 All of these numbers are based off of a Google AI, so we can trust that source.

2097
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:23,920
 As of getting warmed up.

2098
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,920
 Paul's just yelling out numbers.

2099
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:25,920
 Paul's just yelling out numbers.

2100
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,920
 I thought he was just yelling numbers.

2101
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,920
 Yeah.

2102
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:28,920
 I'm just yelling out some numbers.

2103
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:29,920
 Yeah.

2104
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,920
 You were right.

2105
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,920
 He's yelling out numbers.

2106
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,920
 Starting with the first question.

2107
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:33,920
 Jacob, you are first on the list.

2108
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,920
 All right.

2109
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,920
 So you'll go first.

2110
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,920
 All three of you will give your answers and then I'll give you the right result.

2111
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:37,920
 You're not the boss of me.

2112
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,880
 How many hotel rooms are there in the Las Vegas Valley?

2113
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,680
 Las Vegas Valley.

2114
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,280
 So all of Las Vegas area.

2115
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,280
 Yeah.

2116
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,280
 Not just the strip.

2117
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,160
 For a hint, according to Google, there's 50,000 on the strip.

2118
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,160
 Yeah.

2119
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,160
 I think it's like 200.

2120
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,160
 I'll say 225,000.

2121
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,160
 225,000.

2122
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:58,160
 Some people would say that differently.

2123
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,160
 Some people might.

2124
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,160
 Matt.

2125
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,800
 Those people have two not bloody eyes.

2126
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:03,800
 225,000.

2127
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:08,520
 I will go with 175,000.

2128
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,520
 Interesting.

2129
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,520
 Interesting.

2130
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,520
 Some people would have said that differently.

2131
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,520
 175,000.

2132
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,520
 Paul?

2133
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,520
 300,000.

2134
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,520
 Wow.

2135
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,520
 I'm trying numbers.

2136
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,520
 All right.

2137
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,520
 The actual answer.

2138
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,520
 Thank you very much.

2139
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,520
 Nailed it.

2140
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,520
 150,000.

2141
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,520
 859.

2142
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:25,520
 Which makes Matt our closest guess.

2143
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,520
 One point.

2144
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,520
 Nope.

2145
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,520
 That's not right.

2146
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:34,000
 159, which makes Matt our closest guess one point.

2147
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
 Nope.

2148
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
 That's not one point to Matt.

2149
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
 No, it's one point to Jacob.

2150
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
 Jacob, our second closest.

2151
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
 Yes.

2152
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 Damn it.

2153
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
 All right.

2154
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
 One second.

2155
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
 I'm great at this game.

2156
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 One of my equations got broken.

2157
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,840
 He's already having a hard time with it, but I'm great at it.

2158
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:46,840
 Okay.

2159
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,840
 150,000.

2160
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:48,840
 I'm locked in now.

2161
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,840
 I've got it.

2162
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:50,840
 Yeah.

2163
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:51,840
 Sorry.

2164
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:52,840
 One second.

2165
00:52:52,840 --> 00:53:00,240
 I have never been more angry that we're not on video for a show.

2166
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:04,400
 We're not on video for how many shows in a row, and we're not on for this one.

2167
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,120
 Paul is just a face and a sea of comfort around him.

2168
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:12,160
 Keeping it in Vegas parking and weather related, going with Matt first on this one.

2169
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:16,680
 How many jets, blasters, and nozzles are there in the Bellagio fountains?

2170
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:17,860
 Oh, fuck.

2171
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,240
 What counts as a jet, a blaster, or a nozzle?

2172
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,640
 Well, the jets is a gang.

2173
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,640
 Nozzles are time travelers.

2174
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:27,260
 When you're a nozzle, you're a nozzle all the way.

2175
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:29,600
 Nozzles are just, you know, idiots.

2176
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,600
 Muggles.

2177
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,480
 Nozzles is what we call the people watching the show.

2178
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,480
 So it's totally not just jets.

2179
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,480
 It's jets.

2180
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,480
 Nozzles.

2181
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,480
 Everything.

2182
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,480
 Nozzles in Aries.

2183
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,480
 Nozzles.

2184
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,480
 Nozzles squirt water up in the area.

2185
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,960
 Nozzles squirt water up in the area.

2186
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:42,960
 800.

2187
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,960
 Matt guesses 800.

2188
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:44,960
 Paul?

2189
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:52,760
 I'm going to need about 350.

2190
00:53:52,760 --> 00:54:06,400
 How is it that Paul isn't drunk?

2191
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,920
 I'm going to say, uh, 801.

2192
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:11,920
 801.

2193
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,560
 All right.

2194
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:19,960
 There are 1,214 jets, which means Jacob would be closest.

2195
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,040
 So Matt gets the point.

2196
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:26,080
 I thought it was going to be like seven something or six something.

2197
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,080
 I love it.

2198
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,680
 It's already the much better version of Price is Right.

2199
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,680
 I love this.

2200
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,240
 I gotta fix this because I just realized there was one little error in my equations.

2201
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,840
 You're cooking, buddy.

2202
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,280
 All right.

2203
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,280
 How many pounds of ice cream, we're starting with Paul this time.

2204
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:42,480
 How many pounds of ice cream were used for the world's largest ice cream sundae made

2205
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,160
 in 1988 by Palm Dairy?

2206
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,160
 Ten pounds.

2207
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,760
 Ten pounds of ice cream is the world's largest ice cream sundae.

2208
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,760
 All right, Jacob.

2209
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,760
 Wait, what?

2210
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:51,760
 This way?

2211
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,760
 Beat it.

2212
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,760
 Beat that.

2213
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,760
 Is that right?

2214
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:55,760
 Paul?

2215
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:56,760
 Good luck.

2216
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,240
 Good luck being better than second best on that.

2217
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,240
 I'm going to say...

2218
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,240
 How much?

2219
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,240
 More than 30.

2220
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,240
 Oh, really?

2221
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,240
 More than 30?

2222
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,240
 I only said 10.

2223
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,240
 Oh, I don't know what you said.

2224
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:06,240
 I said 10.

2225
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,240
 800 pounds.

2226
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,240
 800.

2227
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,240
 Oh my God.

2228
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,240
 That's insane.

2229
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,840
 And Matt?

2230
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,840
 Eleven.

2231
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,840
 Eleven.

2232
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,480
 Oh, you sneaky fuck.

2233
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,040
 The correct answer is 44687.

2234
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:26,920
 Jacob would have been closest, but due to math, Matt is second now.

2235
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:27,920
 I played it right.

2236
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:33,360
 He gamesmanshiped it properly there by knowing that Paul was so far off that you could be

2237
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,280
 one better than him and be correct.

2238
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,280
 That's it.

2239
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,280
 That's it.

2240
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,000
 I was close.

2241
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,720
 This might give an even bigger advantage to the person who goes third.

2242
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:43,720
 That's true.

2243
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,800
 Well, I mean, it depends on genuine answer or not.

2244
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,800
 Right.

2245
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,800
 Right.

2246
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:48,800
 All right.

2247
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,800
 Next up.

2248
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,800
 That's a genuine answer.

2249
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,800
 This one we are starting with Jacob.

2250
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,360
 We're back to the top.

2251
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,360
 As of May 19th, 2025...

2252
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,760
 Ask something about ghosts.

2253
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,040
 How many episodes of The Simpsons have aired?

2254
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,040
 Something about ghosts.

2255
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,160
 I asked for a ghost question.

2256
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,360
 Oh, Simpsons episodes?

2257
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,720
 How many have been?

2258
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,360
 As of when?

2259
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:13,640
 As of May 19th, the most recent airing of their most recent episode.

2260
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:17,880
 So there have been 532 episodes.

2261
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:24,120
 532, Matt?

2262
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,120
 What episode?

2263
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,120
 530.

2264
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,120
 530.

2265
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,120
 All right.

2266
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,720
 There have been 790 episodes.

2267
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,120
 Locked in.

2268
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,120
 Yes!

2269
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,120
 No.

2270
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,120
 Locked in.

2271
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:39,120
 Wait, what did I say?

2272
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,120
 You said 532.

2273
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,120
 I got it.

2274
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,120
 I said 532?

2275
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,120
 Paul said 530.

2276
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,120
 So he's second closer.

2277
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,120
 Oh, in my mind I said 522.

2278
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,360
 I don't even know what I said anymore.

2279
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,360
 All right.

2280
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,360
 All right.

2281
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,360
 Starting with Matt.

2282
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,360
 Going in the middle is really tricky.

2283
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,360
 It really is.

2284
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,360
 Just say 10.

2285
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:59,960
 How many minutes is the combined runtime of all 21 official studio albums by Bruce Springsteen?

2286
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:00,960
 Oh.

2287
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,960
 Wait, what?

2288
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,960
 Question about ghosts.

2289
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,600
 How many minutes...

2290
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,000
 It's spooky season.

2291
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:12,160
 ...is the runtime of all of 21 of Bruce Springsteen's studio albums?

2292
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,720
 Wow.

2293
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,520
 1,800.

2294
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,920
 Paul?

2295
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:28,960
 It's hard to game this one.

2296
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:29,960
 Yeah.

2297
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:30,960
 1,801.

2298
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,960
 Ooh.

2299
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,640
 Jacob.

2300
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:45,800
 It'll be weird when Paul gets it on the nose.

2301
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,760
 Which way is wrong?

2302
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:48,760
 Right, right.

2303
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:49,760
 So this is the thing, right?

2304
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,680
 So now you have to figure out what your right answer is in your mind.

2305
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:53,680
 Right.

2306
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,680
 That's it.

2307
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,680
 And then figure out where you want to be.

2308
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,600
 So now I have a 50/50 chance.

2309
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:01,160
 Well, if Matt is closer to the answer than you are right now...

2310
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,160
 Not possible.

2311
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,400
 If Matt is closer to the answer than you are, then you get a point.

2312
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,200
 If you're closer to the answer than Matt is, then Matt gets a point.

2313
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,200
 Wait.

2314
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,200
 No.

2315
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,200
 But you have to guess and that'll change it all.

2316
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,200
 Right.

2317
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,200
 But you said right now.

2318
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,200
 So I was answering...

2319
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,200
 Oh, I guess you're right.

2320
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,200
 I was answering the question that you asked.

2321
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,200
 Oh, I guess you're right.

2322
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,200
 Something about ghosts, please.

2323
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,760
 There's not a lot of ghost math.

2324
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:21,760
 Sorry.

2325
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,760
 Man.

2326
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:23,760
 What were the two answers?

2327
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,760
 1,800.

2328
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,280
 1,800 from Matt and 1,801 from Paul.

2329
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,280
 1,802.

2330
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,280
 Whoa.

2331
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,280
 All right.

2332
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,280
 The correct...

2333
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,280
 All I was between 1,802 and 1,799.

2334
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,280
 Right.

2335
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:40,160
 I'm getting this one locked in.

2336
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,560
 The correct answer is 1,178 minutes.

2337
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,560
 Oh, shit.

2338
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:44,560
 Paul gets the point.

2339
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,560
 Oh, yes.

2340
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,560
 You're the second closest.

2341
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,080
 Matt was closest with 1,800.

2342
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,080
 Paul was second with 1,801.

2343
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,080
 Oh, yes.

2344
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,080
 So by sandwiching Paul.

2345
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2346
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,080
 I meant through the other...

2347
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,080
 Yeah, yeah.

2348
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:55,080
 Never mind.

2349
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,080
 But you couldn't have sandwiched yourself in between us.

2350
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,080
 Right.

2351
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,080
 That's the move.

2352
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,080
 Right.

2353
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,080
 Okay.

2354
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,080
 This is fascinating.

2355
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,080
 I wanted it between you.

2356
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,080
 But you couldn't.

2357
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,080
 But I couldn't that time.

2358
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,080
 Right.

2359
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,080
 That's right.

2360
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,080
 Yes.

2361
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,080
 Yeah.

2362
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,080
 Oh, that is a different...

2363
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,080
 Because I'm using ghost math.

2364
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,080
 That's right.

2365
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,080
 In September.

2366
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,080
 Okay.

2367
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,080
 I like this.

2368
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,080
 Spooky.

2369
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,080
 Okay, okay, okay.

2370
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,080
 I think we found a new tactic.

2371
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,080
 I like this.

2372
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:19,080
 That's true.

2373
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,080
 We definitely found a new tactic.

2374
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,080
 How many distilleries are currently operating in the United States of America?

2375
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,080
 Do they count Guam and Taiwan?

2376
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,080
 Matt.

2377
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,080
 We are starting with Paul.

2378
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,080
 It is 2025.

2379
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,080
 Of course not.

2380
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:29,000
 Distillery means makes rum.

2381
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
 Makes alcohol.

2382
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
 Just booze.

2383
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
 Yeah.

2384
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
 Distilleries.

2385
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
 Although it just makes distilled spirits.

2386
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,880
 So St. Croix counts with Cruz and Rum.

2387
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:46,160
 So I'm going to guess there's probably, probably, I'm going to rough guess, let's say a hundred,

2388
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:49,840
 no, probably 200 per state.

2389
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,040
 Per state?

2390
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,760
 Per state.

2391
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,760
 Oh!

2392
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,880
 So 200 times 50?

2393
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:01,600
 Do you want us to just tell you now that that's wrong?

2394
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,400
 Not all states are like Kentucky.

2395
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,360
 Thank the fuck God.

2396
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,640
 And the fuck God is my favorite.

2397
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:08,640
 Yes.

2398
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,640
 He's the good one.

2399
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:10,640
 Hello.

2400
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,640
 I am the god of fuck.

2401
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:12,640
 I am the god of fuck.

2402
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:13,640
 Fuck God!

2403
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:14,640
 Wait.

2404
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:15,640
 Are you done answering?

2405
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:16,640
 No.

2406
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,640
 200 per state is 10,000.

2407
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:27,200
 200 per state is not right, so using ghost math.

2408
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:34,760
 If this is your first episode of listening to Matt Madley's ice cream social, I'm sorry.

2409
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:35,760
 Just stop now.

2410
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:36,760
 Just bail.

2411
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:40,840
 I really thought he was just relying on Mitzi to do the math, like 200 per state, go for

2412
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:41,840
 it.

2413
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:42,840
 Whatever you think that might be, Mitzi.

2414
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:43,840
 No, no.

2415
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,840
 We're running with it, buddy.

2416
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,840
 You got the number in front of you.

2417
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:46,840
 Just put me close to it.

2418
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:47,840
 Yeah.

2419
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:48,840
 No.

2420
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:49,840
 Okay.

2421
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:56,320
 Well, let's do.

2422
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,440
 Is this the first guest on this question?

2423
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:59,440
 Yes.

2424
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,440
 5,000.

2425
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:01,440
 5,000.

2426
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,440
 Okay.

2427
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,440
 Jacob.

2428
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,440
 4,999.

2429
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,440
 Okay.

2430
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,480
 Now we're playing for shit.

2431
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:10,760
 So I get the gamesmanship, right?

2432
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:14,080
 Because then if I go somewhere more realistic.

2433
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:17,600
 If you go realistic, then you give me the point.

2434
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,960
 If you go unrealistic, you give Paul the point.

2435
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:20,960
 No.

2436
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:21,960
 Yes.

2437
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:22,960
 Yes.

2438
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:23,960
 You went forward, didn't you?

2439
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:24,960
 No.

2440
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:25,960
 No.

2441
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:26,960
 I went one under you.

2442
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:27,960
 He went one below.

2443
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:28,960
 So Matt can't get between us.

2444
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:29,960
 So he either has to go under or over.

2445
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,880
 But if he goes over, then that's going to be a point to me.

2446
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,240
 That's what I just said.

2447
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:39,040
 And you followed that up with saying no and then said the same thing.

2448
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,960
 Basically, I'm in a position to either give Jacob or you a point.

2449
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,240
 That's the only thing I can do.

2450
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,240
 That's exactly it.

2451
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,840
 So the question is, do you think the numbers are less than their numbers?

2452
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:52,720
 Or you could get it exactly right and give us two points.

2453
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:53,720
 That is true.

2454
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:54,720
 That is an opportunity.

2455
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,240
 Matt, get it exactly right.

2456
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,320
 All right.

2457
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:02,360
 For the sake of getting it exactly right.

2458
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:03,360
 Here we go.

2459
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:07,200
 Daddy's rolling the dice.

2460
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,200
 1,321.

2461
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,200
 Ghost math.

2462
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,200
 All right.

2463
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:18,960
 Matt's answer is two thousand two hundred and thirty, meaning Jacob is second closest.

2464
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:19,960
 So Paul was closest.

2465
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:20,960
 Yes.

2466
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:21,960
 Have you gone over?

2467
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,960
 No.

2468
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:23,960
 No, I was close.

2469
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,400
 That was closest.

2470
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,400
 I was way over.

2471
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,400
 You both are way over.

2472
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,400
 There's only two thousand places making booze.

2473
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,400
 Yeah.

2474
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,400
 Can you imagine?

2475
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,400
 That's why there's such a shortage.

2476
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,400
 That's why you can't find booze anywhere.

2477
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:40,640
 I'm realizing right now, like, holy shit, why can't I remember any of these answers?

2478
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:41,640
 It's because I never have to.

2479
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:45,420
 I usually have the computer screen in front of me.

2480
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:46,580
 Next up, we've got a fun one.

2481
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:47,580
 This is one of my favorite ones.

2482
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:48,580
 This is about ghosts.

2483
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:49,880
 Are you keeping track of the points?

2484
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:50,880
 Yeah.

2485
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:51,880
 What have we got?

2486
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:53,360
 It is currently a three way tie at two points apiece.

2487
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,480
 But who has the second most points?

2488
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,480
 Me.

2489
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,960
 I am currently winning with the second most points in this game.

2490
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,480
 How many more questions do you have?

2491
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,080
 I have four plus a couple of backups.

2492
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,080
 So a lot of questions.

2493
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,080
 I got two more.

2494
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,080
 Two more sounds great.

2495
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:09,560
 Then we'll keep going if we want to keep going.

2496
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:14,920
 How many college football teams are currently playing football in the Big Ten?

2497
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:17,620
 We are starting with Jacob on this.

2498
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:24,080
 The Big Ten.

2499
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,080
 For you non-sportsball fans, this is actually a very good question.

2500
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:32,760
 I think like four.

2501
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,040
 Four is Jacob's guess.

2502
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:36,800
 Matt, how many teams are currently playing in the Big Ten?

2503
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:37,800
 Ten.

2504
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,520
 That's a solid guess.

2505
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,520
 Paul?

2506
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,520
 Five.

2507
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,080
 Five.

2508
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:51,640
 So you're thinking of the Pac-12, which has two teams and not the Big 12, which has 16

2509
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:52,640
 teams.

2510
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:53,640
 Because you don't math.

2511
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:54,640
 Right.

2512
01:03:54,640 --> 01:04:01,600
 The Big Ten obviously has 18 football teams, which makes Matt the closest guess and Paul

2513
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:04,000
 the second closest guess with five.

2514
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:11,720
 No, I'm using ghost math.

2515
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:14,240
 So currently ghost math is winning the game.

2516
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,240
 Come at me.

2517
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,240
 Come at me.

2518
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,540
 Casper is running this thing.

2519
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:26,280
 How many days were there between the groundbreaking and the grand opening of the Fountain Blue

2520
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,280
 Las Vegas?

2521
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,280
 Oh Jesus.

2522
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,280
 Holy shit.

2523
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,280
 That was a boondoggle.

2524
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,280
 How many days?

2525
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,280
 How many days?

2526
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:35,560
 Come on, Paul's doing Kentucky math.

2527
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:36,560
 With ghosts.

2528
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,560
 With ghosts.

2529
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:38,560
 Who goes first?

2530
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:39,560
 This one starts with.

2531
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,440
 I think I went first last time.

2532
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:42,440
 Matt, you start first.

2533
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:45,360
 Oh yeah, because I said four on the last one.

2534
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,360
 1,400.

2535
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:47,360
 1,400 days.

2536
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,360
 1,400 days.

2537
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:53,640
 Paul, how many days between the groundbreaking to the grand opening?

2538
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:54,640
 1,401.

2539
01:04:54,640 --> 01:05:08,680
 1,400, 1,401, fuck.

2540
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:12,720
 So again, like I just decide, I decide who to use it to know who you want to give two

2541
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:13,720
 points to.

2542
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:14,720
 You're going for it.

2543
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:15,720
 I get it.

2544
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:18,720
 You did not nail this.

2545
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:24,920
 Let's see, 365 times 17.

2546
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:28,200
 Oh, you think they did it on the actual anniversary?

2547
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:30,880
 No, no, no, but like, oh, but you're just doing that.

2548
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,280
 It was roughly 17 years.

2549
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,280
 Was it?

2550
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:35,280
 Yeah.

2551
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,280
 17 years.

2552
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,280
 It was a fuck ton of time.

2553
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:39,280
 17 years.

2554
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:42,160
 Um, so let's see if I go high, Matt gets a point.

2555
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,800
 If I go low, Paul gets a point, right?

2556
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,800
 Not 17 years.

2557
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,160
 Paul has the lead.

2558
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,880
 Matt has 1,400 guests.

2559
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:49,880
 Paul has 1,401.

2560
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:50,880
 Ah, okay.

2561
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,440
 So if you go high, I get a point.

2562
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:54,440
 Right.

2563
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:55,440
 You go high and I get a point.

2564
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,440
 Oh, wait, wait.

2565
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:57,840
 You say the fountain blue?

2566
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:58,840
 Yes.

2567
01:05:58,840 --> 01:05:59,840
 Oh, one day.

2568
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,840
 One day.

2569
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:01,840
 Yeah, yeah.

2570
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:02,840
 One day, Wink.

2571
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:03,840
 That's right.

2572
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:04,840
 It was one day.

2573
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:05,840
 All right.

2574
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:06,840
 Well, Jacob was close.

2575
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:07,840
 It was, uh, I didn't could find the official day of the groundbreaking, but I found an

2576
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:08,840
 article on February 2nd of 2007.

2577
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:09,840
 Okay.

2578
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:10,840
 And it opened December 13th, 2023.

2579
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:11,840
 Yeah.

2580
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:12,840
 So 6,158 days.

2581
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:15,840
 That was a lot of time.

2582
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,760
 Five ownership groups, I believe, and multiple other things that happened in that time.

2583
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:22,360
 I think a couple of court orders to tear down what had already been constructed.

2584
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:23,360
 Yeah.

2585
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,480
 That means I get the point, right?

2586
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,480
 Yes.

2587
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,480
 It does.

2588
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:30,520
 Which means right now, Matt and Paul are tied at three, which means Jacob has the second

2589
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:31,520
 most points.

2590
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,040
 And it's a cat's game.

2591
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,960
 When Matt and Paul are tied and Jack versus nerd, Jacob wins.

2592
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,160
 Second most points win the game?

2593
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,880
 Eh, we could do that if we really want to.

2594
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:39,880
 That's really funny.

2595
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,880
 Second most points wins the game.

2596
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:44,800
 Oh, that adds a whole nother layer of strategy.

2597
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,960
 I have three, I have four more questions.

2598
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:50,240
 We can play for second, second, second if we want.

2599
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,240
 No.

2600
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,240
 Let's wrap it up.

2601
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,240
 No, that's good.

2602
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,240
 One more, but this has been fun.

2603
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,240
 Is it about ghosts?

2604
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,240
 All right.

2605
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,240
 This is, this is one less.

2606
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:58,240
 I don't have it.

2607
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,240
 He doesn't have any about ghosts.

2608
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,240
 Well, not with that attitude.

2609
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,240
 All right.

2610
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:02,680
 We're going to go with this one.

2611
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:05,300
 I have two that I'm trying to between.

2612
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:11,560
 What is the current cost to join the Las Vegas A's season ticket holder priority list in American

2613
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:12,560
 dollars?

2614
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:16,280
 Oh, I was going to say your pride, but that doesn't.

2615
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,280
 Starting with Jacob.

2616
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,280
 Oh shit.

2617
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:19,280
 God damn it.

2618
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,160
 Why does it start with me?

2619
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:31,120
 Um, $472 Matt, this is just to get on the list.

2620
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:36,020
 This is the, this is the down payment to put your secure, your spot for the A's season

2621
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:37,020
 tickets.

2622
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:38,020
 What did you say?

2623
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:43,280
 $472, $473.

2624
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,840
 All right, Paul.

2625
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:48,880
 It is definitely more than that.

2626
01:07:48,880 --> 01:08:00,680
 But I'm going to say 470.

2627
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:01,680
 What'd you say, Jacob?

2628
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:02,680
 Two.

2629
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:07,280
 That's a four 72, four 72 50.

2630
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:13,120
 This is actually the only time you can technically get in there with a middle number or it gets

2631
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,960
 even better guys.

2632
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,800
 The current price to join the A's season ticket list is $19 a one cent.

2633
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,800
 Oh shit.

2634
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:20,800
 I got that right.

2635
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:21,800
 I still won.

2636
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:22,800
 No, I knew you got the point.

2637
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:23,800
 Yeah.

2638
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:24,800
 I thought it was like a hundred bucks.

2639
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:25,800
 Yeah.

2640
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:26,800
 So here's the thing.

2641
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:29,240
 Paul got the point, which now gives Paul four points, which means Matt wins the game cause

2642
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:32,280
 he has three points and Jacob loses with two.

2643
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:33,280
 We did it guys.

2644
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:38,280
 Wouldn't that make me the first runner up?

2645
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,280
 First runner up.

2646
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,280
 I like it.

2647
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:41,280
 I like it.

2648
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,280
 Excellent new game, Missoula.

2649
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:43,720
 Have fun programming that one.

2650
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:44,720
 Yeah.

2651
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:45,720
 Holy shit.

2652
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:46,720
 I, well, here's the thing.

2653
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:52,880
 If you were to host a live again, I think the way to do it would be, um, for all of

2654
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:53,880
 us to-

2655
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,240
 You would write your answer down and then show it so that we can't do it this way.

2656
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,240
 Yeah.

2657
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,240
 So you can't do gamesmanship.

2658
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,240
 Oh.

2659
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:02,960
 So even if we did on zoom, we could, we could, we could private message you.

2660
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:03,960
 Yeah.

2661
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:04,960
 Our guesses without you.

2662
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:05,960
 Yeah.

2663
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:06,960
 Right.

2664
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:07,960
 That's something that we can, or, or we can-

2665
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:08,960
 Or we can just write it down.

2666
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:09,960
 Or just write it down and hold it and hold it.

2667
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:10,960
 Yeah.

2668
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:11,960
 We can figure it out.

2669
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:12,960
 Yeah.

2670
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:13,960
 Yeah.

2671
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:14,960
 We could write it down and just be able to hold it to the camera.

2672
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:15,960
 Normally I'm like the lowest tech guy.

2673
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:16,960
 I can't even think of a lower tech solution.

2674
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:17,960
 What are you talking about?

2675
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,600
 Oh, Matt's like, just make all the answers below 10 and we can just use our fingers.

2676
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:20,600
 Perfect.

2677
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:21,600
 You know what?

2678
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,600
 That's actually better.

2679
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:23,600
 That's actually better.

2680
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:24,600
 Just flash our answers.

2681
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,600
 For one of them, for one of them is not a bad idea.

2682
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:35,420
 This game is all within 10 to one to 10, feel free to sign your answers to me at any time.

2683
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:38,880
 We don't have anyone else to thank right now because we are in the, the back and I've done

2684
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,680
 a bad job at prepping for this show.

2685
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,200
 That's we're going to do a lot.

2686
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,200
 We got a lot going on.

2687
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:44,200
 We got a lot of thanking.

2688
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:49,040
 We got a lot of jiggering with our Patreon for something by with a brand new course.

2689
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,040
 Thanks for having me gentlemen.

2690
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:55,120
 Or an updated version of the game, a fun, a fun version.

2691
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,120
 Yes.

2692
01:09:56,120 --> 01:10:00,560
 And thank you to everybody who supports us over on Patreon.

2693
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,400
 You are the reason that we're able to do this show.

2694
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:07,000
 You are the reason that we are able to do things like Scoop Fest this week, which is

2695
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,360
 the reason that you're getting an insane show right now.

2696
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:13,160
 There's a lot of reasons and they're all for you.

2697
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,160
 Congratulations.

2698
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,160
 Yeah.

2699
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:19,560
 For anybody who has left a bunch of money by their unraptured neighbors, you can send

2700
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:20,560
 that our way.

2701
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:21,560
 Yep.

2702
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:31,200
 I was all ready for it.

2703
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:41,360
 It is so weird hearing these sound clips not at one and a half feet.

2704
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,560
 And if you want more questions about ghosts, go to FartsInTheBag.biz.

2705
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,560
 Bring it.

2706
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:52,320
 Farts, farts, farts, farts, farts, farts in a bag.

2707
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,320
 Next.

2708
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,320
 Second closest.

2709
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,320
 Just ghosts.

2710
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:56,320
 Oops.

2711
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:57,320
 All ghosts.

2712
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:59,960
 That's FartsInTheBag.biz along with PreachingFun.com.

2713
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:04,200
 It takes you to our Patreon page where for as little as $3 a month, you can upkeep this

2714
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,240
 show on the air.

2715
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:09,000
 Like I said, the Patreons are the reason that we are able to do this show twice a week each

2716
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:14,120
 and every week, no matter what is going on in life like this week.

2717
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:16,040
 So here you go.

2718
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:17,040
 Enjoy.

2719
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,040
 Take care.

2720
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,040
 Thanks.

2721
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,040
 Thanks, everybody.

2722
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,880
 I was going to ask Paul, did you like the video I made for the bucket show this week

2723
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,920
 with their pop-up guys?

2724
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,440
 Yes.

2725
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,240
 I really thought they were going to kiss at the end.

2726
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:29,240
 I was disappointed.

2727
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:31,280
 There's a lot of sexual tension between those two dolls.

2728
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,280
 I know.

2729
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:33,280
 It was really heavy.

2730
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,280
 Thanks a lot for this, everybody.

2731
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:35,280
 Take care of yourselves out there.

2732
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:36,280
 We love you and we'll see you soon.

2733
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,280
 We'll see you soon.

2734
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:38,280
 I did like it.

2735
01:11:38,280 --> 01:12:07,560
 I liked it.

2736
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:08,560
 It's funny though.

2737
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,280
 It's just somewhere in the middle.

2738
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:11,280
 That's all.

2739
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,680
 There's a bunch of Christians who aren't Christian at all right now.

2740
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:16,400
 There's a bunch of other Christians who are diving way too in on this Rapture stuff.

2741
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,000
 But that's me in the middle.

2742
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,840
 But those aren't Christians either.

2743
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:23,800
 That's not what Christianity is not about going up into space.

2744
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:28,060
 Wait, whose Rapture is that Christian?

2745
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:34,200
 It is a weird small sect thing that came up in like the 20s.

2746
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:37,280
 It's not truly Christian.

2747
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,840
 It's evangelical at best.

2748
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:40,200
 There's not a way to buy yourself out of it.

2749
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,520
 So it's definitely not from the Catholic Church.

2750
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:42,520
 Exactly.

2751
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,520
 It's a hoohah.

2752
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:51,600
 If it can't be cured with a plenary indulgence, I don't want to hear about it tomorrow.
