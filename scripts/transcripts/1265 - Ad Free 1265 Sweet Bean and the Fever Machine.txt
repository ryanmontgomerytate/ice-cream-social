Anyhow, I'll figure it out. I'll figure it out schlitz Sliding on uh, yes schlitz is still made and is currently owned by uh pats brood company. There we go. Wow Yeah, they probably bought all the vintage and they reintroduced the original 1960s formula It's it's brood and milwaukie. They but milwaukie as we know milwaukie in missouri both start with an m So I think that's fine they have a uh Some kind of cornered market on all the Nasty sounding names for beers This is classic old beers. This is classic old factory worker beers, man. They all just sounded like bodily functions shapers Yeah, oh god. I got a bad case of the shapers. I should have I should have got the vax when I had the chance No, I'm going I'm going through milwaukie uh with the with the jokers of magic um I was there last time we built the foolershow in milwaukie and doing paps at the paps center was like so fun Oh, right. Um I thought it was more cool than the audience did the audience didn't give a shit, but um I thought it was super fun They paps their prime Yep, they're paps. They're paps Uh, I finished up my uh f1 weekend. Uh, oh, yeah Oh, yeah, how was the rest of f1? Well, yeah, I was uh Basically trying to figure out the story didn't end well last time we were recording So I didn't get into too much of the nitty gritty details, but right the bottom line is uh They thought it'd be really funny to have two inept announcers announce some of the marquis events at the ski lodge For all three nights at at the uh at the f at the mercedes tent, right? um And the race is about an hour and a half long and having inept announcers uh For an hour and a half for an hour and a half is a little is a little long Are you one of the inept announcers? Yes. That's that was my job I mean was it Did you have breaks? Yes, or more importantly did the audience have breaks? Well, we we we eventually we figured out. Yes you know good good so, uh, we But uh, it was funny was like so we we were brought in right and then we came up with all these things for all these characters to be I came up with stetson barber. You can call me big barbie and uh We were going to do all these games and everything and uh All of a sudden we were at our first brainstorm session and they said oh We just have to you know film something and send it to Mercedes just so they know what's going on. Oh jesus Exactly exactly exactly exactly Just instantly So I was like film what like what are we shooting over right and it was like, you know And so it was it was me and uh, kasey wilson, right? friend of the friend of the show we love kasey and Mercedes based out of germany well, yeah international international automobile behemoth Mercedes Benz. Yeah, where's their Core base is the germany? I mean they're they're originally from germany. I don't know where they're based now Right exactly. I now's your chance to put on your best german And give them the kind of inept announcer That's really gonna sell it My lieber I can't believe what has happened with the car The tires they're rolling over and over the potholes And and the potholes are wet Why are we so much rain in the vegas? The rain didn't do the effect. How many cars are there? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight nine nine cars There are nine cars. nine Uh, Mercedes still based in germany. Yes Mercedes are going to Benz the rules to win. That is what we do So, uh, uh, who welcomed f1. I'm your host Dieter exactly Now it's a time on sprockets for every race That's that's next year, man. You just beat Dieter So we're filming by the way like kasey and I came in for like a brain door You know a day at the office brainstorming session. We weren't dressed Like particularly flashy or well or in character or anything And so you didn't have your uh, you had your casual tuxedo on not your show tuxedo And so we had different people to manage the project different people to brainstorm. There wasn't necessarily a distinct director So we're going to make this video. I was like, what's so what's this video? I'm like, they just want to see stuff and I was like, which stuff, you know and so I kind of help orchestrate like a four phase flow to take one of the video right good And we finish and I go, okay. Well, that's the take and then I go We can we can cut up the best bits of that maybe it may be we'll do another run Uh, and we'll just do fresh bits. Uh, who who's editing this? Oh Oh Sweet summer child matt They're getting this raw. They're gonna be lucky You know what this is it's going to be on a flash card Mailed by a ups and it's going to get there in five weeks. They're going to be like, what's this loss? Oh, I was I was expecting you to say what are you talking about matt? I just sent it Right, that is basically what was what was happening. Oh shit so Our project was like, well, I don't see myself like editing a lot. I mean I can cut the There, but I'm gonna I don't see myself doing a lot That dang jaco, we need to get you that t-shirt. I don't I don't see myself doing a lot of editing here Hold on so Uh, I was like, well if we're not editing then I don't think we should do a second take right like because we're we're not gonna We're not gonna come we can't we can't edit the takes together And the magic's gonna be lost by the time it gets around to the second roll, right? Yeah You're gonna watch 20 minutes of stuff instead of 10 minutes of stuff that you know, whatever and so I I'm like, and I was like, I feel like I feel like this is a bad idea You were you were right matt. You were right. Your instincts were dead I was like, we're not really showing them what we can do or whatever and they go No, they just want a gist of what's going on And I was said It's a casey. I was like, I've never known any corporate client let alone even production companies. I've pitched projects to To show a single ounce of imagination when it comes to like what's going on Nobody wants the gist of it. They want to see what the finished product is The only thing that that kind of video does Is let a middle management person say no That's exactly what I was thinking. I was like, I was like, I that's all I was thinking. I was like, oh gosh I might not get to do this gig. That's all it is That's all that is that's all that that's all they do is say no Because they're so scared to death of taking credit for anything that could go wrong right now to My cruise credit They this is not their first radio with Mercedes, right? So they've gone around around with them before So they kind of knew what Mercedes likes. Well, they just simply Been like, you know, they've simply presented stuff where Mercedes was skeptical And then all of a sudden it goes off without a hitch and they're and they're happy and thrilled them Okay. Oh, so I that's true. The the company has some credit with the with the car company. Yeah Like for example, this is a multiple times that I was I was performing a thing called the ski lodge I'm sure the first time they said, hey, we want to shove a giant ski lodge in the back of your Hospitality area. They were kind of I'm sure the first thing was like what what how does that make me sure some eyebrows went up Right And now it's like some people's like favorite part of the whole attraction And so now nice lodge has been getting bigger and bigger with each race and this is like the fourth race They've had a ski lodge, right? Very cool. It's going to be an alpine village by the time The next race, right? I hope so. I mean, I doubt I'll be at some point. I hope so It's just going to be the winter olympics happening and an f1 race breaks out And uh So they're setting off the video and then all of a sudden I get a call I was like, hey, instead of uh noon to three tomorrow, can you come from 11 to five? Hold on. I'm just doing some some quick back of the napkin math here And I joke I wrote the video went over that well, huh? Yeah Did anyone I know the answer to this did anyone acknowledge that maybe we shouldn't have said that video? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We have notes. We have notes. No No No one will ever say in any industry. I don't know. Maybe I think I did yesterday. I just shouldn't have done it But this is where the uh, uh, uh, our our team leader was super smart We came in the state for a long time And uh case and I brought in stuff to look more professional uh And smart smart they said let's do another round But let's bring in everyone from the office and let's do it with a with an audience Oh, that's smart. It was smart. It was smart Uh, oh because your stuff reads with human beings Not just yeah Of course, no That's exactly how it is god. It's okay. They just want the gist of it. It's so different It's honestly it's why I love how we're doing our recordings now with our live audience It helps me tremendously when I'm doing my bits to see if people give it half a damn about it Right, right. Sometimes it do the answer is no, but Once in a while It's such a pleasant surprise everybody's like fuck that shit. We all hate they're all throwing their hands up Give me the booze Yeah, just thumbs down to camera. Yeah, get the fuck out of here, man With your garbage. They're just waiting for you to put on a bikini and do shots in a hot tub That's like all like all the other twitch broadcasts figured out honestly I've been waiting for that for 12 years start up and only fans and just do it. I'd fucking do it There probably is a market. I don't know. I've already got something of a user base. Maybe I should look into it Why not? It's already a market Wait a second Jacob. Did you just hear that in 20 seconds? Paul talked himself into doing an only fans like Oh, you think I've been thinking about this just today son Please you started with I can't do an only fans and then in three sentences said I guess I can I can't I'm doing one right now There was there was somebody who wanted us to do an only fans and do like uh stand up On on only fans. Do you remember that several years ago? I don't wait. I don't remember this at all Someone told us that we should do comedy somebody pitch this to us that we should do uh stand up and uh improv On our only fans. Oh And I think we all had that reaction. I think we all went like oh All right We've already failed to thrive on twitch We might as well add another platform that we tank on we should just do that Hey your definition of thrive Pump the brakes. We can get on every platform that is made for something else and do comedy Just just us uh doing doing live performances where people just tell take our clothes off while we do it The truth is I'd be really refreshing. I've never felt that attraction, you know that that kind of attention before It'd be fun matt take off your pants. Oh wow take take him off matt. It feels good Yeah, it's nice and airy right you guys start pantsless fridays I I get that uh, I get that I would be um I get that it would get old You know for for any for any of our more attractive listeners out there who who suffer harassment on the on the regular basis I'm not trying to belittle your harassment. I understand that maybe we get old It's just never happened to me. So uh, it's a novelty at this point I think if you open up a channel called bare necessities, I think you'd be a hit and I think that's all I need Be good to go might be a different demographic than you're used to but I think you're ready to rock Attention is attention and money is money, man. I don't know It sure is I think it would be hard to you know, tell the kids don't come upstairs daddy's doing a bare photo shoot for his only fans Like it might be a little tougher to pull off though. You're right. It it would be hard Real hard Lumberjack in it. That's a great name That's not a bad one That's not a bad one Yeah, I found the like ML Kennedy. Hey scoop starts a farmer's only profile Get my my flannels on here. That's all I need Only flannels. How about only flannels only flannels? Oh that has to already exist, right? Let's see Only flannels.com Let's see only flannels.com The fuck Oh jesus No, that was another twitch channel. I don't know how that came up. Oh weird. That's weird only flannels has a twitch channel already Only flannels.com seems to be a twitch channel. Okay So I guess that's it smart Somebody beat us to it. Yeah, good job Or they I'll tell you who else uh beat us to that Lumberjack in it that's sweet sweet lumberjack in it. All right, that is the following sponsor Today's show Matt and mantley's ice cream social is brought to you by Marcus McGillicuddy's luxury abandoned homes That's from george scoops stanza in 2024. That's a great scoop name Uh Marcus McGillicuddy's luxury abandoned homes Oh and Marcus McGillicuddy I came over to the united states And I moved to florida Here in the caves I bought a lot of luxury apartments But they've gone unused for years and they're rotting from the inside What what that means for you? Value That's right You can get value from my open apartments what nobody's been in for years Come on down and get your case a legionaire's disease from my old pipes And a bunch of mold. Have you seen those moldy spiders? What have we gotten going on now? You seen them There's a cryptid spider mold. What's taking them over and turning them into looking like We creepy snowflakes. Oh, we got plenty of those don't we? Come on over now what I meant to say at the top a minute again Value You won't stay for a dollar You can stay for a dollar And I do not care how long That's an indeterminate lease what i'm offering you. You give me one dollar You can stay in the abandoned place as long as you want You understand as long as you want But you do have to put it with the spiders And the legionaire's disease and the squatters There's already a lot of squatters in me abandoned place I shouldn't have never bought it when I saw there was already a squatter in there I shouldn't have done it but I did but you know I didn't pay much I paid like 40 grand to this guy and I got like 18 high-rise apartment buildings for 40 grand I thought that's pretty good turns out the tax lien on him 18 million who knew well I've had a done with due diligence I would But didn't I saw it don't how about you Come and stay and then you know you can buy him off of me for a dollar I'll sell him real cheap now you do have the tax lien liability while that goes over but Who's coming for it? I mean really? Nobody nobody's coming to take it take it from a McGillicuddy You can trust me no one's come to collect from me No one wants these old abandoned high-rises Except for circus folk Apparently circus folk are real interested in abandoned high-rises had I had a wee lad And a fat man come over and say hey, how about we take your place for circus use? I don't know What are you the big guy and he says yeah, I'm the fat man in the circus and the little guy says yeah I'm the little guy in the circus And then sure enough they had a giraffe with them too And a monkey and a lady who could dance on a zebra's back I couldn't believe it and she said I'd kind of do anything but dance on a zebra's back I can't dance on regular surfaces because they're too flat and require the spine of a zebra to impact my Feet in order to enable my dancing. I thought that's strange, isn't it? That doesn't make a whole lot of sense Turns out they weren't circus people at all. They were aliens So these high-rise apartments are very Very nice looking to the aliens who are coming to take us over I should have known from the one guy who was real big and fat and the little guy there's little guy crawled in him They later on they crawled inside of him Yeah, I should have known there's something fish something alien going on about that. I should have asked I'm the lady who dances on zebras She didn't have a zebra You know like she didn't have a zebra. They didn't have a giraffe though At least that's what they told me it was could have been a stretched out dog I'm not a hundred percent I don't know anyway. Come on by Try out my houses. What are rotten from the inside? They're not good I'm tired of selling them the alien circus people Hey scoops check out That was a that was a good take one.

I was gonna say The new band will have to sign the stage We haven't named the new band yet. Is is an as-yet unnamed band What's the uh criteria? Nope. Nope. It's a corporate band Paul. What do you mean? It's a what? It's a it's mainly a corporate band. It's okay name that band. Let's go. Let's name them Now, all right. So so uh, it looks like it looks like general rock. Is that what i'm saying General rock. Yeah, it's a military band. Uh general rock There it is. Oh my god. Would that would you say a military band general rock? Oh my god general rock Four star general rock four star general rock I don't know what i'm allowed to say about the band. I didn't I didn't discuss Press with sj. All right, right. Good point. But uh, but yeah, no, it's it's a uh, they're they're the plan is to tour around Probably this coming summer Uh and get a get a lot of dates just all over the all over the united states How about pussy bucket? I feel like that'd be a good corporate band That is one that is on the board already. Uh, it's it's high up there. It's not number one But it is it's pretty high up there. I'm on the side between cock magnet and cock and balls magnet Uh, do do do uh front people. Um, yes, so you can go with a lady song or a band song. Yeah, yeah That's good. How about that's the name of the band lady song or man song? You pick Butch and bitch present But general rock general rock is not bad. What to have um Who were the the two with the shootout and body and Clyde Bonnie and Clyde. Yeah solid solid Also, uh, they were killed in Louisiana. So there's the there's the tie in When people are like, why is your new band named Bonnie and Clyde? We're like, no, no It's okay. Bonnie and Clyde were actually killed in Louisiana, which is where Jacob is from Who's Jacob? He doesn't have anything to do with this band. It's just he's just a guy that we know Bonnie and Clyde, there we go. Bonnie and Clyde Um, yeah, the stage is it needs to be a name and then like a thing Yeah, like a hoodie and the blowfish Yeah, I would I I'm not even being coy about it I would tell you the names that we've already come up with for the band But I can't think of a single one right now. All right. Well, you've already got SJ in the ruckus So SJ is not going to front another band with SJ in it Right, uh, probably not. Yeah, probably not. That'd be saying the commotion. That's good. That'd be some more Sarah Jessica and the commotion there. Thank you Uh, but yeah, so that was a lot of fun And now I have a whole lot of trust that the the trust that was in that picture is a little bit of the trust that we have I got a whole lot of trust. I got a whole lot of trust y'all Uh, what I have is I have a way for us to not have to rent pipe and drape for next scoop fest That's how much trust I have. Oh, that's awesome. How about this? Yeah, sweet bean and the fever machines sweet bean It's amazing that you say that that's already number one on the list sweet bean and the fever machines sweet Bean We all came up with that one. Yeah, that was basically everybody went away and brainstormed and all of us came back with sweet bean and the fever machine Right there at the top of our list I'm sweet bean. This is the fever machine. I'm saying thank you for having us. Oh my god Can you imagine if SJ got to be sweet bean? Holy shit Every time it's time for her to sing a song the other lead singer guy goes Take it bean When Paul says it I just picture money just showering So much money coming in I just got hit in the head by a quarter How about coyness interruptus When they decide they want to be like a corporate band is Is already a demand for corporate bands or is that a market that they want to try to crack? No, no, this is this is something that sj and one of her agents Came up with this. This is a thought for that It I'm saying corporate. It's really more like like city and city events That kind of that like when when cities hire bands, you know play the riverfront. Yes for a big city party It's it's that it's that type of thing. Yeah Yeah, so let corporates the wrong word. But yeah, I got it city and county events type thing Chris bill and the exact change Put some right out there we're in this for the dough. Yeah, it gives a very professional Oh, Wayne does not like Chris building exact change Thumbs down from waiting on that one. I think Chris building exact change might have legs, but we'll see All right. All right. That one's alph. All right. How about a bean bean counter and the accountants? There you go. You got that going on and then you can get your sweet bean take a bean back in And then you can do the the dolly parton typing song You know, these are the accountants taking accountants Yeah, I I'm also in the same market. That's why I was I didn't know how much I want to be competing with sj Uh, but I'm doing an all tap dance cover band So everything every song we play is through the through the toes and heels through the balls over eaten heels of a tap shoe Interesting interesting How about the Louisiana moon dogs?

Here's what we got moon dogs location tba Okay, that's the last percent of the way there the lost moon dogs I'm trying to think of like if is it even okay, okay What's in the realm of possibility paul says a combination of words that make you go to sj and say a single thing What the barrier of entry of like you actually going to stay with an idea I don't know.

We are that's all we're doing. That's all we're doing But uh, yeah, I think I think don't worry. I've uh written all these down I have sent them. I have sent them to Mercedes already. They're gonna get back to us It's gonna be great tomorrow. I'm gonna go to see uh the new wicked wicked for good Wicked for good wicked for good I'm excited about it. I'm hearing all kinds of things out there Ups and downs Some people are really critical of it. Some people are really like leaving the theaters crying. We're going multiple times I think it's hard to have a sequel to a movie like that Yes, and they and they shot it simultaneously as well, right And the and you you lose all the credit you got from the first one where you created these worlds You can't believe what you're looking at, right? Right did it's such a good job creating that world Now you go making you like, you know, what everything looks like and you're kind of like, okay cool and also This happened with kill bill Ah when you have an awesome movie and you don't have to stick the landing But just leave a cliffhanger and people can leave a theater satisfied with a cliffhanger Oh, that's really that's that's a lot easier to do That's a lot easier. I mean ask a tv writer if it's easier to write a season finale or a series finale Right, right, right, right exactly. That's uh, it's a very valid point. Uh, have you guys watched smiling friends? Smiling friends. No smiling friends brilliant animated series. I highly recommend it. It's absolutely my kind of humor It's fucking hilarious But they go in every season. They just got reneed renewed up to season five Reneed, okay. No reneed up season five everyone reneed But they approach every season Their last episode as though if this is it then this is it They make it so that it could be the end So they've taken that approach map from the jump like that's pretty smart. Yeah, I find it's weird a series That uh does does this bizarrely is slow horses. You guys watching these slow horses on apple Yeah, watch a little bit of that name great old great great band name uh They always end it Like satisfactorily like if that was the last show it could and then they run a preview for next season Which I find fascinating because I can't imagine they're always renewed But they run a preview of the next season at the very end of the montage And I'm always like, wow, how the hell do you do that? That's impossible I mean, I guess they I guess they put that together and run it Until apple says you're not renewed and then apple just takes it takes that part out. Maybe maybe yeah And also, how do you shoot that? How do you already have it? Yeah, how do you already? Right, that's that's the bigger question. Where did this footage come from? I find it bizarre Okay, uh, jacob chase the blaze Yes, there you go. That's the one. That's the one Chase the blaze. That's the one we found it's for people who want to have sex with people with std's chase the blaze. Oh my god A bunk chaser Bunk as jay in the bunk chasers Buggary chasers Buggary chasers Buggery buggery pittery. I only want to have sex with people who've had sex with animals previously. Oh my god Well, that's the now matt you've ruined it. That's the opening song Oh I only want to have sex with animals that have had sex with people and vice versa. How about piddly bob and the Meme No, I'm definitely not a cow. Let's get on the bus You're supposed to play bass not sing betty you're giving it away You idiot utter embarrassment Stupid cow. I mean human Who's definitely a human and I'm married to stupid human. I'm married to get on the bus I know I'm sorry. I had to cut your your hooves to look like hands I know it's terribly painful for you, but I love you so much Also, it's the only way she could play bass Oh, that is music to my ears music to my ears if only it was a country band, we'd have this thing solved Man, I was where was that? Oh, well, I was doing a week of shows in san Antonio Mainstream country music is so stupid Hold on this is breaking news mainstream country music is stupid. There are country songs that are amazing They're a country artist. They're amazing. Absolutely. But the but the other it's just pop It's just pop with a Wawa pedal and they literally it's like I literally go like really every song has a drink and a truck in it Every song has a whiskey and and the truck in it like all of them Uh-huh just makes me I basically I get so I'm sitting there drinking like coffee And like I stand turning a coffee shop being like who can't write this like who like anyone can write these This is not surprising now Matt some of them have a wife at home who is not happy Some of them wish they just could have done better if if a couple other choices are gone differently Well, you know, there's some shit going on when the ai is beating them all Yeah, yeah, but that's been a problem with all genres, but yes Yeah, and I don't know how the hell you fix it, but Spotify is being hijacked by ai bands Yeah And these ai and these and these people people sitting around with ai are just making a bunch of money off of plays uh Instead of actual bands I was just talking to a friend the other day. He was you saying that um Dr. Torrell, uh, what's the thing that you that you have to write to phd Uh, you know thesis a thesis. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Dr. Torrell thesis Betty stop guessing Betty stop guessing Back on the tour bus Let's get on the bus Stop guessing Betty Yeah dissertation. Yeah that kind of thing. Thank you lorry dissertation Uh, he's you got it all written out and gave it to his you know faculty advisor person and Was kind of accused of using ai to uh to write it And basically the the professor said You either use ai to write this Or you wrote this and it feels like ai either way you need to rewrite this That but but but he was like i go fuck yourself right But but no the uh the uh the professor was trying to be helpful Because because he was like no i did write this you know i i didn't i didn't use ai to do this I'm getting my phd and this is this is what i want to be doing like i'm doing this because i because i Want want to do it. Yep. So no i didn't have ai write this And the the professor was basically like yeah, but when the uh when the committee looks at this If they feel like it it feels ai Then uh, then they're gonna hold that against you ai ai That's my favorite song shut up betty get on the bus i'm gonna cut your hooves again I'm gonna re-finger up your hooves. I don't see oh mcdonald on the set list No, betty. We can't play that song. Oh, you're such a talky cow betty I mean person definitely a person person But yeah, they were like, oh, we had to rewrite my whole uh my whole thing or like a couple of chapters in it or something I don't know, uh, but had to rewrite a sizable portion of it because it felt like ai And i was like this is this is such a weird time that we're in right now because we haven't figured that part out yet No, and honestly we're in that weird pocket in history where it's just a pain in the ass right now And college professors are using ai to ask whether or not something is written by ai So they're doing it too And some some some college professors are using ai to read people's fucking shit and and grade it. Yeah. Yeah Oh, yeah, no, it's just it's just like the That thing any time technology happens it takes us a while to catch up to it I will tell you what's was weird and almost like why we think ai is fascinating is that I think ai can be wrong And I think that's definitely so much of lawyers recently got like sanctioned. I think whatever it's called or cc s cease and desists, um killed no murdered. No, no, but um, they uh, basically Had ai write their, uh, legal documents and had false sources Uh, yeah cases whatever and then so we were putting together our quizzes for, uh, f1 We we put together, uh, breakdowns of each rate of each driver And there wasn't a lot, but there were three Errors three lines and so f1 one point was like can we go over all of your material before you do it? I'm sorry Mercedes We didn't know that we're gonna send that video to you and it made up dumb stuff Like they had uh pets that didn't have or Right, uh fears that didn't have You can while you're working on on the ai stuff There are times that you can That you should go in and just be like double double check all of that stuff You just told me is all of that actually corrected. Did you make up some of that? And sometimes it'll be it'll be like no, I made all of that up It'll it'll just tell you. Yeah But if you don't think to ask then you don't know that's really weird though I yes, it is I asked for a list. I was like, what are words have never been used in wordl Because I want to like see if I can get a wordl in one if I can commit to a word Oh, okay. Yeah And uh, it gave me a list and the list was completely wrong. I fact checked it And it was just like no It just gave me a bunch of random five letter words and set it check two archives and it was just lying And back in the 80s and 90s You'd get on and uh, or you'd find an ad or something and you'd hire just like a college student To write a paper for you or in high school or something I was asking if paul's writing down band names. Yeah, I am fire And he drew a logo. Yeah I don't think you'd go wrong with fire lizard I Surely not Paul don't put it fine as it shirts me paul if you're drawing my kid needs a name for his throughout the uh needs a logo for his three-on-three soccer team I have I have I have My brother jingle ballers The jingle ballers jingle ballers So they're like a holiday themed Yeah, so it's a holiday themed three-on-three. It's great people dress up for it Like it's a really silly is a really silly three-on-three soccer tournament Do you want me to be pictures of your kids? Are there gonna be pictures of your kids in santa costumes playing soccer? Uh, there's gonna be a picture of their coach in the santa costume because I am their coach All right. Oh, yeah, I'll get my tablet in a minute and I'll draw one up. I just did the artwork for this uh For this month it's coming out. Okay. Oh, yeah, so I'll get my tablet and draw up a Possible logo. I have already tasked uh rob with it too. So you you're a competition if it comes in second That's fine. I don't care. Okay. That's fine. You got you got a competition. Yeah I I uh, yeah, because basically like my son's youngest His soccer team was a disaster this year Okay, a couple kids got injured a couple kids quit Some kids would just not show up. They regularly played without like enough kids Uh, like one kid down my kid would play the entire game. It was a brutal brutal season So when the three on three came up, I was like, oh Let's get the five kids who showed up All the time who had and let's put them in the in the three on three together. Yeah have them play One one one one a proper finish to their season instead of just constantly getting clobbered by other teams The five gives you a pair of subs. Is that is that what yeah? Yeah, you can have up to six And you sub perfect you sub like crazy in three on three Yeah, okay. And so I was like, let's do it And then the coach who had finished his last season he coached like seven seasons was like, I'm not coaching again So I said, I imagine you don't want to come out of retirement and he goes. No, I do not I said, okay. I said, I will coach this team. I'm going to tell the parents I have no business coaching this team, but I will coach this three on three team. That's nice But I'll do it. That's really good at you man. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah Um, so yeah, jingle ballers jingle ballers. That's a I didn't want this to become a democracy So I simply said, Hey, do you want to play? Hilly wants to play a three on three tournament. Do you want to join him? He's named the team the jingle ballers because I didn't want anyone saying anything else. I was like, it's not up for debate There's no conversation. It is the jingle ballers that is that has happened He was to be doing that in the snow devils Snow devils much easier to logo No, jingle ballers will be fun. Jingle ballers is funnier. How far can we go on the In your window scale The the Tino one last year they were just called the hard penises and they had a big giant cock Lots of veins Yeah, but the the the testicles were soccer balls. That was what made it a soccer Yeah, I mean that's the whole thing jingle ballers. That's what I'm thinking already. I'm like well They showed up to the game in an oscar mire wiener mobile that they had repurposed that it just a giant penis Yeah, just dragging. They painted they painted. They just all you gotta do is paint veins on it Just get a carrot purple spray paint and that's that's all I did In your mobile just like that boom becomes the cock mobile just dragging to christmas ornaments for balls behind it like like like just got married When I say hard you say penises hard penises Uh, so yeah, I I guess uh Paul they're they're 10. So use your best discretion. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I got you I got you they're 10. So they've only seen 10 years worth of internet pornography Just right keep that in mind man I just I think about this every once in a while And I do think about I thought about it too when when I accidentally gave matt's kid a comic that might have a boob in it But it was a circle in a circle I like that. That's moved accidentally. No, it I mean it was accidentally, but also I don't care, uh, but also But also If I were a child man, I've got a box of hustlers for your kids if I were me at that age Because I remember the kind of bullshit links I went to to see pornography at 11 And we had to go to the woods Or somebody's house with a weird older brother Uh, you know or whatever. We also watched Uh in a group Absolutely, which is absolutely when you think about it or yes weird now But like, you know, can you imagine A bunch of guys like gathering around now to watch internet porn around a computer. It's it's a different feeling It is. I imagine it. Yes, but there's no way kids of this day and age avoid porn You can't turn on a computer. It's it's just it's in your face I think about this like what like because like all our, uh Our tv apps, right? I have different profiles and the kids have kids profiles, right? Yeah, and then the kids but the kids know my password to get to my Of course, right to get to the unrestricted And then I'm like, oh, maybe I should change that or do something about that Then I'm like the least of my concern is them finding stuff on like hbo Right, like right when they have access to the internet. Oh shit. They saw Daenerys's tits Yeah, whoop-de-doo They got on the on the max app and looked up old episodes of the red shoe diaries. Oh That's the thing real sex red shoe diaries. Those are all gone I don't think you can look those up anymore, right? Now the question is like so because right now they say it's basically a huge problem is that kids See so much porn before they actually have sex themselves. They get desensitized and weirded out by it No, they feel but they feel well, yes, but they they feel also pressured to imitate it or that They they want to do like porn sex constantly. Yes, right Like the first time you know when they're losing their virginity. They're like, when should I spit into your asshole, right? Yeah, yeah Do we do we gape now or gape later? Yeah Like that was my first question. There it is Galactic president scooper star. That's exactly what I came up with. Oh, just scrambled porn that it was exactly my life That was absolutely my oh man scrambled scramble tv porn scramble tv porn Is a great name for sj's band and um That is a good name Uh Yeah, but basically they're trying to do all this crazy stuff and not enjoying it Yeah, yeah Now it sucks that sucks Yeah, but most people most the good thing about that is have to have a basically and i'm gonna have to have a speech They're skipping from age 17 to age 48 And that's because that's the time when you kind of enjoy sex and after that it's just like, uh Really? Oh god There we go. I'm laughing really hard because I'm 47 so it's like oh, I didn't realize I was on the fucking cuss Yeah, you're on the press buddy. This is it. Yeah, you're knocking on heaven's door I'll tell you who else is aging is edging while they age That's the following sponsor edging while you age edging while you age Hold on.
