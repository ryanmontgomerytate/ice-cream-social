 oh hello there I am so happy you're here because it is time to thank you the
 ice cream truck drivers thank you so much ice cream truck drivers these are
 the folks that bring that fucking ice cream straight to your fucking ear
 holes right now I'd like to thank Jonathan Joshua Bartles L'Oreal's rough
 Leon Casab, Mary Norbury Glazer, Malia and a random admiral admiral yeah it's a
 random admiral if you want to be an ice cream truck driver just like those fine
 people and that one naval officer head over to preaching fun calm preaching
 fun calm is where you go to sign up to be an ice cream truck driver and who
 knows the life you save may be your own
 here's a show hey Johnny do you want to go to an ice cream social yeah I'd love
 to great let's go
 sitting over there in Pittsburgh PA that's Paul Mattingly sitting over in
 Las Vegas it's Matt Donnelly in Las Vegas as well as me Jacob the audio guy we're
 preaching fun I like Taskmaster it's a huge fan of how did this get made the
 podcast with Paul Scheer and Jason Manzoukas who has done Taskmaster in the
 past I don't know if he's on this season or not that well just imagine and I
 haven't got it I just informed by a friend but just imagine because basically
 wrote them being like why aren't I on this show and like barge this way on it
 got us himself invited onto the show yeah but it's an English show and you
 have English comedians or British comedians on there and it's the snarky
 hosts co-hosts and they put people through like random tasks would have to
 be very creative or justify their answers it's all very like very funny
 and I didn't know about the show and turned out a friend of ours their
 daughter was I'm being informed that's that's not snarky it's just British fair
 enough and their daughter was totally into this show and so we decided they're
 going to throw a Taskmaster themed birthday party so what happened was they
 need a taskmaster coach out to California and and they couldn't come
 without bringing a gift because every on the show every community has to bring a
 gift with a certain theme ah and the theme had to be rain and sticky was the
 was the theme of the of the so everybody brought her a rain stick and a press on
 a press of Audrey there was rain and sticky and someone could have you could
 have done that but the problem is if you watch the show if you something
 predictable then the snarky slash just British hosts will slam you and not give
 you points so you have to surprise they'll be British at you and give
 points and so at first I was like I cannot believe that I'm driving my kids
 out to California and I'm giving them homework right but I start watching the
 show with my kids and they haven't seen it either the prep and the show is
 really great like it's really funny I'm gonna have to check it out it's it's
 really great and Jacob what gift would you bring under the restrictions of
 rain oh I glad you asked I already thought about it I would bring a bottle
 of pancake syrup that's exactly what I was gonna do I was gonna do a mrs.
 Butterworth dressed up like a queen oh no no I'm going to have somebody else
 sit in a chair I'm going to do a sticky rain on them oh I was gonna have the
 queen the queen mrs. Butterworth she would have the rain of sticky oh that's
 good too I like that there's a bit of a pun what about you Matt what did you
 end up bringing her so help my kids out with two different ones my one kid
 decided to make a fortune-telling jar of answers to any questions that he had
 with a with a fishing pole with a and this the hook was sticky it was a ball
 of sticky tape so great he basically wrote like yes no maybe ask again fill
 in the blank hell no oh he didn't write a whole bunch of like really super
 specific answers and just drop it in there I know you should not invest in
 that property yeah and then my other kid took an umbrella wrote the most
 impressive thing on the umbrella with sticky notes and dropped glue sticks
 from strings from each prong on the on the umbrella so he opened up the great
 with an umbrella of glue sticks he won he won the challenge with the really
 with the glue stick umbrella yeah he's he's good at a lot of things this was a
 like 24-hour event this was my friend went way the fuck overboard so they were
 throwing a birthday party for their child with all the kids the next day
 but the chosen five were to be contestants in in the in the contest for
 the whole day the day before they're doing all of that and then having a
 birthday party after that yes I was like that is crazy that's too much you need
 to have an intervention with these people like no one loves their child as
 much no one no so we had our objects I load up with all the stuff they needed
 for their sleepover and they were tasks waiting at the door before you enter the
 house so it's like they have these like little ornate envelopes with like the
 red wax kind of sticky on them or whatever uh-huh and I my two children's
 they've been given two different assignments one was told to enter the
 house in the most annoying way please I don't even know I don't even want to
 know which kid that was that go on and then the other kid was told enter the
 house in the smartest way mm-hmm both kids instantly had an idea great so one
 kid who had the annoying assignment just opens door and goes hey six seven six
 seven six seven six seven six seven six seven and this does it and my other kid
 just threw his stuff at me and ran around the house like went to find
 another way in to the house yeah and so I entered behind the kid who got the
 annoying assignment and said you got to go find my other kiddies coming in some
 other part of your house probably good luck to everyone involved uh you know
 they were given like all kinds of crazy tasks and the birthday girl was the
 hosts and the my co-hosts and they literally ran the whole afternoon with
 games and tasks for five of her friends to compete in in the contest that took
 place all day you know I'm thinking about I think this is a girl parent
 versus boy parent difference you say that Jacob just but I had just a
 demonstration of how much harder it is to be a girl parent it is to be a boy
 definitely is it definitely is different challenges for sure I I would say though
 too like some people birthdays are way more of a thing like yeah with my yes
 wife's family birthdays are big big deal you get to eat wherever you want everybody
 has to go along like it's a it's a it's a thing yes my my family wasn't that big
 of a oh it means occasionally it would be a big thing when we were little
 little littler but you know it wasn't it was in our house it was able to be
 shuffled around like we still would do like a dinner yes where or event but it
 was like hey this brother has a basketball game this brother is a
 football game this is like we need to do it next Saturday especially you got that
 many siblings - yeah yeah so it was always just a movable thing right we're
 gonna go have dinner we're gonna we're gonna have a cake and candles or
 something like that some kind of celebration thing and we're gonna do it
 at some point did you have a heavy month Matt was there a triple sibling with my
 period yeah yeah did you have to you know really contain your birthday flow
 no we were pretty we're pretty spread out actually with my fam oh that can be
 a trouble with the period - yeah June July we have a June and July August three
 month period see a doctor see a doctor yeah April December my sister and I are
 well we're nine years apart but we're five days apart that was with the only
 similar birthday okay that's why I was wondering yeah yeah but now like when my
 you know all of your siblings birthdays I do yeah well it's why I know no one
 else's right but people go like I suppose I got shit for like not
 remembering when someone's birthdays and I'm like man I just have my family and
 that's enough but my when my when my second son was born just two days after
 my birthday I was relieved I was like great we don't have to work on birthday
 ever again and then just be his birthday yes I really thought we so cool to have
 the same birthday but didn't work out right probably for the best for his own
 thing but I thought it was awesome nice yeah when he's little you just don't
 mention it right you're like you're at his birthday party or whatever like you
 you know like it's also my birthday kids or just a room full of eight-year-olds
 and no one has told me happy birthday today I think I'll be taking this toy
 thank you very much just be like I thought it'd be cool with it you know
 what now it's not cool what a cake I did not sign up for this you know who else
 thought they were gonna be okay with not being the center of attention for a few
 minutes but they were just wrong about it it's the following sponsor today's
 show Matt Manley's ice cream social is brought to you by Marcus McGillicuddy's

 buy one of my homes filled to burst in with black mold Texas tea enter hey
 scoops a checkout I have an eye doctor's appointment today guys well I hope your
 eye isn't exploding like mine is I know I know the funny thing was is that I I've
 had I insurance been paying for our insurance for the last three years and I
 haven't gone yet never used it and it was only because I went to the Verizon
 store for my ordeal don't worry I will not get into it again we don't have the
 time and they did they did they call you out on your giant font old man I'd love
 to read the terms and services here but it's one letter per scroll here Jesus
 Christ I broke my thumb trying to get to the bottom to agree to continue your your
 TOS took me 18 years to scroll through like I'm so stupid about I stuff like
 I was like I don't know the difference between like person who gives you
 glasses for someone who gives you an eye exam like I just was like there's
 glasses thing optometrist versus optician maybe optician and then I look
 ophthalmologist pearl vision was right next to the Verizon store there and then
 as I walked by it for like the third time because I went back and forth so
 many times I noticed there were doctors names listed on the door oh I was like
 oh so they got I doctors in there mmm doctor places it's I walked in as I can
 help you I said I I bet yes
 how can I have an issue with myself are you in network I go apparently I've had
 very good I doctor insurance for a long time like the basic okay it's VSP they
 take it everywhere is basically what I was told oh great and so I said I have
 this insurance and I had it on my phone and I said Jesus that font I got a
 dial at your eyes you have V scroll s scroll insurance that was Matt realizing
 you couldn't spell insurance bail bail on bit insurance insurance and I said I
 have this insurance I've never been doing I anything before my eyes are
 terrible please help oh god wait now are you wearing contacts or anything yet
 I've never worn contacts I I have readers hit me all over my house like
 like Easter eggs on Easter okay every room has like a pair of readers I've
 just thrown there just in case and what what number reader are you purchasing
 and hiding around your house that's the round one with a big stick at the end of
 it and it's like that's it that's a real big you know one seven five once that's
 not too bad okay okay good good yeah I've recently started hiding readers
 around my house as well that just go along with my contacts because now my
 farsightedness is is thinking about starting to catch up with my
 nearsightedness fine which is going real real bad for Jacob seeing any hit the
 to Jacob let's hit the to middle-aged white guy let's do it because I need I
 need I've added one to the kitchen so I used to have one wherever I'd sit and
 look at my phone there's a pair of glasses I look at my phone and then I
 started for directions on stuff to cook I had a pair I have a pair next to my
 chair and having a pair next to my bed I just have to just just a two around the
 house well at first my and this is really fascinating for listeners but at
 first like you know obviously reading tiny things was was where it started
 just not being able to look at look at small things so so did you have the same
 did you have the same reaction that I did when I started to not be able to
 read my comic books I was like what the fuck is wrong with this printing and the
 same with like macaroni and cheese instructions and things like that I'd be
 like who is this font for what yeah what Lilliputians are picking up these boxes
 this is ridiculous yes yeah and now the problem might be me you see the TV above
 my head that's the bet that's the TV in my bedroom so my I'm further away from
 the TV than like a regular TV viewing kind of thing uh-huh now I'm having hard
 time seeing the subtitles on shows I'm watching from there so now the other
 side's going too so yeah it's time that's both ends it's time but I would
 right after yeah right after this episode I'm running over to Pearl Vision
 oh nice yeah so they said yes we can't help but not today that's right yeah
 that was let's do it let's do a whole appointment we'll do the whole thing
 which gave me some time you know give me some time to think about it and so I
 started buying a lot of supplements off of Amazon and I think I spent this I'm
 trying to cure my eyesight train your eyes train your eyes in three days so I
 called back never mind I'm fine right as rain click I saw some tic-tocker he's
 like problem solved when I tell you about where these glasses he's got these
 glasses that just have nothing but little pinholes in them I wear these and
 that fixes my eyes I'm like fuck you do fuck it does you lying at the you hope
 it does yeah I understand that you would like it too it doesn't know the idea
 like look I know medical costs and medical care in this country is
 complicated annoying and expensive everything else but the idea that it's a
 constant just like no we don't want anyone to know that the simple blank
 exists so that we can just rake in the dough on every single ailment that we've
 come up with it's just a little much sometimes yes it is I don't want to sit
 around defend the medical industry but I don't think that the whole eye doctor
 industry is like shit hope they don't figure out pinhole glasses that we're
 doing like yeah my eyes here's how bad the the medical insurance here is my
 eyes are terrible we've talked about that in show before my eyes are horrible
 you've never seen me without contacts or glasses I can't function without at
 least one of those things and like if this weren't this century if this were
 just a few hundred years ago I would just be dead in the woods somewhere
 right remember there's an old like back like a decade ago an old Netflix show I
 think it's called yeah it was a Western show and it had a guy his glasses broke
 on like a on the terrain and he's yeah and he spent the rest of the series like
 not able to see and I was like holy shit yes I was like oh my god you don't think
 about that like my worst fear on vacation is like if I leave town if my
 contacts or glasses get fucked up yeah I can't do anything yeah I'm just done
 no you will cut pinholes and two pieces I would fashion a mask out of it like a
 placemat you would tape it to your head just pinhole your way around Portugal
 and I'd be fine then I'd be fine but no our insurance is so bad like I have good
 I have good insurance I have good health insurance I've good medical and vision
 insurance all that kind of stuff there is a surgery that could fix my eyes my
 eyes are so bad I can't do like the LASIK thing and so the surgery is
 basically a cataract surgery where they they take that lens out and they put a
 corrective lens in in its place and then it's just an implanted contact lenses is
 basically all it is probably safer than LASIK maybe I have no idea who knows but
 I do know what it does is is it keeps you from getting cataracts later in life
 it's also it's also a preemptive surgery for cataracts preventative because you're
 doing the cataract surgery before you have cataracts smart with my
 astigmatism I'm very likely to have cataracts they will not pay for that
 surgery now until they will pay for cataract surgery until you get they will
 not it's not they will not pay for the surgery that would also correct my
 vision because that's that's an elective surgery even though I will almost
 certainly get cataracts in the future and then I'll have to have the surgery
 anyway yeah it's fucked it's really stupid it is it's stupid it's awful I
 mean one and this is the kind of obstacles I faced as a man of size
 trying to address my hip issue for years you know and just being basically you
 know dismissed out of hand by the first guy I went to because the doctor didn't
 have the appropriate eye prescription and couldn't see you well he could see
 me and he was like he was like look here fatty and I was like put these put these
 pinhole glasses on and you can only eat things that fit in this pinhole I just
 I'll never get over I'll never get over the glory hole diet the the the actual
 guy that actually helped help me and fix my leg and the fact that when they got
 in into my hip socket they were like it was basically deteriorated into fragments
 and dust yeah well we're really surprised how you were walking on that
 as am I I told you this for you it's fucked if y'all listen to him bitch
 about it for the whole time you wouldn't be that surprised your buddy yeah Jacob
 and I were not it was better than what we thought it was gonna be but this is
 the same thing like why the fuck don't I just you know and it's it's worse for
 women I know that too like it's one thing to be a heavy dude but it but if
 you're a woman forget it my god the shit the fucking race the only aspect where
 it's hard to be a woman than a man but thank goodness only applies in the
 medical field oh yeah yeah just well well everybody has a good day I'll keep
 you posted well Jacob do you think there's any way that you could possibly
 rectify this because I know that there has recently been a kerfuffle on
 tik-tok I don't know what other social media sites you frequent or our party to
 but there was a guy on tik-tok I'm pretty much just I'm pretty much just
 tick-tock Paul I just do lots and lots of tick-tock well he needed he needed a
 liver transplant right okay and the the insurance would not cover it they would
 not go through with it he was ready to do it and you know he was gonna die and
 so he raised a bit of a stink on on his tik-tok page and it went very viral and
 what do you know sure enough they turned around and they did the surgery and he's
 gonna live but it takes a couple of million strangers screaming at these
 mega corporations to say hey help this person it's fucked up I'm the same way I
 won't do that I won't help anyone until there's millions of people experiencing
 intermittent or outrage I would also like a liver though so if everyone could
 please raise a lot of outrage get Jacob a liver I don't want it I don't want any
 surgery I just want the liver put it on ice by the way it's a little update on
 the old duo lingo I've after when I was suggested to be friends with my dead
 friend I since I've got a lot of scoops and other people follow me on duo lingo
 I'm following everybody back I think it's gonna be really funny if my most
 popular social media outlet is duo lingo I am eating apples I am drinking water I
 am you know eating pan I'm asking people they speak English or Espanol I'm on a
 roll I'm on a roll yeah but but in terms of like hey do does your phone listen to
 do apps listen to other topics and try to compete with each other my Instagram
 apparently was very jealous of duo lingo uh-huh so that they gave me not one but
 two friend suggestions for two people who are dead they two dead friends they
 offer me to follow back two dead friends just one and two right there first two
 many dead friends follow why would you compete with this I think actually Matt
 you have inadvertently subscribed to cul-de-sac which is the new app that
 just has you trapped in a dead friends and escape I have a lot of friends on
 seance have you guys downloaded seance you wanted to say Spanish you got the
 seance you wanted to say Spanish yeah that's right that's right
 chaotic points out in chat that my duolingo streak is better than my dead
 friends so there you go you got that going for me those are wins or wins might
 not have made the Myler's Club but goddamn it that streak is on no problem
 what are we getting buried with our phones what's the plan here what are we
 doing with our phones I don't know what the hypothesis that made that what's
 that how does that answer a question I don't know I'm just thinking like maybe
 you keep it plugged in throw some kind of bullshit AI on it and let it keep
 chirping and chipping away at people long after you're dead me like hey man
 what's up you know it's like wait I thought you're fucking dead yeah I'm dead
 so what my it's just Paul having weird dark thoughts over here I'm doing fine
 that's precisely like that's it I can't think of a more tech bro idea they'd be
 like I want to be great when you as your AI self can let other people know you're
 dead so to find out from anyone else yeah I mean I mean your brain knows for
 like six minutes or something like that they say so hey yeah great yeah phones
 are waterproof now so it doesn't that doesn't take Throshen off the table you
 know right gates Throshen still there and I can still it's basically I'd be
 talking to you from the grave and a submarine it's like the same time well
 now the only the only challenge is keeping it powered that's the challenge
 is how do you keep the battery going hey how you doing this is the AI Jacob how
 are you I hope you're doing well Jacob is not doing well at all he has passed
 away I am really sorry to be the one to tell you about this I am 100% sorry that
 Jacob has passed away and I am 200% sorry to have to be the one to tell you
 about haha yes of course you said yeah you're a good friend and Jacob was you
 to know that really good job would you like me to break down three different
 ways for you to pay homage to Jacob by the way that might fit your comfortable
 lifestyle I know you don't like my firms wait wait I like it I like it yeah this
 is gonna be a new thing it's definitely gonna be a new thing yeah yeah well I
 mean there's plenty of gravestones with QR codes and shit on them and that
 stuff's not gonna stay around forever it's just weird I don't know grave
 gravestone QR code is actually that sounds better to me than what we just
 came up with that seems like oh how so the idea of just strolling through a
 graveyard and scanning QR codes is both beautiful and horrifying you can do it
 right now there's plenty of graves with QR codes you can scan it up to bring up
 a little memorial and pictures and videos and stuff yeah yeah that's what I
 want I want people on their phones you know like I really want people just be
 in tech just in their day-to-day shit grieve through the screen put these VR
 glasses on and grieve give me your grief in AI AI grief so my oldest kids a spoiled
 brat he's this this this week ends with him going thank God you figured it out
 first this this week ends with him going to the
 sphere with his schoolmates to see Wizard of Oz which we still haven't seen
 uh-huh and then the next day they go to Disneyland with the show choir that's
 that's his Thursday Friday this week tough tough days but the message we got
 for the sphere was hysterical okay so like one is that we have to fill out
 photo and press releases for our children in order for them to go you
 can't go unless you fill out a photo release because both the sphere and the
 school need to put bus to publicize the event they're having school kids visit
 the sphere okay what's what's gonna be shown is I got a show in the big nature
 film Wizard of Oz yeah no one cares about nature anymore Paul that was when
 the sphere opened I don't think they even do the nature film anymore
 and then Lauren Shreve is it sounds expensive it is we fundraised throughout
 the year you know it's it's death by a thousand donations with schools they
 just keep beating you with the same fundraisers I have no idea how much
 money we gave to make this happen but I know that it happened in like several
 several increments of time do you think that you gave more money to this than
 you would have given if you just paid for the kids to go to these events well
 certainly Disneyland because their grandmother has a pass so yeah so more
 than free more than free you should be like yeah you can take my kid to
 Disneyland hold on I'll set up his ticket then the sphere had a breakdown
 that was like hey there'll be no book bags or any kind of carrying permitted
 into the sphere not even water bottles you can't bring water bottles or
 anything into the sphere nothing your children will come in as they are
 dressed that's it okay and we will not sell any food or beverage to anyone while
 they're in the sphere this is the second no this is no this is I get this
 because you get one peanut allergy and it's all downhill bottles of water no
 you don't want nothing it's the desert look give them some water go get your
 own camel back or where's our camel fuck that's the first line of the sand I've
 seen with anyone with school kids and their access to water there's one thing
 the kids have just been able to be fucking nuts with is that they must have
 access to these oh my god they're so hydrated these children now so hydrated
 Mark Gates is no peanut water there's a market salty and delicious peanut water
 hey look at that is that official Waffle House merch it's official Waffle House
 bunk yeah did you buy that at a Waffle House I bought it off the Waffle House
 website because I was waving about Waffle House website send me Waffle House stuff
 and I was like what there's nothing here oh we're usable coffee mug yeah look at
 that I like that it wasn't the yellows this is the blue one that is a subtle
 Waffle House and but yeah so so the kids didn't go there they're they may starve
 while they are in there but that's what's gonna happen go in there and then
 have no evidence that they were ever there ninjas they must come in right
 without a trace there's just gonna be a whole sphere filled with starved and
 desiccated children stuck like mummies to all the little chairs just I just want
 to know what the sphere is gonna do when a busload of kids shows up and they're
 all carrying water bottles like yeah what are you gonna do it really feels
 like like whoever's running the actual like boots on the grounds part of the
 sphere doesn't have kids and like for like eight meetings they're like and
 there's a we have another request from school they're like Jesus Christ with
 these school kids want to come here god yeah yeah so I was like well might be
 good PR all right they better sign fine this is they better have no evidence
 they were ever fucking here they better not fucking pee or eat or drink or not
 like I want to it's like we pulled the bathrooms out there aren't bathrooms
 anymore we will bring them in through a series of locked chambers it's a bad
 idea idea to bring him there yeah any of it yeah yeah I think that I think the
 sphere is making a drastic error how about that do your kids are your kids
 familiar with the Wizard of Oz yes okay I wonder at what point well what part
 will we get to the point where people haven't seen the original Wizard of Oz
 enough to get what's going on at the sphere yeah I don't know I mean you know
 the whole thing is that the wicked wicked creates this extra more current
 right a city for the original that's true Oz yeah who wrote that book in a
 minute couldn't couldn't have thought that this was that this was gonna happen
 with that of all the you know quote-unquote IP the Wizard of Oz like
 you know that's a crazy it's a crazy ass weird psychedelic the guy who wrote
 wicked or the guy who wrote Wizard of Oz Wizard of Oz yeah the person who wrote
 the original yeah the wonderful world of Oz and all that stuff yeah that that's a
 Frank Baum right I think so bomb sounds right yeah so what's fascinating about
 him that Ann has continued to educate me on is that his wife is a woman of some
 renown who's now flying out of my head one of the suffragettes you can fly no
 no no I'll fucking find it but uh yeah his whole family situation was really
 really interesting and that's a big part of why he put women forward in much of
 his work because he he and his family especially his wife in the forefront of
 feminism in that time oh wow oh and it works women have it so easy though no
 good job everybody no but it's great I didn't realize that and it's good it's
 good that it's good that it just puts women forward and I don't necessarily
 make it like oh it's a pro-woman thing so it's good oh pro-women oh bro all right
 yeah so I still haven't got anything in the sphere so my kids will like it will
 beat me to the sphere experience there do you have a desire to do anything you
 want to go see at the sphere I don't have like an eight hundred dollar desire
 yeah it's just the price point thing like even even the movies like yeah
 because because I'm not gonna see was advised by myself so I think that's like
 two hundred something dollars right right but it's still a hundred dollar day if I
 take the fam right sure so that's like it's just it just it just doesn't add up
 or whatever yeah our pal Lewis was looking out for me for a little while
 for first few years stuff that was popping up he runs that liquor
 distribution company all right okay but still the spheres tight tight ticket
 it's pricey it's a tight it's a tight ticket well it's a nine-inch nails ever
 plays a sphere that will prop that that could very well get me to Vegas they did
 right now Metallica the Metallica thing is like that's that but that's pretty
 great that's gonna be so much money so much money it'll be I think it's gonna
 be a lot of money and and but if I ever get the opportunity to I would go see
 the Metallica sphere that's for sure yeah are people making films of these
 concerts yes several of them yes okay I know there were films of the u2 one well
 I know see that's thing like Trent Reznor was working very closely with
 James Cameron at one point to put together a toured film and it just fell
 apart at the eleventh hour but I would love to love to see all that I still
 have I just realized I still haven't sat down and watched Ozzy Osbourne's last
 concert that that big huge concert they did shortly before he died that he
 actually performed at so two things from that you guys are really kind of
 contemplating or beat yourselves up for not seeing stuff it's really Kelly has
 turned into a scarecrow and Jack was just on TV talking about how the
 benefit money was way overinflated I guess they they had claimed like a
 hundred ninety million dollars or something like that remember Ozzy's
 concert yeah remember how giant time money that was supposed to be coming in
 I don't remember hearing anything about the money but I believe it yeah this
 latest interview Jack was like no it was like ten million dollars yeah it wasn't
 190 million dollars but then part of me goes oh wasn't it check oh really mr.
 runs the till yeah as far as I know we donated I don't think we got any money
 our way a lot of expenses here if somebody could reimburse me that'd be
 really great exactly exactly so I don't know yeah so my kill my kid will do that
 and then I'll go I should take all of the school to Metallica that's what I'll
 do good man that would be hip as shit well for your for your next kid's
 birthday you could have five of their friends show up Oh could learn to play
 all of the Metallica music on real instruments and then you could book the
 sphere for them to open for Metallica before Metallica sphere concert you
 could do that and then the next day you could throw a birthday party for your
 kids and wanted me to tell you Matt and wanted me to tell you I don't know if
 you know this map but there is a thing you could do for your kids and their
 friends relatively inexpensively if you wanted to show up like a boss Starbucks
 has just unveiled a mr. beast drink oh yeah that's you take our bucks you could
 take the kids to Starbucks for a mr. mr. beast pick me up I think that would be
 like number one on the kids list like if I if I if they could meet a celebrity I
 believe both my kids would choose mr. beast really really damn that's sad huh
 I know I started watching much less obtainable for them than audio guy for a
 podcast I yeah I mean they we just started watching beast games to the
 second alright of beast games came out this is admittedly not as
 psychologically torturous as the first season so far I've only watched the
 first two episodes lessons I learned this lawsuits have been settled not just
 a bunch of people being terrible right off the bat and just making everyone
 cry there's been a lot less tears in this first two seasons and actually much
 more of like competition stuff which is what you feel like legit things happen
 with winners and losers so I do think they've learned something from the first
 season like go to room one of you yeah psychological breakdown and then you
 lose it would have been difficult for them to how hard would it have been for
 them to just recreate that first season oh if you were just like do exactly the
 same thing here's the new people yeah you would have been like fuck no yeah I
 can't be if they did it again it'd be a felony no I thought it was so funny
 because he's he is remarkably not empathetic and he hosts like his his
 authentic reactions of what he laughs at or like what gets him like a little a
 little stirring is always like wow he just has no room for another human heart
 in there just not right in there and there's one game where they had to wear
 circles on the colored circles on the back of their head and there was
 different circle colors on the floor and within 10 seconds you had to run and be
 in the proper color okay that mass about your head so it means you had to ask the
 person next to you what colors in the back of your head or whatever it's a
 you quickly looked around to see who you had alliances with it would be truthful
 to you and in this particular round everyone was truthful with one another no
 one wanted to fuck anyone over oh nice and so everyone kept going to the proper
 colored circles and he kept being like if this is supposed to be a bluffing
 game and if no one plays the game then we have to find another way to live by
 people and you will not like it and he had to like admonish them for not
 fucking each other over and sure enough I did this is sort of drawing people at
 random and eliminating people because everyone's being truthful and even after
 the first rounds of that happening it never got the bluff game going they just
 eliminated people arbitrarily until it got down so that game was just people
 well you know that gives me a little hope that creeping fascism might have
 some speed bumps along the way oh no I think I think that is a I'm not even
 terribly surprised to hear it hear that honestly I've seen several things now
 like reality TV games I go down weird rabbit holes on these reality TV game
 shows especially foreign-made ones yeah and I just got done with a Korean one
 called something like the it translates to something like the devil's game yeah
 and it is not a well-made show but the game that they that they built to build
 to film the show around is a fascinating game and it was there were people who
 were doing kind of what you're talking about Matt there was one guy
 specifically he was like I'm gonna try and play this game where nobody gets
 eliminated until the final episode which I want to play this game where no one
 gets eliminated and we just play for the prize at the end and that's it Wow and
 it didn't work out that way but like he had real momentum going and just like
 kindness and working together is definitely something that is in the
 face of shitty people doing shitty things is definitely something that is
 making a resurgence I mean I think people recognize that it's a needed
 commodity and and they're filling a void I think yes and I mean it's a good point
 that should be represented in those kinds of more exciting or mainstream or
 attractive kind of media ways people are generally good good like like the
 problem yes the problem is that what makes the news is very right now we're
 living in an unprecedented era of blatant power grabs by very powerful
 people right right and it used to be that even the power grabbers would have
 to pretend to be altruistic or pretend to be you know caring in some way they
 had to do at least one press conference where it wasn't just about the oil right
 like could you imagine if you know as Elon Musk is winning court cases of
 anyone trying to be in the way of him becoming the most obscenely rich person
 on earth right he keeps winning these court cases and Tesla keeps battling to
 pay him the most amount of money possible and the thing that I find
 generally baffling if I were a major Tesla shareholder I would just be
 furious yeah all the time and it's this it's this tech bro like Messiah culture
 where they just make anyone who's come up with a good idea and got fucking
 really lucky yeah become the most you know worship person on earth and
 therefore these things can't exist without the worship person being a part
 of it right and it's really strange but could you imagine if he said hey if you
 if since everyone's making all this money I've decided to make dedicate
 blank of my income to go to these other things but he doesn't right I mean look
 there are plenty of examples of people who have you know like right Bloomberg
 Soros there are plenty of people who have made sure that Bill Gates has spent
 a lot of his money and influenced with altruistic endeavors so it's not it's
 not without examples that that exists but it's just not the culture it's a
 simply not the way it's it's going and so right now we have an era where very
 few people are being blatantly greedy for both money and power and going out
 of their way to affect people's lives that have nothing to do with it right
 and this is yeah that's a thing and those people are inviting other
 people's kids to come to these weirdly elaborate birthday parties for their
 kids it's not it's not free for the other parents I mean they have to do they
 have to spend the time and the money and everything and then they have to go do
 all these all these crazy tasks with their children the parent did offer to
 reimburse anyone for expenses for any supplies and beg them not to spend more
 than $20 so but it's interesting the thought did cross the mind obviously for
 that yes of course oh well I think the majority of people are still good and
 the majority people are empathetic and look out for each other and I do too and
 we see it with people putting the other resources like for example even the
 crazy-ass liver story that you told Paul millions of people did rally right like
 you know like yeah you know it's like we we do look out for people all the time
 did you see the doctor pepper thing I have a lot of friends in Minneapolis so
 I'm happy now donating to numerous couples who are trying to get their
 loved one out of detention from I say although they are citizens so yeah well
 Matt I'm glad that this has I'm glad that all these people's discomfort has
 provided a way for you to feel a little bit better about yourself I'm a good
 person so yeah yeah no you're doing great Matt yeah I mean you can't have my
 liver but other than that I'm you're good part of it all right let's talk all
 right all right it grows back what's the doctor do that I had a friend do a live
 donation live liver donation oh wow cuz you look cuz your liver is one of your
 only organs that does grow back yeah it regenerates yeah yeah I mean yours is a
 strong term for you Jacob but like the general ones liver can grow back yeah
 a liver can grow back there's this creator on tik-tok who she was like hey
 I got a jingle for dr. pepper she's like dr. pepper baby it's good and nice do to
 do and people just glommed on to it kept sharing it and doing remixes of it and
 full instrumentation everything dr. pepper finally ponied up some dough to
 her and they've used it in a national commercial oh nice it's probably gonna be
 a Super Bowl ad yeah yeah it's a very viral fun and I would like to take this
 moment to encourage that person to go over to preaching fun comm with your new
 windfall of cash over to preaching fun comm yeah get us closer to that three
 billion dollar mark that's right that's right get us up there yeah yeah and you

 important after the resounding success of my 80s movie scooper D trilogy I went
 back to the drawing board for a completely original idea that however
 proved to be a whole thing so I'm with plan B a reboot please enjoy this
 completely fresh take on a stale concept that I'll keep rehashing long past its
 overstayed welcome and that is from keester Sunday the categories are 90s
 comedy 90s horror 90s action and 90s sci-fi me first I'm hyped for this all
 right I'll take a I'll take a 90s sci-fi I'll take that for two hundo after
 uncle Fester falls in love with the mom from stepbrothers he says fuck it and
 gives up time traveling to stay in the Old West leaving Teen Wolf to go back
 home and do nothing notable for nine years until Stuart little came out that
 would be back to the future part three that's right future three
 Paul hmm I will try 90s horror for 800 Oh Robert Rodriguez's 1996 horror action
 classic starring everyone's favorite Batman and everyone's favorite creepy
 foot fetishist suddenly becomes a vampire film halfway through when they
 end up at titty twister an all-night Mexican bar from dusk till dawn from
 dusk till dawn of course that's the $800 one wow that's a great movie oh yeah
 Matt and that was also a perfect explanation of it too I need to watch
 that again 90s comedy 200 please future stars of the critically acclaimed smash
 hits the master of the skies and the love guru co-star in this 1992 skit
 turned feature film about two Illinois losers doing a public access show out of
 one of their parents basement well-written Wayne's world that is
 Wayne's world of course the master of disguise and love guru I want to be a
 master of disguise turtle turtle turtle I'll try 90s action 200 you can think
 this overrated pseudo-psychological 1999 film where Ted Theodore Logan and Clark
 Kent's boss save humanity from enslavement inside a computer-generated
 dream world for a decade of annoying parodies and the term red pill that of
 course is the lawnmower man matrix matrix 90 sci-fi for 800 where is that
 over here daily double here's where it all turns around everything's coming up
 Paul mm-hmm this 1994 film has a pyramid and a portal on the poster I made it the
 $800 question because I never saw the film so that's the only clue I have for
 you I bet Paul knows what it is from that vague description though yeah that's
 gonna be Stargate mother fucker that is Stargate isn't it what else could it be
 the only way would be what's his name the guy spader spader spader spader
 would have put it over the edge I'll do 90s action for 800 mace Windu helps the
 singer from the critically acclaimed the return of Bruno solve Alfred's fun
 puzzles around the Big Apple 1995 action thriller it was the third in the series
 and they never made another one I don't know the singer oh shit

 hard I think it's the third one it's a third one but is it die harder is or is
 that with a vengeance diehard with a very hard with a vengeance diehard with a
 vengeance maybe it is diehard with a vengeance it might be diehard with I'll
