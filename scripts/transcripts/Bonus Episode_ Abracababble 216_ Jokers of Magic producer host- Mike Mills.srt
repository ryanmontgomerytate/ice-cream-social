9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:55,660
 And with me today is Mike Mills.

10
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:56,500
 Hello.

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,800
 Mike, thank you for joining us, but me. Well, you're joining us, our listeners, and me,

12
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:10,300
 the person talking to you. Producer of numerous shows, including The Jokers of Magic, star

13
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,100
 of The Jokers of Magic, host of The Jokers of Magic.

14
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,420
 Oh, let's say host, please.

15
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,520
 You Winston star. There's only four of us.

16
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:25,980
 I'm deeply uncomfortable. If there's stars in that show, I'm not one of them. But I am

17
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,260
 the host.

18
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,500
 I am the host. I am your humble host.

19
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,460
 Like, if there's credits, it's just like three names go by, and then you wait until

20
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,920
 the scroll, and you're the only name in the scroll. Like, that's how it would go?

21
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,220
 Maybe. Have you noticed that some of these shows now, they'll roll the credits, and it'll

22
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:45,280
 be like, starring so-and-so-and-so, and then it's with, it's like tied on the end. And

23
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,240
 I don't know what that means.

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,100
 I don't know either. And then, like, in movies, like, if you, you go lower and lower and lower

25
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,460
 unless it goes to and, you know.

26
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,160
 Right.

27
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,160
 Like, and then there's a last one.

28
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:01,660
 The last star that says, and this person. Like, it's very, very crazy. We are about

29
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,260
 to hit the road. We're about to hit nine cities.

30
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,520
 Nine cities in ten days.

31
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,040
 How, on a scale of one to ten, how much do you regret doing this as a whole?

32
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:23,380
 What is a number? I can say, I can say eight and a half. But I, you know, it's a lot of

33
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,240
 work, but it's, it's so much fun. It's all.

34
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,180
 All the work is front-loaded. You know, the booking, the contracting, the insurance, the

35
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,460
 travel planning, the technical advances. That's all, those are all the moments I wish I didn't

36
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,200
 have to deal with.

37
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,680
 I think it's interesting because, like, you have a, you know, it's like, it's like you

38
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:49,260
 were, for our listeners who maybe don't know you, you were a magician, a magic enthusiast

39
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:56,220
 and working magician, just like all the other nerds who still work today, besides me.

40
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,400
 And Rob Zabrecki. And then you, you literally figured out how to start touring, how to start,

41
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,820
 like, getting, booking shows. Like, where does it start? When do you start producing

42
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,020
 shows at your college? Where, where does it go?

43
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:15,480
 No, I, I was, I was a magician. I was paying for, I was working on my bachelor's at the

44
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,320
 University of Albany and, but paying for my tuition by doing shows. And long story short,

45
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,080
 I also had a magic shop in, here in Albany, New York, that I sort of,

46
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,080
 fell into owning this magic shop. And then...

47
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,840
 How old are you when you owned the magic shop? Are you 18?

48
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,000
 Like, 20.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,600
 20.

50
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,060
 19, 20. Yeah.

51
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,980
 Is that the start of you being entrepreneurial? Or were you entrepreneurial before that?

52
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,100
 No, no. That, yeah. I had, you know, as a teenager, I'd always been hustling, trying

53
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,300
 to figure out how to make a buck, sort of by necessity.

54
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,120
 Right. But what did you do?

55
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,240
 What did I do as a teenager?

56
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,040
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,080
 What did I not do? Selling hot dogs, selling, you know, milkshake stands, you know, starting

58
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,200
 at age, you know, 8, 10.

59
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,960
 All the stuff that kid entrepreneurs do.

60
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,600
 Right. But you say that, like, it's common. It's not common to be a kid entrepreneur.

61
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,520
 There are not, like, the majority of kids are not, like, go-getters and, like, want

62
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,960
 to get into commerce right away.

63
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,640
 I feel like, well, it's one of these things, I feel like there's less of it than there

64
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,140
 used to be.

65
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:11,700
 Right.

66
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,820
 But I feel like back in the day, more kids were out, you know, trying to make a buck.

67
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,700
 You know, here it was shoveling driveways or mowing lawns more often. But I got lucky

68
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:25,160
 that I found magic pretty early. And not only did I love it, but you're like, oh my God,

69
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:31,120
 $30 to go do a show at their kid's park. I'm 12. I'm 12 years old.

70
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,480
 Yeah.

71
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,000
 And there's a six-year-old that's having a birthday, and I can get $30 to go for a half

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,220
 hour. And then if I do balloon animals, I can get another 10. Like, these are insane

73
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,300
 amounts of money. And so...

74
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,900
 So you were on top of incentive, you know, experience and that kind of stuff on top of

75
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,660
 that as well. VIP experience, balloon animals on the side.

76
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,140
 I'd stay and take photos with the kids, and I'd do a talk.

77
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:56,160
 Yeah.

78
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,440
 And I'd walk back.

79
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,280
 Aren't you served Q&A?

80
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,660
 No, I never thought of that, actually.

81
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:09,940
 But, you know, so that was... But I think that's a story of a lot of young magicians

82
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,220
 who are, you know, find out that there's some commerce to be had. And then what happened

83
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:20,720
 in college, I was at a magic convention in Vegas, and I met this guy who ran a theater

84
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,140
 in Pennsylvania, and I was picking his brain. He's like, oh, yeah, you know, we just had

85
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,140
 Penn and Teller come through, and we did the Pendragon.

86
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:31,000
 I was like, oh, how would that work if I wanted to promote a show in a theater? And he told

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,320
 me. And so, actually, 1998, the first show I ever promoted in a theater was Penn and

88
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:37,640
 Teller.

89
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,140
 That's getting smart.

90
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:45,280
 Yeah. I mean, it was a good choice. It was a dream for me. I can't... I had no business

91
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,220
 promoting that show.

92
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,080
 How did you... Because Glenn's not their manager then, is he? Or is he...

93
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,440
 No, Glenn was around, but he... Glenn was 20 at the time, too.

94
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,360
 Right, right. So were you doing Crasher?

95
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,020
 Crasher was their manager.

96
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,460
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

97
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,240
 But by way of William Morris. There was this agent at William Morris who this guy I met

98
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,700
 in Pennsylvania introduced me to. Old-time William Morris agent, Marshall Resnick. And

99
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:12,280
 he took my call, and I think he was confused, because when I told him that I owned Planet

100
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:19,480
 Magic, the magic shop in Colony, New York, he thought I owned a nightclub called Planet

101
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,380
 Magic. So he thought I had experience, which I did not.

102
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,400
 So you were bluffing, or did you... You were accidentally bluffing.

103
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,120
 No, I was just...

104
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,200
 No, I just, you know, was the benefit of, I think, him misunderstanding what I did. I was not

105
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,220
 bullshitting at all.

106
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:32,880
 Right.

107
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,720
 You know, so I...

108
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,440
 Just a quick... I want to hear the rest of the story, but I'm just writing a side note that

109
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,760
 we can still open a nightclub called Planet Magic, so...

110
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,120
 Yeah.

111
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,320
 Good, good. All right, good.

112
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,300
 That's nice. Thank you.

113
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,760
 That probably would have been... That would be a whole different path. That's one of those

114
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,880
 sliding doors moments.

115
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,340
 Very sliding doors moments.

116
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,500
 A much more profitable path, but...

117
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,360
 But you wouldn't be alive anymore.

118
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,180
 I don't know where I'd be. But actually, this Penn & Teller show is one of those moments,

119
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,760
 too, of like, if this hadn't gone... It went well. Long story short, like, somehow the theater

120
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,100
 was willing to rent the space to me. The people who ran the theater, they were so sweet. It was,

121
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,080
 you know, this beautiful old vaudeville theater.

122
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,720
 How big was the theater?

123
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:18,100
 It could be here. 2,700 seats. It was, you know, like, a legit situation. But they knew me

124
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,640
 because I was...

125
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,600
 Was this the first show you produced?

126
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,200
 Yeah. It was crazy.

127
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,240
 The first show you produced was a 2,700-seat theater for Penn & Teller.

128
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,040
 When Marshall... When the...

129
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,120
 Agent's assistant was on the phone with me, and she said, I'm going to need to get a rider.

130
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,520
 I thought she meant I needed to rent a rider truck to get Penn & Teller's stuff to the theater.

131
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,780
 She meant a contract rider, a technical rider.

132
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,100
 She...

133
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:47,160
 Irene Pisani, she's still in the business today, and she's the best. She really helped me a lot.

134
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,700
 But then what happened is, they're like, okay, yeah, your date's good. We just need a $10,000 deposit.

135
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,160
 It's like, a $10,000 deposit?

136
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Well, that's... So that's where... That's why all of us don't start off with a 2,700-seat theater as our first show.

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,500
 Right. Because who hasn't? I didn't have $10,000. But you know what I did have?

138
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,080
 I had good credit on my credit card because I had been doing the magic shop for a couple years.

139
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,560
 Yeah.

140
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,580
 And every month, I'd buy my inventory from D. Robinson Company, the magic distributor.

141
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,900
 So all those whoopee cushions and ball vases and cement galley decks went on my credit card, and I paid off every month.

142
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,100
 So I took my credit card, and I swiped it at my own terminal in the store for $10,000.

143
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,460
 $10,000.

144
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,660
 That's incredible.

145
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,820
 It's incredibly stupid, and I feel like if my kids did that, I would tell them they're crazy.

146
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,160
 But thank God that show worked. That show worked. It made some money.

147
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,560
 But this... I mean, this is the whole thing.

148
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,100
 There is no perfectly smart way to go about any kind of business.

149
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,100
 At some point, it takes some kind of risk, and that risk, if it backfires, yes.

150
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,540
 Anyone would point the big, what a moment of idiocy.

151
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,700
 I took my college money and tried to produce a television pilot, and that pilot failed.

152
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,860
 So therefore, it is my thing to talk about.

153
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,820
 I blew my college money.

154
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,200
 But if my show took off, then it's that bold risk, right?

155
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,160
 So you were taking much less of a risk than I was.

156
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,380
 I was relying on television.

157
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,700
 You were relying on 2,700 people in New York wanting to see Penn & Teller.

158
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,520
 That's different.

159
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,420
 There's just all kinds of risks.

160
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:11,960
 But you're right.

161
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,000
 In this industry specifically, there's no path.

162
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,540
 If somebody said, I want to be a promoter, or I want to be a producer, or I want to...

163
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,320
 Maybe if you were going to be an agent, you'd still try to do the mailroom route.

164
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,980
 Like, that's sort of a proven...

165
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,880
 Yes, that's still...

166
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,660
 ...development path.

167
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,140
 Yeah, yeah.

168
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,700
 But for anything else, it's sort of like, well,

169
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,320
 what could you do today and tomorrow?

170
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,440
 What's the next thing you can do to move this forward

171
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,220
 without losing your shirt or crashing and burning?

172
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,080
 Right.

173
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,040
 So anyway, I only share that story because the Penn & Teller of it

174
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,180
 is still one of the things that just brings me great joy.

175
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,300
 And the show sold well.

176
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,480
 The show did well.

177
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,920
 It sold enough tickets where I made a few thousand dollars,

178
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,940
 which, same thing, not to talk about money.

179
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,600
 I was like, oh my god, I could do one of these and make a few thousand dollars.

180
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,380
 How do I do 50 next year?

181
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,700
 And of course, the next year I do two, and they both lose money.

182
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,220
 And the next year I do four, and two of them work and two of them don't.

183
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,600
 It's very, very tough.

184
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,040
 Oh, it's almost like winning your first blackjack bet, right?

185
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,720
 You're like, oh, I'm good at this.

186
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,920
 And then you find out...

187
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,800
 Reality strikes.

188
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,900
 Reality hits hard at some point.

189
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,320
 But you were able to pay off your credit card, though.

190
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,300
 You paid that back, yeah?

191
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,140
 Indeed.

192
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:18,240
 Indeed.

193
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:25,180
 So you start producing three shows, four shows.

194
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:25,820
 Are you still finishing?

195
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,440
 Are you still finishing on college?

196
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,360
 Yeah, I did.

197
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,900
 I got a degree, a business degree.

198
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,640
 I felt like...

199
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,380
 You sound so defeated when you say that.

200
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,680
 No, I debated at the time.

201
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,800
 I was so tired of it.

202
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,120
 I wanted to just get out in the world and do stuff.

203
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,620
 Right.

204
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,800
 My sister convinced me to stick with it.

205
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,880
 She's like, you're close enough.

206
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,620
 Just get the degree.

207
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,660
 And it was.

208
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,960
 It's good to have an education.

209
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,240
 I don't know that I never...

210
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,540
 The degree actually has served me, but the education did.

211
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,100
 Shots fired.

212
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,960
 I'll take it.

213
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,400
 That's fine.

214
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,780
 I'm pretty sure that I'm better for my one year of acting education.

215
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:55,800
 I'm pretty sure that I'm better for my one year of acting education.

216
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,720
 at Montclair State.

217
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,100
 So I'm pretty sure that that's what set me on my way.

218
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,500
 Is it true that you studied Shakespeare?

219
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,860
 I have indeed studied.

220
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,400
 But weren't you a Shakespearean actor?

221
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,040
 I have done Shakespearean shows, yes.

222
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,060
 Why is that?

223
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:15,360
 Have you talked on this podcast about the thing you did on Thanksgiving?

224
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,220
 Oh, no.

225
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,860
 I think I did, actually.

226
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,200
 Yeah, yeah.

227
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,640
 But that's fine.

228
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,060
 Yeah, yeah.

229
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,720
 Exactly, yeah.

230
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,340
 And that's it.

231
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:25,100
 When I was younger, I did an improv show every Friday and Saturday.

232
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,780
 And obviously, we did improv shows.

233
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,420
 And we did genres and stuff like that.

234
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,600
 And so my high school drama teacher, I went to a former arts high school,

235
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,120
 was one of the renowned Shakespeare training people in the state.

236
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,840
 And so I was improvising Shakespeare all the time.

237
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,960
 So when he cast me as the lead in the Shakespeare show my senior year,

238
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,080
 he would laugh and be frustrated at the same time about my ability to

239
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,400
 improvise lines where I was lost in scenes.

240
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,220
 I played Falstaff in The Merry Wives of Windsor,

241
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,900
 just an epic amount of Shakespearean scenes to memorize.

242
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,760
 And so I did a lot of improv.

243
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,200
 And so he was laughing that I would just improvise my way through some of the smaller scenes

244
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
 that I just couldn't crack.

245
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,540
 Incredible.

246
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,160
 Oh.

247
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,220
 So yes, yeah.

248
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,420
 So I was excited to improvise with Brad Sherwood.

249
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,160
 We did Shakespearean Presented of Magic at Matt King's house, the musical.

250
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,740
 It went so well that we pitched it at a local French festival here.

251
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,820
 I pitched, sure, we've heard of Shakespeare's plays, but why does no one perform Shakespeare's

252
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,380
 musicals?

253
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,960
 And so that's the pitch for us to do it.

254
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,340
 So good.

255
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,260
 I can't wait to see it.

256
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,460
 It's so fun.

257
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,740
 But Brad Sherwood is the one who did it.

258
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,360
 It was just still tip top with improvising Shakespeare.

259
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,760
 I put it to bed for a very long time.

260
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,040
 So trying to dust it back off was really tough, really tough.

261
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,880
 I mean, he's a genius.

262
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,720
 And the fact that that's just one of all the genres that he can instantly access and immerse

263
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,620
 himself in and just bring to life.

264
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,020
 When he had the idea, he called me on the phone.

265
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,380
 He just started improvising on the phone with me.

266
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:49,620
 I was like, he's being hilarious just to me on the spot at like 10 o'clock in the morning.

267
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,720
 Also, it's also kind of weird if we're being honest.

268
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,400
 It's like, what are we doing?

269
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,180
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

270
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:09,220
 Like, it's fascinating how many layers, like how much time before we're, yes, we're using

271
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,060
 the same words, but not speaking the same language, right?

272
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,280
 Like my kids studying like the Gettysburg Address right now.

273
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,800
 And I'm translating the Gettysburg Address to him because like it makes absolutely no

274
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,960
 sense to him whatsoever.

275
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,840
 And you're like, it's like, and that's what, that's 100 years, 100 change, right?

276
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,700
 So you're like, yeah.

277
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:25,840
 Yeah.

278
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,320
 Shakespeare, it's like you're, you're, you're just translating English to English, which

279
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,220
 is the weirdest thing, but you are doing that.

280
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,900
 But it's a, it's a weird thing.

281
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,200
 Anyhow.

282
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,580
 All right.

283
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,540
 Back on topic.

284
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,600
 Yeah.

285
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,460
 The Jokers of Magic.

286
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,320
 You know, we've, we've talked obviously a lot off air.

287
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,060
 We've, we've toured.

288
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:48,840
 So, you know, when I look back at like, you loved magic, you started producing shows.

289
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:55,400
 At, at any moment, are you hoping to produce your own show or do you, did you see this

290
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:55,680
 two-part?

291
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,480
 Or how did you, how did you?

292
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,360
 No, I stopped doing magic because the, the producing thing started to work out and I

293
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,960
 found a career there and, and then I had a, you know, got married and had kids.

294
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,460
 And so you just do the responsible thing.

295
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,440
 And it was also very exciting.

296
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,980
 I was loving producing, but for most of the last 20 years, I just did that.

297
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,320
 And, and, you know, did the responsible thing.

298
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,880
 I'm like, oh, I, who has time to perform?

299
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,060
 Also, I was very self-conscious because I was like, no, who's going to take, especially

300
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,260
 when I was younger, who's going to take me seriously as a producer?

301
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,060
 If I'm off, like promoting myself as a magician, I just.

302
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,820
 Or you were just trying to do magic tricks in front of them, right?

303
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,120
 Like, I'm going to bring you into this huge theater, but like, here, do you want to see,

304
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,840
 pick a card?

305
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,880
 Yeah, no, it's just all felt like.

306
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,220
 I don't know about that, Mike Mills.

307
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,200
 Yeah, it just felt like, you know, be a professional, do your thing.

308
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,240
 And, and, you know, and I did some, some shows here and there, but for the most part, I gave

309
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,420
 it up.

310
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,140
 But then what happened is you get to a certain point in your life and you're like, oh my

311
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,080
 gosh, I, you know, being a producer is, is a lot of fun.

312
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,880
 But it's mostly spreadsheets and meetings and email.

313
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,080
 It's, it's, it's business for the most part.

314
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,860
 And it's not.

315
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:09,120
 I mean, like, I remember meeting you, I believe Matt King's Roast is the first time I remember

316
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,540
 having a conversation.

317
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:17,660
 And you definitely were not like, even talking about producing a magic show, you weren't

318
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,140
 like, you know, I also love magic or, you know, I also did magic.

319
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,720
 Like, there was not a part of you that came off as a, as a guy who liked magic, you know,

320
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,880
 as a, as a, as a performer.

321
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,420
 Do you know what I mean?

322
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:27,800
 Like you.

323
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,360
 That's too bad.

324
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,700
 I've always loved it.

325
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:35,960
 But it is, but it's also a tough thing to produce commercially, meaning it's really

326
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,340
 tough.

327
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,820
 You know, it's, it's, it's.

328
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:42,280
 Well, you've said famously, I know we, you have a board with your company, your company

329
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,500
 produces how many shows?

330
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,660
 How many, how many shows does Mills Entertainment send out?

331
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:49,820
 You know, we did a little under 300 dates last year.

332
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,300
 Yeah.

333
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,480
 Like, yeah.

334
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,620
 Across like what, 12, 15 shows?

335
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,740
 Yeah.

336
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,040
 Yeah.

337
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,340
 Exactly.

338
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:55,560
 Yep.

339
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:55,820
 Yeah.

340
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:55,960
 Yeah.

341
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,080
 Yeah.

342
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:01,240
 And you said your board would like to have how many dates of those booked as magic shows?

343
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,480
 Oh, it would be zero.

344
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:11,520
 I still haven't found, you know, I have such great respect for, say, Alex Jarrett, who

345
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,900
 champions of magic and has made such a great business and career out of it.

346
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,000
 And it's, the show's great.

347
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,400
 He's figured out the formula for selling tickets.

348
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,640
 You know, there's, there's a handful of those people that, that we know that have done it.

349
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,540
 Um, and, you know, also the other thing is most of the theaters that my company does

350
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,460
 business in are 1,500 seats or 2,000 seats or 2,500 seats.

351
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,580
 It's a lot of seats to sell.

352
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:32,980
 Yes.

353
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,500
 Right, right, right.

354
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:39,800
 So you need some amount of celebrity, uh, or, or, um, you know, or intellectual property.

355
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,140
 That's.

356
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,640
 Yeah, yeah.

357
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,180
 Yeah.

358
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,320
 Like, now you see me, you know.

359
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,780
 Yeah.

360
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,460
 That kind of stuff.

361
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:45,980
 Great example.

362
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,820
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

363
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,600
 Um, so you never, so you basically put it away.

364
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,900
 Now, as your children get older and you're a secret magician, you're still like a closet

365
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,960
 magician at this point.

366
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,600
 Do you still show this?

367
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,880
 Do you start showing them magic tricks?

368
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,520
 Do you bust it out at the Christmas party?

369
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:00,840
 Oh, yeah.

370
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:05,240
 And I did have this one place I performed every summer that was like a really wonderful

371
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,100
 creative outlet for me.

372
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,620
 So I would do like four or six shows there every summer.

373
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:14,780
 And, and so the kids always came and, uh, if they still, by the way, if they hear like

374
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,900
 Mr. Brightside or some of the songs that I use in my pre-show, they still go, Daddy Magic

375
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,640
 Show music.

376
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,700
 Because those songs are etched.

377
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,780
 So they liked what you did.

378
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,740
 You did magic tricks for them.

379
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,620
 They loved it.

380
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,360
 I mean, they loved it.

381
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,040
 It was such a, they had so much fun coming to see those shows.

382
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,960
 Oh, that's great.

383
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,280
 Yeah.

384
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,200
 So that was very rewarding as a father.

385
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,740
 Um, but then, yeah, basically it's, it's one of those COVID moments.

386
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,560
 It's like, oh, you know what?

387
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,140
 I miss it.

388
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,540
 Let's do it.

389
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,440
 Let's do some more performing.

390
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,640
 So I started performing again.

391
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,120
 And then this tour sort of came a little bit out of the Foolers tour.

392
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,960
 Yeah.

393
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,140
 And that we're like, oh gosh, there's no perfect formula.

394
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,460
 But I felt like the one thing that hadn't been done, and we talked about this, like

395
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,780
 you were the first person I talked to about this.

396
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,220
 Right.

397
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,400
 Was like, I don't think there's been a touring comedy magic package.

398
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,460
 Like, I think that's novel, especially adult leaning.

399
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,260
 Now that's not totally true because the Naked Magicians were out a few years ago and that

400
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,460
 was, you know, comedy magic.

401
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,880
 I never saw it and I don't know it, but I, you know, that, that sort of.

402
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,240
 But it's still not putting comedy first.

403
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,280
 It's putting nudity first.

404
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,680
 Right.

405
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,400
 Right.

406
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:11,840
 Yeah.

407
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,860
 I mean, I guess I'm putting jokes in their mouths.

408
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,880
 I don't know how, maybe they're playing it straight.

409
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,040
 Maybe it's, is that a sexy show?

410
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:22,020
 You just put, you know, in sports metaphors, it's bulletin board material, right?

411
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,520
 Where if the other coach talks to the press and says something derogatory about the team,

412
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,660
 you put it up on the bulletin board so all the whole team reads it and wants to like

413
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,000
 tear the doors off, right?

414
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,740
 Man, sports metaphors are 100% lost on me.

415
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,480
 I was, that's a, I really tried to explain it.

416
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,080
 I, did you, did you just listen to the story?

417
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,100
 I did magic as a kid.

418
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,820
 How am I supposed to understand a sports metaphor?

419
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,580
 Just so you know, that right now the Naked Magicians are huddling up being like, that

420
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,160
 guy said they're laughing at our dicks.

421
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,760
 And then they're going to, they're going to huddle up and they're going to go out there

422
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,160
 and give the best show they've ever done.

423
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,060
 That's what, that's what I'm saying.

424
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,340
 That's what I'm saying.

425
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,520
 Yeah.

426
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,720
 So, uh, so yeah, we have, we have some things in common with the Naked Magicians, but maybe

427
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,740
 not so much the commerce of it.

428
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,520
 But, uh, yeah, so, so, so it actually, I think, I think it's working.

429
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,580
 What we're doing is working.

430
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,440
 It's just one of those things where we haven't, you know, what did we do?

431
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,280
 Three, we did like five cities the first time.

432
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:12,640
 Yeah.

433
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,400
 Nine now.

434
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,440
 And we're in that phase of like, it is hit or miss at the box office.

435
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,940
 Like some of these are working and some of them are working really well and then some

436
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,420
 are just a little soft and you're like, Oh, I wish I knew exactly why, which ones, I think

437
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,340
 I'm starting to get a hunch, which I won't comment on here, but I think I'm starting

438
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,960
 to see what's working.

439
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,600
 Oh yeah.

440
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,100
 See, this is what's exciting.

441
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,780
 Like, I know, like, uh, I laugh because like, I love this show.

442
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,280
 I love the idea of doing the Joker's magic.

443
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,460
 I love a comedy forward thing.

444
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,240
 I had this conversation with Harrison Greenbaum where I was like, you know, we have the term

445
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,540
 like alt rock, but we don't have a term for like alt magic.

446
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,900
 But like, you know, when I talked to him and I was like, you and I are all.

447
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,480
 We're not traditional magic.

448
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,560
 Like if you want like the most, like, you know, traditional magicians show up at this

449
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:01,700
 party, that's not, you don't want us to show up at this party, you know, you want something

450
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,440
 like, I love doing shows where people are like, I don't normally go see magic shows

451
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,800
 or I was skeptical when I walked in.

452
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,040
 I was like, yes, that's, that's exactly who I want sitting down in front of me.

453
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:16,100
 Uh, uh, is like, cause like, yeah, I, we were going to win you over tremendously.

454
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:20,720
 Um, sorry, I just did a show last night where someone goes, I didn't think you need to do

455
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,020
 the tricks.

456
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:21,860
 I just liked your joke.

457
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,680
 And I was like, that's the, that's all I'm looking for.

458
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:31,800
 Sometimes I thought if I were funny enough, I, if I could do, I would just wean myself

459
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,160
 off the tricks and just go out and do the jokes.

460
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,860
 That would be fun.

461
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:40,220
 But, but I will say like, there's magic comedy is different than comedy in that we're not,

462
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,060
 we're not providing commentary about life.

463
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:47,320
 We're creating ridiculous and hilarious situations.

464
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,720
 It's situational comedy, which, which I really enjoy and people do too.

465
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,640
 The social experiment of it of like, oh, this is, this is a weird conceit.

466
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,360
 It's a super playful thing that can take you to some great places with people.

467
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:05,980
 Um, but yeah, I think like to go from producing other shows and they fall in love with magic,

468
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:11,140
 but now we've, we've cornered you into producing your own magic show where you don't necessarily

469
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:15,420
 get to, it's not the break from your routine that it normally is.

470
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:15,680
 Right.

471
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,480
 Like, you know, like when you go off on cruise ships, you get to, it's a total break from

472
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,300
 producing tours.

473
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:26,840
 This show relies on you to wear both hats, you know, producer hat and magic hat.

474
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:32,860
 Is that something that you surprisingly enjoy or are you, is it, is it as, as annoying as

475
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,420
 anticipated?

476
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,300
 How would you describe wearing both hats?

477
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:40,400
 Um, I love, I love, well, you know, there's some ambivalence there.

478
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,280
 There's like some, you know, there's some things I love, but it is tough to do it all.

479
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:49,060
 So just to be clear, like the only, you know, I have to do all the steps of the process

480
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,640
 as the producer of the show, because.

481
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,100
 This piece of business, the Jokers of Magic is a relatively small piece of business.

482
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:00,360
 So the company, the team has said to me, Mike, we support you, but we can't really put a

483
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,140
 lot of time into this.

484
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,300
 So it becomes a magic project and that's okay.

485
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,300
 Like that's, that's okay.

486
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:08,320
 But what's great about it is I do love talking to, like, I don't handle the booking of our

487
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:08,880
 tours anymore.

488
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,300
 Uh, you know, I, I did that in the beginning of the company, but I don't do it anymore.

489
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,460
 But for this show I do.

490
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:17,340
 So I get to talk to the theater operators and it's really nice because, uh, I haven't

491
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,160
 done as much of that.

492
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,640
 Oh, so it's like a, it's like an old school that you're dusting off.

493
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,060
 Yeah.

494
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,780
 I literally like, yeah, it's like, Hey, I got a pitch for you.

495
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,020
 I want to hear a pitch, you know, like, Hey, we should do this show together.

496
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,440
 Let's make the deal, which is super.

497
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,700
 I love, I love.

498
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:28,940
 Yeah.

499
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,200
 And then, you know, but I will say the hardest part, and this is the thing that we talk about,

500
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,440
 you and I talk about a lot, which is like the marketing is tough.

501
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,140
 How do you, how do you get people to pay attention?

502
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:42,060
 We know that they'll have a great time if they come out, but there's so much noise in

503
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,840
 the market and there's so much competition for our marketing for live entertainment.

504
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,540
 It's harder than ever.

505
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:46,820
 Right.

506
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,740
 And across the board, like not just for magic, right?

507
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,300
 Like marketing.

508
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,420
 Yeah.

509
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,720
 Um, I would say it's harder than ever, partially because it's changed so much in the rate of

510
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:01,760
 change is so rapid that, um, you know, none of the traditional media really works.

511
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,840
 There's no ROI there, you know?

512
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,760
 And, and then, um, you know, we do, we spend most of our money on paid digital.

513
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,420
 We can get in front of people, but it's just hard.

514
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,200
 People are busy.

515
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,040
 They have limited dollars to spend.

516
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,860
 They have the best entertainment options at home, historically speaking.

517
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,660
 Right.

518
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,280
 Like why the hell even leave the house?

519
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:18,580
 Yeah.

520
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,120
 Yeah.

521
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,740
 Yeah.

522
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,700
 Get a babysitter.

523
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,580
 You got to drive downtown, you got to pay for parking and then, you know, you got to

524
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,100
 buy the ticket.

525
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:29,100
 So it's, it's a big ask, but, um, that was always my comparison.

526
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,160
 People talk about like living in Las Vegas versus New York.

527
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:36,520
 I moved here, I moved here from New York and I was like, you know, uh, I just remember

528
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,000
 doing some interview for something and they're like, is it, is it, it's gotta be easy to

529
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,260
 do a show here in Vegas and New York.

530
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,300
 I go like, no way.

531
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,680
 And they're like, what do you mean?

532
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,180
 I go, New York, no one's home.

533
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,300
 No one goes home.

534
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,040
 So like everyone's out and about.

535
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,880
 So you're, all you're trying to say is like, Hey, if you're already out and about, come

536
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:50,960
 by.

537
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,660
 Come by here at this time, you know, this night, go for it.

538
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,960
 You know, I was like here in Vegas is like, you're, you're home.

539
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,080
 You're sitting in your couch.

540
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,780
 You can, you can make dinner.

541
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:03,540
 Now you want to get up and get out of your house and then go to this show downtown.

542
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:08,220
 Like, Oh, that's such a harder ask than, than asking New Yorkers to do stuff.

543
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,460
 New Yorkers is a lot of noise, but everyone's doing stuff there.

544
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,880
 You don't, you don't live in New York cause you want to like sit at home, you know?

545
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,440
 So it's like, it's easy.

546
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,300
 It's a culture thing.

547
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:17,640
 Yeah.

548
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,920
 But it's, it's, I mean, but when people talk about doing shows in Vegas,

549
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,900
 they're mostly talking about selling tickets to the, the visitors, the tourists.

550
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,200
 Right.

551
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,400
 So, and then which they also assume is sort of easier, but it's so much harder than it

552
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:30,600
 looks.

553
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,040
 Oh, it's so much harder than it looks.

554
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,320
 And now especially, yeah, yeah, yeah.

555
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,000
 Now, cause we've, we've, we've, we've, we've turned basically Las Vegas into one hotel.

556
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,860
 Right.

557
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,240
 Cause the, the sphere and the Raider stadium have turned.

558
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,880
 So everyone coming to town for blank, can they, do they also want to do this other thing?

559
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,220
 And now everyone's competing for this other thing.

560
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:50,880
 No.

561
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,200
 No one's competing for the primary thing.

562
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,060
 It's a, it's a really weird thing.

563
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,040
 Is this late stage capitalism?

564
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,080
 Is that what they call this?

565
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,920
 We're seeing, as we sit here and complain about how tough these markets are and how

566
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,080
 saturated and how dominated they are by, yeah.

567
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,900
 Yeah.

568
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,100
 I mean, I mean, Vegas has always changed, changing significantly.

569
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,040
 So it's, it's, it's, it's, it's a phase thing for sure.

570
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,120
 For sure.

571
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,080
 But you know, we'll see.

572
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:16,440
 We'll see.

573
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,320
 Let's see.

574
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,860
 We're going to Lexington, Kentucky.

575
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,880
 Yes.

576
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,460
 Bloomington, Indiana.

577
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,480
 Yes.

578
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,840
 Uh, Wabash.

579
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,800
 Cincinnati, Ohio.

580
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,080
 Cincinnati, Ohio.

581
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,940
 Ohio.

582
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,500
 We're doing a few shows in Cincinnati.

583
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:28,820
 Yeah.

584
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:35,540
 A couple, two shows, uh, uh, in Cincinnati, um, Milwaukee, Madison, Green Bay.

585
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,800
 All right.

586
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,020
 And Chicago.

587
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,020
 And Chicago.

588
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,180
 Yeah.

589
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:39,920
 We're playing a comedy club.

590
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:45,600
 I'm very curious how our show will feel in the Chicago comedy club.

591
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,140
 I'm very excited that we're doing a comedy club.

592
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,100
 I just.

593
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,520
 It's going to be a little bit of a different show.

594
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,240
 Yeah.

595
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,280
 In a, in a way that I think I'm going to love, but I'm curious if the others are going

596
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,040
 to love it as well.

597
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,140
 And the others being the audience.

598
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:01,060
 Um, no, it's going to be great.

599
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,840
 It's just like you have to, we can't pretend it's a theater and pretend that, that, that

600
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,960
 the kinds of things we, you know, just, uh, it'll be a little bit different and we'll

601
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:15,620
 just do a club show in a club and it's, um, yeah, I'm really excited about that too.

602
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,780
 We'll see what we'll see.

603
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,820
 But, but for instance, no intermission, right.

604
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,420
 In the theater show, we usually take it.

605
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:20,780
 Intermission.

606
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,860
 We don't need intermission.

607
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,900
 No, no, no.

608
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,520
 Yeah.

609
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,360
 That's what I'm curious about.

610
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:24,600
 All that.

611
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,940
 Because we're doing it without intermission, still doing the bits without like a lot of

612
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:33,780
 tech, uh, feeling how much magic is an add on in a comedy club environment, uh, versus

613
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:37,020
 a comedy being an add on in a theatrical environment.

614
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,160
 Uh, yeah.

615
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,280
 I'm curious about all of it, but you already, you know, this, you seem skeptical about this

616
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:42,580
 show.

617
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:49,420
 Um, no, I actually really thought about it that much other than knowing we should do

618
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,320
 something a little different and figuring.

619
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:50,400
 Yeah.

620
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,100
 I mean, it's, it's halfway through this little run.

621
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,360
 So we'll have a number of days in, in, you know, our van to talk about the approach.

622
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:03,600
 Um, so if anyone wants to join us for that one, Tuesday, January 27th, that'll be a fun

623
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,000
 experimental situation.

624
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,640
 Yeah.

625
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,440
 But it's gonna be great.

626
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,040
 I mean, you're very comfortable in a club.

627
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,400
 Uh, Eric Dittleman is, he does clubs all the time, you know?

628
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,880
 I was going to say, and it's a Tuesday, so I'm also comfortable with smaller audiences.

629
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,420
 So then you'll be very comfortable.

630
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,960
 I mean, I don't know.

631
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,920
 It's one of those, it's like, it sells late.

632
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,280
 Like that's one that, that, you know, we don't know if we're going to have, you know, if

633
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,520
 it's going to be, the whole capacity is only 150.

634
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,200
 So it's going to, it'll be fine.

635
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:35,740
 It'll be great.

636
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:35,980
 Yeah.

637
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,560
 It'll be fine.

638
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,280
 Oh, which, which, which venue are you looking forward to the most?

639
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,660
 Uh, those like Cincinnati is selling great.

640
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,080
 We have two shows and they'll both be packed.

641
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,260
 You know, that, that's great.

642
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,500
 And I love to show days.

643
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,280
 I love settling in.

644
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,460
 And getting to sort of two at-bats in the same venue.

645
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,200
 Yes.

646
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:54,680
 Yeah.

647
00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:00,000
 Um, um, but all of them really, it's a, it's a really great set of venues.

648
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,400
 So if you look, you know, I hope if you're listening and you live in any of these towns,

649
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,300
 uh, I think you'll be really thrilled with the show.

650
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,920
 And these are all the, you know, the, the best local venues.

651
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,540
 Yeah.

652
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:12,620
 And if you don't live in those towns, but you know, someone who does tell those people

653
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,460
 to go to our show.

654
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,240
 Yeah.

655
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,380
 And they're all listed at jokersonmagic.com with direct links to the official sites.

656
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,200
 Yeah.

657
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,560
 Um, well, I'm so excited.

658
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,760
 One is, you know, of all the things we've talked about, it's like, I actually love the

659
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,520
 show that we've put together.

660
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,260
 Like, I like that it's not just a lineup show and that we've put together like a really

661
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,140
 cool way for all of us to interact and share the stage and stuff.

662
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:36,600
 And, uh, I'm really looking forward to, to the longer run, meaning we can find more bits

663
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,020
 and other things to add to the show.

664
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:38,260
 Yeah.

665
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,300
 I think we will have some, I feel like now this is the second round.

666
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,920
 We should try something new every night.

667
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,480
 Yeah.

668
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,360
 It could be small, it can be big, it could be, you know, whatever.

669
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,340
 Just, we should, uh, we should not.

670
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,240
 We should not settle in too quickly here.

671
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:50,900
 This will be a lot of fun.

672
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,480

00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:51,740
