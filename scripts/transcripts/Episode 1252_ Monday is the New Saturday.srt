1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
 I'm here on a job site with Tim who owns his own electrical contracting business.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,520
 Three employees and two work trucks.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,480
 Tim traded up to Geico Commercial Auto Insurance.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,040
 We're positively here where he needs us most.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,760
 They sure are.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,560
 With step-by-step help on all his insurance needs.

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,960
 All for shockingly low rates.

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,320
 Shockingly low, huh?

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,080
 It's just a little bit of electrician humor.

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:20,640
 Do you get it?

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,440
 I got it.

12
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,240
 You know, it feels like we have a real connection.

13
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,040
 All right, I'll stop.

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,960
 Hey everybody, Jacob the Audio Guy here.

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:40,320
 Tierney's Tavern, Thursday, October 23rd, Montclair, New Jersey, 7 p.m.

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,600
 It is going to be great.

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,280
 The doors open at 7.

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,640
 Make sure you get there.

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,760
 Tierney's Tavern, Thursday, October 23rd.

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,360
 Doors open at 7 p.m.

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,880
 It's a night of improv, stand-up, magic.

24
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,800
 Matt Donnelly and Paul Mattingly.

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,160
 That's right, Matt and Mattingly will be there.

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,080
 Kurt Braunler will be there.

27
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,200
 Dion Flynn from The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon will be there.

28
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,440
 The Didgeridoo Scoop and so many more.

29
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,800
 It is going to be amazing.

30
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,240
 If you can get to Tierney's Thursday, October 23rd, 7 p.m., get there.

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,000
 It is going to be a night to remember.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,080
 I'm a little jealous.

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,320
 If you go and I'm not there, just know that I'm jealous of you.

34
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,440
 That's right.

35
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,600
 Here we go.

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,400
 I've been working all day already.

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,440
 It's fucking bullshit.

38
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,400
 That's the thing about you.

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,200
 Oh, you want to go to bed?

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,480
 Yeah, I'm ready.

41
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:41,040
 I want to thank all the ice cream truck drivers that have joined us today.

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,360
 Thank you, all you ice cream truck drivers.

43
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,920
 I don't have a new list with your names on it yet, but we will before this month is over.

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,560
 And we will thank each and every one of you by name here at this part of the show.

45
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,320
 If you want to be an ice cream truck driver, and I sure hope you do,

46
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,400
 PreachingFun.com is where you can go.

47
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,840
 Go to PreachingFun.com, sign up to be an ice cream truck driver, and who knows?

48
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,840
 The life you save may be your own.

49
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,080
 And now, a program.

50
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,560
 Hey, Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social?

51
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,920
 Yeah, I'd love to.

52
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,120
 Great, let's go.

53
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,040
 What would you do?

54
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,760
 Show of hands, everybody who's doing this show from a balcony on a cruise ship.

55
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,280
 Hey, it's Boogey Matt Donnelly.

56
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,160
 One goes up, that's doing it.

57
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,280
 It's time for Matt Donnelly's Ice Cream Social.

58
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,520
 Just sitting in a regular room, it's Paul Mattingly.

59
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,880
 Sitting in a different regular room, it's me, Jacob, the audio guy.

60
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,280
 Sitting on the balcony of a cruise ship, it's Matt Donnelly.

61
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,240
 We're PreachingFun.

62
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,680
 I don't like being called Boogey.

63
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,080
 Boogey Matt Donnelly.

64
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,480
 I feel like nothing about me is being Boogey at all.

65
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:03,280
 Matt Donnelly is wearing a bright pink hoodie modeled after the Beatles' "Sergeant Pepper" album.

66
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,600
 Which one are you? Which one is that?

67
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,120
 I don't know, the pink one? Mr. Pink.

68
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,800
 Is that John?

69
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,560
 Yeah. I think that's Paul.

70
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,160
 Why would you get the Paul outfit?

71
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,320
 Because the John one is the yellow one that none of the three of us wanted.

72
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,680
 I think you would pick the Ringo one, and I think I had the George one.

73
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,880
 Makes sense, all right.

74
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,400
 I'm here to give sage wisdom.

75
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,920
 What a large hood.

76
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,360
 It's great, because you want to know why?

77
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,400
 It's so windy, but I still want to get my steps in.

78
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,760
 I can put my headphones on and put the hood on over the headphones and then tie it tight,

79
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,760
 and I can walk around with my headphones on.

80
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,680
 You're fairly incognito, eh?

81
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,180
 Yeah.

82
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,600
 It is a bigger deal than people realize for large-headed individuals

83
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,160
 to have a hood on a hoodie that actually fits our head.

84
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:04,560
 And same goes with those, you know, I use real headphones because the little ones that go in

85
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,320
 the ears, again, when you have a large head, you also have large ear holes, and so those things

86
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,040
 will fall out.

87
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,880
 Earbuds just fall right out of your head?

88
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,720
 Yeah, I can't wear earbuds.

89
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,240
 Like throwing a hot dog down a hallway with your earbuds, huh?

90
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,240
 I can do the-

91
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,160
 I have a gaping, slutty ear hole.

92
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:33,120
 Matt with his lobe gashes just completely wide.

93
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,640
 Good Lord.

94
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,360
 How do you think he gets that gig?

95
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,080
 How do you think he gets that gig?

96
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,280
 Oh, some serious aural stimulation.

97
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,520
 The earbuds fall into his ears.

98
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,520
 No, gross.

99
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,800
 Little tweezers.

100
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,120
 He's got four Raycons stuck in his-

101
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,520
 Hurry, I just keep hearing Spotify ads.

102
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,840
 Help me, help me.

103
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,120
 Oh gosh, how many of you?

104
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,920
 That's a loud helicopter.

105
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,240
 Is that what it is?

106
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,520
 The helicopter is coming by Matt right now.

107
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,480
 It's great.

108
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,760
 I'm sure they're not looking for him.

109
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,480
 It's no big deal.

110
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,160
 Citizen, are you on Twitch?

111
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,920
 What is the content of your creation?

112
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,440
 Twitch is really cracking down.

113
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,120
 Airwolf, it could be airwolf.

114
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,240
 It could be airwolf.

115
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,320
 It could always be airwolf.

116
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,160
 Stringfellow Hawk coming through.

117
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,080
 So yesterday is this-

118
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,360
 Is that a jet?

119
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,080
 That's a jet.

120
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,760
 I think we're right next to the airport.

121
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,120
 They're gonna be done with my room so soon.

122
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,320
 I'll go back inside so soon.

123
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,000
 Why?

124
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,280
 This is great radio.

125
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,440
 Apparently there's a drawback to doing the show outside.

126
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,600
 You'll never convince me.

127
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,880
 A hovercraft, I'm just gonna keep-

128
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,640
 I'm just playing an old sound effects CD.

129
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,040
 Just modes of transportation.

130
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,080
 Mode to transportation.

131
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,920
 It's an old Spike Jonze bit.

132
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,640
 They're invading Normandy right behind Matt.

133
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,040
 We've got an airplane, a helicopter.

134
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,760
 Next comes a slide whistle and a cymbal crash.

135
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,960
 And a chicken squawking.

136
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,520
 So I was supposed to be at sea today.

137
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,040
 Because yesterday we were supposed to spend the day in Maine.

138
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,640
 And one of the things that's interesting about Virgin is that they-

139
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:30,880
 Basically when you go to ports that you can't dock at because your ship is too big,

140
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,360
 you have to take boats, little boats from your ship to the shore, right?

141
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:35,760
 Okay.

142
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,040
 Those are called tender boats.

143
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,320
 I prefer dinghies.

144
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,840
 And it was really interesting because I didn't know that.

145
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,960
 And everyone's like, "Oh, are we gonna tender?

146
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,760
 Can we tender tomorrow?

147
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,480
 Are we gonna tender?

148
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,200
 Or how do we tender?"

149
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,400
 And I was like, "What is going on?"

150
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,280
 You didn't know what?

151
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,040
 You didn't understand the lingo, eh?

152
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,960
 I was like, "I brought plenty of gasoline.

153
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,760
 Let's do this."

154
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,000
 Let's rock and roll.

155
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,840
 I'm an open-minded individual.

156
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,440
 I assume my wife is as well.

157
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,960
 But either way, she's not here.

158
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,200
 She wanted me to do it.

159
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,080
 She wanted me to do it tender.

160
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,400
 That's what I know her.

161
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:17,920
 So then we were in Maine and the seas were too rough.

162
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:23,600
 And the current too strong to tender boat from the ship to the shores in Maine.

163
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,240
 Oh, no.

164
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,640
 So that means none of their excursions got to go through.

165
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:28,880
 Right.

166
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,120
 So excursions are over that kind of stuff.

167
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,520
 And then also it meant that for the time being,

168
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,520
 we were just spending the day sitting and looking at the shores of Maine.

169
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,400
 Oh, look, there's Maine.

170
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,120
 Was it kind of rocky even while you were docked?

171
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,000
 No.

172
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,200
 Not too bad.

173
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,440
 Because you're lassoed in pretty tightly.

174
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,280
 Yeah, because it's also more of a current issue

175
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,000
 and currents weren't affecting the anchored gigantic boat.

176
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,920
 Interesting.

177
00:07:53,920 --> 00:08:00,080
 But it's different when you're at sea and you're moving.

178
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,120
 You're like, "Oh, it's a sea day, but we're going."

179
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,640
 It's a different thing when you're at sea day and you're like,

180
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,440
 "We can't go there and we're going to sit here."

181
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:07,680
 Right?

182
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,520
 And bless their hearts.

183
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,000
 I'll say it.

184
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,600
 Bless their hearts over there at Virgin.

185
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,480
 They made some calls and about two hours into everything being canceled,

186
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,840
 they're like, "Hey, we're going to Boston right now."

187
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,200
 So we're supposed to be in Maine, go at sea for a day,

188
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,640
 then be in Boston in the morning.

189
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,560
 And they're like, "Nope.

190
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,760
 We're going to haul ass right now and go to Boston right now."

191
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,960
 And so you're going to have an overnight two-day Boston excursion.

192
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,360
 And so I thought that was pretty heads up on their end.

193
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,240
 It caused chaos.

194
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,740
 Yeah.

195
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,560
 It caused chaos in the entertainment department.

196
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,840
 Being scheduled to the show.

197
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,800
 You got to have shows going.

198
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,440
 If the boat's moving, you got to have shows going, right?

199
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,080
 Well, yeah.

200
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,920
 Also, if we're at sea, your show is a primetime show.

201
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,360
 Right.

202
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,720
 If we're going overnight in Boston, it's the only overnight of the journey.

203
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,640
 Boy, is no one going to your show.

204
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,700
 Right.

205
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,360
 Where did you fall?

206
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,280
 I was not on either way until Monday.

207
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,880
 So I don't have to worry about it, but yeah.

208
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,840
 So I'm off.

209
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:24,400
 Speaking of that, how is your life of leisure going between your one and a half shows a month?

210
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,520
 I'm going fucking nuts.

211
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,880
 Okay.

212
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,560
 So now it's time for you to get a handheld console of some kind.

213
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,920
 That's your next move.

214
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,120
 I don't, I just think, yeah, yeah.

215
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,360
 I'm all caught up on my boom beach of nailing.

216
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,040
 Yeah.

217
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,520
 You got to get a proper game boy or some kind of, yeah.

218
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,000
 Yeah.

219
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,320
 We got to get you a modified game boy.

220
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,480
 That's got like thousands of games on it.

221
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,120
 I watched some weird with Wyatt Russell in it.

222
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,520
 I watched.

223
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,880
 It does sound like a weird Western.

224
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,600
 Wow.

225
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,200
 I'm binging task, which is not a real heart warmer.

226
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,160
 Not really.

227
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,360
 It doesn't really warm the soul.

228
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,480
 Anne and I, Anne and I bounced off of that on the first episode.

229
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,600
 We got 30 minutes in.

230
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,280
 She was like, Nope, I can't do it.

231
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,400
 It's dark.

232
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,440
 Oh, that's how, yeah.

233
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:09,840
 What was that?

234
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,680
 I single part of that show that looked, uh, that interested me enough to even turn it on.

235
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,320
 Well, it was just, it's just so, it's so depressing.

236
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:16,640
 Yes.

237
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,720
 Anne just said straight up, she's like, there's enough happening.

238
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,600
 I don't need more made up depressing.

239
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,240
 I'm good.

240
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,560
 Yeah.

241
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,040
 No, no.

242
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,160
 When you're, when you're living as a little cabin boy with room service,

243
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,560
 looking at, looking at, uh, people living in a total hellscape with no hope is really,

244
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,160
 really makes those eggs taste extra delicious.

245
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:42,480
 Speaking of, uh, Matt, uh, sitting in living as a little cabin boy and other

246
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,760
 people living a hellscape.

247
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,080
 I saw Matt's wife the other night after we got done recording.

248
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,600
 Oh, poor, poor hellscape to say hello.

249
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,040
 This is, this is the hard part, right?

250
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,240
 Like I'm doing four shows in two weeks and my wife is doing, like, uh, she is handling

251
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,600
 the speaker world pride parade.

252
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,280
 Yep.

253
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,280
 She is hosting auditions for, uh, the show girls musical at Troy's theater.

254
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,560
 Uh-huh.

255
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,640
 She is running an afterschool program for the children.

256
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,120
 Uh-huh.

257
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,280
 She is also, uh, uh, basically some sort of manager of the disco show.

258
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,120
 Some sort.

259
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,040
 I don't know her exact position, but she's, she's, she's, she's a,

260
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,280
 she's a managing member of the disco team.

261
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,080
 Sure.

262
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,320
 Sure.

263
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,200
 And, uh, there are people down at absence.

264
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,920
 And so Sarah is filling in for two people and covering everyone's shifts over at absence.

265
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,040
 Uh, right now I'm doing all the shows and getting my boys to soccer practice and band practice.

266
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,880
 And I have to do four shows in 14 days.

267
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,000
 I feel like such an asshole.

268
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,880
 I can't.

269
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:49,120
 I saw her on, I saw her on Wednesday evening and, uh, she comes over, we're chatting and

270
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,080
 somebody, uh, also asked how you were doing and she went, oh, I think he's doing.

271
00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:02,080
 Actually, she looks at me, you saw him this morning. How's he doing?

272
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,520
 I said, he's fine.

273
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,240
 Uh, he's a little stressed about, uh, just sitting in the cabin while you're running life, uh, here.

274
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,640
 And she gave me the biggest eye roll that I have seen come out of.

275
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,520
 Oh, boy.

276
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,040
 I'm familiar.

277
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,120
 Luckily for you though, luckily for you, it was her birthday.

278
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:30,880
 And, uh, show it was on her birthday, but everyone at the show was just coming up to

279
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,200
 her and telling her happy birthday and singing to her. So everybody at the show went really out of

280
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,320
 their way to make sure that your wife had a good birthday evening. I think that was, I think that

281
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,240
 was really good. That was, that was a good ending of the day, especially for Matt Donnelly.

282
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,040
 Who was it? Some of Amy Poehler was interviewing, uh, a woman and she's in that Leo, Leo DiCaprio

283
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,920
 movie that's out right now, Paul Thomas Anderson. Um, who's that lead actor? I forget her name.

284
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,280
 And, uh, she was joking. She was like, you know, every man in their marriage says their

285
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,360
 wife is their best friend. But if you ask the wife of their best friend is they have a list of friends.

286
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:11,520
 She's like, men don't know how to have friends. She's like, well, women have friends.

287
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,560
 And said, good thing that you have this podcast, cause you've got male friends.

288
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:27,280
 My wife was, uh, was showered with, with cards and gifts and people take her out to lunch and all

289
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:35,360
 that stuff. And, uh, I sent some, uh, a vegan dark chocolate, uh, gift baskets from far away.

290
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,840
 Oh yeah. I wanted to thank you for that. That was really good.

291
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,600
 Jacob, it's supposed to go to Sarah. I was so excited about the school mail.

292
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,480
 Man, I wasn't going to mention anything. I saw that dark smudging all around your mouth hole.

293
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,240
 I thought that's probably chocolate, but I don't want to, you know, put him on blast.

294
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:08,960
 It's mostly chocolate. It's 85% chocolate. Jacob have asked, we'll eat at Smith.

295
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,520
 Have asked, we'll eat Brogan. There's your sticker.

296
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:29,280
 Oh my God. I'm straight up delirious today from work. I just, yeah. Yeah. Just work just makes

297
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,040
 me delirious at this point. Is it all Christmas stuff now that you're dealing with? Uh, we're,

298
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,560
 we're about to hit Christmas. Yeah. We were getting, we're getting Christmas scented shit.

299
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:47,200
 Meanwhile, a scented foreshadowing of what's, yeah. Yeah, exactly. We're getting like pine needle,

300
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:56,400
 uh, glade plugins and we're getting fucking, uh, leaves, leaves and autumn soap, hand soap.

301
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:02,320
 Like today, like we got the Christmas scents before we got the autumn scents is weird.

302
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:10,480
 And that doesn't make horse sense. It doesn't make a damn lick of sense, but it does. Oh boy.

303
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:17,680
 So yeah. And then just being up so early today, but then I couldn't sleep today because I had

304
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,800
 stuff to take care of at home. So I haven't got my nap in. So I'm kind of just in that,

305
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:32,720
 and then it's true. Well then right before, right before we record at about a half hour ago,

306
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:41,360
 Anne calls me. She says, Hey, can you look over this resume I put together and do some,

307
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,920
 you know, uh, edit, you know, just edit and copyright or not copy copy editing resume.

308
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,760
 It was a, it was a Tinder resume. So she sent me a resume. And so I really, sorry,

309
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:59,440
 I'm just refilling from my recently refilled vase of drinking water. You've got a fucking

310
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:10,320
 fresh carafe, fresh carafe. Oh my God. Uh, life is tough, man. Cruise life is tough. I've been there

311
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:18,320
 for all the trappings, not for the guilt. I would be loving it. But this is the thing. I

312
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,840
 had the exact same or similar situation, but mine was even crazier because I couldn't get off the

313
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:30,800
 boat for four or five months. Oh yes. So like major life events would happen and I was just stuck.

314
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:37,360
 No, you have, I could only call Anne once a week, sometimes once every two weeks.

315
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,800
 No, there are people that are on here like that for like forever. Right. And so, uh, I heard things

316
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,200
 like, I just get the burger of the day, just experienced something different. I don't care

317
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:54,880
 whether I like it or not. I just get the burger of the day. I was like, Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

318
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:02,640
 I know it's got pear on it. It doesn't sound good, but I'm interested. Some vinegar dipped pear

319
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:09,680
 Gruyere. Oh Jesus. It looks really pretty in the picture. I know it's not going to taste that good,

320
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,640
 but I'm going to try it. He's got something a little different. Barf. Oh, that sounds good.

321
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,920
 So you were, you were tasked with punching up a resume. Yes. I was tasked with, uh, doing a quick,

322
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:27,360
 um, you know, what do you call it? Cop? Not what? Editing, editing? Yeah. Copy, copy, copy. Yeah.

323
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,600
 Doing like copy, editing a resume and then they went and whatnot. And I think I, yeah, copy edit.

324
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,280
 And I did a, uh, I did a bang up job if I say so myself. Yeah. As long as the words copy edit

325
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:43,600
 didn't have to be in there anywhere. Thank God. Thank God. She's not a copy editor.

326
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:52,560
 I barely am, but, uh, you know, I agree Paul. You are barely a copy editor. Yeah, I barely am.

327
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:57,920
 Was it her resume or someone else's resume? No, it was her resume. So yeah. So exciting things.

328
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:04,160
 I was going to say, I was like, inter company. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I don't know if it was

329
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:11,040
 like, uh, everybody keep your fingers crossed for all the applying for the role as ICS host.

330
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,640
 Yeah. She's coming. She's coming on. I would, I would cross my fingers, Paul, but I have so much

331
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:24,960
 to do. I have so much going on. I get it. So I get it. I'll get around to it. Okay. Oh, he's halfway

332
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,960
 there. This is good. This is good. Don't rush yourself. I don't want a rush job happening.

333
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,800
 Not going to, it doesn't mean as much if it's, if it's hurried. You want quality. Yeah. Quality

334
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,600
 finger crossing over quantity finger crossing. But so yeah, I was just doing that right up to the end

335
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:47,040
 and then, uh, you know, shifting the dogs around. Cause I got, I gotta run the giz and, uh, Adora

336
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,680
 warden. So I got to switch them. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. One has to be away while the other gets to

337
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:56,480
 roam free and then back and forth, back and forth. You got to balance yard time. They still don't get

338
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:03,920
 along. No. Oh, I thought it was like, I thought it was like a temporary growth. No, no, no. This

339
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:09,440
 is a forever thing. This is not something that I would be okay with as a pet owner. It's, uh,

340
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:17,040
 it's simply not be okay with some of my pets being like, no, no, fuck you. No. Yeah. It's

341
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:23,120
 agger damn bait. And that's for sure. Uh, either she is on my lap next to, uh, or next to Ann.

342
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:30,080
 Okay. Uh, or she is put away or one of the other one has put away. Uh, but so yeah, I spend

343
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:36,960
 Nope. All the time. No babysitting is making sure gives is there and safe. And then, and then she'll

344
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,520
 start going, because she needs to go out or want some water or whatever. And then I had to go and

345
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,600
 lock up a Dora and then put her out and then take her back and get a Dora back out.

346
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:55,120
 And when Ann's home, you have to put her up too, right? Oh, forget it. They are vinegar and water.

347
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,400
 Just, I think that's right. Is that right? Vinegar, vinegar and water. And also that's

348
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,080
 going to be on the new burger of vinegar and water. It does not sound good, but I mean,

349
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:10,800
 it is going to be on there. It will be something different. And water actually do mix there. I

350
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:18,640
 believe it's oil and water. Oil and vinegar. I don't know. Why not oil and vinegar? It's,

351
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:26,560
 you know, it's the reason these oil spills are a problem is because they don't mix snow and not

352
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:32,480
 snow. That's it. As your copy editor, but I ask if you want to do oil, oil and vinegar instead of

353
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:39,840
 water and vinegar. He doesn't know what copy editors mean. I do though. I do. I just don't

354
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:46,800
 remember what the phrase is right, but it was. Yeah. Oh boy. So yeah. Fingers crossed for

355
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:52,960
 whatever she should. She will crush whatever it is. Yes. Yes. I only, uh, you know,

356
00:20:52,960 --> 00:21:01,200
 shake my head in disbelief anytime she's passed over for anything because fools, fools. They know

357
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:07,440
 not the power of Ann McPheeters. Yeah. That's right. Get shit done. She gets to put Matt and

358
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,120
 I down as references. Okay. I'll do that. I'll do that. I'm sure she'll do that. I'll FaceTime

359
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:19,520
 with whoever wearing this sweatshirt. Oh, I'll be ready. Where, where are the fish head? Uh,

360
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,600
 Ms. McPheeters, we were going to hire you for this. We called one of your references.

361
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,480
 He was sprawled nude on a cruise ship balcony during the entire zoom call that we had with him.

362
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,360
 We couldn't really hear him over the helicopters. Yeah. It was just a lot of helicopter sounds

363
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,120
 and we couldn't tell if it was from an actual helicopter or just the way he was rotating his

364
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,840
 wiener. He was harpooned by someone in a lifeboat to make sure that he jumped.

365
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:50,320
 It seemed effective. It seemed effective. Tender that man.

366
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:58,880
 I'll tell you who else wants to get tendered. And that's the following sponsor. Today's show,

367
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,760
 Matt Madley's ice cream social is, Oh, come on now brought to you by use without the internet.

368
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:11,360
 Come on. Oh, I thought you, I thought you read something, uh, scary. No, no, no, no. What,

369
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:20,400
 what could be going wrong in the world now? Um, well, I have one. Yeah. My, my phone's being a

370
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,840
 Dick one second. Oh yeah. I've got one. Say that one for the next one. Okay. We got one for crazy

371
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:32,000
 Jeff's propeller hats for corgis. That's from street scooper crazy Jeff's propeller hats for

372
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:44,240
 corgis. Hi, my name is crazy Jeff. Uh, I've sell propeller hats for corgis for a long time.

373
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:57,360
 I couldn't maintain a job or a relationship at all because I was crazy and, uh, I just could,

374
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:06,720
 I couldn't get it together for anything except the thought of putting propeller hats on small

375
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:17,280
 Welsh corgi dogs. And I started doing that and they let me know how I got these hats.

376
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,040
 Let me tell you,

377
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:31,120
 my first corgi was a fee. He was slipping farther and farther into that Joker impression.

378
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:38,800
 Well, spoiler, crazy Jeff was eventually going to go totally crazy in that, uh, commercial.

379
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,920
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

380
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,840
 It was definitely, it was going to be a slow burn for sure. For sure. He was, you know, he, you know,

381
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,400
 he was coming off as relatively St. Jeff for a pretty long while. So yeah.

382
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:08,640
 Yeah. So, yep. Uh, I saw, so those show their production shows here on board. Oh good. Oh yeah.

383
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,640
 Those are always a trip. What's, what is the title of one now? This was one's called out of time.

384
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:23,280
 Oh, good. Is that, is that banking on the whole, um, musical musicalization of back to the future?

385
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:29,520
 I see why you would think that Paul, it's actually a, a Jersey boys style musical

386
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,520
 about Huey Lewis and the news. You're close. There you go. Yeah.

387
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:41,840
 You know, I just sat in there on the street, like with my friends,

388
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:49,440
 I didn't want to share that with everybody. So I was like, do I go Italian Huey Lewis or how do I

389
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:59,600
 Lewis? I went Huey Lewis on an arena stage. That's why he's speaking a little slowly and loudly.

390
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:05,360
 Don't take money. Don't take fame. Don't need no credit card to ride on this train. Hey, hey,

391
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:11,760
 you know what I'm saying? It's very sudden. It could be cruel sometimes, but it might just change

392
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:18,240
 your life. They say that all in love is fair. Yeah, but you don't care. You know, Joe Pesci

393
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:24,400
 is also in my musical. Yeah. Well, you know what to do. We didn't get told to you with a little

394
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:30,800
 help from above. You'll feel the power of love. It turns out Joe Pesci knew all musical stars

395
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:39,200
 before they became famous. Joe Pesci is also, he's actually a key component into making Huey Lewis.

396
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,760
 That'd be great. Yeah. Uh, anyway, uh, no. So, uh, Paul, Paul's right. It's a, it's about a time

397
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,960
 machine thing. It's a time machine thing. Ooh. Oh, it is just about a time machine. Yeah. It's

398
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,120
 Raiding the Rock Vault. It's Raiding the Rock Vault. Back when Raiding the Rock Vault was still

399
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:02,640
 conceptual and had a giant Mayan temple. Those of you who don't know, Raiding the Rock Vault

400
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:11,280
 started off as astronauts invading a giant Mayan temple and discovering ancient hieroglyphs of rock

401
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:16,160
 and roll. Federal archaeologists. Yes. They were talking about the federal archaeologists.

402
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:23,680
 That was when they were having auditions and our friend, uh, uh, who was our friend? Uh,

403
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:30,560
 SJ. It's my wife. Brandon. Brandon, uh, got in, um, Brandon. Anyway, someone told me I had to

404
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,920
 audition right away. And I said, I'm in LA with my family. And I said, well, they're only, yeah,

405
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:39,680
 I was in, I was in fucking California at the same time. We were both fucked for the DJ. Yeah. I, uh,

406
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:45,120
 so I flew home to make it to the audition time. And he said, oh, just kidding. I'm not seeing

407
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,520
 anyone else today. And I was like, okay, thanks for having me leave my family in California and

408
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:55,280
 fly home to do this audition. Thanks, buddy. Who had you do that? Uh, our friend, our friend,

409
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,960
 who later on was like, yeah, our friend later on, it was like, Hey, can you get pen and tell it?

410
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,600
 No, not Brandon. Brandon didn't do it. Brandon actually got the gig eventually. Oh, yeah. Okay.

411
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:10,240
 Yeah. No, no, it wasn't Brandon. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Ryan, Ryan. Yeah. Right. Right. Ryan was

412
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,200
 in it for a long time. Right. Had me fly home and said, just kidding. And then, uh, uh, and then

413
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,080
 later on I was like, Hey, can you get pen and tell her to do this thing? And I was like, you know

414
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:27,200
 what? I can't. You know what? No, no, I can't. You know what? Give me, give me, give me 180 bucks

415
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:37,520
 back and maybe we'll talk $180 and some time with my children, which has a price. Let's be honest,

416
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:47,600
 not. It does. It does. It does. I'm sitting in a cabin. The price is here. The price is right.

417
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,000
 Motherfuckers prices. Right. My little golden bottoms glass of water.

418
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:01,280
 That's just there with magic fish, scaring housekeepers, too much, too much rating. The

419
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:07,520
 rock vault is finally closing this year in Las Vegas. Yes. I think, I think, I think just like

420
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,840
 a couple of years past this will be the year we're talking about a lot of shows closing. Uh, but yeah,

421
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:17,520
 my sincere hope touring, but yeah, they're going to, they're going to close at the old hard rock

422
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:23,680
 cafe here in Vegas. Finally, at the end of the year, after I think like 12 years, my sincere hope

423
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:30,960
 for rating the rock vault goes to the old wrestling adage. How can they miss you if you never go away?

424
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:37,200
 And I really think that maybe three years from now, they can come back and really,

425
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:45,040
 well, let's see 20, 28 provided things are still intact. She's shaking out in a certain way. Let's

426
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:52,720
 say 20, 28 maybe. Yeah. Okay. Just as a, just as a arbitrary. Gotcha. Yeah. Okay. I'm not picking

427
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,400
 that date for any specific reason. No, and again, we, we, we, a little Vegas and parking weather,

428
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,880
 they're trying to do a couple of things for some, because you know, so you're like not going to

429
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,120
 charge for parking for locals. Other people are trying to buy deals. And the whole point is just

430
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:11,920
 like, man, Vegas is a town of bold swings. So if you kind of inch back little things and expect it

431
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:19,120
 to have a big impact, you're a fool. Yeah. Uh, Cosmopolitan. I just got an email, uh, about three

432
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:26,160
 minutes ago, uh, a report about Cosmopolitan. They are doing a new special to try to entice, uh,

433
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:32,880
 locals and quote unquote, industry people to come to Cosmopolitan. And what they are doing

434
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:39,200
 is they are offering free parking to these people every single Monday.

435
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:54,160
 Mondays free parking to locals on Monday. When I was in my twenties and Monday was my night off

436
00:29:54,160 --> 00:30:00,080
 after I worked on a Saturday and Sunday, I started a thing with my friends called Monday's the new

437
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:09,280
 Saturday and we would go nuts on Monday nights. I'm not even saying that I won't take advantage of

438
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:16,800
 this ever. I'm just saying it's a dumb promotion. It worked in a very small group of friends in the

439
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:22,480
 nineties and two thousands, uh, uh, early two thousands. I would like you and that group of

440
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,120
 friends to hang out at the Cosmo on Monday nights going forward. Let's see how long they keep this

441
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:32,400
 going. What the Cosmopolitan is missing in this calculation is there need to be industry people

442
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:38,240
 employed in Las Vegas for the discount to apply. And if all the industry people are getting let go,

443
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:48,160
 here's an example of what I think would, uh, would, would be fun. Okay. Free parking and

444
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,880
 free valet again, because it used to be free valet when you first came here. Right. For an entire

445
00:30:52,880 --> 00:31:00,800
 month for an entire, if, if, if all of November, it was just free parking and free valet because

446
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,400
 that would make people I think from Los Angeles and stuff go like, Oh, maybe it'd be fun to just

447
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,960
 roll in there and toss the keys and go into Vegas for a weekend or whatever. Like they might, like

448
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,360
 that would be something that would at least make people go like, Oh shit. You know, like, you know,

449
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,920
 like there you go. Scoop. Jesus has got it. No fee. November. I was going to say no pay November

450
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,560
 November to go along with no nut November as we all celebrate. Of course. Yeah.

451
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,400
 I've been celebrating that in October. I'm getting a jump on it.

452
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:39,920
 That was low hanging fruit. That's why I can't resist touching it. Boy. Yeah. That's a good

453
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:45,040
 idea, Matt. It does need to be a big move, right? There are still a couple of casinos that have

454
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:49,760
 free valet or stupid. It needs to be like, Oh, like, Oh, what? Like it needs to go like, Whoa,

455
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,760
 like it needs to like make people go like, Oh shit, cool. They just back. That's what that's like. So

456
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,720
 like these little inching things of like, Oh, well, you know, we're not charging for this over here.

457
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,360
 We can give this much and maybe that will get enough people in the door to move the needle a

458
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:12,800
 little bit. Yeah. But we won't change too much. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But they won't do it. Well,

459
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:20,960
 I don't want to give away too much production stuff here, but I feel like our dealings with

460
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:28,960
 the Orleans reflected very much sort of the zeitgeist of what's going on in Vegas. And I

461
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:36,000
 see this quoted by local Vegas and Las Vegas locally and, and, uh, uh, you know, some of our

462
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,960
 favorite, uh, Twitter bloggers and whatnot, how, you know, this vicious cycle of, Oh shit,

463
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:50,320
 we're losing money because no one's coming. Let's charge everyone for everything, right? Every little

464
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,360
 thing because everything's that used to be free. Now our, our, our charges, things that used to be

465
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,760
 just considered complimentary. Now our charges, things that we used to be able to make a deal on

466
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,800
 now, we can't negotiate a fucking penny, you know? And then that gets even worse because you start

467
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,880
 to tighten the strings on the people who are actually paying to utilize your space. And then

468
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:15,200
 they don't want to utilize your space. And then it's like, well, yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I wasn't

469
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,960
 listening. What'd you, uh, could you start from the beginning again? So I don't want to give too

470
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,400
 much away here regarding our interactions. Yeah. I was just saying you wasn't talking about the

471
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:31,200
 always the time I think as a whole. So Jacob and I both leaned in and leaned out. Yeah. No, I wasn't,

472
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,040
 I'm not, I didn't want to give too much away. I don't mind telling the audience that we had a

473
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:39,840
 very fucking hard time dealing with the audience this year. Oh yeah. Yeah. No, they were tough

474
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:45,040
 this year. Yeah. And I think, but I mean, I think it's part, not just for us. I talked to other

475
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:50,240
 people that had events there and everyone had exactly the same complaints. And I think it's

476
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,680
 in no small part due to that whole effect of the tightening of belts all the way around and the

477
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:02,640
 rejiggering of employ employees to where people who aren't familiar with their prior roles, you

478
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,200
 know, and if you don't want to give too much away here, but we actually had kind of a hard time

479
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:13,360
 dealing with the Orleans this year. Okay. I don't want to spill all the beans, but this year our

480
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:20,320
 relationship with the Orleans was strained. It was. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But not to give too

481
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:29,360
 much away. Let's keep some cats in the bag here, but let's also say so far as us go into the Orleans,

482
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:37,920
 that was tough this time around. That was a real dick kick. If only there was a free place for me

483
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:47,280
 to park on Mondays, then it would all be better. Then I'd hang out on the strip some more. Yeah.

484
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,560
 And, uh, yeah. And they get a whole casino full of people wearing our robes and fezzes. Good point,

485
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:58,960
 Laurie Elsroth. Like we add ambiance to that. That is a win-win. I mean, I'll tell you who loves

486
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:05,360
 us at the Orleans is our bartenders. The bartenders love us and the production guys love us. Yeah.

487
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:11,360
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But, uh, every day I would check in with the bartenders and be like, how'd you do

488
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:16,880
 today? And the bartenders would be like, fuck me. These scoops are awesome. I'm telling you. Magic.

489
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,560
 There it is. I've seen the bars. Ultimately, those motherfuckers who are working, those are the only

490
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:28,240
 people I care about actually making happy. I do want them to be happy. That is absolutely true.

491
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,280
 And one of the bartenders said it was like, I can't wait for you guys to come back. And we were like,

492
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:38,480
 Ooh. And then he's like, Oh, don't, don't wait in one hand and not shit in the other because

493
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:46,240
 you're going to become a constipated motherfucker. Like one of the bartenders, uh, he had been with

494
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,360
 us, uh, for our two previous shows or our two previous scoops. Oh, really? So he made a point

495
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:57,040
 to get sure to get up here. Uh, I saw you guys on the schedule. I made sure to get up here.

496
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,200
 Yeah. He, he was, he was having a fucking, he remembered it's a good time, right? Yeah. Yeah.

497
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:08,320
 Um, I'll tell you who else remembered that it was a good time. And that's the following sponsor.

498
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,520
 Today's show is brought to you by sweat house, roofing company, hot shingles, just waiting to be

499
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:19,440
 nailed. That's right. Sweat house, roofing company, hot shingles, just waiting to be nailed. That's

500
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:26,240
 right. It's time. You know what time it is time to check your papers for openings and try them to

501
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:33,680
 check your openings for papers. Go ahead and look into class asifieds. That's right. Right

502
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:42,720
 under the asifieds. You're going to find our sweat house, roofing, hot shingles in your area,

503
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:52,560
 ready to be nailed anytime. Yes, indeed. Whether you like it hot or whether you want it wet,

504
00:36:53,520 --> 00:37:00,240
 even if you need it metal, we got you covered. We always got you covered at the sweat house,

505
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:08,400
 roofing company. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. How about a little Colombian tile? If you know what I mean,

506
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:18,720
 huh? Huh? How about some, huh? Do I know what you mean? Do you, do I, do you,

507
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:26,320
 do I? I'm talking about doing drugs and having sex. Oh, okay. That's the secret of our roofing

508
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:36,320
 company. It's actually a front for drugs and sex in a van. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. We'll come

509
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:42,240
 right to your house and fuck you. You can fuck me in my own house. Why do I have to go in that van?

510
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:48,000
 Oh, a van just pulled up in front of my house. Somebody's ringing the doorbell. Hey,

511
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,880
 how's it going neighbor? Your roof looks like it needs some help. Wink, wink, exaggerated wink,

512
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:01,600
 deep, deep exaggerated wink. I'm saying it for the benefit of the listening audience,

513
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:12,720
 but I'm also doing it. Wink, wink, exaggerated wink, innuendo hand sign. Wink, wink. Would you

514
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,440
 like a new roof? Wink, wink, innuendo hand sign. Yes. Oh yeah. No, I would like a new roof. Yes.

515
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:27,360
 Great. Get in my van and take off your clothes and give me your credit card. Oh, I see on it.

516
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:32,960
 Okay. Now you get it. It's a fraud protection thing. Yes. Also, would you like some Colombian

517
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:42,240
 tile? Oh, I know what you mean. Do you? I do. Do you? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I just confused the

518
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,840
 first and now, but you got it right away. Yeah. Yeah, no, it's Colombian tile. Okay. Fair. Yeah.

519
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:54,240
 Enter hate scoops to check out. I guess I'm just slow. You'll get it. First, you get the mortar,

520
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:04,880
 then you get the pestle, then you get the Colombian tile. So is that the order? I don't know.

521
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:11,920
 First, you get the pestle, then you get the mortar. I guess that's probably the better way.

522
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:17,760
 Because how are you going to transport the mortar without the pestle? First, you get the pestle,

523
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:27,200
 then you get the mortar, then you get the tile. Say hello to my little roof. Oh, hi. Wink, wink,

524
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:44,160
 deep, deep wink. Yep. I was watching the time traveling show. There's a time machine. What is

525
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:49,680
 it? What is it? Top of a rack. What is it? It's a microwave sitting on top of a rack that's spray

526
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:58,720
 painted. Wait a minute. Yeah. Do they get inside? Why are you in disbelief here? It's a pushcart,

527
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,440
 and you put stuff in it, and then the screens go all crazy, and then they go to a different time.

528
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:11,840
 And I was laughing because it would just go to 1950 something, and then it was in a diner,

529
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:17,920
 and then they had to get fuel each time they needed to leave. So the different fuel had to

530
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:24,640
 go in the microwave to power the time machine to go to different times. 21 gigawatts and whatnot.

531
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,520
 In the diner, there's this elaborate bit during a dance number to steal a cheeseburger because the

532
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:35,440
 cheeseburger is the fuel needed to go. That was enough fuel. And I was like, it's a diner. Just

533
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,600
 order a cheeseburger. You don't need to steal that one. Just order a burger. What are you doing?

534
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:45,200
 Right. It's a 1950s diner. Your dollar will go really far. And I was laughing because it

535
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,360
 all of a sudden went to 10,000. Spoiler alert for those of you who want to go see the show.

536
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:56,640
 Thank you. But it goes to 10 million BC or something like that, right?

537
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:02,160
 And I was laughing because, yeah, I was laughing because when it went to very far in the past,

538
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,800
 very far in the future, there were people around me that were like, whoa. And I was like, really?

539
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:14,640
 They were in. They were bought in.

540
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,920
 Oh, this is not squirrely.

541
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:23,280
 Well, I mean, 10,000 to get out of this one. Well, this is this is pre humans, right?

542
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:29,680
 I believe so. Yeah, not in this one. No, no. OK. There's some tribal dancing.

543
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,080
 Wait, because because humans have been around. This is the biblical one. 300,000 years.

544
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:40,160
 Yeah, they I didn't write them. I didn't write the years down. Maybe they got it right and I

545
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:46,000
 got it wrong. I don't want to despair. The musical don't come to me for exact dates.

546
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,200
 I don't fucking know. But I mean, I'm a sapiens.

547
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,320
 Scoop Jesus is putting on the chat like I've noticed some plotholes in this cruise ship

548
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:58,080
 jukebox time travel musical. No, I get it. That part's like, no, it's ridiculous. Of course it is.

549
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:05,360
 I was bringing the story to the people just be like, whoa, like it was blowing people away.

550
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:12,080
 I was ready for time travel, but not extreme time travel.

551
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:17,440
 What do they think of next? I don't know. The most logical thing.

552
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,600
 Did they do jungle love? They did not do jungle love, although.

553
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:30,880
 Did they do walk the dinosaur when when it featured tribal people? It did go into more

554
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:38,000
 ethnic and rap songs. Oh, no, no, no. Suddenly it's a Busta Rhymes video.

555
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,160
 Yeah, yeah. I was kind of like, maybe don't maybe don't put those two together like that.

556
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:53,520
 Well, you know what? Kudos to them for really addressing our troubled past.

557
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:59,840
 In the 50s diner, everybody was definitely a lot of races all getting along and everyone

558
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:04,960
 got to sit wherever they wanted. Now, there's a chance I could add some real commentary.

559
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,400
 I don't know what I would like to see on a cruise ship more, a cheesy song and dance

560
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:20,880
 show where they're traveling through time or a show where they really examine all of the problems

561
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:28,000
 in America's racial history. Hey there, Daddy. Oh, where'd you zip in from? I'm from the future.

562
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:35,360
 I'm from the future. I'm from 2026. Wowzers. What's that like? Well, it's not too far off

563
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:42,720
 from the 1950s. All the racism and segregation, but none of the prosperity. Fuck us, right? Yeah.

564
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:50,400
 How'd you build a time machine? God knows. Why don't you want to stay here? I'm ignorant. I'm

565
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,960
 going back to where dinosaurs are because I've got a better chance of making a life for myself

566
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:02,000
 in the time of dinosaurs than I do in my time. You're right. I do want to see the educational

567
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:09,040
 show on the cruise ship. I want to see the exploration. It's Saturday night. I'm going

568
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:16,320
 to go to the Rosa Parks musical. Let's do it. Look, man, I'm a tyrannosaurus Rex, not a

569
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:22,720
 tyrannoracist Rex. Everybody gets along in my time unless you're prey.

570
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:35,520
 But you could still sit anywhere you want in our dino diner. Oh, the diner is still there. Oh,

571
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:40,240
 yeah. Of course. The diner is the through line for the diner show. The dino diner.

572
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:47,520
 It's always been a diner. No matter what time period they go through, it's always a diner.

573
00:44:49,280 --> 00:45:01,600
 This show writes itself. I would love to meet you and Sarah and maybe even Jacob and SJ,

574
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:07,200
 honestly, all of us. I think it'd be really fun to take a swing at trying to come up with a cruise

575
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:13,600
 ship show that we could put together. A jukebox musical for cruise ships. I think we could fucking

576
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:18,240
 crush it. That might be the next episode of this show. We could just be us coming up with one.

577
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:23,520
 Seriously, we could crush one. The four of us all together with all the experience we've had on both

578
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,960
 sides. Jacob could come at it with the tech stuff, and we could come at it from a writing

579
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,080
 perspective, and you can come at it from a performance perspective. We could make something

580
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:39,600
 really interesting, I think. All right. We're going to stop doing this podcast. From now on,

581
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:47,120
 we're just writing cruise ship musicals. Step three, profit. All you need is one. All you need

582
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:54,720
 is one. It'll play forever. You have these young people who are crazy talented. You have to do so

583
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:00,160
 many dance numbers and sing so many songs to get on these things. They have their songbook and they

584
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:07,760
 can kick ass choreography. Then you put them in these musicals that are so strange, where every

585
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:16,400
 costume's a million dollars. I was going to showcase myself, but instead of playing a

586
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:24,000
 secret spy scientist wearing a dinosaur tail. That's where I'm doing. That's where I'm living

587
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:33,120
 my life, my best life right now. That's where the money is. Yeah. It was fun. It was certainly

588
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:38,800
 worth seeing. Did they go to the far-flung future eventually, too? Yes. They went back before the

589
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:47,760
 big bang. No lightsabers. What indicated future? When they were hanging out before the big bang,

590
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,080
 I was like, where are you hanging out and where are you standing? Where were they? They went to

591
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:59,280
 before the big bang. They went to before the big bang. Now, wait a minute. They said that was before

592
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,480
 the big bang. That's where they had some real soul searching, Paul. That's where they really

593
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,560
 started to discover who they were and their feelings for each other. Well, it's because they

594
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:12,160
 didn't have any lights. They just went to pitch black. They're like, oh, this is before the big

595
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:18,240
 bang. All matter was condensed into one tiny particle. I was like, how was our sound traveling

596
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:25,920
 from my mouth to your ears before the big bang? Again, I don't want to poke holes in a cruise ship

597
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:38,400
 musical. I was curious about it. There's so much happening here before the big bang.

598
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:54,400
 A really great image of dinosaurs dressed up like line cooks. Pretty great.

599
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,360
 I'm just thinking of different scenes that you can do before the big bang.

600
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:09,600
 Well, the diner, it's sort of like Hitchhiker's Guide, the diner at the end of the universe,

601
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:18,160
 right? Yeah. There you go. Yep. How is this diner even here? Who knows? Before the big bang.

602
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:24,240
 Who the fuck knows? We're all just hash browns. Can I get some pancakes? Not before the big bang.

603
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:35,280
 They don't exist yet. We don't even have moons over Miami because there are no moons. Hey,

604
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:45,520
 how are Miami? How about Miami? Welcome to Miami. Benvenido. How about the Giants beat the Eagles

605
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:51,440
 last night in football? That was pretty fun. That was pretty fun. What happened? Giants beat the

606
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:57,200
 Eagles with Jackson Dart. The New York Giants looked like the best team in the football league.

607
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:03,280
 That's what happened. I only bring this up because Jackson Dart absolutely is the

608
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:13,200
 boyfriend of the daughter from Landman. I was watching him at a press conference. I was like,

609
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:18,960
 oh my God, it's just the boyfriend from the show Landman, the high school football player.

610
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:28,800
 Oh yeah. He's totally the same guy. Paul went away, but Paul... I'm here. He wears like a black

611
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:36,160
 splotch on his cheek. Yeah, he doesn't do the black face paint below both eyes. He just does

612
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:42,800
 like a big splotch below one eye. He does it because it's a tribute to Anakin Skywalker.

613
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:53,040
 Is it really? It is. He was playing in high school and he was inspired by Anakin Skywalker

614
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,880
 and then put a little black splotch on his cheek and it looked pretty cool. So that became his

615
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:03,200
 thing from then on. It was so funny because Herb Street and Al Michaels... Al Michaels is

616
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:08,640
 like almost 80 years old. He's done all the greatest kids, called the miracle of ice in

617
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:15,440
 the 1980 Olympics. Herb Street's like, of course, it's a Star Wars reference. Mike, you want to take

618
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:22,480
 it from here? Al Michaels goes, "Al, you want to take it from here?" He goes, "No, no, no.

619
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,360
 I love me some Star Wars, but no, you go ahead, Kurt. You break it down for the audience."

620
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:33,360
 Al Michaels was like, "Do not make me talk about Star Wars." He just went, "Nope."

621
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:39,760
 Wow. Well, I mean, that generation, they really did love the prequels.

622
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:46,480
 It was very impactful for them. That was their big movie going experience. I got to say Hayden

623
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:52,160
 Christensen was doing a lot of heavy lifting. He tried with that shit script that he had.

624
00:50:52,160 --> 00:51:00,400
 Props to him, but I guess the blotch is to indicate when he got burned up in the...

625
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:08,480
 Yeah. Oh, it's the scar. It's the scar. Okay. Now I see. I thought it was just on his cheek. Oh,

626
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,120
 no, it's the scar. Okay. Okay. Yeah. He's like blacked out one eye. Yeah. He gets a scar.

627
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:18,880
 Okay. Well, he's a handsome little Hayden Christensen looking dude himself.

628
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:26,080
 He really is. He is a gorgeous man. The quarterback of the New York professional football team

629
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:33,520
 is very attractive and is going to do just fine in his life. Yeah. I bet you he's going to be

630
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:38,240
 okay. He's going to have some really nice Star Wars memorabilia. I'll bet he already has some

631
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:44,400
 really nice Star Wars memorabilia. New York transfer, not known for their looks. Eli was

632
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:51,120
 never... You hold your tongue, Eli Manning. Apparently he did. He often would sit on the

633
00:51:51,120 --> 00:52:00,880
 sideline and just hold his tongue. He's not a smart man. I'm Eli Manning. I throw ball. I make

634
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:10,320
 touchdown go happen. I hold tongue. Hey, I hold tongue. Hey, sideline man, you hold tongue for a

635
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:17,040
 minute and make phone call. I can hold that for you. Thank you. Make phone call while someone else

636
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:24,560
 hold tongue. Hello. This is Eli Manning calling from Eli Manning's phone. Not since Paulman that

637
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:32,640
 he's done such an accurate impression of a person. A large cheese. That's right. Deliver it to Eli

638
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:44,160
 Manning, please. Good night. Well, that went good. I expect to eat pizza later. I'll hold tongue now.

639
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:56,080
 Thank you. Yeah. So. Yeah. Eli Manning holds on tongue. That was about how good looking Jackson

640
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:06,160
 Darn was. That's all. Let's do some Scoop Mail. Message for you, sir. We got one here from Bus

641
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:12,000
 Driver Scoop. Dear Matt, Paul, Jacob, and the entire Scoop community, how does an introverted

642
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:18,000
 extrovert that is unbelievably damaged mentally by life express how incredibly loved and accepted

643
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,480
 they felt at their first Scoop Fest? Oh, how does said person express the amount of confidence and

644
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:27,840
 self-worth they obtained simply by being in the presence of this community for four days?

645
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:32,960
 I really do not know where to begin with the thanks, the hugs, the heartfelt face fuckings.

646
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,880
 I really can't find the right words to tell each and every single person that I crossed paths with

647
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:42,240
 that you are amazing. And I am infinitely grateful not only for your existence, but also for you,

648
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:48,560
 for your acceptance into this spectacular group of humans. Thank you from the bottom of my heart

649
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:54,640
 for being all that you are. Love and licks. That's Tracy, the Bus Driver Scoop. Oh, yeah.

650
00:53:54,640 --> 00:54:03,600
 Whatever. That's a bad prank. This is like that. This is wonderful. This is wonderful. Yeah. Yeah.

651
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:09,760
 We got to pass that on to JD for yet another Scoop confessional. Or maybe it made it into

652
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,280
 a Scoop confessional we didn't even see. Oh, yeah. I don't know. We aren't privy to any of that. We

653
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:20,000
 don't know. No. I hope to see them at some point. We got one from Masshole Scoop. Dear gentlemen,

654
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:27,840
 in episode 1244, you guys discussed the song Darling Nikki by Prince. The first time my mother

655
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:35,120
 ever heard that song was in April of 1985. I had been born in March of 1985. My name is Nikki.

656
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:40,080
 Jacob gave a good rundown of the song on that episode. But for context, the very first lyrics

657
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:46,720
 are I knew a girl named Nikki. I guess you could say that she was a sex fiend. I met her in a hotel

658
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:53,760
 lobby masturbating with a magazine. My poor mother was completely horrified. She said that if she had

659
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:58,960
 just heard that song a month earlier, there is no way in hell that she would have named her baby

660
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:04,480
 Nikki. My name would have been Sarah. And that would have been weird. So I'm glad it all worked

661
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:12,560
 out. You're right. People named Sarah are weird. In the same episode, Matt talked about the band

662
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:20,400
 G love and special sauce. Oh, yeah. Coincidentally, they also have a song that references a girl named

663
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:26,480
 Nikki performing sex acts on the singer. It's called kick drum. And it's actually a really good

664
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:31,840
 song. It is a good face. That's a mass hole scoop. Who is a brand? That's a brand new scoop name.

665
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:39,760
 Oh, fantastic. Yeah. Thank you. Mass hole scoop. So that's another question for the ages. And I'd

666
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:49,360
 love to get the popular opinion. Matt, Jacob, what is your take on Nikki's actual physical situation

667
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:55,840
 during this scenario? Is she reading and perusing a magazine and diddlin the beam?

668
00:55:55,840 --> 00:56:02,560
 Or is she rolling up the magazine to some sort of phallus and inserting it?

669
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:07,200
 You know, Paul, they're by masturbating with a magazine.

670
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:12,320
 I have to thank you, Paul, because I thought I was going to have to ask that question.

671
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:18,720
 And so thank you. Thank you for being one of the eternal burning questions.

672
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:24,480
 Nikki actually doing with that magazine option B is eternally burning. That's for sure.

673
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:32,400
 And then ML Kennedy says the magazine was also masturbating, right? That's another reading on

674
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:39,680
 it. It could have been joining in on the magazine's master magazine. There's masturbating.

675
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:45,120
 I think Prince forgot the word for reading and replace it with masturbation.

676
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:53,200
 Do you think he just did a search and replace? He forgot the word for reading.

677
00:56:53,200 --> 00:57:04,400
 Better than a hotel lobby reading a magazine.

678
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:10,640
 I wonder what that word means. I don't know. Let's replace it with masturbating.

679
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:18,240
 Reading too few syllables doesn't work. Linguistically, he knew what would shove

680
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:27,040
 that magazine back up your hoo-ha and get back to writing. Also, you would hope that that's a

681
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:36,880
 very glossy tome because if it's just straight newsprint, he's going to disintegrate. You're

682
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:43,760
 basically, she's going to have a paper machine. Check your openings for paper.

683
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:58,240
 Well, luckily it wasn't glossy magazine. When you read the lighter notes, it said,

684
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:04,320
 do not try this at home. Do not utilize lighter notes for hoo-ha insertion.

685
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:09,040
 When I read the lighter notes, they were all smudged from being in my hoo-ha.

686
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:18,960
 We got one from Trav. Hi, I have over a decade of professional experience in kitchens,

687
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:23,680
 not to mention my continued learning and growth in the 20 plus years of my adult life

688
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:29,040
 that I haven't gotten paid for cooking. I say this to only say, unfortunately,

689
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:36,000
 Paul is right about microwaving hot dogs. He's an absolute potato when it comes to

690
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,360
 microwaving bratwurst though. You see, cooking a hot dog just involves warming it up. Most of them,

691
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:45,200
 you can eat it raw. For the most part, they're cured and fully cooked. Therefore, the only thing

692
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:49,760
 that needs to be done is to make it hot to be tastier. The traditional method for a ballpark

693
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,520
 hot dog is boiling. Cooking a hot dog in a microwave is essentially the same thing. It's

694
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:58,400
 akin to steaming. As long as you don't overdo it, a microwave hot dog is perfectly acceptable.

695
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:04,640
 One could argue even efficient. I'm not saying you microwave the bun. Never microwave bread.

696
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:09,440
 It makes it tough. Now, there could be arguments that grilling a hot dog adds more flavor and a

697
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:15,040
 bit of texture. That's not wrong, but that doesn't make a microwaved hot dog unpalatable. It just

698
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:20,640
 makes those options better. Let's not pretend that a hot dog is some culinary masterpiece.

699
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:25,360
 It is a way to dress up the leftovers and sell some cheap ass shit. Love y'all. Fuck you in

700
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:38,080
 the face. That's Trav, AKA I-D-H-A-S-N. It hasn't. I don't know. I appreciate that, Trav. Thank you

701
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:43,520
 for coming to my defense. Yes, I agree. Well, he did say that you're a potato for microwaving

702
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:52,320
 bratwurst. Look, I did it once. Okay. I've learned my lesson. Potato. Yeah. It's just a convenience

703
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:56,880
 thing. Yeah. Tell that to my intestines. The science is tight on this. It does not.

704
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:03,920
 It's not the same. The science is out.

705
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:11,680
 And we got one here from Robert. Hi folks. Loved episode 1227. Rob's story about his

706
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:17,600
 heroin neighbors reminded me of our old family friend, Tim. He was about 60 at the time and this

707
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:24,080
 took place back in the '80s, back in Poughkeepsie, New York. Every fall, Tim would wander into our

708
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:33,840
 woods and collect giant "basketball mushrooms." Not a nickname. They were literally the size of

709
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:39,600
 basketballs. My gosh. He had the foraging know-how to tell the good from the deadly and had sliced

710
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:44,960
 them like bread and fry them up. Said they were delicious. We weren't brave enough to find out for

711
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:51,440
 ourselves. Then one year, Tim just stopped showing up. He was dirt poor and had no phone. So we had

712
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:58,240
 no way to check on it. Our best guest, he finally grabbed the wrong mushroom and joined the network

713
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:07,840
 in the sky. Years later, surprise, Tim reappears. Turns out he had gone to prison. He did what?

714
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:15,040
 He went to prison. He did what? There's no expanding thing on this. He just went to prison.

715
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:21,120
 For mushroom thieving? Who knows? I like to think it was for mushroom thieving.

716
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:25,920
 Fast forward, he's turned things around, got a place, even a phone. He calls my grandfather

717
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:33,120
 and asks if I, the family's designated pre-teen tech wizard, can help him set up a fax machine.

718
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:41,120
 Grandpa and I head to his sketchy apartment in one of Poughkeepsie's less than great neighborhoods.

719
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:46,880
 I plug in the brand new fax machine and ask if he has anyone to fax or someone who might fax him.

720
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:54,160
 Then we spend 20 minutes explaining what a fax machine actually does. He seems surprised by the

721
01:01:54,160 --> 01:02:01,600
 concept. Then he says, "Thanks for coming over. I got something for you." He leads us into the kitchen

722
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:10,960
 and there, stacked like techno Jenga, are 50 brand new fax machines. I decline. No thanks.

723
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:16,160
 I don't need one either. Tim nods, "You're right. I've got something better for a kid."

724
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:24,560
 Into the bedroom we go, and now there's a stack of 50 boom boxes. Brand new. Shrink wrap still on.

725
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:30,080
 I shoot grandpa a look. Grandpa just shrugs. We both left with a boom box. Mine drains deep

726
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:35,120
 batteries like it owed the Energizer Bunny money. Baby. That is from Robert.

727
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:44,240
 That's amazing. I tell you, the best not stolen boom boxes in the '80s still drained those fucking

728
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:49,520
 deep batteries like they were going out of style. Yeah, it was crazy. You could not run them on

729
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:55,520
 batteries for very long. You get like five or six good hours tops. Yeah, tops. Yeah, it's a shame

730
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:59,440
 Tim had to go to jail for a little while. He was always such a fun guy. Yeah, I wonder why.

731
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:06,400
 Well, I asked him, I asked him if it was for stealing mushrooms. He said, "More or less."

732
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:11,360
 You can't get a straight answer from that cat.

733
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:16,080
 It's time for Jog vs. Nerd.

734
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:42,080
 Ladies and gentlemen, it is time. Time for Jog vs. Nerd.

735
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:52,960
 We got a scoop coming to us today from the OG Scoop. The categories are brands in song,

736
01:03:52,960 --> 01:04:02,480
 Nurb words, noun verb. Oh yeah. Noun verb words, I guess. Homophones five and before and after.

737
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:07,040
 Matt, you're up first. What do you want? Oh boy. I'll take homophones five.

738
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:12,640
 Look at all the pretty flowers all in neat lines.

739
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:22,720
 Wow, he's pretty flat. Oh, rose. Rose and rose. Rose. Yeah, rose, rose. Yep. Rose,

740
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:28,560
 rose, rose. They grows gently. That's me. I'll try Nurb words, noun verb for 200.

741
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:35,200
 A cleaning chore where what you are doing is removing something that is known by the same name.

742
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:49,280
 Oh, to dust, like dusting. Yeah, dust. There you go. Yeah. All right. I got it now.

743
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:55,440
 We're all on board. I'll try. Now we know what these categories are. Brands in song, please.

744
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:00,480
 For 200, what gas company is mentioned in Bruce Springsteen's Jungle Land?

745
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:12,800
 Oh, shit. I'll pass because I don't know. Matt. God, that song is long for me to go through all

746
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:19,680
 the lyrics in my head. Is it Shell or something? It's like a jungle land out here at the Texaco

747
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:25,440
 station. Is it like people's gas like we have out here for our natural gas? Is that what it is?

748
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:32,000
 No. It's the people's gas. It is the people's gas. For time, I'll just pass. Dwayne Johnson came

749
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:42,480
 right to my house and said, if you smell rotten eggs, evacuate your home. I'm passing. Exxon.

750
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:48,320
 They'll meet neat that giant Exxon side that brings this fair city lights. Yep. Yep. There it is.

751
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:58,400
 Matt tried to get your Springsteen song in there. I know he's always looking out for me before and

752
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:09,840
 after. For 200, Daily Double. All of it, Jacob. All of it. NCAA Basketball Tournament with Frankie

753
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:21,520
 Valley. The Final Four Seasons. Of course. Final Four Seasons. Our good buddy Noah was just on that

754
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:38,800
 tour. That's right. Your good buddy. The Final Four Seasons. Take a bet. Let's see. I'll go back to

755
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:46,160
 Brands and Song for 400. What car manufacturer is mentioned in the song American Pie by Don McLean?

756
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:50,960
 Okay, so the Springsteen song was too long for Matt to go through all the lyrics. I'm just going

757
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,960
 to go through American Pie real quick. This comes up pretty quick in the chorus.

758
01:06:54,960 --> 01:07:04,160
 Excuse me. Oh, Chevy. Yeah. Yeah. I wasn't going to make you go through that whole

759
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:12,480
 fucking thing. Long, long time ago. Time ago? No. Galaxy far away. Naboola's under attack. Galaxy.

760
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:19,360
 Ford. I thought me and Qui-Gon Jinn could finally talk the Federation into maybe cutting them a

761
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:29,600
 little slack. Let's go to Brands and Song again. I like it. For 600. What camera company is mentioned

762
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:38,880
 in Haya by Outkast? Polaroid. Polaroid. Picture. Shake it like a Polaroid Nakia. I still feel like

763
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:47,280
 that song is new-ish to me. Yeah, it's not. I know it's not. And that reference was old when he made

764
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:52,240
 that reference. Yes. Yes. People were like, what? What is he talking about? And we were all like,

765
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:56,400
 Polaroid. Polaroid cameras were already gone by that time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, they're out

766
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:01,200
 there still, but yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But now it's like, really, they're gone, gone. Now they're

767
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:05,280
 just a Lego set. Oh, that reminds me. We talked about doing a Polaroid camera thing for ScoopFest.

768
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:09,520
 I'm just now remembering that. I'm going to order some Polaroid cameras for ScoopFest.

769
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:16,000
 Fuck you guys. I for one vetoed that shit. That's true. Matt, you're up. That's why I'm not going

770
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:26,000
 back to the Orleans next year. I'll do before and after 400, please. The Boss and Blondie combined

771
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:38,240
 these 75 and 78 tunes. Awesome. Blondie. So this is a coming and going thing? Yeah, yeah.

772
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:49,280
 75 and 78. Heart of Glass. Springsteen have something with Rapture at the end of it.

773
01:08:52,160 --> 01:09:01,600
 Oh, shoot. I'll pass. That passes to me. I'm passing too, Paul. I feel like this is going

774
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:08,720
 to be very simple once we finally see the answer. I think you have to know the Springsteen song.

775
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:13,600
 Oh no, that's the trick with these questions is you do have to know them.

776
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:21,520
 Yeah, it's the entire trick with the questions. I'll pass. I'll pass. All right.

777
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:30,080
 She's the one way or another. She's the one way or another. That's a good one. Yep. That is a good

778
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:37,120
 one. I'll try. I'll close up Brands and Songs for 800. What technology company is mentioned in Mr.

779
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:55,920
 Roboto by Styx? Accio. Hmm. I don't know. I don't know. I'll pass. Paul. IBM. IBM. Oh,

780
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:04,320
 my heart is human. My blood is boiling. My brain, IBM. My brain, IBM. Yes. Good job. Paul. I ate a

781
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:15,840
 sandwich. I am a robot. I have IBS. Let's go with the NURBOARD's noun verb. Make the connection.

782
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:31,920
 Ollie and cardboard. They're both boxers. Boxing. Okay. Boxing. The box. Yeah, yeah.

783
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:42,000
 Paul, our math. Before and after. 600, please. Daily double. All of it, Jacob. All of it.

784
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:54,800
 Rowling magical novel with a new character, a stunning wrestler. Oh, I mean, Harry Potter.

785
01:10:54,800 --> 01:11:03,520
 Who's the stunning? I got it. Who's the stunning wrestler? Would I know the stunning wrestler,

786
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:13,200
 Paul? Yeah. Who does the stunner? That's his move. I don't know. Most of the administration has

787
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:20,800
 suffered at the hands of this wrestler, a stunner. Like a good, like over 50% of the administration.

788
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:26,640
 There was a great picture that came out last week of what's his name. The guy who, one of the guys

789
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:33,840
 who runs WWE now. Triple H. Yeah. Triple H. Yeah. Him and his wife, who's Vince McMahon's daughter.

790
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:39,200
 Yeah. And her mom, Linda McMahon, who's the secretary of whatever it is in the Trump

791
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:44,000
 administration right now. Yeah. Yeah. And the thing went out and was like Stone Cold Steve

792
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:49,760
 Austin has stunned all the people in this picture. Oh, who? Who, Jacob? Stone Cold Steve Austin.

793
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:55,680
 Oh, right. I forgot we were talking about that. For the record, I still don't know the answer to

794
01:11:55,680 --> 01:12:06,000
 this question. You got it. It's Harry Potter and I don't know the stone. I don't know the stone.

795
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,080
 It's a Daily Double, so I guess I'm going to say. It's a Daily Double, Paul. So I'll also say Harry

796
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:17,120
 Potter and the Stone Cold Steve Austin. Let's try it. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer Stone Cold

797
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:23,040
 Steve Austin. There you go. So close. Wow. In my defense, I got 80% of the words. Yeah.

798
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:28,640
 You stunned 80% of it. You did. I'm kidding. Go ahead and mark me right.

799
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:38,640
 It's me. I'll try noun, noun word or nerve, nerve words, noun verb, securing a box for shipping.

800
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:50,400
 Securing a box for shipping. Closing it. Oh, tape, tape. Yeah. Yeah, there you go. Paul.

801
01:12:54,480 --> 01:13:00,000
 I'll do homophones for 400. Upgrading the offering table.

802
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:09,680
 Upgrading the offering table. Let's see. Let's see. Oh, altering the altar.

803
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:14,720
 Alter the altar. Alter the altar. Oh, there you go. Alter, alter. Well done.

804
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:25,360
 Matt, you're up. I will not have gotten that one. I will do before and after 800. A Bond theme song

805
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:34,400
 plays as John McClane kicks ass in this movie. Live and Let Die Hard. There it is. Oh, live and

806
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:46,400
 let die hard, of course. Yippee-ki-yay. I'll close out nerve words for 800. Sometimes on a wall or

807
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:53,920
 used to beautify something hung on the wall. Sometimes on a wall or used to beautify something

808
01:13:53,920 --> 01:14:04,960
 hung on the wall. Picture. You could picture a picture. I'll try picture. I'll paint.

809
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:10,400
 You could paint a picture. That was a stretch, I think. Paul.

810
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:24,800
 So was picture in fairness. Homophones for 600. A rough path. A rough path. A rough path.

811
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:41,920
 Trial and trail. Are they spelled the same? No. No. They're not. So it can't be a trial trail.

812
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:46,480
 You did make me spell both of them in my head though to answer that question. Yeah, right. I know.

813
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:57,920
 I had to too. Rough path. I don't know, but there was only one set of footprints. A road road.

814
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:06,240
 A road road. No, I'm sorry. It's a course course. Course, course. A course, course, course, course,

815
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:13,680
 course, course, course. And we got homophones for 800. Matt closing out the category and the game.

816
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:17,920
 I think it's the other daily double, right? No, he already got both of those.

817
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:22,800
 Oh, if I get this, I'm in second place. And if I pass, I'm in second place.

818
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,880
 Right. I will take them all, but not that one.

819
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:38,320
 This is homophones? This is homophones, yeah. I will take them all, but not that one.

820
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:45,280
 Oh, I think I've got a guess. I don't know if it's it though. I don't feel super confident.

821
01:15:50,320 --> 01:16:08,240
 I will take them all. They're not the best I've ever had. Not even close. Something like the lot.

822
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:14,960
 Not that one. I just don't know. I'm going to pass.

823
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:21,120
 It passes to me. I'm going to, I'm going to try for second place here. I think it's except, except.

824
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:31,440
 Yes. Look at you. I couldn't think of a good way to give a hint on that one. That is the game.

825
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:37,280
 Paul wins with 1600. I'm in second. Thanks to accept, accept with 1200. Matt's in third with

826
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:44,080
 600. That's from the OG scoop. Thank you. Thank you. That was great. I'm only very good at the

827
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:51,040
 before and afters and I didn't get any of them or maybe one of them. Good job, OG. Good job, OG.

836
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:39,600
 Smith. It says remember your password. I can't tell what my hat says. What's my hat say in that

 picture, Paul? It says eat ass, suck a dick, and sell drugs. And your mouth has a suspicious stain

838
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:52,560
 around it. Are you eating my wife's chocolate? It's suspicious to you, maybe. Yeah, it's clearly just

839
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:56,800
 chocolate. You ate my wife's chocolate. That's amazing work. It's chocolate mayonnaise. Amazing
