**[0:01:31]** Can they get this by like sharing a water trough and shit? Is that how bad it can be?

**[0:01:36]** That how viral it is. Where's Nick Newman when we need him

**[0:01:40]** I was looking for him in the chat before we started. He's not in. Let's see

**[0:01:44]** No confirmed cases were reported reported in Nevada, but there is a significant equine

**[0:01:50]** Herpes virus outbreak affecting horse events nationwide causing major major disruptions cancellations

**[0:01:57]** like the all-in barrel race and

**[0:02:01]** It heightened biosecurity at the NFR rodeo, which is the one in Vegas here during early December

**[0:02:08]** So a lot of people just didn't bring their horses

**[0:02:11]** A lot of people just just left their animals at home and came to the rodeo

**[0:02:14]** Apparently the rodeo was really affected by it

**[0:02:17]** Paul says Paul Paul's Paul is right. Let's do it

**[0:02:21]** Okay, primarily directed through contact nose-to-nose or indirectly from shared items like tack buckets clothing

**[0:02:28]** even people's hands

**[0:02:31]** Oh aerosol droplets or contact infected with fluids man. It's amazing how we all don't have horse herpes. This is everything

**[0:02:38]** I'm already looking up if it can go to

**[0:02:41]** People no, it's not a zoonotic jumper. Please fuck no

**[0:02:47]** I don't want horse herpes if I

**[0:02:51]** Know our next humans cannot get infected with horse herpes. Don't worry about it. Keep on fucking those horses

**[0:02:58]** Keep on a horse a fucking use a stepstool safety first people safety first. That's right. Oh good Lord

**[0:03:06]** Yeah, just be out there hoofing it. Mr. Hands has nothing to worry about

**[0:03:11]** There'll be more horse herpy stuff in the new Taylor Sheridan show about the rodeo

**[0:03:21]** It'll be called it'll be called bull rider long dick man

**[0:03:32]** Speech guy Sheridan's running out of good names bull rider long dick man speech guy

**[0:03:38]** You know

**[0:03:39]** You know what? You know what to say about riding bulls?

**[0:03:43]** What's that a lot of times people think it's all about those eight seconds. You got to stay on the bull

**[0:03:49]** Those eight seconds. Those are the least important seconds of the whole thing

**[0:03:54]** The most important time is when you enter the pen

**[0:03:59]** My secret

**[0:04:01]** Give that bull a little light touch behind the ear. I

**[0:04:08]** See cold on my finger and I give him a little rub right behind the ear with icy cold I

**[0:04:16]** See hot and that's what he's what he's recording. What are you quoting? I'm making up a dumb

**[0:04:22]** Speech that he would do for this

**[0:04:25]** Rodeo, I thought you were quoting something but you're doing

**[0:04:28]** I'm improvising Matt. That's what I do. No, no, I don't mean I didn't mean to be that much of a dick about it

**[0:04:38]** You didn't make me feel liberal guilt, that's why I didn't think it was a Sheridan speech

**[0:04:45]** Also to be fair I don't I don't watch you don't watch so I don't know enough of

**[0:04:52]** Okay, so now I know where to go to go with it. Yes

**[0:04:56]** I rub a little bit behind there and then when that bull knocks me off

**[0:05:00]** After eight seconds if I stay on there for more than eight seconds

**[0:05:04]** Bulls outlived its life and that bull is gonna become your quesa frajita over at Chili's next week

**[0:05:11]** But you can't look at that bull and realize that's my case of frajita coming to me

**[0:05:16]** You look at that bull thing. What a noble beautiful animal and all I see is the

**[0:05:22]** 999 dinner for two special at Chili's

**[0:05:26]** You fucking limp tarred

**[0:05:31]** Enter share it at checkout

**[0:05:34]** That closer is that more like yes, I don't close pretty close. That's much closer. What a dick

**[0:05:39]** You're gonna watch any of those shows

**[0:05:41]** You would hate them Paul. I know I

**[0:05:49]** Know there was a thing it was a yellow stone like last year the yellow stone

**[0:05:52]** there was this character a PIP like a hippie who got arrested, but he became like a like a girlfriend of

**[0:06:01]** Kevin Costner, but like in this like pseudo we don't like each other, but we do kind of thing

**[0:06:05]** Oh, yeah, yeah, and her job. The last season was just to get lectured by every cast member a different aspect of Montana society

**[0:06:15]** It's a good gig if you can get it and at one point this one character

**[0:06:18]** Who's a Native American who's already was already feeling guilt about marrying into a Montana family that like, you know

**[0:06:23]** It's against her Native American, you know, whatever she lectured her and I was like Jesus

**[0:06:28]** I was like everyone's breaking character just to lecture libs

**[0:06:33]** Once we torched this lib girl we can go back to fighting about real things between our cultures

**[0:06:37]** But in the meantime the enemy of my enemy is my friend

**[0:06:42]** And

**[0:06:43]** There's a plot point happening in land made right now and I and I and I and I feel crazy

**[0:06:48]** Only because like in season one this person got a payout from the oil company like a wrongful death suit

**[0:06:52]** Okay, this couple this whole season this whole season

**[0:06:55]** They're fighting over money and I'm like weren't you paying a shitload of money from an oil company?

**[0:06:59]** Why isn't that coming up in conversation? Why is it coming up?

**[0:07:03]** You're paid out

**[0:07:05]** a large plot point last season about the large plot point that's happening right now in mayor of Kingston, which I watch right now like

**[0:07:12]** Like the pilot episode is that?

**[0:07:17]** What's his name the guy got ran over by a snow blower in real life. Oh

**[0:07:21]** Hawkeye Hawkeye. Yeah. Yeah. Yes

**[0:07:23]** So that guy he has it becoming his brother's job because his brother gets killed in a botched robbery, right?

**[0:07:29]** And they went through like four seasons were like man. We haven't brought him up in a while

**[0:07:33]** So the last episode that they bring up his dead brother like six times

**[0:07:38]** So go they're really making up for the lost lost bit there Jeremy Renner Jeremy Renner is who I'm thinking of yeah

**[0:07:45]** Yeah, it's hard

**[0:07:48]** It's hard. He's it is

**[0:07:50]** He's a fucking

**[0:07:51]** Yeah, okay, you talk about somebody coming away with the wrong life lessons after a near-death experience

**[0:08:02]** Yeah, oh

**[0:08:03]** Oh, he's just kind of doubled down on his asshole or he's a bit of a shit bird. Okay. Yeah, I

**[0:08:10]** How I don't know I I like Jeremy Renner a lot

**[0:08:13]** Not a lot. I like Jeremy Renner. I'd fuck him. He's gonna break your heart Matt. He

**[0:08:20]** It's probably true

**[0:08:22]** but he like

**[0:08:24]** like

**[0:08:25]** Survived unlike like he and his brother were like split like a box like doughnut holes when they were like dirt poor

**[0:08:32]** Okay, they got by in Hollywood by like buying and flipping a house and then flipping that in other houses and doing construction

**[0:08:38]** So like that

**[0:08:39]** But like he went from like dirt as poor to like building himself up into

**[0:08:43]** Like a house flipper while trying to be an actor at the same time and I thought that was pretty cool that he was

**[0:08:48]** not

**[0:08:48]** Any kind of like nepo baby or anything that like he really had to like fight to stay in the business and try to make

**[0:08:53]** A go of it. So I do like it and her locker. Come on. That's a cool debut story. Sure. All right

**[0:09:00]** What is why is he a shipper?

**[0:09:03]** I get them vibes when I hear him talk. Oh

**[0:09:06]** Did something no, he's just kind of he's just kind of his

**[0:09:09]** Might I get along with him? I don't give a shit about that

**[0:09:16]** His stance on some shit, it's a little bit

**[0:09:18]** But whatever it's all is weary Paul is weary of good for him good for him. Do your thing make you make your money

**[0:09:27]** Poker the other day for the first time in a very long time. Yeah, and I thought I was gonna watch

**[0:09:32]** Someone get murdered. I was at the poker table. I thought one player was gonna murder another player tournament or open table

**[0:09:40]** Open table. Okay cash game. Okay. No big deal low stakes cash game one three one three. No limit cash game

**[0:09:49]** A fellow that was at the table a couple of seats down from me

**[0:09:53]** He won a sizable pot from me got a little bit lucky on the last card drew out on the last card

**[0:10:01]** Nobody I'm not saying anything to him. You know, I'm do the hand ends he wins

**[0:10:06]** It's a good sized hand just doing yeah, you're stewing. I'm not even stewing. I'm like, oh that's over. All right. He got it

**[0:10:12]** He says without me saying anything. He says to me

**[0:10:16]** Boy, I thought you were gonna draw out on me there

**[0:10:20]** And I looked I looked back I was just confused I looked back I was like I wait I was ahead though

**[0:10:25]** I was ahead until the until the last card you got the last card there and you won it

**[0:10:30]** He goes. Yeah. Yeah, but I was mathematically ahead already. I was supposed to win that hand already

**[0:10:34]** I just wasn't ahead on the cards yet

**[0:10:37]** and I and I kind of laughed I kind of I kind of good because he was

**[0:10:41]** Absolutely being genuine. He was he was saying that with all sincerity

**[0:10:45]** He was like no, no, I was supposed to win that hand. I was ahead mathematically which he wasn't by the time

**[0:10:50]** He actually made the call. He was mathematically behind when he made the call doesn't matter doesn't matter

**[0:10:54]** He won the hand I wasn't mad about it. Yeah. Yeah, so that was that was that he was a touch of a you know a

**[0:11:02]** skosh this much of a just a bit of a jerk about it just a

**[0:11:07]** Just not even not even a jerk. I was done with it though. I so we continue playing the game

**[0:11:13]** I don't say anything to him about it

**[0:11:15]** After I got it after I figured out what he meant by that didn't matter that he was wrong

**[0:11:19]** I was over it moving on so about half an hour later

**[0:11:23]** I win a big hand a very big hand off of that guy. Okay

**[0:11:29]** So I made all the money back and then quite a bit more off of that guy

**[0:11:35]** Like I say about half an hour later

**[0:11:37]** Again, this person is not sitting next to me. There is a person between us

**[0:11:43]** After I win that hand I don't say anything because I'm not stupid

**[0:11:49]** When it comes to this I'm not scenario you're in this scenario. I was not stupid at that moment. Yeah, there we go

**[0:11:56]** so I

**[0:11:58]** Don't say a word

**[0:11:59]** The person between us though looks at the guy who just lost the hell and by the way

**[0:12:05]** I had drawn out I had drawn out on this hand

**[0:12:08]** So I got a little bit lucky on this hand and the fourth card out I got a little bit lucky with that card

**[0:12:14]** Well the moment of the setup right you got lucky. That's it. That's it. Yeah, I'm just being quiet

**[0:12:18]** I'm stacking up my chips

**[0:12:20]** I'm moving on to the next hand the guy between us looks at the guy who just lost and goes

**[0:12:26]** Well, that was payback for earlier, huh?

**[0:12:35]** And I like my head just snapped up, you know, I'm looking down I'm looking anywhere but at this guy

**[0:12:41]** My head just snaps up and I just was like I whatever is happening here. I don't want to be a part of this

**[0:12:49]** That's I would give a I would give a stern stop helping

**[0:12:54]** Line to the guy over there. Don't I wanted to I wanted to so badly

**[0:13:00]** I didn't want to open my mouth though

**[0:13:03]** I was afraid that if I drew any attention to myself that it was all just gonna dump onto me

**[0:13:09]** I've you did a party you consider going

**[0:13:11]** Right and then high-fiving the guy

**[0:13:22]** Took the words out of my mouth

**[0:13:30]** You need to shut the fuck up

**[0:13:34]** Oh shit

**[0:13:45]** Would make me laugh really hard I

**[0:13:50]** Was crying at the poker table I had to get up and walk away it was awful

**[0:13:59]** Because that's it like you you have to laugh at that point because

**[0:14:03]** That's all you could do. It's all you can do

**[0:14:05]** And if that guy is above the laugh line, he's about to get kicked out of the casino anyway, yes

**[0:14:12]** Yes, yes. Yeah, so Jake I just want to make it clear that I'm not involved in whatever this conversation is over here

**[0:14:18]** I I think I'm gonna go home. I think I'm just gonna go home in that kind of scenario

**[0:14:23]** Can you can you just get up and go? Can you just get up and go after after any game after any hand?

**[0:14:28]** Open can open table you stand up any time. I feel don't you feel I have felt bad in the past

**[0:14:34]** I haven't played in forever, but I would feel bad after winning a pot and then leaving the it's called hit and run it

**[0:14:40]** You know, you're not it's bad etiquette

**[0:14:43]** To but it's also how you get money, right?

**[0:14:46]** it's certainly it is certainly allowed within the rules and the people who do it are

**[0:14:51]** Probably more intelligent than the other people who are still sitting at the table. I just stay there to lose

**[0:14:56]** But at least the DC to take a fake phone call pretend to talk about an urgent matter

**[0:15:04]** My gosh a baby now both babies both babies at the same time

**[0:15:11]** Wait more than two bit. Where's the other babies? How many babies guys guys?

**[0:15:15]** I gotta go sorry all the baby lots of babies so many babies so many babies guys. Hey

**[0:15:21]** Great game and you need to shut the fuck up. Bye. I

**[0:15:28]** Think I stayed for about five more minutes because I didn't know how to not leave awkwardly right and I was like

**[0:15:34]** This is it. I'm leaving. Yeah, you're gone to fuck that

**[0:15:40]** It was so bad it was so bad. I was like this you're gonna get yourself shot

**[0:15:45]** I'm gonna get shot just by sitting here. I don't want to get shot

**[0:15:49]** I don't want to be in a fight with some random dude in a casino at 1130 at night

**[0:15:54]** I've done I've been sitting at a table where someone hit and run and it's not even I feel that like oh

**[0:16:00]** They're there, you know that that lucky motherfucker

**[0:16:02]** It's more like all the money at the table is gone like you look like it's just a bunch of short stacks

**[0:16:07]** You're like, oh now what are we all playing for $50? Yeah, now the game is kind of over. Yeah. Yeah

**[0:16:13]** But still, you know, it's it's an open table

**[0:16:16]** That's all I would have sat and played for a while longer if this guy had not egged on the guy that I had

**[0:16:23]** Just accidentally roughed up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah the scenario the amount of scenarios where the table

**[0:16:29]** And the other guy was already putting more cash down on the table like he was staying in yeah

**[0:16:33]** So he wasn't leaving he wasn't going anywhere anytime soon

**[0:16:38]** Like no, no, whatever is happening here

**[0:16:40]** I don't want to be in it people going on tilts one of the weirdest things to watch and it's so hard to

**[0:16:46]** Deal with and yes, especially at like a low-stakes game. Yeah

**[0:16:51]** But this this is supposed to not matter, right?

**[0:16:55]** Like on on pot therapy Whitney's husband Peter, yeah, he's a professional poker player

**[0:17:02]** And so we I always anytime I play poker, which is probably I don't know at this point three times a year

**[0:17:11]** I go I'll play poker and

**[0:17:14]** Oftentimes I will end up with a story for Peter from these low-stakes games because he's

**[0:17:19]** He's won three games aren't the games that he's playing but every now and then you run into

**[0:17:25]** A professional, you know a big quote-unquote professional poker player at a low-stakes game

**[0:17:31]** Well, they all have these training apps now and they're all like these there's

**[0:17:36]** Soles and game theory stuff

**[0:17:38]** Yeah

**[0:17:39]** Makes people do dumb things on purpose to mess with other people's math and no one's getting the cards and it's gotten super weird

**[0:17:46]** But watching people do that at a low-stakes game where no one is doing the math in the first place. Yeah

**[0:17:52]** It's like meta fuck you. Yeah. Yeah

**[0:17:57]** It's it's crazy. It's just a weird crazy thing and also like, you know, and I I've been you know

**[0:18:03]** We've all been victims of bad beats, you know that kind of thing

**[0:18:09]** It's like it's poker for a reason, you know, like you're like, oh yeah

**[0:18:13]** I was doing the math and then gambling happened. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's the kind of like what we're doing

**[0:18:20]** Is tempting fate for bouts of luck and craziness

**[0:18:24]** Sometimes the wrong card just comes out or the right card speaking of gambling. Go ahead

**[0:18:29]** what are your guys takes on the current state of

**[0:18:33]** sports and

**[0:18:35]** Sort of the veneer cracking around. Oh that play was clearly somebody

**[0:18:41]** Covering a spread or fucking around for no good reason

**[0:18:46]** Level

**[0:18:49]** A lot of heat right is there gonna be is there gonna be any kind of real?

**[0:18:55]** No, cuz what I don't know but my consequence like you can't have a consequence if you don't know that something happened

**[0:19:01]** There's no way to tell if something happened unless somebody says like I did this

**[0:19:04]** I will say that I will say that I hear Paul and that like when they started loosening up all the sports gambling

**[0:19:10]** All the scenarios that everyone thought of sure came up in a hurry all the things that we like what if this happens?

**[0:19:15]** What that happens? It seems of all come to a head really quickly

**[0:19:19]** Oh, I let me be clear. I don't think I don't think that Paul is wrong on this

**[0:19:22]** I think that Paul is absolutely correct on this. Oh, what's that? I don't know. I think you're absolutely correct on this

**[0:19:28]** I'm saying I don't know how to prove it

**[0:19:30]** I don't know how to I don't know how to like get anyone but like did you see that play?

**[0:19:35]** Like it was making be viral. I've been really intentionally not watching any football anything

**[0:19:40]** uh-huh, but there was some college game and the kid is running down the field with the ball and

**[0:19:46]** Just he's got nobody in front of him. He's almost the goal line. He just walks off the side

**[0:19:52]** You see it. I

**[0:19:54]** There's so many college games. So there's so many that's things like college sports specifically, right?

**[0:20:00]** So like you can watch the NBA in the NFL. You have 30 teams going at it, right or 33 to whatever and

**[0:20:07]** With college you have hundreds and hundreds of this 30 teams just in the Big Ten, right?

**[0:20:13]** and

**[0:20:14]** And in those scenarios, right those those those smaller colleges where they're not making a lot of money

**[0:20:20]** Right. So like this if I had the opportunity to take two steps to the left and make $20,000

**[0:20:27]** I think I'd do it

**[0:20:29]** All right, you know, let's all right. Let's

**[0:20:32]** I'm in for 20. I just need a thousand people to join me

**[0:20:38]** You're not over 20,000 you're in for $20 feel like I just feel like

**[0:20:43]** You can't trust any sport at this point on a professional level

**[0:20:47]** I don't think you have here's why here's where I think you are not wrong

**[0:20:53]** But mistaken in the in the path that you're going down. Okay, I don't think you have to go to gambling

**[0:20:59]** I think you can just go to the to the legit money the quote-unquote legit money in it

**[0:21:05]** And that's all you have like I don't know. Yes, and that's gambling side of it

**[0:21:08]** You have to go to the dark money to find the crazy shit

**[0:21:13]** College football it's getting nuts and in the end of the mean that's going around is like Indiana has been terrible football for 150

**[0:21:20]** Years, you can pay players and suddenly they're good. They're like

**[0:21:23]** Indiana was the only only college playing by the rules for the last hundred and fifty years

**[0:21:29]** And I was laughing because Indiana won a crazy game against Ohio State and both players are interviewed

**[0:21:34]** We're like I want to thank God. I want to thank our Lord God Lord God Lord God

**[0:21:37]** I was like money you have the highest payroll

**[0:21:42]** You could thank old Johnny greenbacks

**[0:21:46]** You want to thank your river of money of boosters

**[0:21:51]** I want to thank God which is what I call all of my sugar daddies here at Indiana University

**[0:21:57]** Thank you God. No, it's gonna college football is gonna get weird

**[0:22:02]** College football is about to get bizarre because the amount of money that's going into that

**[0:22:07]** Through like the legit channels. Yeah, it's it's so much money. It's yeah, it's gonna be great

**[0:22:14]** Oh, yeah, and then Andy has mentioned the transfer portal that being able to transfer from from team to team much more easily now

**[0:22:21]** Oh, yeah, but coach. Oh, yeah, like coaches leave teams with like I'm gonna leave this

**[0:22:27]** $12,000,000 a year job, even though I was I thought I was trying to kind of stay for ten years

**[0:22:32]** I'm gonna leave because I was gonna pay me even more money like you can't there's no these contracts mean nothing. Yeah

**[0:22:43]** Even more infinite money than protein right, but there's 32 NFL teams, right? Yeah, just 30. I think it's 32

**[0:22:53]** So like if you're like the 33rd or 34th best quarterback, right?

**[0:22:59]** you can now make money by staying at a
