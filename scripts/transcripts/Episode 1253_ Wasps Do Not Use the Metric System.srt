1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
 Paying extra for tire care is BS, you know, bad service.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,000
 So at Midas, we're rolling out our BS-free tire guarantee,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,200
 included with paid installation and tax on every purchase.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,600
 You'll pay nothing for flat replacements, nada for flat repairs,

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,800
 and zilch for tire rotations every 5,000 miles.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,800
 That's zero dollars for all that.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,200
 So with this limited lifetime tire guarantee,

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,400
 you'll pay a whole lot of nothing compared to what the other guys charge for tire care.

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,200
 That's the BS-free tire guarantee, only at Midas.

10
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,000
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social?

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,400
 Yeah, I'd love to.

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,200
 Great, let's go!

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 HeyScoops.com, right there, there is ScoopFest Swag.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,400
 Over there at HeyScoops.com, from this last ScoopFest.

15
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,000
 Get the beds, you can get the robes, you can get the t-shirts.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,400
 HeyScoops.com, ScoopFest Swag.

17
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,800
 It's time for Matt and Mattingly's Ice Cream Social.

18
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,400
 Sitting at C, it's Matt Donnelly.

19
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,400
 Sitting at Pittsburgh, it's Paul Mattingly.

20
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,800
 Sitting at Vegas, it's me, Jacob the Audio Guy.

21
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
 We're pretty much in fun.

22
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,000
 Hey guys.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Hey, by the time you hear this, tomorrow night, Friday night,

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 I'm playing Sparta, New Jersey, two shows, Sparta Avenue Stage.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,800
 The 7pm is sold out, but my 9 o'clock is not.

26
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,200
 So if you can be anywhere near Sparta, New Jersey,

27
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,600
 or know anyone near Sparta, New Jersey,

28
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,800
 tell them to come on out for a really fun show at 9 o'clock in Sparta.

29
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,600
 It'll be awesome.

30
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,000
 Where do they get tickets?

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,200
 If you look up Sparta Avenue Stage,

32
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,400
 you'll find it there or it's in the link of my MyNoodler bio on Instagram.

33
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,600
 You can find the link there.

34
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,200
 And then just to confirm, if they can't come,

35
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,000
 but they still want to buy tickets, they can do that too, right?

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,800
 Yes. If you love the performance art of buying tickets

37
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,400
 and not showing up, go for it.

38
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,800
 Also, then Paul and I, our shows are starting to sell pretty well here,

39
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,400
 but we're doing stuff at Tierney's Tavern.

40
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,000
 A lot of scoops are coming out.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,200
 I know, which is fantastic.

42
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,000
 It's going to be another good scoop gathering October 23rd.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,200
 That's for sale on our website.

44
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,400
 That's at heyscoops.com/comedynight.

45
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,800
 Tickets are 20 bucks.

46
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,200
 Yeah, and we've definitely moved a few tickets for that.

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,600
 That is going to be a nice little scoop event.

48
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,000
 It's a steal.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,200
 Get yourselves out there.

50
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,600
 If you're in that tri-state area, make the magic happen.

51
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,100
 You won't regret it.

52
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,200
 Tierney's in and of itself is an experience.

53
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,400
 That's true.

54
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,000
 Are we going to be up in the upstairs again?

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,400
 Yeah, we're going to be up in the upstairs.

56
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,200
 Oh my fucking God, that spot is just tits.

57
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,400
 Get you a can smashed burger.

58
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,800
 It's going to be good, good times, baby.

59
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,200
 In the old days, when our improv group was in the Twilight phase

60
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,600
 of our improv group, we kind of would just throw shows together

61
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,600
 up at Tierney's, and we would just do sets.

62
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,800
 We would just do a set and stop, have some drinks, hang out,

63
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,600
 then go like, ah, let's do another set, and we would kind of get up.

64
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,400
 Like, I'm kind of envisioning something as fun and kind of casual as that.

65
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,200
 Oh my God, I can't wait, dude.

66
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,200
 Kurt's coming by.

67
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,800
 We're just going to get up and do some free-for-long form?

68
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,200
 Yeah, Dion's coming by.

69
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,200
 I'll do some stand-up sets.

70
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,000
 I'll do a couple of magic tricks.

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,600
 Matt, this is a bad idea.

72
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,800
 This is a bad idea, Matt.

73
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,400
 Because after you sit down for a couple of minutes,

74
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,000
 Paul's going to be like, they've seen funny stuff now.

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,400
 We don't need to get back up again.

76
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,800
 What are you talking about?

77
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,400
 You're going to do a couple of sets, and then you're going to sit down

78
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,600
 and start talking to people, and you're going to be like,

79
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,800
 we don't need to do any more sets.

80
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,000
 Are you crazy?

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,600
 No, man.

82
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
 You don't know.

83
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,000
 No, no, no, no, no.

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,600
 I don't know if you see the reaction from your other business partner,

85
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,800
 but we both know.

86
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,800
 What are you talking about?

87
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
 No, man, we did double.

88
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,600
 We've been doing double bucket shows for the last few Scoop Fests.

89
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,200
 It's been great.

90
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,400
 Who knows what it's all about?

91
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:43,800
 Yeah.

92
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,600
 I know, I know.

93
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,600
 I'm not going to--

94
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,000
 No.

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 It's going to be so good.

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,400
 If we go late enough, we might get a cameo from a New Jersey celebrity.

97
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,000
 We'll see.

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,200
 But I'm not going to put the name out there.

99
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,800
 But--

100
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,000
 Bruce.

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,400
 I'm not kidding.

102
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:05,200
 I am down to improvise until the wee hours with new players and players,

103
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
 players that I know are good.

104
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,600
 That's going to be super, super fun.

105
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,800
 I'm hungry for that shit.

106
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,600
 Yeah, it's going to be so fun.

107
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
 Just starting teaching--

108
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,200
 Can smash burgers.

109
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,000
 --just starting teaching this week.

110
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,600
 The 20th will be my first class, officially, outside of my free classes

111
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
 that I've been doing, which were great.

112
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,600
 They've really been serving the job of getting my improv muscle back in shape,

113
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,600
 and especially my teaching stuff.

114
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,200
 Very good.

115
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,800
 Yeah.

116
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,600
 Yeah, very excited.

117
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,200
 Well, in two nights, yeah, I got my improv jam reunion at the Smod Castle.

118
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,600
 Yeah.

119
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,200
 Kevin Smith is also doing an event that night where he's--

120
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,800
 Wow.

121
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,600
 --going to do something with mall rats.

122
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,400
 So I might run into my old buddy, Kev, you know?

123
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:47,800
 Yeah.

124
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,000
 I might be able to--

125
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,600
 Hey, man.

126
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,200
 --get you a selfie.

127
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,400
 --the pleasant trees and--

128
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,600
 Yes, toss him a chip, baby.

129
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,200
 A friend of mine wrote me.

130
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
 He said, he's coming.

131
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,600
 And he goes, wait, can I get a picture with Kevin Smith?

132
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,600
 And I said, I mean, I can't help you with that, but yes.

133
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,800
 As far as I'm concerned, you can.

134
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,200
 You know, I don't know.

135
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,800
 I think--

136
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,600
 Either Kevin Smith doesn't remember who I am, which is very likely.

137
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,200
 Yeah.

138
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:10,400
 Right.

139
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,200
 Or if he does, he's going to be like, hey, let's get a photo.

140
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,200
 It's not going to be--

141
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
 I don't know, man.

142
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,600
 You don't think he'll suggest it?

143
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,200
 I don't know.

144
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:26,000
 He has become incredibly sentimental and sort of water under the bridge

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 about a lot of stuff, especially after the big heart attack event.

146
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,800
 Yeah.

147
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,300
 Right.

148
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,000
 And that's only been like five years.

149
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,200
 All right.

150
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
 I think you might--

151
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
 There's no reason to light this candle of hope for me, Paul,

152
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,000
 but let's go for it.

153
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,200
 OK.

154
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,000
 This is the role I play.

155
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,800
 I sit down and say, I've done enough.

156
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:55,000
 And I tell people to go and make up with their mortal enemies.

157
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,800
 I've already been funny today.

158
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,200
 I don't need to be funny anymore.

159
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,000
 I mean, there comes a certain point of diminishing returns, Jacob.

160
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Don't I know it?

161
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,800
 I'm getting some good guesses on who the New Jersey celebrity is.

162
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
 Southside Johnny.

163
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,600
 Chris Christie.

164
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,400
 Chris Christie.

165
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,600
 Oh, Chris Christie.

166
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,800
 Oh, man.

167
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,000
 I feel like we could get Southside Johnny.

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,400
 I feel like we could get Chris Christie.

169
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,800
 I should make some calls right now just to put a cap on it.

170
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,200
 I think the Asbury Jukes might just be the house band.

171
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,000
 Southside Johnny's becoming--

172
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,200
 We were going to be there for dinner anyway, so why not?

173
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,600
 [LAUGHTER]

174
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,200
 Southside Johnny is slowly becoming bit worthy.

175
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,600
 I have more scoops to write me.

176
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,000
 Be like, wait, who was the guy that you guys always talk about?

177
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,200
 And I have to always be like Southside Johnny.

178
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,600
 I keep forgetting the name.

179
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,000
 I have been trying to get Southside Johnny to be

180
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 a bit on this podcast for years.

181
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 It is finally reaching critical mass, where it would be a bit to get him

182
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,800
 to show up somewhere as a thing.

183
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,200
 Yes, yes, for sure.

184
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,000
 I'll tell you-- oh, did we say this on air or no?

185
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,400
 But there was someone I was trying to get for the variety show that

186
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,400
 was going to make the crowd go wild that I couldn't get.

187
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,200
 Oh, we did not say this on air.

188
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,800
 That is, we took a swing for Scoop Fest, and we weren't able to hit it.

189
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,200
 I could not get in touch with Monroe.

190
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,800
 I was trying so badly to get Monroe, the retired garbage truck

191
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,400
 driver, to come sing a song because he sings in the church.

192
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,200
 Couldn't get him, huh?

193
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,200
 I was trying very hard to get Monroe to Scoop Fest.

194
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,500
 You were.

195
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,000
 Matt really worked to try to get Monroe.

196
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,600
 You just could not find him.

197
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
 And I was like, I don't know how I'm going

198
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
 to dance on this thin ice that we're going

199
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
 to dance on to get him in and out of Scoop Fest

200
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,600
 without him knowing that the joke is that he fucks my wife.

201
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,000
 But I was going to try.

202
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,400
 I mean, you know, you keep playing with that kindling,

203
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
 you're going to get a fire.

204
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,800
 It's up to you.

205
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
 Monroe is either going to show up and sing it

206
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
 in the village or fuck Matt's wife.

207
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,600
 That's what I mean, or both, buddy, or both.

208
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,800
 Maybe, that's true.

209
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
 It could never happen, Paul.

210
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
 I'm always home.

211
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
 [LAUGHS]

212
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,200
 What's that in the background?

213
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
 Oh, oh, you're on a boat.

214
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,000
 OK.

215
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,200
 I've been away since the very end of Scoop Fest.

216
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,000
 I've been away.

217
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

218
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,800
 Yeah, there are other semen you need

219
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,000
 to be worried about, my friend.

220
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Good gravy.

221
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,800
 No, that's going to be exciting as hell.

222
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,800
 So this week, you know, I'm still kind of just rolling

223
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,400
 from my eye emergency bullshit, which I think

224
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,600
 is going to just turn out to be much do about nothing,

225
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,000
 Tempest in a teapot type shit.

226
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,600
 I hope I get a x-ray next week to see what's happening.

227
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,600
 And then I fly away, wee, to New Jersey the next day.

228
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,800
 So but, you know, never stops.

229
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,200
 You guys know, everybody's busy, busy, busy.

230
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,800
 And between all my other little shit that I'm doing,

231
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,600
 we're getting our house finally painted.

232
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,800
 And has been desperate to get the house painted for years.

233
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,300
 Whoa.

234
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,000
 Glad.

235
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,700
 And yeah, it's a big thing.

236
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,100
 It's a big change.

237
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,300
 So our house was created in the '80s.

238
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,800
 And it very much is that--

239
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,500
 I like that Paul's house was created.

240
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,900
 Other houses were built, but Paul's house created.

241
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,700
 This was created in the '80s.

242
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,200
 And it's very much the same color

243
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,100
 as the Ford Tempo I used to drive back in the '80s.

244
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,600
 And it is-- I picture every Ford Tempo

245
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
 as being a shade of brown.

246
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,100
 It is two-tone brown.

247
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,600
 Good.

248
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,500
 This is where it's beginning.

249
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,400
 And here's where we're going.

250
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,200
 And it's already--

251
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,400
 This is why you want to be on Zoom and on Twitch right here.

252
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:45,800
 That's right.

253
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,900
 Because you get to see pictures of Paul's house getting

254
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,400
 painted.

255
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,200
 Yes.

256
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,100
 Already happening.

257
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,900
 Watch pictures of paint dry.

258
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,100
 Does anything be more interesting than that?

259
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,600
 Nothing could be more exciting.

260
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,400
 But it's turning out.

261
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,000
 iPhone videos of paint dry.

262
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,500
 It's turning out beautiful, honestly.

263
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,800
 It's really going to be gorgeous.

264
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,800
 And you can see how much brighter and cheerier

265
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,400
 it already is just with one little application.

266
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
 Oh, that is nice.

267
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,500
 It really is nice.

268
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,000
 And we're going to get white trim.

269
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,700
 And the brick's going to get worked on.

270
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,800
 And what do you call that?

271
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,300
 They're going to lime wash the brick.

272
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,800
 So it's kind of light and all kinds of things like that.

273
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,900
 So it's going to be really nice.

274
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,900
 Oh, is that how they do the light--

275
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,400
 the straight brick look?

276
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,200
 That is oftentimes what is utilized, the lime wash.

277
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,700
 Yes.

278
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:43,500
 And so we are hoping that that all continues to move forward.

279
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,300
 We've got all the paint and everything.

280
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,900
 But the guy yesterday, as he's leaving,

281
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,200
 they had to leave early to go work on another job.

282
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,100
 And I was like, OK.

283
00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:01,800
 And then he says, oh, I'll be back at 9 tomorrow

284
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,200
 in the morning.

285
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,500
 So Ann and I both get up.

286
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,600
 I get up early on my off day.

287
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,200
 Instead of sleeping my little butt away all day

288
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,900
 like I wanted to do, I get up and make sure everything's

289
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,200
 ready to go, get the garage door open,

290
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,500
 get the paint cans set up and everything.

291
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,400
 Let the snakes in.

292
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,300
 And nothing, nobody, nothing.

293
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,600
 Nobody showed the whole day, finally.

294
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,500
 Finally, at right about 1 o'clock,

295
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,900
 the project coordinator called me up and was like, hey,

296
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,600
 yeah, nobody showed up today because blankety blank blank.

297
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,800
 And I'm like, OK, well, all right, great.

298
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,900
 So but at least they touch base.

299
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,800
 This is far more communication than any other contractor

300
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,000
 in this burg.

301
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,200
 But it's just always the way it is.

302
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,000
 But it's fine.

303
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,200
 We're already happy with how things are going.

304
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,400
 But man, oh man, if it ain't one thing.

305
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,500
 That's looking good.

306
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,300
 Yeah, yeah, we're really, we're really happy.

307
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,300
 And Ann's over the moon.

308
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,300
 And I, for one, cannot wait for you to get that white trim.

309
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,600
 You're going to be so relaxed.

310
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,900
 I just need--

311
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,100
 I need my white trim.

312
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,200
 Well, we took-- they took down the shutters.

313
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,500
 They took down all the shutters.

314
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,300
 And these shutters are just these cheap old little plastic

315
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,300
 fakey things.

316
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,500
 They're fake as hell, right?

317
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,200
 They're not even--

318
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,400
 What if a tornado comes through?

319
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,700
 Then these would be the first things to go.

320
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,000
 They're not even-- they're just pieces of plastic.

321
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,400
 So as we pulled them all down, we

322
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:30,100
 must have got 10 different calcified ancient wasp hives--

323
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,700
 Oh, yeah.

324
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,000
 --out of the backs of those things.

325
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,200
 It's wild.

326
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,000
 Yeah, yeah.

327
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,900
 But we've got an excellent anti-wasp plan now.

328
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,900
 Have I told you guys about Ann's fake wasp nests?

329
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,900
 No.

330
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,800
 We have fake wasp nests strategically

331
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,900
 placed all over the yard.

332
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:50,300
 Wait, in that-- what's afraid of wasps?

333
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,300
 I mean, besides humans.

334
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,300
 And then I would make a human, by the way.

335
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,000
 Wasps.

336
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,100
 Wasps are afraid of other wasps?

337
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,600
 If there is a wasp nest already constructed,

338
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,700
 they will-- they will make a point

339
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:09,000
 to not build a wasp nest within 40 yards, I think it is,

340
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 of that wasp nest.

341
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,600
 Oh, that's right, because wasps use imperial measurements.

342
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
 I have heard this before.

343
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,500
 Yes, yes, yes.

344
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,700
 They will not use the metric system.

345
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,700
 They do not use the metric system.

346
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,800
 It is the USA and wasps.

347
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,500
 40 yards.

348
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,100
 So these nests that she got--

349
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,300
 the nests-- they are--

350
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,800
 they're basically Chinese lanterns, you know,

351
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,100
 without the lantern component.

352
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,300
 But it just expands with a little wire frame inside,

353
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,800
 loose little wire frame inside.

354
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,900
 And it looks like just a little--

355
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,800
 it looks like a wasp nest.

356
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,900
 You hang them up in the trees and stuff.

357
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,200
 And our neighbors were like, oh my god, you got--

358
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,700
 and I'm like, no, no, no.

359
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,900
 Fakeity fake.

360
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,500
 This is keeping the real deal at bay.

361
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,500
 Your neighbors were like, you are overrun, sir.

362
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,300
 It's true.

363
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,100
 There were like three of them.

364
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,500
 There's three of them in the backyard and one in the front.

365
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,300
 You were in trouble.

366
00:14:59,300 --> 00:14:59,700
 It's like--

367
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,200
 You need to move immediately.

368
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,000
 You guys are about to be inundated.

369
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,800
 We're like, we're OK.

370
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,700
 We're OK.

371
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,500
 So yeah.

372
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,900
 My aunt had--

373
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,600
 so I never know the right terminology for this anymore,

374
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,900
 because back then, it was the Africanized bees in the '90s.

375
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,800
 Let's stick with that.

376
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,900
 That sounds right to me.

377
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,100
 Yeah.

378
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,100
 Let's don't change it from anything from that.

379
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,700
 Yeah, I just don't know what to actually--

380
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,100
 I don't know what the real name of it is.

381
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,700
 What the fuck is the real name of that?

382
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,500
 Would you have like--

383
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,200
 Technically-- technically, Zimbibwe.

384
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,800
 Whatever the real fucking name of that is supposed to be--

385
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,500
 That's the technical term.

386
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,500
 That's what they called it.

387
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,400
 That's what they called it.

388
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,300
 I'm not saying that.

389
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,300
 That's what they called it in the '90s.

390
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:54,400
 And my aunt's house got overrun with bees--

391
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,000
 What?

392
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,400
 --to the point that they had to sell the house.

393
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:03,500
 That's one of Kurt Bronneler's best comedy bits.

394
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,200
 He closes out one of his specials.

395
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,500
 He talks about my aunt's house?

396
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,900
 It might be.

397
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,100
 Yeah.

398
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,100
 He talks about a house being overrun with bees,

399
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,500
 and how when they get in there, they discovered-- what was it?

400
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,100
 10 million bees or something like that?

401
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,400
 Oh, this wasn't that bad.

402
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:21,900
 Still--

403
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,700
 I don't think this is Kurt's story, then.

404
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,700
 But that's how Kurt closes out one of his comedy specials,

405
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,800
 talking about just how the fuck do

406
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,700
 you ignore that your home has 10 million bees in it?

407
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,100
 I mean, when it happened in my aunt's house,

408
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,800
 there was just a constant swarm of bees around the house.

409
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,600
 It was horrifying, and no one knew why.

410
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
 Well, that's the thing.

411
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,400
 If you're from Zimbibwe, you don't notice.

412
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,900
 That's right.

413
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,600
 Where the walls are paved with honey, Zimbibwe.

414
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,000
 [LAUGHTER]

415
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Zimbibwe.

416
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,700
 I am not comfortable with that.

417
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,100
 [LAUGHTER]

418
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Yeah, Penn's old place, the slammer,

419
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,300
 was overrun with bees before its demise, as well.

420
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,200
 I do remember that.

421
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,900
 Yeah, they had a bunch of nests all over the place in that place.

422
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,200
 You just see honey running in from anywhere.

423
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
 It was really strange.

424
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,700
 I just drove past--

425
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,800
 this last week, I drove past where the slammer was.

426
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,100
 I was thinking about the slammer this week.

427
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,600
 Oh, so sad.

428
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,000
 Yeah, yeah, just--

429
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,600
 You can't even dig just a big bunch of houses.

430
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,100
 You can't even figure it out.

431
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,000
 Did they develop-- it's a whole development now, huh?

432
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

433
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,200
 It's a little block in a neighborhood now.

434
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,000
 Yeah, there were two really cool houses right in that area.

435
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,200
 There was Penn's house, and there

436
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,200
 was this giant white house that had four windmills on it.

437
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,100
 Yeah, both of those houses are gone now.

438
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,400
 Those were two weird houses right next to each other,

439
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,900
 and it made me sad that they're both gone.

440
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,700
 Yeah, yeah.

441
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,700
 Yep.

442
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,600
 So I was just down in--

443
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,500
 one of my stops was Boston, Massachusetts.

444
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,700
 Uh-huh, Boston, Massachusetts.

445
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,000
 Oh, I heard all about it.

446
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,600
 I talked to your wife the other day, and she was like,

447
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,300
 I am doing this, I'm doing this, and Matt's

448
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,300
 hanging out in Boston.

449
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,700
 There's no getting around it.

450
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,000
 This sucks to be her.

451
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,100
 I don't know how--

452
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,400
 Sorry, Sarah.

453
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,600
 And so do I just call it every day,

454
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
 be like, it's miserable for me, too.

455
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,200
 I'm doing nothing.

456
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,000
 No, no, I think you're playing the right--

457
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,500
 No, because she's not buying that.

458
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,900
 She's simply not buying it.

459
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,700
 You're playing the right move.

460
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,700
 You got to just lean into it.

461
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,300
 So one of the comedians on board

462
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,400
 is a guy named Rondell Sheridan.

463
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,300
 OK.

464
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,700
 I know Rondell Sheridan.

465
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,900
 He's hilarious.

466
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,600
 That's it.

467
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,500
 He's a very funny--

468
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,900
 He's on board your ship right now.

469
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,900
 Yes.

470
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,000
 Incredible.

471
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,400
 And so Rondell has been amazing, right?

472
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:56,900
 Yeah.

473
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,800
 It was funny, because I once saw his show.

474
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
 It was funny.

475
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,600
 And then this guy on board, Tom, who knows, like,

476
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,300
 everyone who does Virgin Ships, he goes,

477
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,500
 you never see Rondell Sheridan.

478
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,900
 You see him do his shows, and you see him come down for food,

479
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,200
 and you never see him around.

480
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,600
 And then the second night, like, we made conversations

481
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,100
 with Rondell, and we started talking sports and stuff.

482
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:25,100
 And then he started hanging out.

483
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,400
 Started hanging out with us.

484
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,700
 Oh, yes.

485
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,700
 So Rondell, most people know him as the dad from--

486
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,100
 that's so Raven.

487
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,000
 He was Raven's dad.

488
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,500
 And he's directed-- he's been and directed a bunch of shows

489
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,300
 for Disney Channel.

490
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,800
 But you look at his old stand-up bits,

491
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
 there are old stand-up bits that you don't realize are his.

492
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,500
 You go back and look, and you're like, oh, that's his.

493
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,300
 Like, the famous parachute man who survived after bouncing

494
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,600
 on the ground twice.

495
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,300
 I don't know if you remember that bit.

496
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:57,400
 So we're supposed to go to Maine.

497
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,500
 The seas are too rough, and the currents are too strong

498
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,800
 for us to go to Maine.

499
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,500
 So the ship pulls an audible and just says,

500
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,900
 hey, let's go to Boston early.

501
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,700
 Let's haul ass to Boston and do an overnight.

502
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,200
 Yeah.

503
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,200
 Overnights are so rare, and they're the fucking best.

504
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,400
 I did one in Tenerife, Spain.

505
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,300
 And it's just like, you just-- the whole ship's

506
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,900
 just excited to roll into town and go out for the night,

507
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,700
 right?

508
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,700
 So it's just the buzz in the air or whatever.

509
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,500
 Wait, what do you mean-- what's an overnight?

510
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,900
 You get to Boston at nighttime?

511
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,900
 The ship's going to be parked.

512
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,300
 Your ship basically becomes a hotel.

513
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,400
 You are now in Boston for the night.

514
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,500
 Oh, right. OK, great.

515
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,300
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

516
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,100
 You don't have to come running back at 415

517
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,900
 to make sure you don't get left behind.

518
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,900
 Right, OK, you got a floating hotel in Boston.

519
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,100
 Floating hotel in Boston.

520
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,300
 Everyone can stay out all night, right?

521
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,800
 Great.

522
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,600
 So Tom--

523
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,800
 That was one of the best things.

524
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,200
 I still talk about that from the Bermuda scoop cruise.

525
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,200
 That was great, because that boat just parked at Bermuda,

526
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,100
 and we had a hotel at Bermuda.

527
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:58,700
 It was perfect.

528
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,800
 It was so fun.

529
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,300
 It was so fun, sailing out every night

530
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,300
 and stumbling back to the ship.

531
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:04,800
 Yes.

532
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,300
 So I haven't spent time out in Boston

533
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,800
 since I was in my 20s.

534
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,800
 Yeah, who would?

535
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,200
 Who would?

536
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,300
 Who would want to?

537
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,700
 Indeed.

538
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,300
 So Tom does the research, and turns out

539
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,800
 there's this magic lab, Boston Magic Lab,

540
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:31,300
 does a magic open mic, open mic with a wink face.

541
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,000
 So as I was out shopping, I was like, I'm going to haul that.

542
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,700
 I'll haul my ass back to the ship

543
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,600
 and throw some fish in a backpack, and let's go.

544
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,800
 Matt shows up with a fucking rolling suitcase.

545
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,500
 All my two full cases.

546
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,900
 Let's go, motherfuckers.

547
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,300
 Open this mic.

548
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,800
 But Tom does some advanced research.

549
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,800
 It turns out, no, it's open mic.

550
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,800
 The sign-up is beforehand, not day of,

551
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
 because people have to work on their tricks, obviously,

552
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,300
 or whatever.

553
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:04,500
 And so we were told that, no, it is a set lineup.

554
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,600
 I mean, they should definitely have a couple of spaces

555
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,800
 put aside if somebody just shows up.

556
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,100
 This is the debate.

557
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,800
 This is the debate that we were having.

558
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,300
 OK?

559
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:13,800
 Yeah.

560
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,100
 Tom did his due diligence, because of everything I do,

561
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,300
 just being the co-host at Penn Sunday School is the big one.

562
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:22,800
 I mean--

563
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,300
 Sure.

564
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,800
 --almost every magician listens to Penn Sunday School.

565
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,600
 Right.

566
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,800
 And so, like--

567
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,500
 You were known in the world of magic,

568
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,300
 if for no other reason than because of that show.

569
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,100
 And then one of the guys in the lineup

570
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,800
 has done "Fool Us" a couple of times.

571
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,400
 I mean, Tyler Twaldy.

572
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,700
 So you've got the connects.

573
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,200
 Yeah.

574
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,800
 But I-- but no, no, no.

575
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,000
 We make no waves.

576
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,400
 There's no scuttlebutt that we are there.

577
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,400
 We just buy tickets.

578
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:51,800
 We watch.

579
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,800
 And then we watch open mic.

580
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,800
 And it's an open mic.

581
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,800
 It is an open mic, like comedians have an open mic,

582
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
 like musicians at a coffee house have an open mic.

583
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
 It is the same open mic.

584
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,800
 It's not better or worse.

585
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,800
 It is as good as an open mic.

586
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:12,800
 The level of goodness is open mic level.

587
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,300
 It is an open mic.

588
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:18,300
 It is an open-faced mic, hot and brown.

589
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:22,800
 But what's cool is because it's like this open mic concept

590
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,800
 is that no one was just doing a trick they bought.

591
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
 And no one was doing like a--

592
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
 Oh, that's cool.

593
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,800
 And no one was just doing like an off-the-rack trick.

594
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
 Everyone was going for something different, original,

595
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,300
 or something with some kind of intellectual bite,

596
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,300
 something with some kind of narrative,

597
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,800
 something with some kind of feel.

598
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,300
 So I did really like that a lot.

599
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,800
 And my buddy Tyler did kill it.

600
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,800
 He did a really fun couple of routines and stuff.

601
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,300
 And that part was great.

602
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,800
 But there was a guy who was so socially awkward.

603
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,300
 I mean, they were all like college professors

604
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,800
 and shit like that.

605
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
 It's like a magic club, basically.

606
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:01,300
 And he was this older Asian professor

607
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,800
 who dressed up like Marty McFly from "Back to the Future."

608
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,800
 Oh, I love this person already.

609
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,300
 I know.

610
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,800
 He was so shy.

611
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,300
 But he worked on his script within an inch of its life.

612
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,800
 And it was really well-written.

613
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,300
 Yes.

614
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,300
 And he was doing time machine stuff with an hourglass,

615
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,300
 like little mini hourglass.

616
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,300
 And then he was doing coin stuff where coins were disappeared

617
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,300
 and returned to his hands based on the hourglass.

618
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,800
 Oh, he just dressed like Marty McFly.

619
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
 So he wasn't doing like a Marty McFly bit.

620
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,800
 He was doing a time traveling bit.

621
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,300
 Oh, this is good.

622
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,800
 This is a good-- this is a fine bit.

623
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,800
 I'm very happy with this bit.

624
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,800
 And sometimes he wasn't laughing at some of his jokes

625
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,800
 because he was just delivering so stone cold across the board.

626
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,300
 I just turned to Tom and I was like, I love this guy.

627
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,800
 I'm in love with this man.

628
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,300
 I fucking love him.

629
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,800
 And I was laughing at all of his bits.

630
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,800
 And I was loving everything he was doing.

631
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
 Yeah.

632
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,300
 And he was making fun of himself for dressing like Marty McFly.

633
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,800
 And when he wanted to do time travel that was more significant,

634
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
 he got a bigger hourglass.

635
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,300
 [LAUGHTER]

636
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,800
 I got to go further back.

637
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,800
 Hold on.

638
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,800
 This is like-- I was like, no notes, man.

639
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,300
 Let me just buy this routine off of you.

640
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,800
 This is great.

641
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,800
 All you're missing is decades of social skills.

642
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,800
 Other than that, you are fucking nailing it.

643
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
 Golden.

644
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,800
 [LAUGHTER]

645
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,800
 But he was so likable and everything.

646
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,300
 It wasn't even like-- I'm being harsh.

647
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,800
 But he was so likable and funny.

648
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,300
 Yeah, yeah.

649
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,800
 But yeah, but then afterward it was funny.

650
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,300
 Like, I went up to one guy and Tom went up to another guy.

651
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,800
 No one decided to hold court.

652
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,300
 No one decided to say, hey, you're here.

653
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,800
 We should introduce you to everybody.

654
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
 We should get a photo or whatever.

655
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
 Oh, that's nice.

656
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,800
 No, no one did that.

657
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,800
 No one did that.

658
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,800
 Right.

659
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,800
 That's what I'm saying.

660
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,800
 That's nice.

661
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,800
 Oh, no.

662
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,800
 I thought we should have all got a big photo.

663
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,300
 Oh, I see what you mean.

664
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,300
 OK.

665
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,300
 Yeah, fine.

666
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,300
 Because I put a photo up of it saying,

667
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,300
 had a blast tonight at Boston Magic Lab

668
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,300
 and got all these notes saying, I didn't know you were there.

669
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,300
 Holy shit.

670
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,300
 I would have said hello.

671
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,300
 Oh, I got all this stuff.

672
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,300
 I was like, well, I didn't know.

673
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,300
 I threw out my name.

674
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,300
 As much as comfortable as I am throwing my name around,

675
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,300
 I threw my name around.

676
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,300
 Right.

677
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,300
 There you go.

678
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,300
 I guess as I was saying, it's surprisingly

679
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,300
 less than you'd think.

680
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,300
 [LAUGHTER]

681
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:30,300
 But then, Ron Down wants to come out.

682
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,300
 And so--

683
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,300
 Right.

684
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,300
 Does he come with you to the magic thing?

685
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,800
 We find-- he says he's too tired to go to the magic thing.

686
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,300
 Sure.

687
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,300
 We all are, Ron Down.

688
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:41,300
 And as a comedian not wanting to rush through a magic open mic,

689
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,300
 I totally understand.

690
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,300
 Yeah.

691
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,300
 [LAUGHTER]

692
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,300
 But we decide we're going to go to a comedy club

693
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:50,300
 in the middle of Cambridge, the college comedy club.

694
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,300
 OK.

695
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:55,300
 And so we roll up with Ron Down Sheridan,

696
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:59,300
 and Guy recognizes him right away.

697
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,300
 Of course, because he's comedy royalty.

698
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,300
 Right.

699
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,300
 He's stand-up royalty, that guy.

700
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,800
 And we sit down and we get--

701
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
 Is this that guy from Boston Commons?

702
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,800
 Was he there?

703
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,300
 Who's that cat that came up with that TV show?

704
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,300
 He was a stand-up?

705
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,300
 Oh, I don't know.

706
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,300
 I haven't heard of him for like a decade.

707
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,300
 Yeah.

708
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,300
 Oh, I need to look that up.

709
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,300
 But he--

710
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,300
 Everybody drink.

711
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,300
 He--

712
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,300
 Paul brought up a story.

713
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,300
 He doesn't know what the ending is.

714
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,300
 Everybody drink.

715
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,300
 I just don't know the guy's name.

716
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,300
 And we sit down.

717
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,300
 And of course--

718
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,300
 That was the only part of your story.

719
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,300
 It's the--

720
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,300
 True.

721
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,300
 They, of course, come up and say, hey,

722
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,300
 we can get you a slot if you want to do time.

723
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,300
 And I go, comedy clubs get it.

724
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:43,300
 These magic clubs get one or two from these comedy clubs.

725
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,300
 They know.

726
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,300
 They know.

727
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,300
 I could have easily had a spin pad and a couple of fish in my backpack.

728
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,300
 Anthony Clark.

729
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,300
 Anthony Clark was the comedian I was fishing for.

730
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,300
 Anthony Clark, who started--

731
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,300
 Oh, yeah.

732
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,300
 Thank you for bringing it up.

733
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,300
 And just to make sure we're being clear about the story,

734
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,300
 Anthony Clark, not involved in the story whatsoever.

735
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,300
 OK.

736
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,300
 That's what I want.

737
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,300
 I thought perhaps he might have been,

738
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,300
 because I don't know what he's been doing

739
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:10,300
 besides possibly hiding in Boston hosting open mic nights.

740
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:14,300
 I also don't know what Anthony Clark has been up to lately.

741
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,300
 But he might have been up to something with the following sponsor.

742
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,300
 Oh, shit.

743
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,300
 I don't know.

744
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,300
 He might have been up to something with the following sponsor.

745
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,300
 It might have happened.

746
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,300
 I simply don't know what he's doing.

747
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,300
 This was a regular line-up night.

748
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,300
 This was not an open mic night.

749
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,300
 This was--

750
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,300
 No, no, no.

751
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,300
 Following sponsor.

752
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,300
 Oh, sorry.

753
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,300
 I started reading the chat.

754
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,300
 I was too clever for my own good.

755
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,300
 Yeah, I know.

756
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,300
 Today's show is brought to you by the fine people of--

757
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,300
 Go.

758
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,300
 Go, phone.

759
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,300
 Go.

760
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,300
 Go to the website.

761
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,300
 I think I'll just--

762
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,300
 Four floors of whores.

763
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,300
 If you've got the balls, we've got the whores.

764
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,300
 Four floors of whores.

765
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:58,300
 That's from Scoop Me Hard in 2025.

766
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,300
 So there you go.

767
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,300
 I was at this place last night.

768
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,300
 Hello, everyone.

769
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,300
 It's me, Vincent Price.

770
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,300
 I'm here to tell you about my newest attraction.

771
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,300
 Four floors of whores.

772
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,300
 Yes.

773
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,300
 Open the doors.

774
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,300
 There are the whores.

775
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,300
 Doesn't matter what floor it's yours.

776
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,300
 Because there they are.

777
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,300
 Come on in.

778
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,300
 Whores.

779
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,300
 Come on in.

780
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,300
 Would you like some porridge?

781
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,300
 I've got some on the stair store.

782
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:40,300
 When you enter the first floor, you may notice many whores.

783
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,300
 But I'll have you know, the second floor contains more.

784
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,300
 Open the door to the second floor.

785
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,300
 You'll find more whores.

786
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,300
 They abhor.

787
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,300
 Abhor.

788
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:56,300
 So be exciting and give them something more.

789
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,300
 Oh, what's in this closet over here?

790
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,300
 That's not a closet.

791
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,300
 Oh, it's a storage.

792
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,300
 That's just storage for the porridge.

793
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,300
 That's porridge storage.

794
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,300
 You found my porridge storage.

795
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,300
 Can I have some porridge?

796
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,300
 Sure.

797
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,300
 Sure.

798
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,300
 Now go up the door to level three whore.

799
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,300
 Guess what?

800
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,300
 More whores.

801
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,300
 On level three.

802
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,300
 Are you surprised?

803
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,300
 You shouldn't be.

804
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,300
 Because the name of the place is four floors of whores.

805
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,300
 I'm just waiting until we get to the fourth floor.

806
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,300
 This is Sam Elliott for whores original.

807
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:39,300
 Cool whores original whores whores.

808
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:44,300
 Sam, who would have thought you would have been barring the door for floor four?

809
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:50,300
 Here in my house of many whores.

810
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:55,300
 Can I get by you, please?

811
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,300
 No.

812
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,300
 Oh.

813
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,300
 Well, I guess this is where our tour ends.

814
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,300
 No more tours of floors for the four.

815
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,300
 You'll have to find out what's on floor four.

816
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:14,300
 I can almost guarantee you it's just more whores, but still.

817
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:18,300
 Don't forget to try the porridge.

818
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,300
 And pay scoops at checkout.

819
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:25,300
 I swear, honey, I go there for the porridge.

820
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:31,300
 And the conversations with Vincent Price.

821
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,300
 I eat porridge and I talk to Vincent Price.

822
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:38,300
 You should come.

823
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:45,300
 The Nevada DMV doesn't know what happens to snitches, apparently.

824
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,300
 No, no, what happened?

825
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:54,300
 The Nevada DMV has started a program to what they say.

826
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,300
 Oh, I do know about this.

827
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,300
 This is fucked up.

828
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,300
 This is stupid.

829
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,300
 So Nevada has a problem.

830
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,300
 Especially Las Vegas has a problem on the roads.

831
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,300
 And that is unregistered vehicles.

832
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,300
 Unlicensed.

833
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:15,300
 Yeah, yeah, no license plate on them, nothing.

834
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:22,300
 And so the Nevada DMV, I suppose in conjunction with Metro or whatever,

835
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,300
 they have started a program where it's just a tattle program.

836
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:31,300
 They have a thing on there where you can now report cars that are unregistered

837
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,300
 to the Nevada DMV.

838
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:39,300
 And I saw a report today that they got 1,500 reports on their first day.

839
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,300
 Jesus, it's 1,500.

840
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,300
 I don't know.

841
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,300
 But there's nothing to be done about this.

842
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:52,300
 I think this is just a thing about people leaving old cars in their yard.

843
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,300
 I mean, that's some of it.

844
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,300
 Some of it is absolutely neighbors snitching on neighbors.

845
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,300
 I'm tired of that junker sitting there.

846
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,300
 There's a lot of that.

847
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:07,300
 But there's also just a lot of just snitching.

848
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,300
 That's not a good idea.

849
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,300
 It's a very bad idea.

850
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,300
 They don't fucking know that snitches get snitches.

851
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,300
 Ain't nobody told them.

852
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,300
 It's a terrible idea.

853
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:24,300
 The DMV was basically dismantled through a hack and took a month to recover.

854
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,300
 And they're like, all right, now that we're back, let's start ratting people out.

855
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,300
 Sorry, we couldn't get shit done for a month.

856
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,300
 I've been getting hammered for this real ID thing.

857
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,300
 I traveled with a passport.

858
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,300
 Do you not have a real ID yet?

859
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,300
 No, so I made an appointment to get a real ID and I went in.

860
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,300
 They're like, oh, we got hacked.

861
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,300
 We can't get you set up right now.

862
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,300
 We have to make another appointment for you.

863
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,300
 They're like, we're not recovered from the hack yet.

864
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,300
 And I was like, oh, well, I'm glad you guys kept the appointments.

865
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,300
 Thanks for letting me know before I got here.

866
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:00,300
 What a bunch of, yeah, our appointments didn't get hacked, but everything else did.

867
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,300
 Yeah, but sure.

868
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,300
 Let's do that.

869
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:11,300
 The Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles has recently added a Nevada Registration Spotter Report Forum on their website,

870
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:17,300
 which is intended solely for the purpose of reporting motor vehicles operating on Nevada roadways with expired,

871
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:24,300
 invalid or no registration, including Nevada residents operating vehicles with illegal out-of-state plates.

872
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,300
 So they want neighbors to report on each other.

873
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:31,300
 They say that this report is not intended for abandoned vehicles, traffic violations.

874
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:36,300
 Oh, and vehicles, parking violations or other DMV related issues.

875
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:41,300
 This is only supposed to be for cars on the roadway without registration.

876
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,300
 And we all know that's not the only thing that's getting reported.

877
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:48,300
 Yeah. Why? Yeah. Why doesn't make any sense.

878
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,300
 I never understood driving around Las Vegas.

879
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,300
 You will honestly see tons of vehicles with just no license plates.

880
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:02,300
 And every time I would see that, I'm like, why would a police officer not pull that person over immediately?

881
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:09,300
 And a friend of mine got pulled over for fucking expired registration just the other night.

882
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:16,300
 And I was like, how? Why? Why did this cop decide to finally pull you over for expired registration

883
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:22,300
 when there must have been 20 cars that drove past while you were stopped without license plates at all?

884
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:31,300
 Yeah. I know that happened to you, Jacob, to another friend of yours when your friend's son was in your car.

885
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:39,300
 That is true. I do. I had a friend of mine's son was in my car with me and then my friend got pulled over in his son.

886
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:47,300
 And me and his son went, huh. Jacob had to talk my son off the ledge.

887
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:53,300
 I was like, no, no, no. Everything's going to be fine. Everything's just fine.

888
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,300
 Yeah, galactic president scooper star is exactly right.

889
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:00,300
 It's like, hmm, what else does the government ask people to start informing on their neighbors?

890
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,300
 I'm sure it's fine. Yeah. It is maybe not historically relevant in any way.

891
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:10,300
 It's baby steps to some real bullshit, y'all. Just crack a book once in a while, you motherfuckers.

892
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:15,300
 All I do want, though, is to see all of these reports roll again.

893
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,300
 I just want to see just every single report that comes in.

894
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,300
 I want to see how it's worded. I want to see the report itself. I want to see all of this.

895
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:31,300
 The closest like citizens arrest. We've really gotten here, which is like I'm doing a citizen's arrest.

896
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:38,300
 I'm doing a license plate to a concealed carry for your expired registration.

897
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:45,300
 How about that? I mean, what this is going to this is going to cause big problems.

898
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,300
 And I tell you what it's going to do.

899
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:53,300
 This is going to cause a fight where somebody is going to get killed in like a grocery store parking lot.

900
00:36:53,300 --> 00:37:00,300
 Because two motherfuckers are going to start arguing and one of them is going to start like reporting it on the on the Web or something like that.

901
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,300
 And then somebody is going to get fucking stabbed in a parking lot.

902
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:08,300
 Yeah, all over all over this shit. Yeah, it's going to be bad.

903
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:15,300
 This is a bad idea. If anybody from the Nevada DMV is listening and I know you are.

904
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:19,300
 This is a bad idea. I mean, we're the number one Vegas parking and weather podcast.

905
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:24,300
 So, of course, that's right there. Of course, we are where the cars get parked parking and weather.

906
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:31,300
 No one does it better than I see, especially not the Nevada DMV. No. Get your shit together.

907
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,300
 Absolutely right, Jacob. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

908
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:41,300
 I also have been seeing through the national media what little trickles down that Vegas had some serious flooding this last week.

909
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:46,300
 Oh, yeah, we had a we had a crazy rainstorm blow through here. We had hail at the house.

910
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:55,300
 We had we had hail at my house. Yeah, it was it was this does not sound like much anywhere else.

911
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:02,300
 But but we had over an inch and a half of rain in about an hour. Get the fuck out of that.

912
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:07,300
 No, that's that's insane. I didn't realize it was that major for for Vegas.

913
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:12,300
 That's the death. Yeah. Yeah, that's why I know multiple people died. People died.

914
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,300
 Right. Yeah. Yeah. Multiple people died. They found multiple bodies drowned.

915
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:21,300
 Yeah, yeah. All that horrible stuff. Yeah, it was it just like it came out of nowhere.

916
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:30,300
 It blew in and it was hard. Apparently it was off of a tropical storm. Priscilla, I think they said it was a remnant of a tropical storm.

917
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:37,300
 Queen of the desert. I believe so. Queen of the Mojave. Yep. Well, she did bring water. Yes.

918
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,300
 She left her parents. That's a good question.

919
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:51,300
 Galactic president scooper star McScoops a lot was the obelisk damaged in my in my backyard. The obelisk has been put away. So so thankfully the obelisk was safe.

920
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:59,300
 Good, good, good. Weirdly, my wife didn't want an obelisk just sitting in the backyard year round

921
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:04,300
 because she is a party pooper. Clearly.

922
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:11,300
 Boo her boo my wife. Don't boo my wife. She'll punch you.

923
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:15,300
 When we last left off, Matt was just getting a comedy club with Rondell. Yes.

924
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:20,300
 So Ronnie Sheridan goes in and this is a different open mic. It's a comedy open mic.

925
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:24,300
 No, it's not. It's a regular lineup. It's a lineup. Oh, it's a regular show. Yeah. Yeah.

926
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:30,300
 This is after the magic open mic. This is regular comedy show Friday night in Boston. We're not doing open mics on Friday night in Boston.

927
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:35,300
 We're doing we're doing a lineup of closed mics. Boston's best.

928
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:41,300
 Colin Quinn. Just Colin Quinn.

929
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:47,300
 We can get you a spot up on stage because right now we just have Colin Quinn.

930
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:59,300
 We actually need openers and features as well. Colin Quinn on a series of iPads on sticks around comedy clubs all across Boston.

931
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:07,300
 That'd be great. Colin Quinn performing at every comedy club in Boston simultaneously.

932
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:15,300
 We're in a college town. And so the comedians are all like 30s, you know, late 20s, early 30s, kind of folks.

933
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:22,300
 Collegiate. Rondell gets up and he announces that he is 67 years old.

934
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:32,300
 And he starts doing bits and he just plows through like 15 minutes of just assassinating, just fucking killing and crushing across the thing.

935
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:40,300
 He finds this one guy. He did a little crowd work. He finds this one guy and he's like, he goes, what do you do?

936
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:46,300
 He's like, I'm an MMA fighter. And he's like, oh, shit, I should stop talking to you.

937
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:57,300
 And he goes, what's your name? And the guy says, I think I have it right. He goes, Letremaine Montgomery.

938
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,300
 It's like the old Key and Peele bit.

939
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:06,300
 Rondell goes, man, could you have a blacker name than that?

940
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:12,300
 He goes, ain't nobody going to fight you. No one's going to sign up to fight Letremaine Montgomery.

941
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:17,300
 That's it. You're the champ.

942
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:22,300
 He goes, you're a legit fighter. He goes, yeah, I have my Texas fighting license.

943
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,300
 Oh, oh, that is legit.

944
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:35,300
 And the whole crowd roars. He goes, do you keep that with your fishing license, with your hunting license, with your fishing only using guns license?

945
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,300
 Fishing only using guns.

946
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,300
 It is a special license.

947
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:45,300
 Rondell killed it. And then, man, people lined up. We couldn't leave.

948
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,300
 We couldn't leave. People just lined up. Everybody wanted a photo with them.

949
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:54,300
 We finally get them out of there. We pile into a pub. Everyone in the bar makes out who he is.

950
00:41:54,300 --> 00:42:01,300
 And the waitstaff is all taking photos with him. I had no idea how popular the show.

951
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,300
 I just said it.

952
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,300
 That's So Raven?

953
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,300
 That's So Raven was.

954
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:10,300
 It's a different generation. It's after all of our time. I'm aware of it.

955
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,300
 It's the choice of a new generation.

956
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:16,300
 Since then, I've been hanging out with Rondell. So we went out yesterday in Charleston, South Carolina.

957
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,300
 Oh, that's awesome.

958
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:22,300
 And I'm just going past Paul's joke.

959
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,300
 Good, good. I gave it a thumbs down.

960
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:29,300
 We were stopped constantly. I got on the boat without him for like an hour.

961
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:39,300
 Then I came at him back and we walked from the boat and I walked right back the path that I walked up and we couldn't catch up to our friends because he was being stopped so often by people who were filming out that it was him.

962
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:45,300
 And I was like, my God, I had no idea how famous this guy was.

963
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:49,300
 He's been an absolute gem. We've just been hanging out and joking around on the boat. It's been so fun.

964
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,300
 Are you parked next to Disney cruise ships, too?

965
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,300
 We're not.

966
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,300
 I was going to say, because that would tip it over to like insane.

967
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:03,300
 Everywhere we parked, we've been by ourselves.

968
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,300
 Why would the Disney thing be a different thing?

969
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,300
 Because it shows on Disney Channel.

970
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,300
 Oh, I see.

971
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,300
 That's how Raven is a Disney thing.

972
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,300
 Gotcha, gotcha.

973
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:17,300
 Yeah, but so it's super fun. Super fun adventures with Rondell Sheridan.

974
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,300
 Yeah, nice. Yeah, nice.

975
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,300
 So did you get him a chip?

976
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,300
 Yep.

977
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,300
 Sure.

978
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,300
 Do you think we might be able to get him on the show sometime?

979
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,300
 Yes.

980
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,300
 I do want to get him on the show.

981
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,300
 Yeah.

982
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,300
 That'd be great.

983
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,300
 Yeah.

984
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,300
 He's not going to listen, but he'll come on.

985
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,300
 I don't care if he listens.

986
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,300
 Correct.

987
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,300
 Correct.

988
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:42,300
 I said that as a joke, but we all know it's just true.

989
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,300
 It's just true.

990
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,300
 Yeah.

991
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,300
 I'll tell you who else we might be able to get on the show sometime if we work really hard at it.

992
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,300
 And that's the following sponsor.

993
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:55,300
 Today's show is brought to you by Four Floors.

994
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,300
 No, I'm kidding.

995
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,300
 The fourth floor.

996
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:03,300
 Columbastro, private investigator in space.

997
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,300
 That's Columbastro.

998
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,300
 That is an old bit.

999
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:12,300
 That's from the Microscoop from 2021. So it is. It's requested from 2021.

1000
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,300
 Is this a bit from Geek Shack?

1001
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,300
 It is.

1002
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:19,300
 Next commercial.

1003
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,300
 Excuse me, excuse me.

1004
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:26,300
 I'm sorry to come into your space here.

1005
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:31,300
 I want to get into your airlock just for one minute.

1006
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:35,300
 I don't want to deplete any oxygen systems here.

1007
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,300
 Have I got just one more question there.

1008
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:48,300
 When you first encountered Mr. Zambalaxes, did you actually realize he was the president of this alien world

1009
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,300
 that you were hoping to invade?

1010
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:56,300
 Or was that just a coincidence that you two just happened to hit it off, he and your space daughter?

1011
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,300
 Do I need a space lawyer right now?

1012
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:06,300
 Look, sir, I'm not a professional in any sense of the word, but I like to watch, I like to listen, I like to hear.

1013
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:09,300
 Even in space, I can hear you scream, you know what I'm saying?

1014
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:18,300
 But look, OK, if you tell me that there's nothing to investigate here, I'm going to be on my way.

1015
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:27,300
 But you just let me know if I can park my shuttlecraft over on your aft docking port later.

1016
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,300
 I was just going to leave it there for a half hour or so.

1017
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:33,300
 One second. I'm space texting my space lawyer.

1018
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:36,300
 That's fine. That's fine. You go ahead and do that.

1019
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:41,300
 Future sounds, futuristic sounds as I type it.

1020
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,300
 Yeah, OK. Well, all right. Well, I'll let you know.

1021
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,300
 Hello, Matt Notley. I am your robot space lawyer. What can I do for you?

1022
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,300
 Got him on the line there.

1023
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:52,300
 I'm being questioned here by, what was it, Columbastro, you said?

1024
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:59,300
 Columbastro, I'm just a private detective, sir, out in space. That's, you know, kind of what I do.

1025
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:05,300
 Whatever you do, don't try to walk away from him. He will have one more thing he wants to talk to you about.

1026
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,300
 No, that can't be true. I'm going to walk away right now.

1027
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,300
 I mean, that seems a little presumptuous of your robot.

1028
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,300
 See you later.

1029
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:17,300
 Your robot. That's quiet air. But just one more thing before I do go.

1030
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,300
 I'm just going to float.

1031
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,300
 I told you so.

1032
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:24,300
 I can float here because you're low gravity. I get to float around.

1033
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:30,300
 But I did want to know, just want to, are you yourself, sir, an avid collector of phaser rifles?

1034
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,300
 Do you have a lot of phaser rifles in your home?

1035
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:37,300
 Do you keep those loaded? Do you keep the phaser ammunition separate from the phaser rifles?

1036
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:40,300
 Isn't it illegal to hold phaser rifles in your home?

1037
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:44,300
 Not at all. But, you know, you do want to have a safety precautions. You want to make sure that this...

1038
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,300
 Alright, I did it. You got me.

1039
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:50,300
 Columbastro wins again.

1040
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:55,300
 Enter eight scoops of checkout. Get some every time.

1041
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,300
 He broke me down.

1042
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:07,300
 I still think, like, we are not far away. I should fucking write that treatment, because I don't know if you know.

1043
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,300
 Do you know?

1044
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,300
 Do I know how much time is being made right now?

1045
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,300
 Yes.

1046
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:14,300
 Right. You're right. But...

1047
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,300
 Are you talking about the movement?

1048
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,300
 I'm talking about...

1049
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,300
 The Lumbo movement?

1050
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,300
 I'm talking about Catherine Janeway.

1051
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,300
 Captain Catherine Janeway.

1052
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:27,300
 What's that actress's name? I'm fucking blanking on her name.

1053
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,300
 Everybody drink, Catherine Janeway Jones.

1054
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:30,300
 No.

1055
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,300
 Catherine O'Hara.

1056
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,300
 Anyway, Kate Mulgrew. Thank you, chat.

1057
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:42,300
 So, I don't know if you know, but early in Kate Mulgrew's career, she portrayed none other than Lady Columbo.

1058
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:49,300
 So it's not that far to have a space Columbo happening.

1059
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,300
 She's a space detective.

1060
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,300
 I think it would be great. I would love to...

1061
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,300
 Lady Columbo.

1062
00:47:55,300 --> 00:48:00,300
 Let me text my space lawyer right now.

1063
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,300
 Get a hold of him.

1064
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,300
 He doesn't sound happy.

1065
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,300
 You rang, sir.

1066
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,300
 Yes. There's a Lady Columbo here.

1067
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,300
 Wants to talk to me about...

1068
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,300
 Calm yourself.

1069
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:18,300
 I've just got one more thing, please. Just give me one moment. Just one moment.

1070
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:25,300
 Oh, Jakote. Jakote, you are my rock. I can't...

1071
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:29,300
 You know what I need? I need a stiff cup of coffee. Hot.

1072
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:37,300
 What's going on with Seven? Where is she? I like that sparky young boy.

1073
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:42,300
 Did you see the movement to replace Christopher Columbus statues with Columbo statues?

1074
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:45,300
 Yes. Yes. And I'm 100% here for it.

1075
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,300
 Man.

1076
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,300
 It's a great idea.

1077
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:50,300
 I am watching Task on HBO.

1078
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,300
 Okay.

1079
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:57,300
 And that is a very dark, dark show. It's in the makers of Mayor of Easttown, which is already a very dark show.

1080
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,300
 So you've been able to stick with it. We bounced off so early.

1081
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:06,300
 It is so good. It is so depressing. And it is so dark that I get anyone...

1082
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,300
 It is so good at making me depressed.

1083
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:14,300
 Yeah. It is amazing acting about a very depressing area of our country.

1084
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,300
 Yeah.

1085
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,300
 It is so sad. And...

1086
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,300
 It's meth, right?

1087
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,300
 There's a thing with...

1088
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:27,300
 I mean, the plot line's a little meth-y, but I don't know.

1089
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,300
 Got him!

1090
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:34,300
 It's more of a history and science than meth.

1091
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,300
 Gotcha. Gotcha.

1092
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:43,300
 No, no, no. There's kilos of... I think it's heroin in it that play a key plot point.

1093
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:55,300
 But it more ends up being about is the system like other corrupt people in the system kind of thing.

1094
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:59,300
 But Mark Ruffalo just is Columbo. He just is Columbo.

1095
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,300
 He's just doing a Columbo impression.

1096
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,300
 He's channeling Columbo.

1097
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:08,300
 Exactly like Peter Falk, mosing in and out. He's an older, out of shape.

1098
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,300
 He definitely has the disheveled thing going on.

1099
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:14,300
 That's it. He's got this big disheveled hair, which is exactly like Peter Falk's hair.

1100
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,300
 Yeah. He's got frumpy, wrinkly shirts.

1101
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:20,300
 He's the guy who's been out of the field. He gets called back in the field because it's an emergency situation.

1102
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:26,300
 And so he gets called back to head of task force and he doesn't know who he can trust on his own force.

1103
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:32,300
 And so he does things where he starts questioning people, trying to break them down.

1104
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:37,300
 And I am laughing. I'm like, this is just... He's mosing in. He's aching.

1105
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:41,300
 You know? Just one more thing.

1106
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:44,300
 He ends up through plot points as having a head injury and a back injury.

1107
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:51,300
 And so he's just touching his head and mosing in and seeming kind of out of it and then questioning people and making them want to confess to things.

1108
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:59,300
 And I'm like, this is just... This is just secretly high-end Hollywood white trash Columbo at the same time.

1109
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:05,300
 This is just all... And it's really distracting because it's such a dead serious show.

1110
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,300
 I bet. Because he's so good.

1111
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:13,300
 Yeah. But no, it's a tough show to get. I love it, but it's a tough show to get through for sure.

1112
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:19,300
 If I wasn't on a cruise ship alone, constantly staying up from 4 o'clock in the morning watching stuff, I would do it.

1113
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:23,300
 I'm also watching Peacemaker, which I really love. Peacemaker is so good.

1114
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:28,300
 We just watched another episode of Peacemaker last night. This new season is kind of amazing.

1115
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:29,300
 Yeah.

1116
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:32,300
 The writing in this season is just really, really good.

1117
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:39,300
 Oh my God. There's a running gag. It is so ridiculous. Tim Meadows plays a character in this season.

1118
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:43,300
 Yes! It's so great.

1119
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:54,300
 And Tim Meadows says he has a condition called bird blindness, where he can't distinguish any kind of bird from any other kind of bird.

1120
00:51:54,300 --> 00:52:05,300
 And they find ways for this to come up. You forget that there's a bird in the equation and all of a sudden Tim Meadows talks and he just says something totally wrong.

1121
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:09,300
 And then everyone looks at him and is like, "Are you going to be prejudiced against my condition?"

1122
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,300
 My bird blindness.

1123
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:15,300
 You cannot use my disability against me.

1124
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:21,300
 His bird blindness is one of the funniest things. Whoever came up with that in the writer's room was just like, "Oh man."

1125
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:24,300
 It's probably James Gunn. I don't know.

1126
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:28,300
 I don't know anything else about his character and I don't care.

1127
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,300
 I know.

1128
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:45,300
 It's fine. I know he works for the agency in some capacity. I don't know what he does. I don't care. He is bird blind. Nothing else matters.

1129
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,300
 And they make it important to the plot.

1130
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,300
 I've got to see it.

1131
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:53,300
 It's not just an aside. It is plot crucial.

1132
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:57,300
 I love it so much. So good.

1133
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:00,300
 Every time it comes up, we just howl. It's great.

1134
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,300
 Yeah.

1135
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,300
 That sounds awesome.

1136
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:06,300
 Oh yeah. And gives everybody terrible nicknames too. That's true. That is true.

1137
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:12,300
 Yeah. But that's still, that's all fine. But yeah, I'm really enjoying that as well. Yeah.

1138
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:19,300
 Yeah. Also, we wanted to get into it, but holy shit. John Oliver is just perfect.

1139
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,300
 I have to catch up.

1140
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,300
 John Oliver's show is just perfect.

1141
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:27,300
 Yeah. I have to catch up. I was watching the season at South Park. I'm enjoying that.

1142
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,300
 Yep.

1143
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,300
 But I have to catch up on John Oliver.

1144
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:41,300
 Yeah. It turns out, and we all know this. We all comment on this every time it happens, but it turns out when the political leadership in the country is terrible, the comedy does get really good.

1145
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:45,300
 That is the upside to all these things is the comedy does get really good.

1146
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,300
 Yeah. Yeah. I have to.

1147
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:51,300
 Not good enough to make it worth it, but still good.

1148
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,300
 Sorry. I'm just getting a call. I have to take this.

1149
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,300
 It's Hollywood.

1150
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:55,300
 Excuse me.

1151
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,300
 Oh no. It's a space lawyer.

1152
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,300
 I'm sorry. Just got one question for you.

1153
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:06,300
 No. I'm doing a podcast right now. I can't, I'll have to call you back later.

1154
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,300
 Okay. You say that. Okay.

1155
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:12,300
 Oh, that was easy.

1156
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:14,300
 Hey, you guys want to do a little scoop mail?

1157
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,300
 Let's do a little scoop mail.

1158
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:19,300
 Kurt is texting me right now, so I'm texting him.

1159
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,300
 Fantastic.

1160
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,300
 Oh good.

1161
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:25,300
 Tell him I just brought up his awesome house full of bees bit.

1162
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:28,300
 I plugged his house full of bees bit special.

1163
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:33,300
 That's why he's texting. He's texting Matt to thank him for you bringing that up.

1164
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:36,300
 He suddenly saw a giant influx of bees.

1165
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,300
 I really do hope we get Kurt back on the show.

1166
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:42,300
 You don't know Paul, but he's my comedy partner and he loves the bee thing.

1167
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,300
 Yeah, exactly.

1168
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:48,300
 No, I hope we get Kurt on the show again sooner than later.

1169
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:51,300
 We got an email here from nincomscoop.

1170
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:56,300
 No, really. ICS is making me smarter.

1171
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,300
 That seems impossible.

1172
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,300
 What?

1173
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,300
 My family has decided to visit Japan next year.

1174
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,300
 We are all trying to learn some Japanese.

1175
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:07,300
 I have been taking a deep dive into learning the language because I've always wanted to and why the fuck not.

1176
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:15,300
 One thing about learning Japanese is learning the kanji, those logo graphic characters representing words and ideas.

1177
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,300
 I believe it's pronounced kanji.

1178
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,300
 Kanji, thank you.

1179
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:27,300
 There are tens of thousands of them and learning them you have to remember the concept and they usually have more than one pronunciation depending on context.

1180
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,300
 It's kind of a bitch to learn.

1181
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:34,300
 One helpful memorization technique is creating mnemonic pictures in your mind.

1182
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:38,300
 I've created a handful from ICS concepts.

1183
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,300
 Here's my favorite.

1184
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:48,300
 Oh, the kanji looks roughly like a man sitting in a car with what could be an arm sticking out.

1185
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,300
 That man is actually Matt.

1186
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,300
 He's got his hand out.

1187
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:58,300
 Oh, no, it's full of coins and he's about to throw it at another car shouting be the change.

1188
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:00,300
 This kanji means change.

1189
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,300
 Hey.

1190
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:08,300
 And on of the primary pronunciations is ka.

1191
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,300
 Thanks for the help, Matt, I guess.

1192
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,300
 Loving you all sexually.

1193
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,300
 That's nincompoop.

1194
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:16,300
 It's the least I could do, quite frankly, the least.

1195
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,300
 Literally.

1196
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:20,300
 Yeah.

1197
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,300
 We got one here from Big Sexy.

1198
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,300
 Hola, mi amigos.

1199
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:29,300
 I am loving the streaming and wanted to chime in on the red flag stories.

1200
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:33,300
 But I was in the lobby of a hospital waiting to see cardiologists at that moment.

1201
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,300
 So I didn't do it right then.

1202
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,300
 So I decided to write in.

1203
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:37,300
 I was dating this woman.

1204
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:40,300
 We'll call her Evelyn because that's her name.

1205
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:44,300
 And she was this beautiful, hard of hearing mother of two.

1206
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:48,300
 The hard of hearing part was new to me and it rekindled my interest in learning sign language.

1207
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,300
 Oh, we got two language emails right off the bat.

1208
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,300
 That's cool.

1209
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,300
 The red flags came from two different areas.

1210
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:58,300
 First, she was incredibly disorganized and her apartment showcased.

1211
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,300
 Things were everywhere with no rhyme or reason.

1212
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:04,300
 It made going to her place a nightmare for my OCD brain.

1213
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,300
 Books were piled on floors and dressers.

1214
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:10,300
 Clothes placed willy nilly and nothing in the kitchen made sense.

1215
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,300
 I just have to back up for just a second here.

1216
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,300
 Big Sexy, I might have just messed up your email.

1217
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,300
 I said it made it a nightmare for his OCD brain.

1218
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,300
 That isn't actually what he typed.

1219
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:27,300
 What he typed is his OC brain, so I don't know if he's referring to his Orange County brain or his OCD brain.

1220
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:31,300
 I suppose those are two very different things.

1221
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:37,300
 So Big Sexy, if you meant Orange County and I corrected it to OCD, I apologize.

1222
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,300
 It was hoarder status, but the kitchen made sense.

1223
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:43,300
 It was -- oh, sorry, sorry.

1224
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:44,300
 I'm reading two different lines here.

1225
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,300
 Books were piled on the floor and dressers.

1226
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,300
 Clothes placed willy nilly and nothing in the kitchen made sense.

1227
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:51,300
 It was hoarder status, but for books and clothes.

1228
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:57,300
 We couldn't have sex without me kicking over a stack of Judy Blume novels or self-help guides.

1229
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,300
 Whoa.

1230
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:05,300
 The bigger red flag flying from the highest flagpole, though, was her parenting.

1231
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:09,300
 First and foremost, like Paul and Jacob, I have no kids.

1232
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:15,300
 I did work at a boy's home at the time, so raising kids wasn't a new or unknown concept to me.

1233
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:20,300
 I also understood the notion of boundaries, which apparently her children did not.

1234
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:25,300
 As the boyfriend, I made zero attempt to play daddy at all.

1235
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:26,300
 Not my place.

1236
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:32,300
 Deeply known by me, having had several stepmoms in my life and knowing they couldn't tell me shit either,

1237
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:35,300
 I made no attempts save for one.

1238
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:38,300
 Evelyn and I had just returned from a dinner date and had leftovers.

1239
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:44,300
 As we put them in the refrigerator, Evelyn clearly said, "Do not eat my food."

1240
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,300
 Later, she went to run an errand.

1241
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:51,300
 As soon as she left, her daughter, around 16 at the time, promptly made her way to the fridge,

1242
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:55,300
 cracked open mom's food, and finished the meal.

1243
00:58:55,300 --> 00:59:00,300
 When she pulled it out, I spoke up and said, "Hey, your mom said not to eat her food."

1244
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:03,300
 I did feel some kind of way since I paid for the meal.

1245
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:08,300
 Her daughter said, as most teens would, "Don't worry about it, and you aren't my dad."

1246
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:09,300
 Oh.

1247
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:10,300
 Wow.

1248
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:14,300
 I went via the boys' home to pick my battles with the youths wisely.

1249
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,300
 This was not worth the fight.

1250
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:17,300
 No.

1251
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,300
 I did, however, mention it to their mom when she returned.

1252
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:22,300
 Oh, snitches, baby, snitches.

1253
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:27,300
 Big sexy working for the Nevada DMV now.

1254
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:31,300
 I did, however, mention it to her mom when she got home, and instead of reprimanding her daughter,

1255
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:34,300
 she said it happens all the time and she just let it go.

1256
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:39,300
 Growing up, that would have been a stern discussion and punishment in my home.

1257
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:42,300
 The fact that it happened often said that her kids have little respect for rules

1258
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:49,300
 and that they would have zero respect for mine were we to get even more serious and/or get married,

1259
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:52,300
 which is why Evelyn gave me the ultimatum.

1260
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:58,300
 Which is why when Evelyn gave me the ultimatum, either this was moving to marriage or we needed to break up,

1261
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:01,300
 there was no hesitation when I said, "Well, I guess we're done."

1262
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:02,300
 Yeah.

1263
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:04,300
 Which took her by surprise.

1264
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,300
 She walked it back, but it was too late.

1265
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:10,300
 Decision made, each of my relationships has had red flags.

1266
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,300
 Sometimes it was me.

1267
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:16,300
 Luckily, the red flags around my current relationship were able to be overcome,

1268
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:18,300
 and our marriage is wonderful.

1269
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:20,300
 Glad you snuck that in there, big sexy.

1270
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:24,300
 Currently in the running for America's favorite couple vote on Facebook.

1271
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:25,300
 Shameless plug.

1272
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:29,300
 Fucking you in the face and ignoring your boundaries, that's big sexy.

1273
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,300
 Thanks, big sexy.

1274
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,300
 Thanks, big sexy.

1275
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:36,300
 Yep, those are things.

1276
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:39,300
 That's tough.

1277
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:46,300
 I have not had that situation myself, but if any of you have seen Toast of London,

1278
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:51,300
 one of my all-time favorite BBC comedies with Matt Barry,

1279
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:55,300
 holy shit, there's a hoarder girlfriend that he gets.

1280
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:58,300
 God damn, it's remarkable.

1281
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:06,300
 They have to crawl into her bedroom over just 10 feet high newspapers and shit.

1282
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,300
 It's wild.

1283
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:09,300
 It's fucking wild.

1284
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,300
 It's such a funny episode.

1285
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,300
 I think it's like the second episode.

1286
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:15,300
 It's really early in the series.

1287
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:19,300
 If you guys haven't seen Toast of London, highly recommend.

1288
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:24,300
 If you're What We Do in the Shadows fans, jump on Toast.

1289
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,300
 It's so fucking good.

1290
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,300
 Winner scoop.

1291
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:32,300
 It's amazing what men will put up with for some strange.

1292
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:38,300
 It is true that we can be blinded by a lot of shit sometimes.

1293
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,300
 It is true.

1294
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:41,300
 That is true.

1295
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:43,300
 That is true.

1296
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:47,300
 Speaking of being blinded by shit, you ain't going no shit because it's Jock vs. Nerd.

1297
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,300
 That's your claim.

1298
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:50,300
 I'm here to debate it.

1299
01:01:50,300 --> 01:02:00,300
 Ladies and gentlemen, it is time.

1300
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:13,300
 Time for Jock vs. Nerd.

1301
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:16,300
 Of dating women with kids.

1302
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:20,300
 We have a scooper today from Bearded Scoop 3.

1303
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:27,300
 The categories are B&A song titles, B&A movie titles, B&A people and B&A potpourri.

1304
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,300
 Do I know what B&A means?

1305
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:31,300
 What's B&A?

1306
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:33,300
 Breaking and acquiring?

1307
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:35,300
 No.

1308
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:36,300
 Oh, before and after.

1309
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:37,300
 Oh, before and after.

1310
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:38,300
 OK.

1311
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:40,300
 Bearded Scoop sent an email along with it.

1312
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,300
 Yeah, this scooper is entirely before and after.

1313
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,300
 So before and after song titles, before and after.

1314
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,300
 What were the others?

1315
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,300
 Movie titles, people and potpourri.

1316
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:49,300
 Matt, you're up first.

1317
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:50,300
 Oh, wow.

1318
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,300
 This is going to be Matt's-- Matt's going to crush.

1319
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:53,300
 I know.

1320
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:55,300
 Matt's really good at the before and after ones.

1321
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:56,300
 Yeah.

1322
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:57,300
 All right.

1323
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:58,300
 Way to jinx me before 16 questions.

1324
01:02:58,300 --> 01:02:59,300
 All right.

1325
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:01,300
 Let's do before and after movie titles, please.

1326
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:03,300
 Let's see here.

1327
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:09,300
 Luke Skywalker gets to know his father while Marty McFly gets close to his mother.

1328
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:11,300
 Empire Strikes Back to the Future.

1329
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:12,300
 There it is.

1330
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,300
 Wow, he is so good at these.

1331
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:15,300
 Right?

1332
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:17,300
 Oh, Matt is so good at these.

1333
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:18,300
 Paul.

1334
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:21,300
 I will try song titles.

1335
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,300
 Let's see here.

1336
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:29,300
 A 1980 Queen hit and one of Kansas's most popular songs.

1337
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:32,300
 Oh, 1980.

1338
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:35,300
 I can't think of the song by Kansas now.

1339
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:38,300
 Yeah, as I say, there's a lot of Queen hits, but I don't know any.

1340
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:41,300
 I know Kansas has a bunch of hits, but I don't know them.

1341
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:45,300
 We will rock you.

1342
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:50,300
 Crazy Little Thing Called Love.

1343
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:52,300
 Fat Bottom Girls.

1344
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:55,300
 Fat Bottom Girls.

1345
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:59,300
 Yeah, I can't think of enough Kansas songs.

1346
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:01,300
 I'll have to pass.

1347
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,300
 That's me.

1348
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:06,300
 Let's see.

1349
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:11,300
 Crazy Little Thing Called...

1350
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:14,300
 Do you know any Kansas songs off the top of your head?

1351
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:16,300
 Like Carry On Wayward Son.

1352
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:20,300
 That's probably their biggest one.

1353
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:21,300
 They've got some others, too.

1354
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:22,300
 I don't know.

1355
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:23,300
 I'll pass.

1356
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:24,300
 Matt, you're really good at these.

1357
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:25,300
 What is it?

1358
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:29,300
 Pass, pass.

1359
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,300
 Another One Bites the Dust in the Wind.

1360
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:32,300
 Oh, that's a good one.

1361
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:33,300
 That is a good one.

1362
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:34,300
 That's a good one.

1363
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:36,300
 I was like, I don't know Kansas songs.

1364
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:39,300
 Dust in the wind.

1365
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,300
 Let's see.

1366
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,300
 I'll try People for 400.

1367
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:50,300
 When this Cleopatra actress gets criticized for her numerous relationships, she just shakes it off.

1368
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:53,300
 So this would be Elizabeth Taylor Swift.

1369
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,300
 That's right.

1370
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:55,300
 There you go.

1371
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,300
 Yeah.

1372
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:59,300
 Matt.

1373
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:01,300
 I'll go with People.

1374
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,300
 For 800.

1375
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:07,300
 Lead singer of Blondie meets the 33rd US president.

1376
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:09,300
 Debbie Harry Truman.

1377
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:14,300
 You were so good at these.

1378
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:15,300
 Paul.

1379
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:19,300
 I'll try Song Titles again.

1380
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:21,300
 Song Titles for 800.

1381
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:32,300
 A popular anti-establishment song by CCR and a major hit for Dusty Springfield.

1382
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:35,300
 Fortunate Son of a Bitch.

1383
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:36,300
 Oh, gotta be.

1384
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:38,300
 Yes.

1385
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,300
 Now it's Fortunate Son of a Preacher Man.

1386
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,300
 Oh, shit.

1387
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:46,300
 I was thinking of somebody completely different.

1388
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:47,300
 Oh, buddy.

1389
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:52,300
 I was thinking, now you're messing with Son of a Bitch.

1390
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:53,300
 By Dusty Springfield.

1391
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:56,300
 By Dusty Springfield, which is not Dusty Springfield.

1392
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:58,300
 I'll try Movie Titles for 800.

1393
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:02,300
 Rufus Sewell wakes up in a hotel bathroom with no memories,

1394
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:09,300
 is saved by a heavenly being that looks a lot like Nick Cage.

1395
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:10,300
 Oh, I don't know.

1396
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,300
 I guess I'll pass.

1397
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,300
 Matt.

1398
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:13,300
 Oh, shit.

1399
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:14,300
 OK.

1400
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:15,300
 Hold on.

1401
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:16,300
 Who is that actor?

1402
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:20,300
 This is from-- oh, man.

1403
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:21,300
 Boy.

1404
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:23,300
 Old brain, creaky-ly working.

1405
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:26,300
 Creak, creak, creak.

1406
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:28,300
 Tell the hamster to run faster.

1407
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:30,300
 Ah, it's not Inception.

1408
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:34,300
 It's-- what the hell is the first Nolan movie?

1409
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:35,300
 Memento?

1410
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:37,300
 Memento.

1411
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:38,300
 That's what I was thinking.

1412
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:39,300
 It says Memento.

1413
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:42,300
 Yeah.

1414
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:45,300
 But I'm trying to-- I can't remember that actor's name.

1415
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:47,300
 Memento.

1416
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:48,300
 He's, like, confidential, too.

1417
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:49,300
 So I'll pass.

1418
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:50,300
 Oh, is it names?

1419
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:51,300
 Is the names of the--

1420
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:53,300
 This is names, right?

1421
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,300
 I think so, yeah.

1422
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:57,300
 Is this movie titles or names?

1423
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:58,300
 I thought it was movie titles.

1424
01:06:58,300 --> 01:06:59,300
 I don't know.

1425
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:01,300
 Oh, no, I think it has movie titles.

1426
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:02,300
 Oh, so I was doing the wrong thing.

1427
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:05,300
 I already said pass.

1428
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:06,300
 Ah, well, Paul.

1429
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:09,300
 I'll have to pass.

1430
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:10,300
 Dark City of Angels.

1431
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:12,300
 Ah.

1432
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:14,300
 Oh, I wasn't wrong, anyway.

1433
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:15,300
 Dark City of Angels.

1434
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:17,300
 I don't know Dark City at all.

1435
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,300
 No, I thought--

1436
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:19,300
 Dark City is interesting.

1437
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:20,300
 I had the wrong movie.

1438
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,300
 Yeah.

1439
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,300
 Huh.

1440
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:26,300
 Matt, you're up.

1441
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:28,300
 Movie titles, please.

1442
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:29,300
 For $1,200.

1443
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:32,300
 The story of Westward and Bernstein--

1444
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:33,300
 Woodward.

1445
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:34,300
 --breaking the Watergate--

1446
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,300
 Woodward.

1447
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:36,300
 Westward.

1448
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:37,300
 The story of Woodward and Bernstein

1449
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:39,300
 breaking the Watergate scandal plus an agency

1450
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:43,300
 tasked with hiding aliens on Earth.

1451
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,300
 Oh, wait.

1452
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:47,300
 I keep on blanking out on that movie.

1453
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:52,300
 It's not-- it's not Deep Throat.

1454
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:53,300
 That's what I was thinking.

1455
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:55,300
 That's a whole different movie.

1456
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:56,300
 An excellent movie.

1457
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:57,300
 I'll pass.

1458
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:58,300
 A whole different one.

1459
01:07:58,300 --> 01:07:59,300
 I've got this one.

1460
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:00,300
 I'll pass.

1461
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:01,300
 Paul.

1462
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:03,300
 All the President's Men in Black.

1463
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:04,300
 Yes.

1464
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:05,300
 That's a good one.

1465
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:06,300
 That is a good one.

1466
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:07,300
 Yeah.

1467
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:08,300
 Paul, you're up.

1468
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:10,300
 I'll close out movie titles, please.

1469
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:11,300
 All right.

1470
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:12,300
 For $2,000.

1471
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:13,300
 Daily double.

1472
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:16,300
 Oh, now is my chance for redemption.

1473
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,300
 Redemption.

1474
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:21,300
 Tony Stark first dons his armor while Henry

1475
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:23,300
 Cavill plays Superman.

1476
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:26,300
 Iron Man of Steel.

1477
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:27,300
 Oh.

1478
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:28,300
 Yeah.

1479
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:29,300
 Iron Man of Steel.

1480
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:30,300
 That's it.

1481
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:31,300
 There you go.

1482
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:32,300
 Good job.

1483
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:34,300
 Oh, now Paul is commanding lead.

1484
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:35,300
 Yeah, score check.

1485
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:36,300
 Paul has 2,400.

1486
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:37,300
 Matt has 1,200.

1487
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:38,300
 I have 400.

1488
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:39,300
 How do I only have 400?

1489
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:41,300
 I guess I'm bad at this.

1490
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:43,300
 Matt's really good at this, though.

1491
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:46,300
 I'll do People for 1,200.

1492
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:49,300
 The director of Bullets Over Broadway plays

1493
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:52,300
 basketball with the answer.

1494
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:53,300
 Oh.

1495
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:56,300
 I don't know who the director of Bullets Over

1496
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,300
 Broadway is.

1497
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,300
 I will pass.

1498
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,300
 Matt.

1499
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:00,300
 Let's see.

1500
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:01,300
 That is Woody Allen-Averson.

1501
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:02,300
 There it is.

1502
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:03,300
 Oh, of course.

1503
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:06,300
 I'm mad that I didn't know that Woody Allen

1504
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:09,300
 directed Bullets Over Broadway.

1505
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:10,300
 Matt.

1506
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:21,300
 Let's go with People again.

1507
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:26,300
 People again for 2,000.

1508
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:29,300

1509
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:32,300
 Lord Protector of the United Kingdom.

1510
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:33,300
 Oliver.

1511
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:34,300
 What is it?

1512
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:38,300
 I don't know who the Lord Protector of the

1513
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:43,300
 United Kingdom is.

1514
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:45,300
 John Oliver Clothes Off.

1515
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:46,300
 John Oliver Clothes Off.

1516
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:47,300
 Good guess.

1517
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:51,300
 John Oliver Clothes Off.

1518
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:53,300
 Pass.

1519
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:54,300
 Paul.

1520
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:56,300
 John Oliver Cromwell.

1521
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:57,300
 John Oliver Cromwell.

1522
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:59,300
 Lord Protector of England.

1523
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:00,300
 Good job.

1524
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:01,300
 Bordens.

1525
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:02,300
 1592.

1526
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:03,300
 9/16.

1527
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:04,300
 28.

1528
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:05,300
 September.

1529
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:08,300
 It's a Monty Python song.

1530
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:09,300
 I've got those dates.

1531
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:11,300
 I'm sure I got those dates completely wrong,

1532
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:12,300
 but I remember.

1533
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:15,300
 Paul, you're up.

1534
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:16,300
 Popery.

1535
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:18,300
 For 400.

1536
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:21,300
 The sweetest and sparkliest breakfast cereal

1537
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:26,300
 races against the looming deadline.

1538
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:27,300
 What was this one?

1539
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:28,300
 Just Popery?

1540
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:29,300
 Popery.

1541
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:32,300
 Yeah.

1542
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:36,300
 Sparkliest breakfast cereal.

1543
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:41,300
 Oh, Cinnamon Toast Crunch Time.

1544
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:46,300
 Cinnamon Toast Crunch Time is just correct.

1545
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:47,300
 Wow.

1546
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:48,300
 Paul is also really good at these.

1547
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:51,300
 I was about to say Fruit Loops of Fury,

1548
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:55,300
 but then I was like, no, that's not what that...

1549
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:57,300
 I'll try song titles.

1550
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:58,300
 I don't know, for 1200.

1551
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:00,300
 I'm getting whooped in this.

1552
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:07,300
 A 1978 hit for Bob Seeger and the Moody Blues song about bedsheets.

1553
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,300
 Song about what?

1554
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:15,300
 And a song about bedsheets.

1555
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:17,300
 I have no idea.

1556
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:18,300
 Pass.

1557
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:19,300
 Well, this is so hard.

1558
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:20,300
 It's not going to figure out,

1559
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:23,300
 because what I have is I'm thinking of night moves,

1560
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:25,300
 and then there's nights and white satin,

1561
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:27,300
 but you can't do night moves and white satin,

1562
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:31,300
 so that doesn't work.

1563
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:34,300
 Nights and white satin moves?

1564
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:41,300
 No.

1565
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:44,300
 I don't know if it's a Seeger song that ends in...

1566
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,300
 Wait.

1567
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:50,300
 Was this the song that Bob Seeger did about werewolves?

1568
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:51,300
 Oh, no, I was getting confused.

1569
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:52,300
 He didn't do a song about werewolves.

1570
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:54,300
 He had the Silver Bullet Band.

1571
01:11:54,300 --> 01:12:00,300
 Yeah.

1572
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:02,300
 I'll pass.

1573
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:06,300
 Paul.

1574
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:10,300
 Moody Blues about bedsheets.

1575
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,300
 Pass.

1576
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:13,300
 Well, let's see.

1577
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:16,300
 Hollywood nights and white satin.

1578
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:18,300
 Hollywood nights and white satin.

1579
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,300
 Hollywood nights.

1580
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:21,300
 You're halfway.

1581
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:23,300
 Matt, you got song titles or potpourri?

1582
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:25,300
 I got to chase Paul here, yeah?

1583
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:29,300
 So I'll go 2,000 potpourri, please.

1584
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:31,300
 Okay.

1585
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:34,300
 A documentary series detailing this singer's sexual abuse

1586
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:36,300
 aired in 2019, hosted by the woman

1587
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:45,300
 who replaced Kathie Lee Gifford on live.

1588
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:47,300
 Whoa.

1589
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:49,300
 A documentary series?

1590
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:52,300
 Uh-huh.

1591
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:56,300
 Who replaced Kathie Lee Gifford?

1592
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:59,300
 Old Scrawny Arms.

1593
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:01,300
 I think she changed her name, though.

1594
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,300
 I just don't know. I'm gonna pass.

1595
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:09,300
 Paul.

1596
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:11,300
 Paul Mattingly.

1597
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:14,300
 I'm thinking it's not from Justin to Kelly Ripa.

1598
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:16,300
 A documentary series.

1599
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:24,300
 From Justin to Kelly?

1600
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:28,300
 Is that sexual abuse?

1601
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:32,300
 A documentary.

1602
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:34,300
 From Justin to Kelly, it was a different type of abuse.

1603
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:36,300
 Yeah, exactly.

1604
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:42,300
 It was like Kelly Ripa, Jack the Ripa, Kelly Jack the Ripa.

1605
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:44,300
 I don't fucking pass.

1606
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:51,300
 That said, it's Kelly Jack the Ripa.

1607
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:54,300
 A documentary series detailing this singer's sexual abuse

1608
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:59,300
 aired in 2019.

1609
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:02,300
 Was that Michael Jackson?

1610
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:04,300
 Michael Jackson Kelly?

1611
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:10,300
 Michael Jackson Kelly Ripa?

1612
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:14,300
 I can't remember what. Oh, maybe it's P. Diddy?

1613
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:19,300
 No, I think it's the sexual abuse of the singer.

1614
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:20,300
 Oh.

1615
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:22,300
 Yeah, that's what I'm assuming.

1616
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:24,300
 Oh.

1617
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:27,300
 So it'd be like if Megyn Kelly were a singer,

1618
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:29,300
 it'd be like Megyn Kelly Ripa.

1619
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:32,300
 Okay. Well, maybe that's it.

1620
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:35,300
 I don't think Megyn Kelly is a singer.

1621
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:37,300
 Who?

1622
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:39,300
 Is it R. Kelly there?

1623
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:40,300
 R. Kelly Ripa?

1624
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:42,300
 Oh, it's R. Kelly Ripa.

1625
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:44,300
 It's got to be R. Kelly Ripa.

1626
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:46,300
 R. Kelly Ripa.

1627
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:48,300
 R. Kelly Ripa.

1628
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:50,300
 We got there, y'all.

1629
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:52,300
 We got there, y'all.

1630
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:55,300
 We took a village on that one.

1631
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:57,300
 A big dumb village.

1632
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:59,300
 Paul, you're up.

1633
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:01,300
 Me, us three idiots.

1634
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:04,300
 I agree, Lauren, by the way, those points should be shared.

1635
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:06,300
 However, there's not a button for that, so they're mine.

1636
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:08,300
 Song titles, please.

1637
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:10,300
 Song titles for 2000.

1638
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,300
 Yeah.

1639
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:14,300
 A hit from The Doors, self-titled album,

1640
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:17,300
 and a 1970 hit for James Taylor.

1641
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:20,300
 Oh, boy.

1642
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:22,300
 Oh, God.

1643
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:28,300
 Like L.A. woman.

1644
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:30,300
 I don't know enough James.

1645
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,300
 It's the James Taylor part that's going to slow me down.

1646
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:36,300
 Oh, come on, let me light your fire and rain.

1647
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:39,300
 Oh, good job.

1648
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:42,300
 Light my fire and rain is absolutely right.

1649
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:43,300
 Yeah.

1650
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:44,300
 Damn it.

1651
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:46,300
 I had that one that I thought you were going to pass.

1652
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:47,300
 I did, too.

1653
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:49,300
 It's over, everyone.

1654
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:50,300
 Go home.

1655
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:51,300
 Isn't there one Daily Double left?

1656
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:53,300
 No, there's one more Daily Double still in there.

1657
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:54,300
 Yeah, it doesn't matter.

1658
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:55,300
 I think there is.

1659
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,300
 It doesn't matter.

1660
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:57,300
 Look at the scores, guys.

1661
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:58,300
 It only matters if Paul gets it and misses it.

1662
01:15:58,300 --> 01:15:59,300
 Right.

1663
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:00,300
 Oh, I understand.

1664
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:01,300
 Oh, which I don't think he can.

1665
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:02,300
 Oh, no, I can.

1666
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:03,300
 I just answered my last question.

1667
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,300
 Yeah, yeah.

1668
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:06,300
 That's over.

1669
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:07,300
 I'll do a potpourri for $1,200.

1670
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,300
 You could get the Daily Double.

1671
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:10,300
 There's the Daily Double.

1672
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:12,300
 If you get this, won't that take you over?

1673
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:13,300
 No.

1674
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:14,300
 Oh, OK.

1675
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:15,300
 Paul.

1676
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:16,300
 I have 2,400 points.

1677
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:17,300
 You have 6,800 points.

1678
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:19,300
 If I double my points, how many points do I have?

1679
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:21,300
 Yeah, but don't you also get the $1,200?

1680
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:23,300
 OK, brace yourself, everyone.

1681
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:25,300
 Paul's doing Kentucky math.

1682
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:27,300
 All right, go ahead.

1683
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:34,300
 The Steamy BDSM Best Seller if it were set in Big and Little Eddie's Crumbling Hampton's

1684
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:35,300
 Mansion.

1685
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:37,300
 Oh, my God.

1686
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:38,300
 Hilarious.

1687
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,300
 Oh, I got this.

1688
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:41,300
 I got this one, too.

1689
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:43,300
 I know the first part.

1690
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:46,300
 50 Shades of Grey.

1691
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:48,300
 There you go.

1692
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:51,300
 One more word.

1693
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:58,300
 It has to do with taking care of plants.

1694
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:02,300
 It does not take place in Madison Square.

1695
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:03,300
 Right.

1696
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:06,300
 Oh, OK.

1697
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:10,300
 50 Shades of Grey Basketball.

1698
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:16,300
 Oh, boy.

1699
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:17,300
 Grey Garden.

1700
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,300
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1701
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:21,300
 All right.

1702
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:22,300
 We really helped Jacob today.

1703
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:23,300
 This has been a good.

1704
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:24,300
 This has been a good day.

1705
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:25,300
 We really helped Jacob a lot today.

1706
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:26,300
 We did.

1707
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:30,300
 Matt Closenhouse, the category and the game, potpourri for 800.

1708
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:31,300
 If I get this right.

1709
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:33,300
 In second place, it takes a village.

1710
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:34,300
 If I get this right, I'm in third.

1711
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:37,300
 And if I lose, I'm in third.

1712
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:38,300
 Yep.

1713
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:39,300
 High stakes.

1714
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:40,300
 Prince is iconic.

1715
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:43,300
 And if I pass it to Jacob and he gets it, he's in second.

1716
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:44,300
 Maybe he loses.

1717
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:46,300
 He's in second.

1718
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:48,300
 Or if you pass it to Paul and he misses, he's still in first.

1719
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:49,300
 Yeah, it's high stakes.

1720
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:53,300
 But if he gets it, he's in first.

1721
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:54,300
 Prince is iconic.

1722
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:58,300
 Movie slash song needs to reschedule for another time.

1723
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:02,300
 Oh, oh.

1724
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:04,300
 Bassey just typed it in.

1725
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:05,300
 Purple rain check.

1726
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:06,300
 Thank you for that.

1727
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:07,300
 Just type it in the chat.

1728
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:08,300
 There you go.

1729
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:10,300
 Much easier game if we just do that all the time.

1730
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:13,300
 I was I was thinking something like under the cherry moon.

1731
