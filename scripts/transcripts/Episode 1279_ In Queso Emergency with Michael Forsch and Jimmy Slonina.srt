1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
 "We're not privy to the Twitch chat, when we switch that off of our stack."

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,760
 This is my favorite part of the show, this is the part of the show where we thank you,

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,560
 the Ice Cream Truck Drivers!

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,560
 Thank you so much Ice Cream Truck Drivers!

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,000
 It's crazy, we have a new list, I can't figure out how to look at all of it, who can say

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,600
 what's going to happen in the future, but hopefully you don't even hear this and you

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,240
 just hear me thanking people.

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,120
 In case you don't, I decided to put this hilarious anecdote in right here.

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,460
 If you want to become an Ice Cream Truck Driver, and I hope you do, preachingfun.com, preachingfun.com

10
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,720
 is where you're going to sign up to be an Ice Cream Truck Driver, and who knows, the

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,880
 life you save may be your own!

12
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,880
 And now, a program.

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,400
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an Ice Cream Social?

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,400
 Yeah, I'd love to!

15
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,400
 Great!

16
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,400
 Let's go!

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:09,760
 We have some guests here in the churn today, Michael Fortune, Jimmy Somina from A-List

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,760
 Casting, the web series.

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,760
 Woo!

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,760
 It's true!

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,760
 Yee-haw!

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,920
 It's time for Matt Mattingly's Ice Cream Social, sitting in Las Vegas, that's Matt

23
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,680
 Donnelly, sitting in Pittsburgh, PA, that's Paul Mattingly, also in Vegas, it's me, Jacob,

24
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,680
 the audio guy.

25
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,680
 We're preachingfun.

26
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,680
 Aww yeah!

27
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,960
 But before we get started, fuck Landman right in the neck.

28
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,200
 Fuck it, fuck that show, fuck that fucking piece of shit show.

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,760
 I'm so happy that we didn't dive into this season from what I'm hearing about this season.

30
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,680
 This season's been terrible, many people have been writing about it, but they did a scene,

31
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,480
 okay, this is the second to last scene, the series is about to end, and they spend, again,

32
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
 this is a show about--

33
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,480
 The whole series?

34
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,480
 Does the end end?

35
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,960
 No, it should be, but no, it won't, it will go on.

36
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,480
 We're heading to the end of season two.

37
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:10,800
 This is a show that is about an oil company trapped in doing business with a drug cartel,

38
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:22,120
 and the episode nine of a ten episode season, it spends 90% of it with really deep conversations

39
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,280
 about relationships and about their daughter going to college and all this other stuff.

40
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,680
 Now that's just a big waste of a premise, but in this episode, this is things, I watch

41
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,400
 this show because it is mediocre, I watch this show because it's easy to watch some

42
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,900
 of it and go to bed, that's why I watch it.

43
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:47,280
 So I'm watching it, and the daughter goes to college, and it's this really sweet moment,

44
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,720
 and she even makes a little prayer gesture and then opens up her door and walks inside

45
00:02:51,720 --> 00:03:01,880
 her first dorm room, and they have written a character to be a Charlie Kirk, every liberal

46
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,280
 valued person becoming a nightmare possible.

47
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,320
 It is a trans roommate who says that they are vegan, they can't hear certain words

48
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,280
 because it's triggering, they said they have to meditate, they have a pet muskrat, they

49
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:29,120
 have to take every possible thing that you could, every shitty liberal stereotype, here's

50
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,560
 all, and not even stereotypes, stereotypes is the wrong word because it's not even stereotype,

51
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,280
 because trans isn't a stereotype, but they just look at that and go like, well trans

52
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,120
 is a problem, so we're going to make this into a list of problems.

53
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:50,040
 Yeah, they took everything, any kind of liberal value and made it an antagonist, and tried

54
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,920
 to make it an assault on the daughter, and they literally have the mother come in to

55
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,240
 save the day where she rents a hotel, says invite all of your cheerleader friends because

56
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,840
 the daughter's going to be on the cheerleading squad.

57
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,760
 They literally sit there sipping margaritas, okay, everyone's underage except for the mother,

58
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,760
 they're all sitting there sipping margaritas, saying this is what college should be like,

59
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,120
 and then talking about the roommate and saying she's just unhappy with herself, so they purposely

60
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,800
 misgender the roommate, and then lecture each other at the pool, saying, you know, basically

61
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:25,160
 saying that if you have liberal values, you have no fun, you have no friends, but if you,

62
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:32,760
 you know, just hate all those things, and just value totally being selfish and fun,

63
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:38,840
 life works out for you, and I'm supposed to go to bed, and instead I am fucking livid

64
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:46,360
 and angry that this fucking, for no reason, just multiple shots, anti-trans, multiple

65
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:54,520
 shots across the badges, no reason, not for no reason, fair, fair. There's a reason. There

66
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:01,920
 are several PSI ops going on right now, baby, but this is it. Like I get it. Like we watch

67
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,960
 entertainment to give ourselves brief respite from this hellscape of issues that we were

68
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,460
 constantly assaulted with from the time we wake up to the time we go to bed, right? And

69
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,760
 on the one hand, we shouldn't be so concerned with the news, and on the other hand, real

70
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,520
 terrible shit is happening, and it is affecting people. So where do we find a balance? I don't

71
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,720
 know, but one place to try to find balance is like for an hour before I go to bed, right?

72
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,960
 Can I make a recommendation as to my bedroom viewing routine? Just your own penis where

73
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,680
 you put googly eyes on it, and you just keep wiggling it around?

74
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:39,920
 Step one, because Bobbo, that's his name, Bobbo is always watching along, and he can't

75
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
 watch without his eyes.

76
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,420
 And before you do the job, you gotta put on the uniform.

77
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,520
 You gotta put the googly eyes on, or Bobbo is blind. And a blind Bobbo, nobody wants

78
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,520
 to see that.

79
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,520
 That's not helpful, right?

80
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:57,160
 Anyway, I strap Bobbo's eyes on, and I throw on Tubi. And Tubi has the giant selection

81
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,160
 of mystery science theater and rift tracks, and that's all I do. I start a mystery science

82
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,580
 theater or rift tracks and let it play in the background forever. It's a mediocre film.

83
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:13,880
 If it has anything problematic in it, it is being lampooned by voices of reason, who happened

84
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:19,200
 to be based out of Minnesota, by the way.

85
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,920
 Mystery science theater was from Minnesota. That's where that all jumped off. That brilliant

86
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:32,160
 stuff. So that's how I sooth myself to sleep every night, by watching old episodes of mystery

87
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,560
 science theater and rift tracks that I have seen hundreds of times, and it's wonderful.

88
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,560
 Yeah.

89
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,080
 I will. Anything's better than what I'm doing. So I can't say whether I do or don't like

90
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,360
 your idea, Paul, because I'm not a good judge of character as to how to spend an evening.

91
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,360
 So great.

92
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,480
 The best part about it, Matt, is that, especially with the rift tracks, you've got the voices

93
00:06:53,480 --> 00:07:02,320
 of the guys who are very left leaning. For the most part, Mike's not, but still he rolls.

94
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,880
 I used to just watch mediocre dramas because comedy can get me into my analytical brain,

95
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:13,480
 which makes it not shut off. And so I end up in a joke construction kind of whatever

96
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,840
 and I can just stay up for hours and hours and hours and hours.

97
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,840
 Gotcha.

98
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,840
 So that's usually why I try to watch-

99
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,920
 I think that's the best thing about rift tracks is because what you're watching is not funny,

100
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,000
 but they make it silly.

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 And so-

102
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,720
 Well, I tell you what, I can watch. I can watch season two of A-List Casting.

103
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,720
 I say that's the best thing about our show, too.

104
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
 Oh, yes.

105
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
 The best thing about our show is that it's not funny.

106
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
 The best alternative to Landman out there.

107
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,720
 A-List Casting beats Landman, hands down.

108
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,000
 I haven't even watched season two. It's already better. There's season two's definitely better

109
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,560
 than the season two of Landman. I haven't even watched it.

110
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,640
 Definitely.

111
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,000
 Is it out yet, or are you just about to roll out episodes? Where are we at from the sake

112
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,560
 of a viewer, boys?

113
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,600
 We have five episodes out, so we have only three more. So you have some catching up to

114
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
 do, Mr. Donnelly.

115
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,000
 A deal. A deal. Clearly. My schedule is now open. So there you go.

116
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 There you go.

117
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 No problem.

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,560
 Your viewing schedule has opened up.

119
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,080
 So remind our audience about what your show is and where people watch it.

120
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:18,880
 Absolutely. We are A-List Casting. Jimmy, our esteemed actor here, who keeps randomly

121
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:26,440
 changing his wallpaper and currently has a massage table.

122
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,760
 That's exciting. Who's? Never mind. I'm not even going to ask who.

123
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,880
 I've been in that spa. That's Happy Beginnings. I know that place.

124
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:41,480
 Happy Beginnings is where A-List Casting season two is located. Happy Beginnings.

125
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,480
 Happy Beginnings.

126
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,760
 I mean, not that I'm overly familiar with the industry, but I'm guessing that would

127
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:52,800
 work actually better, right? Like, I think it's way more comfortable than a casting couch.

128
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,880
 Let's just go with that.

129
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,240
 Let's get that crazy part out of the way. And then now I can really relax in a massage.

130
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,640
 Why put it at the end?

131
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,000
 Fall asleep.

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,520
 A-List Casting has nothing to do with that.

133
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:18,240
 Okay, but I'm just going to say you're missing the marketing.

134
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,200
 It's actually about a show about two casting directors and their assistant who have been

135
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:30,440
 blackballed by Hollywood. And now they are stuck in Las Vegas because when Hollywood

136
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:40,480
 spits you out, Vegas sucks you in.

137
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,480
 That is Happy Beginnings' slogan.

138
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,480
 What are you talking about?

139
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,960
 That's true. I mean, you guys are writing season three as we speak right now.

140
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:58,680
 Jimmy plays Roger, and Roger is the owner of Happy Beginnings. No, Roger, Jimmy started

141
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:10,040
 out as a sad actor in the pilot episode. And we loved him so, so much in the pilot episode

142
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,880
 that we gave him a name. And he's been a series regular ever since.

143
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,120
 You got Urkels, buddy. You got Urkels. Look at you go.

144
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,360
 Oh, baby. Did I do that?

145
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:28,320
 Yes, it's a very proud day. You know, I'm a classically trained actor. I studied

146
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:37,280
 Shakespeare, Chekhov, decorated with awards. And now here I am dressing up as a clown and

147
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:47,300
 playing the sad actor before I actually get my name. So finally got my name and it's Roger.

148
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,800
 Is there any Rogers? Do we know any like actual Rogers in the wild these days?

149
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
 I know a Roger.

150
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:59,080
 I mean, there's the American dad alien. And that's the other one that I could think

151
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,640
 of. Yeah, those two, the guy that I know and the American dad alien guy.

152
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,440
 Jimmy, I am stunned by this question. I have to actually look at my contacts whether I

153
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,840
 actually have a Roger in my... Roger Whitaker.

154
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:17,360
 Roger Whitaker. American treasure. Actually, I think he's English. English treasure. Roger

155
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:24,320
 Whitaker. Do I know Roger Whitaker? Yeah, the only Roger that popped up in my phone is the one that I mentioned.

156
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,760
 He is the only Roger that I have in my contacts.

157
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,220
 You guys are acting as squirrely as Jimmy just asked the same question over and over

158
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:35,280
 again while you guys continue to stretch the parameters of the question.

159
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,840
 Roger Stone, I do not have in my Rolodex.

160
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,480
 Do you get a Roger ring at the massage parlor?

161
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,040
 Roger Dodger.

162
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
 Happy Roger.

163
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,600
 Roger Dodger on my Todger.

164
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,000
 Don't have anyone with a first name Roger in my contacts.

165
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,940
 Let me shout out to Roger.

166
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,960
 That's it. I'm going to make another kid. I'm gonna name him Roger. The market's wide open.

167
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:06,880
 I do want to say that his name almost was Kroger because when we were writing it, I

168
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:15,000
 mistyped Roger and my creative partner, Zach, loved that it was Kroger. And he was like,

169
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:24,480
 I love it. His name is going to be Kroger. I can rock Kroger. I can make Kroger work.

170
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:31,520
 Well Kroger is not only the grocery chain, but you've also got the Nickelback fame Kroger,

171
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,680
 right? Like that's Nickelback to Kroger.

172
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,760
 Thank you for bringing up the Nickelback thing, Paul.

173
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,160
 Jack Kroger is Nickelback, right?

174
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,240
 That's why I had to cut it back to Roger. I can't have three Krogers.

175
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,920
 Nowadays, he's known as Mrs. Avril Lavigne.

176
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,920
 Right.

177
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,920
 Yeah.

178
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,920
 Okay.

179
00:12:51,920 --> 00:13:02,600
 Thanks for that weird marriage history fact there, Paul. Yeah, Avril Lavigne married Nickelback.

180
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,640
 Did you guys not know that?

181
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:12,640
 I thought Avril Lavigne died. Didn't she die? Well, one of the Lavines died, but there's

182
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,680
 lots of clones of her.

183
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,680
 Okay.

184
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,200
 No, she didn't die. She got Lyme disease, right? Isn't she the one that got really afflicted

185
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,960
 with Lyme disease or is it somebody else?

186
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:27,160
 That's what's her name from Bikini Kill, who's married to a Beastie boy.

187
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,960
 I'm with Jimmy on this one. I think Avril Lavigne got Lyme disease.

188
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:38,640
 She might've, but Kathleen Hanna. Kathleen Hanna also got Lyme disease.

189
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,480
 Kathleen Hanna, the initial riot girl.

190
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,840
 What I'm taking from this is if you marry a musician, you get some kind of disease.

191
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,840
 That's what I'm saying.

192
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,840
 That's correct.

193
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,160
 Avril Lavigne contracted Lyme disease from a tick bite in 2014.

194
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,160
 Oh no.

195
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
 Yeah.

196
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,640
 Jimmy knows everything about Lyme disease.

197
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,000
 You got to stop this camping shit.

198
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,120
 I don't want to talk about Avril Lavigne except for her nickel-backed husband.

199
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,120
 Kroger.

200
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,120
 Who's apparently named Roger.

201
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,760
 Jimmy, who else got Lyme disease?

202
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,600
 Anybody who goes outdoors, which is why I never do it. I love the outdoors.

203
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
 Yes.

204
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:18,880
 That was really something that was brought to me as a selling point of just like, "Yeah,

205
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,160
 we go out for a walk. We go through the trees. We pet a deer and then we go home and check

206
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,160
 each other for ticks."

207
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,360
 I'm like, "I don't want type two entertainment. I don't want it."

208
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,440
 Who is giving you this entertainment pitch? This is a terrible salesperson.

209
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,800
 Yes, you're right. Terrible.

210
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:43,440
 Now, Jimmy, once your character went from a sad actor to Roger, did you start doing

211
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,880
 a lot of like, "Hmm, I don't know if my character would say it this way or hmm, will my character

212
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,440
 do that?" Roger doesn't seem like the kind of person who would like, "Did you really

213
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,880
 take ownership now of your scenes?"

214
00:14:53,880 --> 00:15:00,360
 Right, right. Yeah, no. I had plenty of notes. Well, I didn't give the notes. My agent gave

215
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:08,120
 the notes to Michael directly. I mean, I don't got time for that shit.

216
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,200
 Thank you again for being here, by the way.

217
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:18,000
 Oh, sure. It's my pleasure. The envelope is slipping through the door right now. My fee.

218
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,040
 It's on its way.

219
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:26,280
 Wait, we're paying him? Michael should be paying him. We're paying him?

220
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,280
 Oh.

221
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,320
 We didn't pay him in sandwiches.

222
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,520
 As long as the money and the sandwiches are green.

223
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,880
 Oh, this is going to be so awkward. I have them slipping a sandwich under your door right

224
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,880
 now.

225
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,880
 That would smell so good.

226
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,600
 It is a Capriotti sandwich. It's a big sandwich. It's not going to fit under the door. It's

227
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
 going to be a mess.

228
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,520
 So, Michael, I know you guys...

229
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,360
 Cranberry and stuffing just oozing out like play-doh.

230
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,360
 Terrible.

231
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,360
 Now I'm hungry.

232
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,360
 You guys have.

233
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,360
 Now I'm hungry.

234
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,360
 You guys have.

235
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,360
 Actually, we're ending the podcast right now.

236
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,360
 It was Bobby from...

237
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
 We're going to have lunch.

238
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:08,200
 Bobby's the best. You guys have a studio where you're filming a lot of this, but are we looking

239
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:15,400
 as you keep growing here to do more on-site possible shoots and things like that to make

240
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,160
 Vegas even more of a character as the series progresses?

241
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:24,920
 As I know, LA is quite the character in a lot of Los Angeles productions, so are we

242
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,960
 hoping to make that more of a reality?

243
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:33,520
 I know there were talks at one time of Las Vegas investing in some tax breaks for filming

244
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,480
 and stuff like that that may have just been pissed in the wind.

245
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,960
 Yeah, I don't think that's really come to fruition, but what's the ability to...

246
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,760
 How film-friendly is Vegas right now for what you're doing?

247
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:52,720
 Actually, I found filming in Vegas really embracing.

248
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,480
 It's actually a lot easier to get permits.

249
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,840
 It's a lot easier to find locations for people to film at.

250
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:06,320
 The problem is it costs a lot of money to transport an entire crew and to rehearse in

251
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,960
 a space and all that.

252
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:15,240
 As soon as A-List Casting gets funding from a bigger network, we'll definitely be able

253
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:22,620
 to take advantage of all these things, but currently we tend to pick one location outside

254
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:29,920
 of our casting office to go to, and this time it was a local dance studio where we filmed

255
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
 at.

256
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,560
 In the previous season, we went to Millennium Fandom Bar, which I'm sure you guys are familiar

257
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,560
 with.

258
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,560
 Yes, Fun Bar.

259
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,320
 We filmed there.

260
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,640
 I think that if we could afford it, I would absolutely do, but this is definitely an independent

261
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,240
 project where we pay Jimmy in massages and sandwiches.

262
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:58,640
 So if any locations want to let us film there for sandwiches and massages, then we're open

263
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,640
 to that.

264
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,240
 Well, Millennium Fandom Bar is a great example.

265
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,400
 That's a great example of local business chipping in and wanting to be represented on the screen.

266
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,040
 And an example of businesses that love massages and sandwiches.

267
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,800
 Jacob, what was that bar that you went to that turned into two bars the other night?

268
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:20,200
 Maybe those guys need some film, they look like they needed some promotion, right?

269
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,480
 Tony Two Bars.

270
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,480
 Tony Two Bars.

271
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,480
 Oh, Tony Two Bars.

272
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,240
 Oh, the guy dragged you over to a second bar for a drink and then left you high and dry.

273
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,240
 Yeah, yeah.

274
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:36,680
 The owner of this bar took us out of his bar to a different bar and seemed like he was

275
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,000
 going to buy us a drink and hang out with us in this other bar that he was taking us

276
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,840
 to and then just left.

277
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:50,200
 He was in the other bar for a grand total of two minutes.

278
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
 What were these locations?

279
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
 You don't want to mention either of these bars?

280
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
 It was the weirdest thing.

281
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,640
 Oh, I've forgotten both of the names of both bars.

282
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,640
 Oh my God.

283
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,640
 Well, see, that's one thing.

284
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,320
 Well, then they definitely need some promotion.

285
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,780
 So the second one used to be the downtown lounge, hot seat, hot seat, hot seat.

286
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,780
 That was it.

287
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,780
 It was the same word twice.

288
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,200
 It was a nice place too.

289
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,800
 Was it Boing Boing or something like that?

290
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,800
 No, it wasn't Boing Boing.

291
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,160
 We were calling it hot seat, hot seat.

292
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,160
 So it rhymes with that.

293
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,160
 Yes.

294
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
 All right.

295
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,160
 Hoochie.

296
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,080
 It was like, it was like Potsy Potsy Potsy pot.

297
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,240
 It was Potsy Pots with the other one was Potsy Potsy.

298
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,240
 Good.

299
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,240
 We figured it out guys.

300
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,240
 Go ahead and film there.

301
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,240
 Yeah.

302
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,240
 We figured it out.

303
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,880
 You have full permission to film there as far as we're concerned.

304
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,480
 Well, at least I'm glad to hear that at least on the locals level, Vegas is still helping

305
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,360
 each other out in that respect, artistically.

306
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,480
 I also, I also volunteer at Jacob's house.

307
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,480
 Oh yeah.

308
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,760
 Jacob, well, how's your house?

309
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,840
 Is it good for, does it have a casting couch and sandwiches?

310
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,840
 So many.

311
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,800
 So many cast the couches, so many sandwiches.

312
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,440
 You'd be, you'd be doing me a favor if you got rid of some of these sandwiches, actually.

313
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,800
 He actually has like a dog accessible casting couch, which is pretty amazing.

314
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
 Yeah.

315
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
 It has a little ramp up.

316
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,440
 It's got a little puffy stair staircase that goes up to his couch for his puppies.

317
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,960
 So it's a good, it's a good for a, for dogs and we'll sleep their way into roles.

318
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
 Right.

319
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,960
 Oh, I see.

320
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:22,040
 I wasn't sure that was for me to get onto the very high couch, short, short, short person.

321
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:27,880
 But no, seriously, like, you know, it's, it's, I think it is a love letter to Las Vegas,

322
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,440
 not so much in terms of the landmarks or the, the, the, the places, but like the characters

323
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:38,560
 that you'll find in Las Vegas, which I mean, I challenge you to find something that has

324
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:45,680
 that sort of thing where it like kind of explores the strange, weird people who are in the entertainment

325
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:52,880
 field on the fringes that are not Cirque or Spiegel or whatever, and how they make their

326
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:59,000
 lives work in this town because you know, like LA actors left and right, but you know,

327
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,720
 what are these lowly, sad lawyer turned actors and, you know, all these, all these other

328
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,280
 kinds of characters.

329
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,260
 So I think that's, that's one of the benefits of it.

330
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,760
 I mean, no, no city on earth has better people watching than Las Vegas.

331
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:24,760
 And so to have a show that is kind of dedicated to a bit of that spirit is, is a fascinating

332
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,480
 idea and something that people should check out.

333
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,600
 I mean, that, that's a, that is a weirdly niche thing that I think people are going

334
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,120
 to really love.

335
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:39,580
 And more importantly, Jimmy in episode three is dressed up as a birthday party clown trying

336
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:48,520
 to steal craft, crafty, which is the catering at craft services and, and him and I get in

337
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,400
 a shouting match with each other.

338
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:59,440
 So is that because Jimmy came to the shooting from his side gig as a birthday clown?

339
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,680
 No, no, no, no.

340
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:07,240
 He is for, so the backstory of the movie that we're filming is that he's the clown in a

341
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,120
 world of mimes and he's, he feels lonely and left out.

342
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:17,320
 And so he has to, it's very dramatic, has to jump off a roof to end everything.

343
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,600
 I can't wait to watch this.

344
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,480
 This is all backstory.

345
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,360
 This is all backstory that you will not know.

346
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,560
 Of course, you're hearing it first.

347
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,480
 I'm not even sure Jimmy knew this.

348
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:35,160
 I was wondering why there were all these mimes and me there that, that was kind of confusing,

349
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,360
 but now that makes, no, it makes total sense.

350
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:45,440
 So now you finished season one, does suddenly like, did you always, are you going to make

351
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,440
 the season two?

352
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,240
 Is season two simply just like, I, we cast something of funny casting adventures to go

353
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,000
 on or did you think of somewhere new to go with the show?

354
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,760
 How did, how did it all come together creatively for season two?

355
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:05,040
 Well our writer, Nick Adams, he had already started writing season two unbeknownst to us.

356
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:10,440
 So we were like, we did season one and our executive producer, Chuck Prater, was like,

357
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,440
 you know, I, I think that we need to get a season two going away.

358
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,040
 I'm going to get some funding for you guys and stuff.

359
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:22,160
 And then Nick was like, funny enough, I have eight episodes ready for you guys to go.

360
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,040
 And I was like, that's great.

361
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,080
 I was like, okay.

362
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,540
 And I was like, this is great.

363
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:35,560
 Now we need to make them twice as long and with much more characters and much to my chagrin

364
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,200
 doing 27 pages a day.

365
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,460
 I was in three days.

366
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:47,620
 We talked about this last time I was on, but we tend to shoot three episodes per day.

367
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:52,600
 And that was, it turned out wonderful, but also I was like, I'm never doing this again,

368
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,840
 which I say after every season, I'm never doing this again.

369
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,360
 I was going to ask you when he, when, when, when the, when the writer said, Oh, I've got

370
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,320
 eight more episodes in the, in the bag ready to go.

371
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,880
 Were you more excited or more terrified?

372
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,080
 Which, which direction did the needle lean?

373
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:14,400
 Cause I know it, I know both, both were on the scale for sure.

374
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,280
 We were very excited actually because you know, we love doing this.

375
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:24,400
 This is, you know, at Jimmy having this whole family together and having everybody on the

376
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,400
 set.

377
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,400
 It's, it's definitely been an experience.

378
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,520
 We've been doing it for five years.

379
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,480
 So bringing the crew together and, and doing everything.

380
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,460
 It feels like at the end of 16 hours, like everybody's just like, Oh my gosh.

381
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,480
 But then you get to see what you did and what you achieved.

382
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,720
 And that's that in itself is always, always gratifying.

383
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:49,400
 And actually Matt and I had a conversation about magicians.

384
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,400
 You said you would never do that.

385
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,480
 You said you never out me on this.

386
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,480
 You said you were going to keep this anonymous.

387
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,520
 You're supposed to say a magician friend.

388
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,520
 I know.

389
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,160
 Well, we, I told it to the writer and so now it's too late.

390
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:07,040
 So if there is a season three, there's going to be a magician episode.

391
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:12,480
 So hopefully we can get some magician adjacent type people.

392
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,920
 Maybe Matt Donnelly will make it up here.

393
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,720
 I was just saying, I can't tell whether you're saying I should do this or stay away from

394
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,720
 it.

395
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,720
 I'll do it.

396
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,720
 I would love to do it.

397
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,040
 Oh my God.

398
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:27,420
 If you can see on the background, there's, there's a little, there's Jimmy's spoilers,

399
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,800
 but that's me.

400
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,800
 Wow.

401
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:35,160
 That's pretty dope for the video for people who aren't on, on Twitch or zoom.

402
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,160
 Yeah.

403
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,480
 There's a little, little bonus something I'll let you know, I'll just speak as my agent

404
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,480
 for a moment.

405
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,860
 You should make Matt part of the last episode because he tends to cause schedules to go

406
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,840
 off the rails with, with stuff.

407
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,520
 So you definitely want, you don't want me holding up another episode.

408
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,280
 I'll just tell you that much right now.

409
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,960
 Oh, you'll be the grand finale, baby.

410
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,960
 There you go.

411
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,960
 There you go.

412
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,920
 I'll get you when you have your least amount of patience and I'm doing the most amount

413
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,920
 of improv.

414
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,920
 You're going to love it.

415
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,720
 This is why the show ended.

416
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,520
 Oh, that hit so close to home.

417
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,560
 Oh man.

418
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,560
 Yeah.

419
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,320
 I had a friend working on a project that I was like, oh, I would have been fun to work

420
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,320
 on that one.

421
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,520
 And they described the working processes like, oh, I would have been a nightmare.

422
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,520
 Thank God.

423
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,520
 I didn't try to be a part of that project.

424
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,560
 I would have just pissed everyone off.

425
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:33,360
 They would have hated me, but it's good somebody just put Jimmy with the dude wipes dressed

426
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,360
 as a clown.

427
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,700
 Those pumpkin spice dude wipes I'll have, you know, that's a Blumpkin spice.

428
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,700
 That is not Photoshop.

429
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,700
 That is legit.

430
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,700
 That is Blumpkin.

431
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,700
 I remember that day.

432
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,700
 Yep.

433
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,700
 I'm happy to see that picture.

434
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,700
 I didn't have that picture.

435
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,700
 Yeah.

436
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,700
 Jimmy.

437
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,700
 Wow.

438
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,700
 Jimmy.

439
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,700
 That's good lighting.

440
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,700
 Look at that.

441
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,700
 Download that shit.

442
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,700
 Yeah.

443
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,700
 That's a good picture.

444
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,680
 Jimmy, how many, how many months now with no podcast, do you miss it at all?

445
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,880
 Do you hate not being part of the audio world?

446
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,880
 No.

447
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,480
 See now like this is the perfect opportunity for season three.

448
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:11,560
 All a list casting goes all podcasts.

449
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
 Just goes to total.

450
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,560
 Audio only.

451
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,560
 Man.

452
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,560
 Audio only.

453
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,560
 Michael, I'm going to tell you right now.

454
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:24,200
 I'm going to say G. You know what, if it's not 16 hour days and we're doing three back

455
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,240
 to back podcasts, I'm here for it.

456
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,240
 It's way shorter days.

457
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,240
 It's fine by me.

458
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,440
 We only do two on, on our hardest days.

459
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,520
 We do two in a row.

460
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,600
 We've, we've tried three in the past and it doesn't work.

461
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
 If everything falls apart.

462
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,600
 They don't even go on location anymore.

463
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,600
 No.

464
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,600
 They just do it all from home.

465
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,600
 Yeah.

466
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,600
 Or cruise ship or wherever the hell they are.

467
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,760
 I like to take cruises.

468
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,760
 What can I say?

469
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,760
 We've evolved.

470
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,760
 No, I'm, I'm good.

471
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,760
 I'm, I'm, I'm good.

472
00:27:52,760 --> 00:28:00,040
 Saving my conversations for my therapist and not for, not for some two dudes that I, that

473
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,320
 I work with that I love.

474
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,320
 Yeah.

475
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,920
 You guys still getting together for the occasional meal.

476
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,240
 You still keeping up with the guys.

477
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,800
 It's just not as regular or.

478
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
 Yeah.

479
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,800
 Yeah.

480
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
 Sure.

481
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,800
 You know, it's, you know, and you know, we've got the dressing room hang.

482
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,680
 So you see each other all the time.

483
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,680
 Wouldn't it be great here?

484
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,640
 If it was like, actually we, we have built walls between our stations and the dressing

485
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,640
 rooms.

486
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,840
 It kind of looks like literally not spoken since that last episode.

487
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,800
 Like, you know, when like restaurants were desperate to open during COVID.

488
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,120
 So they put up all those little micro walls and stuff.

489
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,120
 Yes.

490
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,680
 That's what the dressing room is like now at the stair.

491
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:36,000
 And the best part is all you need for Jimmy to stay private is a micro wall.

492
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:46,120
 Oh boy, stay down the stairs, get the part, get the part buddy.

493
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,400
 You want to get on the massage table.

494
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
 You've got to climb there.

495
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,400
 Come on.

496
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,400
 You got to get up there by yourself.

497
00:28:53,400 --> 00:29:03,280
 You guys, so the last time I was on this episode, all we could talk about was docking.

498
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,260
 So I was like, I'm going to bring Jimmy on.

499
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:12,440
 So at least like, he'll keep these guys in line and good job, Jimmy, good job, Jimmy.

500
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:18,440
 Actually, I'm glad you brought up docking because I have some things I want to discuss

501
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,440
 with that.

502
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,440
 So thank you.

503
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,640
 Jimmy, maybe, maybe this is unfair to put a button on it, but we should say you, since

504
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,760
 you last were on air, your case got thrown out.

505
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,160
 You were, you were not being, you were not exonerated.

506
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:37,640
 You're not being, you're not going to jail for going to your own place of business from

507
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,640
 a bar.

508
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,640
 Yes, it is.

509
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:45,260
 It has been dropped, but it still could be, I guess I just found this out the other day.

510
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:49,340
 It could be, it takes a year for them to like actually close it.

511
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:56,920
 So like at any point, if I act up or, you know, oh Jesus, you're still like, yeah.

512
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,020
 So you're on a list.

513
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,020
 Is that what we're hearing?

514
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:04,680
 Can you tell me that Las Vegas has like a delete folder for 365?

515
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:14,200
 So like if you move into delete, but it actually stays in this folder for a year, exactly.

516
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,600
 So I still got to mind my P's and Q's.

517
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,520
 No happy endings at the massage parlors.

518
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,520
 That's it.

519
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,520
 Yeah.

520
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,520
 Got to.

521
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,640
 But beginnings are on the table.

522
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,640
 The happy beginnings.

523
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,640
 Oh, the happy beginnings.

524
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,640
 I mean happy beginnings.

525
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,640
 Yeah, absolutely.

526
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,640
 Absolutely.

527
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:35,600
 But for all intents and purposes, that case is now done and the future is still is unclear

528
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,880
 and my lawyer says I shouldn't talk too much about it.

529
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,880
 There you go.

530
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,880
 That's fine.

531
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,880
 We'll leave it.

532
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,880
 We'll leave it alone.

533
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,880
 Only 20 more minutes.

534
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,880
 Let's leave it there.

535
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,880
 Yeah.

536
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,880
 Yeah.

537
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,880
 I was wanting to celebrate.

538
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,400
 Now I have to put it like a little note on my calendar, like wait a year to celebrate.

539
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,400
 Yeah.

540
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,400
 Good to know.

541
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,400
 June 11th.

542
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,400
 The fateful day.

543
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,400
 June 11th.

544
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:59,280
 Well, I have, I have faith in the fair and six 11 you turned around.

545
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,280
 It's nine 11.

546
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,280
 It's my nine.

547
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,280
 Wow.

548
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,280
 Illuminati.

549
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,920
 You never forget guys.

550
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,920
 Machiavelli.

551
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,480
 You know, when we started this episode today, I thought to myself, you know, I really hope

552
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,400
 I could find out one day what Jimmy's slow Nina's nine 11.

553
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:20,200
 What is Jimmy's personal 11 it's just actually now going to be an ice breaker for all of

554
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,200
 our guests.

555
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,200
 Hey, what's your nine 11?

556
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:30,480
 My nine 11 is finding out my character's named Roger when it could be Kroger the whole time.

557
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:37,960
 Oh, he looks so much like a Kroger.

558
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:45,360
 My nine 11 is watching episode nine of of land man over and over again.

559
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,840
 There's a character in a list.

560
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,840
 God help us.

561
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,840
 Her name.

562
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,840
 Her.

563
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,280
 The actress name is Katie.

564
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,360
 It turned her.

565
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,240
 Yeah, she's hilarious.

566
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,240
 You'll see her in episode five and she's selling episode three, but she's featured in episode

567
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,240
 five.

568
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,320
 And unfortunately, we made it a bit that her name is tall actress.

569
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,760
 So that's what she's called in the show and she doesn't get a name.

570
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,000
 No one can remember her name.

571
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,960
 It's just sort of nice.

572
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:21,480
 So she hasn't been given a name and she is very careful to remind us every time we do

573
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,440
 any kind of promotion that she doesn't have a name yet.

574
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,060
 And I'm like, don't worry.

575
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:30,840
 It's going to be a big reveal in season three Kroger or five.

576
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,840
 Her name.

577
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,280
 Her actual name is Elevator, Elevator thespian.

578
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,640
 So her real name is tall actress.

579
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,640
 Elevator.

580
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,320
 Her name is also Roger.

581
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,320
 Yeah.

582
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,320
 Also Roger.

583
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,320
 Oh, man.

584
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,320
 Everybody is Roger.

585
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,680
 This is all on YouTube, yes.

586
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,680
 Yep.

587
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,020
 You can find it all on YouTube.

588
00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:02,280
 I think you just look up A-list casting and you will see me, you will see Jimmy, you'll

589
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,960
 see a lot of Las Vegas actors and some not Las Vegas.

590
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,960
 Jonas Wilberton.

591
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,960
 Oh, wow.

592
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,960
 There's so many people that you guys know.

593
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,960
 Yeah.

594
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,960
 It's a who's who of Scoopguess.

595
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,960
 Yes.

596
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,960
 Tons of them.

597
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,960
 Yes.

598
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,960
 Carina Harney-Jones.

599
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,960
 Yes.

600
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,960
 Nicole Unger.

601
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,600
 I heard there's a lot of pressure to up the sex appeal for season two to boost the ratings.

602
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,600
 Is that true?

603
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,980
 That's very true.

604
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:37,200
 Jimmy shows his nipples on every podcast and whether he's asked to or not.

605
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,600
 Yeah.

606
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:46,360
 And much like Brett Alters, he gets naked at the top any chance.

607
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,880
 You don't have to ask Brett once.

608
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,960
 I've got one more testicle than that guy has.

609
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,280
 True story.

610
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:01,280
 Somewhere Brett Alters is just getting like kings in the universe.

611
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,080
 Oh, Brett Alters is doing fun.

612
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,520
 Hey, he's got a little baby.

613
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,520
 He's doing fine.

614
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,520
 He's got a little baby.

615
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,520
 One is enough.

616
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,520
 One is enough.

617
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,960
 The ringmaster of Big Apple Circus.

618
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
 Yeah.

619
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,960
 Now he's touring with Piff again.

620
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,960
 Fuck that guy.

621
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
 Yeah.

622
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,960
 Fuck.

623
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,960
 Fuck you, Brett Alters.

624
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,760
 And your nudity.

625
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,560
 But we'd love to have you back on the podcast.

626
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,560
 Oh yeah.

627
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,560
 Come on by Brett.

628
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,560
 Anytime.

629
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,560
 Yeah, Brett.

630
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,560
 Anytime.

631
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,560
 No pants.

632
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,560
 I don't think we ever had Brett on.

633
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,560
 Which is a mistake.

634
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,560
 No.

635
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,480
 Did we have him on once?

636
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,480
 Maybe a long time ago.

637
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,480
 Oh yeah.

638
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,480
 We've done this podcast for too long.

639
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,480
 I don't know.

640
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
 He'd have to tell us.

641
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,480
 He'd have to tell us.

642
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,660
 Now between this podcast and Piff stuff, yeah, I have no idea.

643
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:45,600
 You guys talk about how if you, you know, you had a budget, you go maybe shoot some more

644
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:54,100
 locations and that kind of stuff, modern entertainment is a fucking crazy, making entertainment was

645
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,100
 always hard.

646
00:34:55,100 --> 00:35:00,320
 It's harder than ever to take an independent project like this to a major streamer.

647
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,560
 But small entertainment like this, like these smaller episodes and being able to watch from

648
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,840
 your phones, that kind of stuff, like that's all on the rise, right?

649
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,840
 Yeah.

650
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,360
 Has, have you thought about possibly simply trying to do like a Kickstarter or a crowd

651
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,640
 funder to try to maybe see if you could just get a budget you'd want for, to maybe make

652
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,400
 this a little, a little more dynamic and spicy for you guys?

653
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,400
 Yeah.

654
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,260
 I mean, that's definitely on the portfolio.

655
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:30,680
 You know, we're looking at where things go with this current season, and then we're going

656
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,340
 to get together and talk about, okay, do we crowdfund?

657
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,680
 Like what's our goals?

658
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,380
 Like what are we going to do with season three?

659
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,880
 What can we do to make a season three happen?

660
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,760
 You know, that sort of thing, or, you know, with the help of all the scoops in the chat

661
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,620
 and everything, the subscriber base and the viewers watching everything goes up so high

662
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:55,420
 that we can, you know, take that to more of a network type style.

663
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,080
 So there's two different ways to go.

664
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,560
 We kind of have to step back and examine exactly where we're at.

665
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,980
 I would love, like, you know, this, this show is, is definitely a love letter to Las Vegas

666
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,020
 and, and to entertainment here.

667
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:13,520
 So I would love to continue making it and everybody enjoys the process of doing it.

668
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,760
 So there's many, there's many opportunities we're going to be looking at, but hopefully

669
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:24,000
 one of them would be to crowdfund and to kind of get it enough of a budget to make a season

670
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 three.

671
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,400
 The other option, you know, take it to some more networks again, now that we have more

672
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,560
 of a fan base and stuff and show them the analytics and that kind of thing and see if

673
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,680
 it gets picked up.

674
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,680
 So a couple options.

675
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,280
 If you do crowdfund, Paul, Jacob and I are in for $5.

676
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,280
 Yes.

677
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,280
 Total.

678
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,280
 Yeah.

679
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,280
 Thank you.

680
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,280
 Five.

681
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,280
 Between the two of you.

682
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,280
 How dare you, Jacob?

683
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,280
 I would appreciate it.

684
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,280
 What's up?

685
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,280
 How very dare you.

686
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:57,760
 Jacob has switched his Zoom background to Jimmy and Jimmy's background, which is pretty

687
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,760
 good.

688
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,760
 Inception.

689
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:06,960
 It's a Russian nesting doll of weirdness.

690
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,960
 This is what you're missing.

691
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,880
 I put the link, I put the link to the A-list Casting channel on the chat.

692
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,880
 Very nice.

693
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,520
 Go there and hit that, smash that subscribe y'all.

694
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,520
 Yeah.

695
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,900
 And if you're not on the chat, A-list Casting, just do A-list Casting, search it on Google,

696
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,040
 search it on YouTube.

697
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,040
 It pops right up.

698
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,040
 Yeah.

699
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,040
 Subscribe to it.

700
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,040
 It's going to be fantastic.

701
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,040
 You're going to love it.

702
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,040
 All right.

703
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:36,160
 Well, gentlemen, we're going to do a little ad, we want to thank you for plugging the

704
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,160
 episode.

705
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,520
 You're welcome to stick around and fuck around with us, but we're going to move on to other

706
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,280
 topics.

707
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,880
 So if you want to go, I get it.

708
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,880
 No problem.

709
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,880
 I do have to run.

710
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,880
 Okay.

711
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,880
 All right.

712
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,880
 I love you all.

713
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,880
 Love you.

714
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,880
 Love you, Jimmy.

715
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,880
 Great to see you.

716
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,880
 Bye, buddy.

717
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,880
 Love you too, Michael.

718
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,880
 Thanks.

719
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,880
 Thank you so much for being here.

720
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,880
 Yeah.

721
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,880
 Our pleasure.

722
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,880
 Thank you, guys.

723
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,880
 All right.

724
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,880
 Thank you.

725
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,880
 Yes.

726
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,880
 Yes.

727
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,880
 Happy beginnings.

728
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,880
 Happy beginnings, everyone.

729
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,880
 Happy beginnings.

730
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,200
 You know, who else is really happy to be on a show that has so much talk of dirty massage

731
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,280
 parlors?

732
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,880
 And that is the following sponsor.

733
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,640
 Today's show is brought to you by Captain Cutberry Cereal.

734
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,640
 That's right.

735
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,680
 From the Microscoop.

736
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,720
 That is Captain Cutberry Cereal in 2021.

737
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,760
 It's taken four years for this gem to make it to the top of the shuffle.

738
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,320
 And here we are.

739
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,320
 Captain Cutberry Cereal.

740
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,320
 Ahoy there, everybody.

741
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,000
 Captain Cutberry here.

742
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,200
 Boy, oh boy.

743
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,940
 My pussy's as dry as a Sahara.

744
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,200
 I need something to lube up this twad of mine.

745
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,200
 What's that?

746
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,200
 What's that ahead?

747
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,200
 Oh, it's the soggy's.

748
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:53,520
 Well, come on over here to my place, soggy's, and get in my poon, because I'm as dry as

749
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,920
 a 90-year-old's cough.

750
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:05,160
 Yeah, oh, Captain Cutberry is, I've got sandpaper twix my nethers right now, you know what I'm

751
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,160
 saying?

752
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,960
 That's why I definitely need the help of the soggy's, and you can do it too.

753
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:15,520
 Go look for Captain Cutberry's Soggy Lubrication Affiliate.

754
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,520
 That's right.

755
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:23,260
 The Soggy Lubrication Affiliate goes right in your zone, drips on down smooth like a

756
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:29,520
 roaring river, and stays there guaranteed for at least three hours, plenty of time for

757
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,440
 ingress and egress.

758
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,440
 That's all you really need.

759
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,480
 Get it in, get it out, get it done.

760
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,920
 That's what Captain Cutberry says.

761
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:44,400
 Ahoy, soggy's, stay in my poon.

762
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,640
 And her hay scoops at checkout.

763
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,640
 Stay in my poon.

764
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,640
 That's the famous-

765
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,640
 Stay in my poon.

766
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,640
 That's the famous steal there.

767
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,640
 Ay-ay-ay.

768
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,640
 Jacob, do you have a time, I have a topic, if you don't have a topic, a topic you got?

769
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,640
 I have a topic.

770
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,640
 I have a topic.

771
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,720
 I have a couple of topics.

772
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,520
 Pick who feels strongest about their topic.

773
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,600
 I got two quickies.

774
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,240
 First of all, I'm gonna let y'all know I got to experience a little slice of heaven the

775
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,840
 other night.

776
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,400
 Let me tell you what a slice of heaven is.

777
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,680
 So I went to this massage park.

778
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,960
 A slice of heaven-

779
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,040
 Happy beginnings.

780
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,040
 Happy beginnings.

781
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:32,840
 Is a Pennsylvania Costco on a Steelers playoff Monday night.

782
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,640
 Oh man!

783
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:42,880
 It was, it was a ghost town, and it was wonderful.

784
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,720
 Anne and I had the run of the place.

785
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,840
 There couldn't have been fifty people there, workers included.

786
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,920
 It was wonderful.

787
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,140
 Were the workers all furious that they were there?

788
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,140
 No.

789
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,000
 Nobody in their right mind wanted to watch that game.

790
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 Give me a break.

791
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,440
 Are you kidding me?

792
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:07,160
 Anyway, I watched a few minutes of it and then just dozed off, woke up at some point

793
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:12,400
 right around, it was almost halftime, I mean it was right after halftime, and looked at

794
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,520
 the game and went, "Nope," and turned it off and got up and just did other things.

795
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

796
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,680
 As someone who loves watching Aaron Rodgers lose and be a dick about it, it was a fucking

797
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,680
 chef's kiss.

798
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,640
 You can't get any more perfect than an interception-turned-touchdown as your final playoff.

799
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,080
 Yeah, after he's bitched everyone else out on the sideline and they just showed up shouting

800
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,440
 at everyone, and I was like, "Oh, this is really nice."

801
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:39,320
 Well, he's the reason I didn't watch a single lick of it this whole season, and I'm a better

802
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,960
 person for it, and now I'm completely off football again.

803
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,160
 That, and you don't care about sports.

804
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:50,080
 You moved to Pittsburgh and you forgot that you don't care about sports.

805
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,480
 I reminded myself real quick.

806
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,560
 Aaron Rodgers just reminded you.

807
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,560
 If anything, you owe Aaron Rodgers.

808
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:03,560
 Well, part of it too was for two years I was basically immobile from my damn leg.

809
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,720
 Well, that's true.

810
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,640
 I didn't have a whole lot of options, but to connect with the outside world through

811
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,200
 live sports entertainment.

812
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,880
 It was either like sports or become a card magician.

813
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,440
 That was kind of it, and so I think I chose wisely again.

814
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,440
 All right, so that was a great-

815
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,440
 I love that.

816
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,760
 Our scoops right now are all catching each other up on football, and they also don't

817
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,560
 care and know that much about it, so right now the chat is just a litany of like, "Wait,

818
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,560
 bears?

819
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:31,560
 Wait, packers?"

820
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,240
 Somebody just mentioned the Brooklyn Dodgers.

821
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,240
 Who cares?

822
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,240
 I don't even know.

823
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,240
 Who even cares?

824
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,240
 Yeah.

825
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,120
 Well, that was great fun Monday night going shopping with Ann.

826
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,800
 That's really funny to hit Costco during a playoff game.

827
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,320
 That's truly the perfect time.

828
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,320
 It was the perfect time.

829
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,320
 It was insane.

830
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,880
 Like, I mean, ghost town.

831
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:58,800
 So there was that, and then Ann for holiday through her work got a gift card from one

832
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:05,560
 of her associates for Applebee's, so we decided to burn that Applebee's gift card yesterday.

833
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,920
 I don't know if you guys have been to Applebee's recently.

834
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,800
 You should have used it at Applebee's.

835
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,800
 We had to use it at Applebee's.

836
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,840
 Oh, you shouldn't have burned it.

837
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,840
 Oh, well.

838
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,840
 That was a waste.

839
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,720
 You know, it might have been a better move.

840
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,720
 I don't know.

841
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,720
 But we went to Applebee's.

842
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,900
 Applebee's currently has on the menu.

843
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:27,080
 On the menu currently, they have an item called the O.M. Cheeseburger.

844
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,520
 O.M. Oh, this is the one that's-

845
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,640
 Yes, I just saw the ads for this too.

846
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,280
 This was on every playoff game this weekend.

847
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:41,400
 So they cut a cheeseburger in half and let it rest on a melted dish of cheese?

848
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,240
 Not just a melted dish of cheese.

849
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:48,160
 The wording is served in a molten pool of cheese.

850
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,160
 Oh.

851
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,640
 Served in a molten pool of cheese.

852
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,640
 This is-

853
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:57,240
 Matt and Madagley's Ice Cream Social served in a molten pool of cheese.

854
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,280
 And I was like, yes, of course.

855
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,720
 I'm going to have to move, I'm going to have to move Throshen to second place as to what

856
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,360
 to do with my dead body.

857
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,400
 Put me in a molten pool of cheese, please.

858
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,880
 Put me in a molten pool of cheese.

859
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,640
 Why wait until you're dead though?

860
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,640
 Serve me.

861
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,560
 It's like a cheeseburger fondue.

862
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,920
 So, a whole cheeseburger fondue.

863
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:25,040
 Do you put like a long fork in it?

864
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,040
 Oh.

865
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,560
 You have to get a fork in there to get the cheese that's left.

866
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,560
 And I'll tell you this-

867
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:35,040
 Oh, Applebee's missing out on giving people a long fork for their hamburger to dip it

868
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,040
 in the cheese.

869
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,080
 I didn't eat super fast.

870
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,080
 Like on the cob.

871
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:45,300
 And by the time I went for the second, the second half of the burger, it was not coming

872
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,300
 off the plate.

873
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,300
 It's congealed.

874
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,300
 Completely congealed.

875
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,300
 You're too late, bozo.

876
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,300
 You missed your train.

877
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:57,880
 It was exactly where I was like, oh fuck, half my burger is staying on the plate.

878
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,680
 And I saw on the menu, I was like, limited time only.

879
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:05,600
 I'm like, yeah, you have a limited time to eat it before it glues itself to the dinnerware.

880
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,600
 There it is.

881
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,600
 So that was it.

882
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,600
 Exactly.

883
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:14,600
 Just cut the thing in half and then put the two flat halves down in just a plate of cheese.

884
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,600
 That's it.

885
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,600
 Andy's got the video up.

886
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,600
 There it is.

887
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,400
 This feels like something that like some mother does for like one of her kids.

888
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,280
 And like, can you serve it to me with the cheese on the plate?

889
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,600
 Can I have melty cheeseburger tonight?

890
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,000
 Can we do melty pool burger?

891
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 And then that kid goes to sleep over for the first time and he asks him to cut his cheeseburger

892
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,760
 in half and says, can you put more cheese on this plate?

893
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,320
 Do you guys do melty pool burgers?

894
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,200
 And they go, what the hell are you talking about, kid?

895
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,960
 And then he shows them and they never eat a cheeseburger the same way again.

896
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,760
 And then those children went on to open an Applebee's.

897
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,520
 Well, like I said, I'll say it wasn't bad.

898
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,920
 It's just that that second burger experience.

899
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,120
 It should come like fondue.

900
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,560
 It should have a little fire.

901
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,600
 It should have a little heater.

902
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,600
 Yeah.

903
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,600
 It comes on a skillet.

904
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,080
 So it comes out bubbling like a fajita plate.

905
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:09,000
 So it is truly like blah, blah, blah, blah.

906
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,520
 Like it is molten cheese.

907
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,520
 Like you cannot fuck with this thing.

908
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,520
 Blah, blah, blah.

909
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,520
 It's a cheeseburger.

910
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,520
 Blah, blah, blah.

911
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,520
 Eat me.

912
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,680
 I dare you to consume me.

913
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:23,560
 Is the cheese just, is the cheese in the little pan just like cheese, just like cheddar cheese

914
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,560
 or something?

915
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,360
 It's like a Mexican cheese blend, I would say.

916
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,480
 Like a Monterrey Jack style.

917
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,680
 This is a fucking, this is a fucking miss on their part, not to do it in a pan of queso.

918
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,680
 Yeah.

919
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,680
 Wiz.

920
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,680
 Yeah.

921
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,680
 I mean, yeah.

922
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,840
 If you're, if you're going for it, you should go for it.

923
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:46,120
 Like they do serve like skillet, just do some skillet queso, throw a couple of cheeseburgers

924
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,120
 in there.

925
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,120
 You're done.

926
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,040
 I think they serve skillet queso at Applebee's.

927
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,040
 Come on Applebee's.

928
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,040
 I don't know.

929
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,040
 I'm giving you gems here.

930
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:58,160
 So I went to Sonic the other night and uh, I, you know, they have a pretzel twist with

931
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,320
 like a cheese dip, but they're at a pretzel twist.

932
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:05,680
 So I still ordered the, the, the, the, uh, uh, yeah, I ordered the dip and put my tater

933
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,680
 tots in it.

934
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:07,680
 Tater tots.

935
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,680
 Smart.

936
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:11,920
 Eat shit Applebee's, eat shit Applebee's.

937
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,840
 Well, I think, I think they're onto something, but I think you guys are exactly right.

938
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,480
 If you're going to go for it, fucking go for it.

939
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,600
 But then I think it becomes just a, you're spending too much on your cheese.

940
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,720
 And so I think it just becomes an arms race at that point.

941
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,560
 I think then all the restaurants are racing to see who can put what in queso.

942
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,560
 Yeah.

943
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,680
 And I mean, it would probably just end the world.

944
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:41,720
 I mean, if, if you, so if you put on your menu menu in queso emergency, eat cheeseburger,

945
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,840
 I am, I am buying that sandwich.

946
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,280
 I will be at your restaurant every day.

947
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,240
 Every day in queso emergency, eat cheeseburger.

948
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,240
 Fuck yeah.

949
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,240
 And go ahead.

950
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,700
 Like make that just an option in case of emergency as an option.

951
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:59,720
 So I ordered a chicken Caesar wrap, cut it in half, dip the two hands into a bone thing

952
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,720
 of cheese and give it to me.

953
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:05,920
 Can I get that in queso emergency style, please?

954
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,440
 Sir, you, you ordered a drink.

955
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,440
 You ordered a Coke.

956
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,000
 I'm aware of my Pepsi fountain drink order.

957
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,520
 I also would like it in queso emergency style.

958
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,520
 Very good, sir.

959
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,840
 Are you unwilling to place my Pepsi in a molten pool of cheese?

960
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,600
 Oh no, no, no, sir.

961
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:30,040
 Here, please never let it be said that I will take my business elsewhere, sir.

962
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,320
 No sir, please come back.

963
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:39,580
 I will go eat in another establishment, willing to dip my Pepsi in a molten pool of cheese.

964
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:40,580
 You understand me.

965
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:43,200
 This is not an idle threat.

966
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,880
 I am ordered by Pepsi in queso emergency style.

967
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,880
 I shall not be refused.

968
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,880
 I am the owner here.

969
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:52,880
 What is the problem?

970
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,880
 I will not be refused.

971
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:54,880
 Hello.

972
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,880
 Theo Appleby at your service.

973
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:01,800
 Mr. Appleby, have you a bone that I might pick at, sir?

974
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,360
 For I have a bone to pick.

975
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,820
 Oh, I have bones.

976
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:09,800
 I have bones because I myself, I just ordered Buffalo wings in queso emergency.

977
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:15,080
 So, I cut each wing in half and I put the top and the bottom end of the wing in queso

978
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,080
 emergency.

979
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:21,360
 And the shards, the shards fall where they may.

980
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:31,520
 The chef has like a bone saw back there and just we line them up and just.

981
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,520
 Yeah.

982
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,160
 Split the riblets and send them into the fucking cheese sewer.

983
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:41,280
 I like this whole chicken in queso emergency, please.

984
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:47,560
 I have brought my own Kirkland brand chicken, sir, and I would like this served in queso

985
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,240
 emergency style.

986
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,240
 Charge me whatever.

987
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,240
 Yeah.

988
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,240
 No price too high.

989
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,240
 What is that?

990
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,240
 Is that like a corking fee?

991
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,240
 What is that?

992
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,240
 Yeah.

993
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,240
 Do not deny me.

994
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,240
 Spatchcock it if you must.

995
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,240
 Oh, in fact, please do.

996
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:09,000
 But put it in a pool of molten cheese, please.

997
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,520
 In queso emergency style.

998
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,600
 Oh, I even.

999
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,640
 That is ours.

1000
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:24,320
 So, Nick Newman famously taught me the Sonic secret hack, which is that they often say

1001
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,320
 their name.

1002
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,400
 Welcome to Sonic.

1003
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,400
 My name is Deborah.

1004
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,400
 How can I help you?

1005
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,400
 Whatever would you like to order?

1006
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:34,240
 If you say their name back, they give you a discount.

1007
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,080
 And I remember this every time I go to my local Sonic.

1008
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:43,640
 But every time my Sonic people don't say their name and it drives me crazy because I'm like

1009
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,640
 ready.

1010
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,640
 I'm ready.

1011
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,640
 Like a ninja to say their name.

1012
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,540
 And the last three times I've gone to Sonic, they don't introduce themselves.

1013
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:53,120
 And I was like, just make up a name and start addressing them as that name.

1014
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,120
 Yeah.

1015
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,120
 Yeah.

1016
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,120
 Thanks, Tara.

1017
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,120
 Thank you, Roger.

1018
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:01,400
 I'll have some nuggets.

1019
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,400
 What's the why?

1020
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,400
 Tots.

1021
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,400
 Jesus Christ.

1022
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,480
 I'd like some potato nuggets, please.

1023
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:11,120
 I have the chili dog or the corn dog nuggets.

1024
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,600
 I had my brain in case of emergency.

1025
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,800
 So I just have it just floating in the bat of milk.

1026
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,800
 I can't remember the name of tater tots.

1027
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,280
 You split both hemispheres and put them in a pool of molten cheese.

1028
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,840
 Oh, cheddar bites in case of emergency.

1029
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,400
 Yeah.

1030
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,400
 We got it.

1031
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,400
 Yeah.

1032
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,960
 The Apple is about to find out how lazy they are.

1033
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,600
 It's going to happen is that they've opened a door here and now other people are going

1034
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,600
 to walk through.

1035
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,600
 It's going to be.

1036
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,680
 That's exactly right.

1037
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:43,880
 They have given away a real move to just throw your food in a bunch of cheese and people

1038
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,960
 are going to go hog fucking wild.

1039
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,920
 Isn't it chilies that already has the skillet queso?

1040
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:49,920
 Yes.

1041
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,120
 See, that's going to start cutting their burgers in half and throw it in the skillet queso.

1042
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:56,000
 Well, you can do it with the big mouth bites.

1043
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,960
 I mean, if you're not getting triple dipper, you're not getting eaten right at Chili's

1044
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:59,960
 anyway.

1045
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:00,960
 I don't know.

1046
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,240
 I don't know who's going to Chili's order or anything besides a triple dipper.

1047
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,240
 That's right.

1048
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,520
 Shots fired.

1049
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,520
 Fucking fools.

1050
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,520
 Idiots.

1051
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,520
 Uh-huh.

1052
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,520
 Been a minute.

1053
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,520
 Come on now.

1054
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,520
 In case of emergency.

1055
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:30,320
 Oh, Andy's asking if we've seen the new KFC bowl, but I haven't tried it yet, Andy, but

1056
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,320
 I've seen it.

1057
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,040
 Oh, that's a seasonal items.

1058
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:37,000
 And my friend Jen said the funniest time saw, saw an advertisement when we were living

1059
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
 in New York at a bus stop.

1060
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,720
 I was at the, for the KFC bowl and she just looked at it and goes, for those who've just

1061
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:52,720
 given up, but man, if you go through a KFC and get you a KFC bowl, you're not going to

1062
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,720
 be mad about it.

1063
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,920
 No, you're not going to be mad about it.

1064
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,160
 You're going to be perfectly good.

1065
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,160
 Yeah.

1066
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,160
 How about some KFC bolognese?

1067
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,160
 Throwing some queso?

1068
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,160
 It's going to be great.

1069
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:05,600
 Oh, KFC bolognese.

1070
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,140
 Pass it up.

 Oh, man.

 You're at first.

1109
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:03,220
 All of these.

1110
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,220

00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,780
 I know exactly what this is.

1115
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:27,740
 Um, oh, I don't call it.

1116
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:28,740
 It is.

1117
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:37,380
 It is a group of people, uh, and all of these people have, uh, something in common.

1118
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:44,020
 Yeah, Paul, I'll have to pass.

1119
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,660
 I don't know this one.

1120
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:46,980
 Those are all bond girls.

1121
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:47,980
 Oh, yes.

1122
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:48,980

1126
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:08,740
 song with the most radio plays in history.

1127
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:13,120
 What at first sounds like a gentle love song is actually more like something a stalker

1128
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:15,300
 might sing to their target.

1129
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,500
 Someone call the cops.

1130
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:22,180
 Ah, this is, uh, every breath you take from the police.

1131
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,780
 Every breath you take.

1132
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:24,780
 Indeed.

1133
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:25,780
 I'll be watching you.

1134
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:26,780
 Good clues.

1135
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:27,780
 That's me.

1136
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:28,780

1137
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:34,860
 I named the candy 200 taste the rainbow Tuesday evenings.

00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:37,980
 Oh, skittles, smarties.

1139
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:38,980
 Yeah.

1140
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:39,980
 Yeah.

1141
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:46,900
 Um, I'm going back for binders full, I got to get this right.

1142
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:47,900
 All right.

1143
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:50,860
 For 400, what group of people have the first names?

1144
00:57:50,860 --> 00:58:03,620
 Catherine and Jane and Catherine and Catherine, uh, I don't know this path, Queens, Queens.

1145
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,780
 Let's try Queens.

1146
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,100
 Wives of Henry the eighth.

1147
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,660
 All right.

1148
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:13,140
 Wives of Henry, the eight coach rat bastard literally did the double head smack, uh, disappointment

1149
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:15,420
 that we couldn't, we didn't know that one.

1150
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:16,420
 Why?

1151
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:19,420
 They're Queens.

1152
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:21,980
 I think, did you, did you mean Queens?

1153
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:23,980
 Like they're, did you know that their wives were 100 of the eight?

1154
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:26,020
 Cause I feel like that's the bigger, important part.

1155
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:27,020
 Right?

1156
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,020
 Yeah.

1157
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:29,020
 I mean, but they were all Queens.

1158
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:30,020
 Nope.

1159
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:31,020
 That's a no.

1160
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:32,020
 You said, yeah.

1161
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:37,180
 You answered no, we were both ready to give it to you if you said like, oh yeah, they

1162
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,140
 were Queens because they were all married to Henry the eighth.

1163
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:42,700
 You know, cheers episode to age myself or Cliff answered, who have people who have never

1164
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,420
 been in my kitchen, uh, for final jeopardy.

1165
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:47,940
 Well, technically true.

1166
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:48,940
 Yeah.

1167
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:49,940
 Yeah.

1168
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:50,940
 Paul.

1169
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:58,220
 Um, I will try sixties music out or the sixties to the nineties for 800.

1170
00:58:58,220 --> 00:58:59,500
 Let's go for the big money.

1171
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:06,580
 All right, 1973, this song ostensibly from a, uh, paroled prisoner to his girlfriend asks

1172
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,920
 for a sign that she wants him back.

1173
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:14,260
 It was covered by Bing Crosby, Perry Cuomo, and Dean Martin and had renewed popularity

1174
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:17,860
 in 1979 during the Iranian hostage crisis.

1175
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:20,340
 Oh boy.

1176
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:22,460
 Huh.

1177
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:29,420
 I am going to guess tie a yellow ribbon.

1178
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:33,260
 All right, let's try it.

1179
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:36,860
 Tie a yellow ribbon around the old oak tree.

1180
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:37,860
 Yeah.

1181
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:38,860
 I'm sorry, Paul.

1182
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:40,380
 You just said tie yellow ribbon.

1183
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:41,380
 Oh, come on.

1184
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:42,380
 I got it.

1185
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:43,380
 I'm sorry.

1186
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:44,380
 That's not enough.

1187
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,380
 They're all Queens.

1188
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:46,380
 The whole song.

1189
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:47,380
 Queens.

1190
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:48,380
 I got it.

1191
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,380
 Right.

1192
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:50,380
 That's me.

1193
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:51,380
 I'll try.

1194
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:56,100
 The chances of using me, Nick, Nick Newman just got up and grabbed a yellow cloth and

1195
00:59:56,100 --> 01:00:01,020
 tied it in front of the camera to give it to Paul.

1196
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:02,020
 I didn't see that.

1197
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:03,020
 I know you didn't.

1198
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:07,220
 I'm just, I'm just shouting out our amusing scoops here.

1199
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:11,340
 We have some very funny typing in the chat is lazy acting it out on camera.

1200
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,860
 That's that's that's improv shit right there.

1201
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:14,860
 Yeah.

1202
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:15,860
 That's a fine lifeline shit right there.

1203
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:21,060
 I'll drop binders full for 600 who are Jane.

1204
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:23,700
 Oh, this is a, this is a bad start.

1205
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:33,820
 Come on, Weedland, Belinda Carlisle, Charlotte, Kathy, Gina stock shock and Kathy Valentine.

1206
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:36,980
 Huh?

1207
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:40,180
 Come on, pass it.

1208
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:50,340
 The Bronte sisters, they're all Queens, they're all Queens.

1209
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:54,500
 That doesn't even like ring a bell in my brain.

1210
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:58,980
 I pass Matt.

1211
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:03,460
 Is it Oingo Boingo fucking Belinda Carlisle?

1212
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:11,300
 You're halfway there in me or you're more than halfway there, I guess.

1213
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:15,900
 Linda Carlisle was, it was in a shit I'm blanking it.

1214
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:16,900
 All right.

1215
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:17,900
 Paul knows it.

1216
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:18,900
 I'll pass.

1217
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:24,420
 Oh, it's the go-go's that's a map.

1218
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:25,420
 Okay.

1219
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:27,620
 So far, I've been bad at everything.

1220
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:31,660
 Let's go to photos and movies for 200.

1221
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:32,940
 Let's try something new.

1222
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:37,440
 A group photo of the guests at the July 4th ball in 1921.

1223
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:41,940
 The guy front and center looks awfully familiar, but I think the last time we saw him, he'd

1224
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:44,900
 just had his hair and everything else frosted.

1225
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,900
 What's the movie?

1226
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:47,900
 Beautiful moment.

1227
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:49,860
 Yes, of course.

1228
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:56,580
 My buddy Dion writes for the Tonight Show and he did a bit with, as it did like a bad

1229
01:01:56,580 --> 01:02:00,780
 improv singing bit with Jimmy, with Jimmy calling him on like just doing the same thing

1230
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:06,660
 over and over again and he says I'm off stage and for no reason the show gets really crazy

1231
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:13,980
 and Dion was so proud that it just cuts to a photo of an old ballroom and Dion's character

1232
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:20,700
 is in it singing in this old shot and he said it's from The Shining and I go buddy you don't

1233
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:26,220
 even know like what you've done because in that movie he says here's Johnny that's the

1234
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:29,900
 Tonight Show and you wrote that bit for the Tonight Show you didn't even realize it.

1235
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:30,900
 Inception.

1236
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:31,900
 Yeah.

1237
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:32,900
 Inception.

1238
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:33,900
 We're just all.

1239
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:34,900
 Incepted.

1240
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:35,900
 Looking at each other's inner eggs.

1241
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:36,900
 Okay.

1242
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:37,900
 It's pretty, pretty cool, man.

1243
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:38,900
 It was pretty fun.

1244
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:39,900
 Ball.

1245
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:40,900
 Oh, great.

1246
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:44,160
 I'll keep going with the singles.

1247
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,160
 Let's do it.

1248
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:46,160
 For 400.

1249
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:51,980
 1965, the only Rolling Stones song to be included in the Library of Congress recording registry.

1250
01:02:51,980 --> 01:03:02,980
 Notable cover versions were recorded by Devo and The Residence.

1251
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:08,500
 This is a number one.

1252
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:09,500
 Paint It Black.

1253
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,100
 Paint It Black's gone on my guess.

1254
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:13,100
 Yeah.

1255
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:14,100
 I was thinking about that.

1256
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:15,100
 Satisfaction.

1257
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:16,100
 Satisfaction.

1258
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,100
 Shit.

1259
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:18,100
 My dick.

1260
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:19,100
 You fools.

1261
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:20,100
 You fools.

1262
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,100
 It's me.

1263
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:22,100
 I'll try.

1264
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:25,500
 I'll try singles.

1265
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,500
 600.

1266
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:32,380
 1999, this song pioneered the use of auto-tune to distort the vocals and won the Grammy for

1267
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:37,660
 Best Dance Recording, the only Grammy this legendary performer with a multi-decade career

1268
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:38,660
 has won.

1269
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:39,660
 Becky.

1270
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:40,660
 Wait.

1271
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:44,980
 So you want the song or the artist?

1272
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:46,980
 Both.

1273
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:49,260
 If you get one, you're getting the other on this one.

1274
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:51,380
 I can't think of the song name, though.

1275
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:52,380
 Oh.

1276
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:58,060
 It sounds like the past.

1277
01:03:58,060 --> 01:03:59,060
 You tell me the artist.

1278
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:00,060
 You got a past?

1279
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:01,060
 Oh, is that Turn Back Time?

1280
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:02,980
 Is it Cher, Cher Turn Back Time?

1281
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:03,980
 No.

1282
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:04,980
 No?

1283
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:05,980
 Oh.

1284
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,980
 Well, Paul doesn't know.

1285
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:09,380
 Paul just thinks that's not it.

1286
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:10,380
 Just to be clear.

1287
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:11,380
 No, I know.

1288
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:12,380
 Right.

1289
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:13,380
 Okay.

1290
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:14,380
 He knows it.

1291
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:15,380
 All right.

1292
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:16,380
 You're on the right track.

1293
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:17,380
 It's not the right song.

1294
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:18,380
 It's Cher or something, right?

1295
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:19,380
 It's not the right song.

1296
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:20,380
 Yeah.

1297
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:21,380
 Yeah.

1298
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:22,380
 Yeah.

1299
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:23,380
 It's because Turn Back Time is the one on the battleship.

1300
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:24,380
 Yes.

1301
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:25,380
 Yeah.

1302
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:27,980
 So that'd be too late.

1303
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:28,980
 That's too early.

1304
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:29,980
 The battleship was too early.

1305
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:30,980
 That was in the '80s.

1306
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:31,980
 Oh, is that too early?

1307
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:32,980
 Yeah.

1308
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:33,980
 Oh, wait.

1309
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:34,980
 Yeah, sorry.

1310
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:35,980
 I'm '99.

1311
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:40,740
 I was just saying, Nick Newman is singing his heart out, if you want to, if he's mouthing

1312
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:41,740
 it, he's singing his heart out.

1313
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:47,480
 I can't even see the chat or the people because I'm sharing the screen so that everybody can

1314
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:48,480
 see the scooperty.

1315
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,480
 Yeah.

1316
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:50,480
 I win.

1317
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,480
 Because I'm seeing an amazing performance.

1318
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:52,480
 It's just true.

1319
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,480
 I can't fucking think of the song.

1320
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:56,480
 I pass.

1321
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,480
 Matt?

1322
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,480
 If I could turn back time.

1323
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,480
 No.

1324
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:00,480
 It is Turn Back Time.

1325
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,480
 No.

1326
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,480
 No, no, no.

1327
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,480
 I'm sorry.

1328
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:04,480
 I'm sorry.

1329
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,480
 I'm sorry.

1330
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,480
 I'm sorry.

1331
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,480
 I'm sorry.

1332
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,480
 I'm sorry.

1333
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:09,480
 I'm sorry.

1334
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:10,480
 I didn't know.

1335
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:11,480
 It was, "Do you believe in life after love?"

1336
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:15,440
 But I did the, whatever the thing is where you switch the thing.

1337
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:20,920
 This is why I'll never perform a hand stab in my show.

1338
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:21,920
 Good.

1339
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:22,920
 Good.

1340
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,680
 Because you did get this.

1341
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:27,360
 In this case, you only lost some points.

1342
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,360
 Yeah.

1343
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,080
 You didn't stab yourself in the hand.

1344
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:31,080
 Didn't lose a digit.

1345
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:35,400
 I literally was thinking, do you believe in my head over and over again and then the other

1346
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,400
 words came out of my mouth.

1347
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,400
 And here we are.

1348
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,400
 Yep.

1349
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,400
 Do you believe you can turn back time.

1350
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:46,840
 Matt, get those points back.

1351
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:50,780
 I'll take more share trivia, please, Jacob.

1352
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:55,960
 Let's do photos in movies for 800.

1353
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:59,800
 I'm thinking of a celebrity that was married to Sonny Bono.

1354
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:00,800
 Share.

1355
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:01,800
 Correct.

1356
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:02,800
 Yeah.

1357
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:07,480
 An autograph photo is stolen off a restaurant wall and gives this movie its title.

1358
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:13,000
 The photo is of a Tony award winning singer, dancer, and actress famous for a recurring

1359
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,840
 role in an iconic television series, Meow.

1360
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,720
 What's the movie?

1361
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,040
 What's Eating Gilbert Grape.

1362
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,040
 No.

1363
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:22,040
 What's eating?

1364
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:24,480
 It's just a picture of a grape.

1365
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,480
 To Wong Fu, Julie Neumar.

1366
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,480
 Close.

1367
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:35,000
 So Julie Neumar was Catwoman, but that's not, uh, you got, you got half of it.

1368
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
 What's in the middle?

1369
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
 You got the right movie.

1370
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:44,520

 Thanks for everything.

1382
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:04,360
 No matter how much Newman acted it out, I wouldn't have gotten it.

1383
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,360
 That is a tough one.

1384
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:06,360
 That is a toughie.

1385
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:07,360

 Turn back time.

1426
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,520
 Turn back time.

1427
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:13,520
 It's not a battleship.

1428
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,520
 Yeah.

1429
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:21,120

 Oh shit.

1435
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,120
 That is candy right there.

1436
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,120
 In case.

1437
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,120
 So emergency.

1438
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,120
 So emergency.

01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:31,120

 Oh, mounds dicks in case.

1441
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:52,400
 Oh, my house, slim Jim's, um, not to you.

01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,800
 Oh, that's your opinion.

1443
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:54,800
 Oh, gross.

1444
01:08:54,800 --> 01:09:00,080
 Give me a candy slim Jim, please cover the sugar in case of emergency.

1445
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:09,600
 Yeah, uh, snickers Milky way.

01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,600
 I don't know.

1447
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:19,080
 Uh, pass Paul Twizzlers Twizzlers is make smells happy.

1448
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,400
 Yeah, I was close to slim Jim.

1449
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:29,040
 I mean, in a, in a licorice sense from, from, from like an alien's observing humans.

1450
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:32,920
 A general shape, shape, shape sensation.

1451
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:33,920
 Yeah.

1452
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,080
 Like a thermal camera.

1453
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:42,120
 You can't tell the difference between a slim Jim and a Twizzler.

1454
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:44,880
 Oh God.

1455
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,520
 How many of our poor boys in uniform have suffered that indignity?

1456
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:55,440
 I was on the thermal sergeant couldn't tell the difference between a slim Jim.

1457
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,640
 Oh, it was so upsetting.

1458
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:01,920
 I don't know how to name the candy for 600.

1459
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,920
 Isn't life juicy?

1460
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:17,040
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ah, I think Kardashian, it's Kimberly J Kardashian.

1461
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:27,240
 I think it's starburst starburst is Paul run in the candy category.

1462
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:29,080
 Huge lead 3,800.

1463
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:37,000

1464
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000

1465
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
 Look at it.

1466
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
 Look at it.

1467
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
 Candy.

1468
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,480
 Of course you were.

1469
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:44,480
 Oh man.

1470
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:48,040
 It looked, there's this damn tick tock shop got me.

1471
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:52,320
 I didn't go on a tick tock shop, but they, they do this thing where they scoop the candy

1472
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:56,040
 in a very ASMR kind of way.

1473
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:58,120
 All these different, very exotic candies.

1474
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,120
 Oh man.

1475
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,120
 Ooh, so many exotic candy.

1476
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,480
 That's exactly what their old gig is.

1477
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:07,160
 I'll go photos and movies for 600.

1478
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:10,080
 It's the other daily double.

1479
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:17,640
 This is my chance to keep second place, a framed photo of the protagonist's brother's

1480
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:18,640
 girlfriend.

1481
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:22,500
 To avoid insulting a young actress, the photo was actually of the art director's son in

1482
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:23,500
 a wig.

1483
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,500
 Woof.

1484
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:25,500
 What's the movie?

1485
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:35,240
 This is, oh no, it's not that shit.

1486
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,240
 You fool.

1487
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,240
 Oh wait.

1488
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:38,240
 No, no, no.

1489
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:39,240
 I think it is.

1490
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,120
 I think it is home alone.

1491
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:44,460
 Oh, I think it's home alone.

1492
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:47,160
 It is motherfucking home alone motherfuckers.

1493
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:48,160
 Oh yeah.

1494
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,160
 Wow.

1495
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:52,080
 Jacob, you're really, you're an angry winner.

1496
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:57,200
 It's a Macaulay Culkin's brother, he like has, I can't believe that just popped into

1497
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:58,200
 my head.

1498
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:01,680
 Is it the, is that Butch or whatever his name is?

1499
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:02,680
 Yeah.

1500
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:03,680
 Yeah.

1501
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:04,680
 Yeah.

1502
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:05,680
 And they, and they have like a picture of his girlfriend.

1503
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:06,680
 I got a Canadian girlfriend.

1504
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:07,680
 Yeah.

1505
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:10,320
 And it's like, it is like a silly looking picture.

1506
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,320
 Yeah.

1507
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:12,320
 Yeah.

1508
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:16,560
 Matt closing out the category and the game photos in movies, Matt trying to hold on to

1509
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,840
 third place for $400.

1510
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:19,840
 Let's go.

1511
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:25,960
 A photo of three siblings where two of them seemed to, seemed to fade out of existence.

1512
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:26,960
 That's heavy.

1513
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:27,960
 What's the movie?

1514
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:31,240
 Also, weight has nothing to do with it.

1515
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:34,240
 Baron von Munchausen.

1516
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,440
 Munchausen by proxy.

1517
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,880
 Fade out of existence.

1518
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:39,880
 What is the-

1519
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:40,880
 Come on, you know this.

1520
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:41,880
 I do?

1521
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:42,880
 Yeah.

1522
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:43,880
 Oh yeah.

1523
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:44,880
 Everybody knows this.

1524
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:49,320
 This is the reason that for like two years I wore a Mickey Mouse shirt.

1525
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:50,320
 If you don't get this right-

1526
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,880
 It's because this, this photograph in this movie.

1527
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:56,760
 If you don't get this right, I'm going to call you a Huey loser.

1528
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,080
 Wow.

1529
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,080
 Hip to be square.

1530
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,080
 Close.

1531
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,080
 That's it.

1532
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,080
 In high definition.

1533
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,080
 Okay.

1534
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,080
 That's it.

1535
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:07,840
 Matt, Matt, if you don't get this, I am going to go outside.

1536
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:10,840
 I'm going to get into my lifted Toyota pickup truck.

1537
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:18,880
 I'm going to drive over there and I'm going to take you on a camping trip.

1538
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:19,880
 With Elizabeth Shoe.

1539
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:20,880
 Elizabeth Shoe.

1540
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,040
 She's going to be there.

1541
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,040
 Harry and the Hendersons.

1542
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,040
 No.

1543
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,040
 Oh no.

1544
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,040
 Adventures in Babysitting.

1545
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,040
 Oh no.

1546
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:33,840
 Matt, you're going to feel silly in the future when you don't get this.

1547
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:34,840
 That's fine.

1548
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:38,280
 Let's just, let's just make that the present.

1549
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,280
 Paul.

1550
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,280
 It's back to the future.

1551
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:42,160
 Back to the future.

1552
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:46,240
 Oh, right, right, right, right, right.

1553
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:52,560
 I did not love those movies when they came out and my friends did and then I was always

1554
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:56,320
 on at like parties and sleepovers and stuff, but I was always half paying attention to

1555
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,320
 those things.

1556
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:59,760
 It was a seminal movie for me.

1557
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:00,760
 Well, it's an age thing too.

1558
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:01,760
 It is for a lot of people.

1559
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:02,760
 No, it is for a lot of people.

1560
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:03,760
 It's an age thing.

1561
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:04,760
 Yeah.

1562
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:05,760
 Yeah.

1563
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:06,760
 I'm a little older than you.

1564
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:07,760
 I forget sometimes.

1565
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:08,760
 And those early years are big, right?

1566
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:10,360
 Like that was a big movie in the theater for me.

1567
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:16,200
 Well, and that was, it was big for me because Back to the Future 2 came out at, I was, when

1568
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:19,200
 whatever, whatever age I was, when Back to the Future 2 came out, I was the perfect age

1569
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,200
 for that.

1570
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:24,400
 And so that got me hooked like back on Back to the Future 1 and then, yeah, then I was

1571
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,400
 back in.

1572
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:28,000
 Uh, that's the game by the way, Paul crushed us.

1573
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
 What?

1574
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
 4,200 points.

1575
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,440
 I have 1600 points.

1576
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:34,520
 At least I'm respectable because Matt only has negative 400.

1577
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:38,280
 But if I'd gotten that share question right, I would have only gotten the third.

1578
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:39,280
 That's right.

1579
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,280
 So you got that going.

1580
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:41,280
 That's right.

1581
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:42,280
 So you got that going for you.

1582
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:43,280
 Which is nice.

1583
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,280
 Uh, what was it?

1584
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:47,120
 That was actually a very well-written, uh, uh, tribute.

1585
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,120
 That was great.

1586
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:49,120
 That was really good.

1587
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:50,120
 I love, I love that scoop.

1588
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:53,000
 Even though I got all over by it, it was really good.

1589
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
 Um, thank you for writing it.

1590
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,040
 If you want to send us a scooperty or any kind of jock versus nerd, HeyScoops.com is

1591
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:59,040
 where you ought to go.

1592
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,720
 HeyScoops.com right there on the homepage.

1593
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:03,960
 You can make us a jock versus nerd quiz to play on the show.

1594
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:08,240
 You can also send us some emails, send us some scoop mail right over there at HeyScoops.com.

1595
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:09,240
 Do it now.

1596
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:14,680
 Um, I definitely thought I was going to have, uh, name lists by now, by this point in the

1597
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:20,160
 episode to thank people and I don't, but we're going to thank a lot of people.

1598
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:21,160
 Are we working on it?

1599
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:24,000
 Are we going to add it in or do you think we're just going to go one more episode?

1600
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,680
 Uh, because this one comes out tomorrow, I think we're going to go one more episode.

1601
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:28,680
 Great.

1602
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:29,680
 Well, there's no time.

1603
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:31,040
 We thank all the people who support us on Patreon.

1604
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:34,640
 Obviously we're in a transition of going from any to no one.

1605
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:39,480
 Um, other people, a lot of people have offered to, to hop in there, um, we're still getting

1606
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:43,440
 our, our, our, because we did, and we may still take them up on, but we are going to

1607
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:50,080
 experiment and see if we can do it ourselves, which is a little weird, um, but, uh, uh,

1608
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:53,960
 we should be thanking everyone the way they should be doing it.

1609
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:57,860
 But the way we simplified our Patreon, it seems like we will be able to just be able

1610
01:15:57,860 --> 01:16:04,600
 to get lists ourselves and be, we don't have a lot of, uh, uh, crazy deliverables anymore

1611
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:11,200
 so we can't have people write us and yell at us, um, which is also why we had any, we

1612
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,200
 think we're safe.

1613
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:13,200
 Sure.

1614
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:16,440
 I think with the way it's digital deliverables, safer, the digital rules are mostly doing

1615
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,660
 kind of hang stuff and that kind of thing.

1616
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:23,320
 So yes, um, which is coming up soon, uh, beyond the lookout, we'll have that sometime next

1617
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,320
 week.

1618
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,320
 I'm planning.

1619
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:26,320
 Great.

1620
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:29,040
 But we've been more community oriented with our Patreon and it shows is our patron has

1621
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,200
 gone up a little bit and we appreciate that.

1622
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:34,980
 Uh, it really helps us out tremendously, it helps us in all that we do for us and our

1623
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:35,980
 entire scoop community.

1624
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:36,980
 Yes, indeed.

1625
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:40,880
 If you want to contribute and you have room in your heart and your wallet for, uh, to

1626
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:44,440
 support us, head on over to preachingfun.com

1627
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:24,680
 magazine.

1628
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:28,880
 That's fartsinabag.biz that along with preachingfun.com, it takes you over to our Patreon page where

1629
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:33,720
 for as little as $3 a month, you can help keep this show on the air.

1630
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:38,720
 I was just looking through our Patreon, uh, page earlier today and, uh, I was looking

1631
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:46,000
 through the, the full list with like everybody who has ever been on our Patreon at all.

1632
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,840
 And it was just a little walk down memory lane.

1633
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:54,520
 It was so great seeing all the names of current and former Patreons and people who have been

1634
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:56,280
 on there for a long time.

1635
01:17:56,280 --> 01:18:01,160
 Uh, it has like, they, they go away and they come back and then they, and I think, you

1636
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:03,360
 know, and they go, sorry, I had to take a break.

1637
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:06,400
 I look, you know, no explanation needed.

1638
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:09,880
 Anytime you can find a little time to support us is just amazing.

1639
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:10,880
 And we're so grateful.

1640
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:14,960
 And if it can't be for your entire lives, that's, that's okay.

1641
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,000
 You know, uh, we appreciate it.

1642
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:22,360
 Um, and of course we appreciate our long time, uh, supporters, uh, as much.

1643
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:26,200
 So, uh, but we truly, we truly have such a soft spot in our hearts.

1644
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:31,600
 For everybody who supports us over there at preachingfund.com and fartsinabag.biz, uh,

1645
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,120
 because we couldn't do the show without you.

1646
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:36,800
 Just very frankly, we are dependent on our Patreon supporters.

1647
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,120
 We are dependent on our paid subscribers.

1648
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:45,000
 So if you think this show is worth more than $0, preachingfund.com, fartsinabag.biz, that

1649
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,040
 is the place that you can go.

1650
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:50,240
 Uh, oh, uh, AWOL scoop, thank you for reminding me.

1651
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:54,040
 Uh, we do have our billionaire experiment still in the works.

1652
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:57,480
 Uh, the experiment is you're going to give each of us a billion dollars.

1653
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:02,120
 So we need $3 billion, uh, before taxes, $3 billion gross.

1654
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:05,360
 I don't think we've been completely clear on the financials here.

1655
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:06,360
 It can be crypto.

1656
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:10,080
 It can be fine with paying it, paying back some of that.

1657
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,080
 Yeah, yeah.

1658
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:15,080
 No, if we have to tax on it and whatever is income or however we have to do that, we'll

1659
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:16,880
 figure that out on our end.

1660
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,440
 You don't worry about that.

1661
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:21,980
 You just come up with the 3 billion even.

1662
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:25,040
 We might even bring Annie back to help us figure that one out.

1663
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:28,200
 Yeah, we might, we might, uh, maybe a contractor fee.

1664
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:29,200
 Yeah.

1665
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:33,820
 Uh, but yeah, you give us the $3 billion and we will see if we are better at being billionaires

1666
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:35,320
 than the current billionaires out there.

1667
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:36,320
 You know what?

1668
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:37,320
 I'll go ahead and say it.

1669
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:40,200
 We'll even bring back the hands-less eating, uh, reward.

1670
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,200
 So there you go.

1671
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:46,640
 Challenge returns, but we learned the first time around, we have to do it all in one.

1672
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:50,260
 We can't do like multiple sessions, one hands-less eating session.

1673
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:54,880
 You know, Matt, you know, that has to be available at the, uh, where do we go eat that famous

1674
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:55,880
 Los Angeles?

1675
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:58,640
 Pepper mill, pepper mill, pepper mill menu.

1676
01:19:58,640 --> 01:19:59,640
 The big step.

1677
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:00,640
 Lucky for you.

1678
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:01,640
 Everything's on the pepper mill.

1679
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:02,640
 Right.

1680
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:06,600
 You need to just sit seriously, reinstate that on the Patrion at the $3 billion level.

1681
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:12,200
 We need to make a legit $3 billion level on the Patrion.

1682
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,200
 You're right.

1683
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:14,200
 Because that's hilarious.

1684
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:18,720
 Eating videos, eating video, $3 billion.

1685
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:22,560
 No, no, no, for $3 billion.

1686
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:26,840
 You get three, you get three, $3 billion for $3 billion.

1687
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:27,840
 You get one from each of us.

1688
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:28,840
 Yeah.

1689
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:32,680
 I like that before the government, even right away, we're giving away 5% to Patrion.

1690
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:35,000
 Like we would increase their stock price.

1691
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
 Right.

1692
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
 Yeah.

1693
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,160
 It would be, uh, it would be a big win day for them as well.

1694
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:43,500
 If someone had three billion, they give away, they're going to do it through Patrion and

1695
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:44,500
 not contact.

1696
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:45,500
 That's pretty great.

1697
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:46,500
 Not just give it right to us.

1698
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:47,620
 I mean, but you know what?

1699
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:54,920
 Maybe they really want those videos and the other benefits that come from being a Patrion.

1700
01:20:54,920 --> 01:21:02,000
 There are incredible benefits that come from being a Patrion at PreachingFun.com and Fartsinabag.biz.

1701
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,480
 Have you not hit the production meeting of music?

1702
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:10,480
 This is killer stuff.

1703
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:21,880
 I'm going to put $150 million by the way, is what Patriots cut would be.

1704
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:22,880
 Amazing.

1705
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:23,880
 Amazing.

1706
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:29,520
 We would be giving Patriot $150 million.

1707
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:30,520
 I'm okay.

1708
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:31,520
 I'm okay with it.

1709
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:32,520
 All right.

1710
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,880
 We'd be, we'd be a Patriot on celebrities forever.

1711
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:38,920
 My, my, uh, we'd probably get an invite to their parties.

1712
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:40,280
 Improv group, possible side effects.
