 Happy birthday, Paul. Thank you

17
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,640
 50 fun years old

18
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:16,200
 I feel it

19
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,320
 Social

20
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,520
 Barely sitting because of me issues. It's

21
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:35,080
 Fun yeah, wait you you have knee issues. I have a bum knee right now. Yeah, I think there's something going on

22
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,080
 It's my right knee is just acting a fool

23
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,400
 I don't know why

24
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:46,600
 It's just been last five days the left face. So we have a different disease entirely. Absolutely. Absolutely different. It's tough

25
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,480
 Be careful fellas. It's spreading completely different shit. I don't know. It's just you know

26
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,720
 I think it's possibly the change in the weather combined with the fact that I

27
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,400
 Worked my ass off for three days straight. I don't know

28
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:05,480
 Who knows whatever it's you know, what's fucked up but good it gets better the more I'm up and on it

29
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:11,680
 So I guess that's our weird. It's when I sit down that it starts to get really bad. Oh, it's like tightening up

30
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,320
 Yeah, I don't know. So I'm having to stretch a lot more and all that kind of thing, which eventually is good

31
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,680
 I do need to do more stretching and and all that kind of thing

32
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,640
 what's happening with your knee Matt I

33
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,600
 Just heard it

34
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:33,480
 Playing in a soccer game with adults versus kids soccer games. Oh, yeah smart play. Okay

35
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,480
 Oh, hold on one second guys. I gotta hit this button

36
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:44,000
 Because my knee hurts too

37
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,200
 And what I'm finding is that I am a restless sleeper

38
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,440
 I toss and turn so what happens is I

39
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:00,760
 start to feel better and then I wake up in my knee it hurts the next day because I because you've been jerking around my

40
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,120
 Leg around all when I like okay, so I worked yesterday early in the morning

41
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,200
 And I had a full day and stayed up past my normal bedtime

42
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,160
 Which I was I had three days in a row so I was getting to bed at like five o'clock

43
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,320
 so I wouldn't play I wasn't playing any games and sick as a dog so I was trying to take care of her a little bit and

44
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:27,800
 Not get sick myself and so far so good. Yeah, I got a little stuffy head today, but not too bad, but

45
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:36,080
 When I stay up late like I did last night past my normal bedtime my

46
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,240
 Legs start to get real

47
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,960
 antsy and they start to hurt they start to hurt and they get jittery and I have to like

48
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:51,520
 Shake my leg and twist my leg all evening. It's like go to bed. Go to bed. Go to bed. Okay, fine

49
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,580
 But yeah, I was up pretty late. I mean I wasn't up that late. I was like 930, but

50
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,720
 Well, I

51
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,120
 Forgot that I'm here. I'm a see I'm in the ocean. Yes. I'm actually actually off-shore some rando

52
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,820
 Thomas Island that princess owns

53
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
 Whoo, but

54
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,880
 I've seen it and

55
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,400
 I

56
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,800
 Forgot to pack a knee brace because I found it was helping my knees

57
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,760
 I was going to sleep with a knee brace which doesn't help me sleep better

58
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:28,920
 It just helps my knee feel better the next day. I sleep worse. I sleep more restlessly wearing a knee brace

59
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,920
 Okay, right

60
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:42,000
 Sounds grabbing my knee. Oh shit. I'm watching Alien Earth. So I assume some alien has gripped my knee. It's like my knee cap

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:52,080
 By the way, I I hate the modern

62
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,060
 TV show where like you you kind of like slow burn

63
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,960
 Middle episodes to like to like peak almost peak boredom and then they and then they really stick the landing on the final

64
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,360
 Two and a half episodes and you're like, yeah. All right

65
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,480
 You did pick it up and I it's like I'd rather watch the show that I just watched at the end the whole time

66
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:17,280
 Are they I hate it too. And what makes me crazy is in our day. We had 24 25

67
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,400
 Now they can't even get fucking eight. Yeah

68
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:28,680
 Well, yeah, I think we look back at the quality of those 24 episodes we're not gonna be like nail of them

69
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,080
 I think yeah, I think we'd be surprised. I'd be surprised

70
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,640
 Well, here's the thing here's the right not nailed them take up with take a pause recording

71
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,640
 Let's all go watch Hill Street Blues and let's come back

72
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:47,560
 Go watch in the heat of the night. I mean my my base thought is

73
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:54,840
 We're gonna sit down everybody and all watch a different world, let's do it

74
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,440
 I just think they're trying to get rid of even more episodes. We're trying to prove that they can't do where I want to agree with you

75
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,000
 It's just money. We just were spending movie money on television now and so you can't afford to make more than eight episodes, right?

76
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,320
 but

77
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:16,600
 Compelling drama that can resolve in an hour. That's where you're talking about. That's what you're talking about. Paul is

78
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:23,480
 These episodes are these these modern TV shows are secretly just super long movies. Yeah, which is gross, you know

79
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:29,080
 Yeah, they're like they have some they have some kind of arc. Yeah

80
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,560
 But they

81
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,720
 An episode of Star Trek their slow burn in the shit. Well, that's the thing like Trek is sort of

82
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,400
 Responsible for all this too because it was season three where they did

83
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,160
 You know best of both worlds. That was the first

84
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,840
 true

85
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,080
 Season-to-season cliffhanger that had ever been attempted in syndication

86
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,520
 Oh, I see it was it was the end of a season and then the season break. Yes

87
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,880
 Gotcha. So half of the season half of the cliffhanger was at the end of the season

88
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,800
 then you had to wait four months five months before the next one started up again and

89
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,440
 You know

90
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,440
 tantalizing but it

91
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,160
 Patrick Stewart became the other thing that the when he became locutus. Yes

92
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,520
 That is are the what's the Borg that's the Borg that became locutus of Borg

93
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:22,760
 Yeah

94
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:29,240
 And that is that was the model that they then went forward with from then on out with all the Trek series

95
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,520
 all the Trek series had

96
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,640
 season cliffhangers I

97
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:40,240
 still remember as a kid not knowing how like I didn't necessarily like we didn't get like TV guide to the house or anything, right and

98
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:48,080
 Different strokes. Yeah, they snuck on the set of Knight Rider. I remember that and they were hiding behind

99
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,320
 He was with that kid from Terminator not the main kid from Terminator the other redhead kid from Terminator

100
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,120
 Who I think was also on salute your shorts. Yeah. Yeah, the little punk that was him and and

101
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,960
 Arnold hid what happened they hid and they almost got killed

102
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,220
 They hid they hid in the set and the set was gonna be exploded, right? Yeah. Yeah, and everybody goes. Yes

103
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:15,920
 The audience goes and I was like all summer being like I have to remember to watch the first see if they die

104
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,240
 What happened?

105
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,680
 Young me was wondering whether

106
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:28,600
 Gonna get dead in the explosion like they start the series be like so sorry every character is dead

107
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,240
 They all do well. Well, it wasn't every character was just Arnold dead space

108
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,300
 The cast broke on to the set of a James Cameron movie and James Cameron murdered them

109
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:43,480
 Was gonna happen in terms of that like Arnold's death. Yeah

110
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:49,440
 I don't well the little kid died in a set explosion in the Simpsons in the first season

111
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,800
 Child was killed. There's that classic episode in the first season of Simpsons

112
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,800
 They're all classics, but that one where Homer finally goes to try sushi

113
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:05,280
 Any fucking loves it and then he decides he wants to go for the forbidden sushi the fugu

114
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,680
 Which is the blowfish which if not prepared properly can be poisonous and deadly

115
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:16,160
 And yes, so the whole premise was will Homer die

116
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,420
 Eating this poison sushi and the commercials that you didn't get TV guide

117
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:27,860
 I got TV guide and the TV guide commercial was a little blurb a little picture with Bart

118
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,280
 Coming up to going. Yeah, right. Like they're gonna kill the main character of a

119
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,560
 In the first season and you know

120
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,440
 So it really was you know, it was before Game of Thrones. They were do that back there

121
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,200
 They were always on their ear. They were always putting stuff

122
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,040
 Anything within I also saw?

123
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:53,440
 Damn, I just saw a tick tock to me. So say I'm not gonna talk about it. Anyway, uh, I

124
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,280
 Wanted to say before we go any further. I

125
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,800
 wanted to say thank you to Matt and Jacob because

126
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:06,080
 Guys, I don't know if you know but they always come through when it's my birthday and sure enough here

127
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,080
 We are recording on my birthday

128
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:14,320
 And they did it. They gave me permission to use my soundbox throughout this episode

129
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,240
 Birthday buddy, there we go. So that's what you have to look forward to

130
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:32,060
 Is zoom cutting off the fart box? Let's see if I want to go through the recording here, but we won't

131
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:40,840
 Zoom as a thing where it cuts out like weird weird weird noise stuff

132
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,420
 It's part of it's part of its noise cancel like things that you only hear the what a bunch of shit

133
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:50,640
 Correct that it is going into the episode

134
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,380
 Okay, that's great. So it'll be really funny

135
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,240
 That it will uh, you know

136
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,000
 It'll come up only in the episode

137
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,440
 So that'll be a whole surprise for later. Yeah, that's right

138
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,320
 So yeah, but a couple of people said it. I already had it pulled up to I'm sorry Paul

139
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,040
 Star Trek didn't do it first. Who did it first?

140
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:22,160
 Dallas who shot JR. Oh, I guess you're right. Yeah 10 years 10 years earlier Dallas was 1980 Star Trek

141
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
 Did it 1990?

142
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,640
 Yeah, yes, they did the the season break who shot JR

143
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:35,240
 I'm sorry Paul. Your precious Star Trek didn't do it first. Hey, look look I'm I am I

144
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,000
 Have no problem giving Brandon Braga less credit. Fuck that guy

145
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,080
 It's all good he can eat

146
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,520
 Brandon Braga's a piece of shit

147
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,120
 Man now my my computer's asking me if I'm playing music. No, I'm not playing music you dumb thing. I

148
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,160
 Mean I played a tiny little piece of music. Well now I can't really do it. It's not fun

149
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,440
 If I know I can hear it. It'll be fun later though. Anyway, oh, I got a message for so

150
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,560
 Well, not only did I injure my knee playing soccer

151
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,120
 But we decided this year man. We did a whole

152
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,480
 Is if Nick Newman

153
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:26,240
 Totally influenced my whole family about Thanksgiving. It's basically this is the unit because seated our kids hate

154
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,000
 Thanksgiving food. Oh

155
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,640
 Would you do it? That's right. Your kids do not care for Thanksgiving food. They never have they do not they do not and

156
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:44,120
 Sarah's you know, basically a vegan. Mm-hmm. And so I rest that there's only one person the household that was looking forward to Thanksgiving

157
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,440
 It was me and I was like, well, I'm not gonna I'm not gonna you know, be a fatty dictator

158
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,440
 Oh, you know that

159
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:58,960
 And so we blew it off I've never done it before in my life we blew off Thanksgiving

160
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:08,720
 I'm so proud of you. It feels so weird. I feel icky about no. No. No, what'd you have?

161
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,040
 Just normal. So here's what we did. We rallied a

162
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,880
 Kind of like friends friends with kids kickball game. Okay. Mm-hmm

163
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,120
 and

164
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,480
 We brought turkey and roast beef deli slices and croissants and right and some fixings

165
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,960
 Some hummus and penis pita. I said Pia penis penis, okay

166
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,920
 So we did we did our we did our new tradition of dipping our penis and in hummus

167
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,680
 Mine the pine nuts and

168
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:52,800
 We have like a basic like half-ass picnic that's not a new tradition, you know, what's weird Matt

169
00:13:52,800 --> 00:14:01,560
 You know what what's strange about that tradition is I personally have never had anyone I've never paid anyone to penis on me before

170
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:09,160
 Nobody's buying that

171
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,240
 There ain't a carbon zone of bean on me

172
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,660
 The bill could never go bond so done Trump's been that's right

173
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,920
 But shit

174
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:37,180
 So then so we're playing kickball and both Sarah and I pop the hamstring playing kickball

175
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:49,640
 And she was like this is terrible this is the worst thing Sarah really Sarah really pop

176
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,320
 But she was going to run for a ball and you know, like like it's like you like music professional injuries

177
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,320
 But they're running and they just stop and you go

178
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,280
 Yeah, like Sarah's Sarah's running and also it was like nope

179
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:07,360
 I could have ran to the next base and I stopped like no God and then the very next play I

180
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,400
 Pop my hamstring running from second to third

181
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,360
 So, uh, I just it's my brain

182
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,400
 Subconsciously cannot let Sarah have any more attention that she already gets good

183
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:25,920
 We have to do it. Well, we had inadvertently a similar situation at my home because

184
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,960
 The day before Thanksgiving and got terribly sick like

185
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:38,440
 Knocked down drag out sick still had to go to work still worked and almost dying

186
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:46,160
 And so I was like, okay. I better make at least some kind of backup plan. So on the way home, I bought

187
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:53,520
 Warm up mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. So at least we'd have something that resembled a Thanksgiving. Okay, right and

188
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:59,580
 Got home and sure enough. She was just out of it. We were done. We didn't get to go down to the the in-laws

189
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,360
 But we absolutely had

190
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,560
 chicken nuggets mashed potatoes cottage cheese

191
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,120
 That was that was Thanksgiving dinner

192
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,160
 That was it

193
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,240
 Wait, where's the cottage cheese? Is it countries of its own dishes to go on top?

194
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,520
 I put mash I put cottage cheese on the mashed potatoes. I can't I love that. That's my favorite

195
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:26,160
 This has come up before and I I still don't understand I talked about it all time. It's one of those things

196
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,400
 I just have to I love it. Just did a triple take up on his view

197
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,440
 I love mashed potatoes

198
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:39,400
 I always have it's so good. Are you pregnant? Are you expecting? I mean

199
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,760
 by the looks of me you'd think when when's that fucking thing coming, but

200
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:49,200
 No, I

201
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:58,600
 See Nick see Nick Newman top baked potatoes with cottage cheese, I think it's a southern thing. I think there's some kind of weird

202
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,100
 You and Nick will not represent the entire

203
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,880
 Okay, but I'm saying Kentucky fine

204
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:14,200
 I'll say Kentucky because I my mom my mom used to make lasagna using cottage cheese instead of ricotta

205
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:19,200
 So I that's I prefer cottage cheese and lasagna to ricotta

206
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,040
 Any day of the week? Yeah

207
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:27,640
 But I just really love a little cottage cheese on my mashed potatoes according to the Google

208
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,360
 It's not a it's not a southern thing or it doesn't have a particular area of origin

209
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:41,360
 it is touted though as a a nice higher protein version and a little healthier version of mashed potatoes if you're not doing like all the

210
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,040
 Yeah, if you're not doing like the loading mash up in their sour creams and bacons and all that

211
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:52,060
 No, I just do a little just a little cottage cheese. Just a dab of potatoes and some cottage cheese in there a little salt and pepper

212
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:58,360
 Yeah, sure. Yes little salt pepper. I'm sure every doctor be proud proud of you switching the cutters

213
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,360
 Oh, I mean, it's the healthy lifestyle choice of a generation as you can tell

214
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,880
 It's done wonders for me

215
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,280
 It's really move the needle. I

216
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:13,080
 Mean it got you to this birthday. It did. I mean, hey, I made it to 51 better than a lot of people do I

217
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,880
 Bet it's better than half the population does so there you go

218
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,800
 Rfk approved don't be saying that lemur creamer lemur creamer in in in chat

219
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,520
 What's this if I'm going to get all those horrible dyes of the cottage cheese?

220
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,840
 With the mashed potato

221
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:42,960
 Paul you are okay, we can't hear you, but I know it'll be on the broadcast

222
00:18:42,960 --> 00:19:00,360
 Right horrible fuck poetry, man, he's so nasty he's so nasty. Oh

223
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,120
 I would pay

224
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,600
 $14.99 for a book of rfk's poetry. Oh god

225
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,720
 Don't say that he'll publish it. He'll do it. He'll he don't give a fuck

226
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:20,240
 He does a little like

227
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,800
 Yes in a kickball. We all ate sandwiches and hummus and

228
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:30,000
 Then went home and I had we had leftover pizzas from the day before because we had all a bunch of kids over if we

229
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 all saw wicked okay, and

230
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,280
 So it was it was leftover pizza was the other Thanksgiving course that we had and then

231
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,840
 There's off the Mac Kings for dessert. That's pretty great

232
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,560
 That sounds like a nice day

233
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:49,920
 It was super fun it was it was it was really nice not to take Thanksgiving that seriously yeah, and it was like gosh

234
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:56,340
 Really good idea to not stress out of all Thanksgiving

235
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:06,760
 I performed it in the max Thanksgiving variety show nice good

236
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:13,280
 He asked Brad Sherwood and I since Paul couldn't make it Paul was invited

237
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,740
 to do a some kind of improv song bit how fun and

238
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:24,760
 Then I called Spadoni and Spadoni was available so we had Spadoni there beautiful and

239
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:31,360
 then after arranging all that I got a text from Brad saying you got a minute and I was like

240
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:38,440
 Oh, no, he's gonna fail. Uh-huh, and then I I call him and it is not him bailing. He's like hey, it's not a wild idea

241
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,880
 It's like what if all right? What if what if we do?

242
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,840
 do it all in Shakespeare and

243
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,600
 You do magic tricks, but I play like your hype man like your producer

244
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,200
 And I'm just blown away by all the magic you do and I just narrate everyone's thoughts

245
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,680
 I

246
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,800
 Like this and I said

247
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:08,000
 The one thing that Mac King's show has is bad, yeah

248
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,440
 Arguably lousy with it and

249
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:20,300
 You know we were specifically asked to do music yeah, it goes alright, why don't we do it as a musical?

250
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:25,080
 Yes, and motherfucker

251
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,120
 Mm-hmm. So we did

252
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:37,580
 We did what we called the the Shakespeare repertory presents much to do about magic the musical great

253
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,840
 Funny that's cool

254
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:49,200
 It was so well that some people thought it was written which is always the best

255
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,400
 exactly and

256
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,720
 Brad and I want to do it again

257
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,520
 Find a way to like we were not satisfied with just the 10-minute hunk that we want to do it again

258
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,880
 This is the trick right like we're finding these new ways to expand on improv like

259
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,960
 Colin Mockery is doing the hypnoprov

260
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,520
 Yes, Brad works with Colin a lot

261
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:22,400
 So yeah, I imagine he's seeing the bold new adventures that can be like what else can we use improv to mine?

262
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:28,320
 Well, yes, so Brad and Colin perform

263
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:34,260
 I've been formed together for 15 something years or more than that. Maybe okay

264
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:41,880
 So so anytime you see hip improv performing. That's Colin not performing with with Brad. Ah

265
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,840
 It's just I think that's the the most delicate way I can say it got it. Yeah

266
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,880
 So, yes, Colin has discovered that trying to sell the hip improv thing they tried it in Vegas it was too soon

267
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,120
 It was a mistake and there's also bad timing. Yeah

268
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,000
 and and and did not

269
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,160
 Did not get a lot of positive show reports from that. Hey man of experience. Where did they do that?

270
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:13,040
 Muppet improv didn't hardly fucking work in Vegas. No, it's it's fucking tough

271
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:18,360
 Muppets didn't work in Vegas for a different set of reasons. Oh fine, but it's still it's still

272
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:26,480
 Improv with awesome shit not working. So yeah, there's the crazy cocaine habit of all those puppets that really did it in. That's it

273
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,720
 They really do good lord those felt-lined straw. They are just

274
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,440
 hoovering it hoovering it

275
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:40,400
 They are bald they are

276
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,600
 I'll tell you who else is sucking up a lot of cocaine into their felt-lined noses and that is the following sponsor

277
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,960
 Which I have in my hand right here. Oh

278
00:23:49,960 --> 00:24:00,840
 This is Paul's emergency toilet paper socks Paul's emergency toilet paper socks

279
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,840
 Monte Cristo

280
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,880
 This year that was this year

281
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:10,560
 We've all had the horrible embarrassment of

282
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:16,640
 Having to shit in a place without a bathroom

283
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,280
 Oh

284
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,800
 When it happens not if but when

285
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,520
 Will you be ready for the challenge of?

286
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,880
 the necessary ass wipery

287
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:40,000
 Because that's the real challenge of going to the bathroom without a bathroom the cleanup

288
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,320
 Introducing Paul's emergency ass wipe socks

289
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,540
 Paul's emergency ass wipe socks are equipped with a double layer

290
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,160
 one for absorbency and

291
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,760
 one

292
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,760
 to be discarded and

293
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,680
 then used again for absorbency I

294
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,160
 Was to number one there are two number ones

295
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:11,640
 Yeah, but one of them is for number two when you have the Paul's emergency shit socks on you technically are wearing four socks

296
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,600
 The first outer layer is the more absorbent layer

297
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,160
 And that is the one to be used upon first blush if you will

298
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,880
 getting the most

299
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,960
 liquid out

300
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,160
 of the system

301
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:33,520
 The second is less absorbent but no less important

302
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,600
 But we advise you go ahead and employ both socks

303
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,640
 use the second socks first layer of

304
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:48,500
 Absorbency to make sure that the rectal area is clear of all juices

305
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,160
 then

306
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,800
 With the third sock which is the first sock second layer

307
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:00,120
 Go ahead and do what we call the check it tab

308
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:08,680
 Tab it up there take it back out and check it. Where are we standing folks? Did we get everything if?

309
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,040
 we didn't

310
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,560
 invert the third sock which is the second sock of the first sock

311
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:24,560
 After the check

312
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:30,520
 You go ahead and you use the fourth sock, which is the second sock of the second sock

313
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,160
 that one of course is

314
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,200
 rounded up and

315
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,200
 tucked as a muffler

316
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,240
 to prevent any further seepage and

317
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,840
 Hey scoops to check out

318
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,840
 It just makes too much sense

319
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:50,560
 Jacob take me we got to figure out the zoom thing because everyone's turned off their cameras and so we can't see if anyone's laughing

320
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,560
 I

321
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:58,760
 Saw a few or maybe everyone turned off the camera just a vomit. I saw

322
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,800
 I saw a few laughs

323
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:07,400
 Just in time for Christmas

324
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,640
 Merry Christmas shit, so you cannot hang them by your but you can hang them by the fireplace, you know

325
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,320
 Well, I mean you had a drive out somehow. Yeah

326
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:31,240
 Have you been yes, if you guys been watching the show physical Asia on Netflix is that the one with the really strange

327
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,600
 Japanese Olivia Newton John impersonator

328
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,760
 Yes, yes, okay, that's that's the show that I'm alluding to right now

329
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:51,200
 Japanese Olivia Newton John impersonator physical Asia. Yeah, that was very odd, but I mean, you know

330
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,200
 Oh

331
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:01,420
 That's so much better than the Japanese person singing physical that I thought you were about to do I didn't do that

332
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,800
 So it's a it's a crazy reality competition show

333
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:15,720
 Where they do these insane like physical tasks and everything it's different Asian countries

334
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,520
 Participating competing against each other. Also for some reason Australia

335
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:26,920
 So it's like all these Asian yeah cuz Olivia and John and Australia because of Olivia Newton John, of course

336
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:32,040
 So I'm watching it last night

337
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,520
 And they they do it's all overdubbed all of the language is overdubbed

338
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:41,120
 Which is kind of neat just as a side note all of the teams competing against each other

339
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:47,440
 In the overdubbing watching watching the show. It just sounds like they're all speaking English to each other, which of course they are not

340
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,440
 They're all speaking their native languages to each other

341
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,720
 Which means nobody else can understand them in the competition so they can just

342
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:01,600
 Work together and talk to each other in their native language and the other team can't understand their planning and it's it's really kind of a neat

343
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,440
 Twist but the thing I want to talk about was the overdubbing

344
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:12,120
 Because they do all of these crazy physical things where they're like grunting and yelling and everything while they're while they're doing it

345
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,320
 And they overdub all the grunting and yelling

346
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:21,840
 Consistent it's so goddamn funny that makes no sense. Oh

347
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:29,200
 Really strange it is the best thing to watch once you realize that that's what they're doing and like oh right

348
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:36,480
 That's not the that that's the same overdubbed voice that is now yelling which is not what that person actually sounds like

349
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,440
 Yeah

350
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:46,440
 It's so good. It's so good. What are some of the physical challenges they have to do they do shit like I mean

351
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,440
 It's it's really insane stuff

352
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:57,200
 the the first one they do is like a king of the mountain type thing where they have these these each team is six members and

353
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,040
 They're all like MMA fighters and

354
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,480
 wrestlers

355
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,600
 Track stars, it's it's quite a few former Olympians

356
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,940
 All this stuff. I mean it sounds like Battle of the Network stars

357
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:16,920
 Kind of but in like a hardcore way. I mean it's it's hey battle network stars was hardcore

358
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,280
 I'm telling you Paul

359
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:26,660
 Meatloaf could not have gotten through the first leg of the first competition on this show

360
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,240
 He would have died into the board. I

361
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:34,840
 Was worried we're gonna present a vigorous defense for Battle of the Network stars. I will I will

362
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:41,200
 It's Paul's birthday, man, of course, we're gonna present a vigorous defense of Battle of the Network stars

363
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,280
 You know, I also saw Jacob. I don't know if you're aware of this new show that they're doing

364
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,240
 they've gone in and they're doing this whole retelling of

365
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,320
 The guys who came up with the atom bomb

366
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,920
 But it's set back in the in the 50s

367
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,840
 So it's like it's like a future backwards. So it's like it's okay

368
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,700
 It's the the the scientists that made the atom bomb, but they're all

369
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:13,520
 High-schoolers in the 50s, right? Okay, so it's up up and hop up and stop up and sock

370
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,760
 Oppenheimer is what it's called

371
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:22,540
 Oppen sock Oppenheimer and can't say the title of the show of the first three tries

372
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:31,200
 Oppen sock Oppenheimer, I said it there. I'll stop sock Oppenheimer and it's also starring

373
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,040
 Olivia neutron John

374
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:39,200
 That's how it works, yeah

375
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:46,800
 The show was a bomb I'm assuming it's that's Pluto TV and it's Pluto TV. It's a Pluto original

376
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,360
 Good call man. Good call Pluto original

377
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,560
 Oppenheimer I said it again

378
00:31:55,560 --> 00:32:05,560
 Say Oppensock Oppenheimer five times fast. Good luck. No, I'm not trying to watch Pluto TV

379
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:14,220
 No, they do these insane challenges like they they do stuff that if the three of us tried to do a

380
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:19,560
 Single one of these games we would die. Oh, I can't play kickball

381
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:27,080
 Oh the first thing I heard about on Thursday night was how injured you and Sarah were

382
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,240
 and

383
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,040
 Sarah and Sarah's like, oh Matt and I are so hurt and keeps watching these

384
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:42,920
 These tic-tacs with these physical challenges. Have you seen some of these where the couples do these extreme physical moves?

385
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:48,480
 With each other they do like these very gymnastic. They'll see a gymnastic move and then they like okay

386
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,200
 We can we can do that, you know, and they're in there like little home gym and they're trying to do it

387
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,200
 and sometimes they fuck it up some of them well

388
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:03,720
 Over Thanksgiving. She found this one where these guys are doing a new tradition right after the Thanksgiving meal the men

389
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:09,760
 grab the their wives and hoist them on their shoulders and run a race and

390
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,280
 And it's laughs of strength. Yeah, and was laughing her ass off

391
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,560
 And I was like I could do it. Let's do it. And she's like, no, no, you couldn't

392
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,800
 Pick you up. Let's go

393
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:29,600
 Pick her up and she wouldn't she wouldn't work with me at all, which is probably trying to convince and let him pick her up

394
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,400
 Is the video that we all need to see wouldn't do it. She would not do it. She's like, no, no

395
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:39,240
 No, I can't do it by myself. You got to give me a little jump so I can you know get it going here

396
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,160
 But she would not she would not commit to the bit

397
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:47,000
 But to be fair, she was also coughing up a fit because she was still very very sick

398
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 But I don't get picked up like that. That's right

399
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,640
 She doesn't get picked up like that and she didn't get picked up like that because I did do it

400
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,300
 but she was she was ridiculous, I could have done it but

401
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:05,200
 Yeah, I see all these things Jacob. Did you ever see the the Japanese one with the wall and the shapes?

402
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,320
 The wall and the shape yeah

403
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:17,440
 Did I see a television show made in Japan that had a wall and some shapes?

404
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,400
 Yeah, is your question? Yeah. So what happens is

405
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:27,240
 You're standing you're standing. I saw Shogun Paul. You're standing in this you're standing in this

406
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:32,360
 Hallway. No, wait. Oh before you go on I'm trying to think of a show that doesn't have a wall

407
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:41,800
 What happens is the outdoor set shows like the Bear Grylls site things where he's surviving in the wilderness

408
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,960
 I guess I don't have walls. There's plenty of shapes though. They have shapes but no walls

409
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:51,360
 this the wall has a shape cut out of it of a

410
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,360
 silhouette

411
00:34:53,360 --> 00:35:00,000
 Uh-huh, right a per a person's physical silhouette. Okay in some sort of stance. Oh

412
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,040
 And the wall I have seen this wall moves towards you. Yep

413
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,560
 And you must assume the stance to Wile E. Coyote style

414
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:15,320
 Fit through the silhouette as it you have to pass through the wall or yes backs you

415
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:20,080
 Yes, you have it's called hole in the wall. There you go buddies on it

416
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,560
 It's called hole in the wall. And so I thought it's called any portentous storm

417
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,920
 any portentous storm

418
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:32,080
 It depends on what region you're watching it in some of them is called any portentous storm. So I'm gonna call it hole in a wall

419
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,560
 I've watched every episode of any portentous storm

420
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:42,320
 So that's what happens and the wall keeps going up and then either you get through it or you get smushed

421
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,360
 They're gonna do a two-person version of that Paul. Have you seen that? No, what is called death in the doorway?

422
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,360
 Oh, it's a gentleman's game

423
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:59,080
 Any portentous storm also has a lot of smushing as well a lot of smushing a lot of smushing

424
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,520
 There was the cocaine addicted muppets was they had a solo show with miss piggy

425
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:14,100
 Called any snort in a perm and she was just out there hoovering hoovering cocaine

426
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:19,480
 So much money

427
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:26,600
 Piggy Oh

00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:33,340

 Come over here and rub it up against my gums

00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:05,440
 I'll tell you what wants to have a broad

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,460
 Johnny Depp in the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean

 That's really funny Leona because I just said, oh my god, did this biggie just like licking Kermit to get high

442

 Kermit always does on a straight and biggie's tail dart frog a dart frog. I dart the hell away from this crazy bitch

443
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:28,240
 Colombian sober is really funny. I like Colombian sober a lot. I'm truly stealing

444
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:41,120
 Even all out on Thanksgiving. Oh, we did we did we tore it up from the floor on up. We had

445
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:49,040
 I don't know 15 20 people over at the house had a big old turkey on the smoker had we had we had house

446
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,720
 Guests in town that week. So they were they were around

447
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:56,680
 We had a ton of people it was great though several people even commented on it

448
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,600
 We had no stress the whole cooking of the of the meal and everything

449
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:07,260
 We were just walking around having a nice time. That's how you do it baby. No stress at all. Yeah, great. Everything just worked out

450
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,640
 We had a nice big spread set up outside in the in the yard

451
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,880
 Yeah, just so so so nice

452
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,520
 That's beautiful. This is the only adjustment. I should have made just I should have come by your house after kickball

453
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,120
 It's the only adjustment I should have made. Yep

454
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,160
 You're gonna you're gonna limped over to the house after kickball and had some turkey

455
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,440
 Nice pack from you. Yep. Yep. I would help you out with an ice pack

456
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:35,880
 The best thing happened that I doubt I'll ever be able to repeat

457
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,920
 That is what we had the big spread set up. We had all the people a

458
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,040
 Couple hours later. I had to go to work. I'd do shows that night

459
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:50,920
 That's where I saw the the injured Sarah that night and we talked about the kickball game of doom and uh, I

460
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,880
 Got home a couple hours later

461
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:59,680
 There was still about five people at the house and the first thing that SJ said to me when we when I got home was

462
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:04,360
 Hey, there's no leftovers. Everybody ate all of it. Wow. Oh

463
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:10,880
 Oh Mike we did it. We did it. We got the exact right amount of food

464
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:17,080
 It got grazed on after the after the meal was over and it's just all gone. That's great. This is magical. I

465
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:23,360
 thought like I I you know grew up with with four brothers and a sister and

466
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:29,920
 We you know, I I am I am the shortest of my not by a lot, but I'm the shortest of my brothers. Uh-huh

467
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,920
 so

468
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,160
 never

469
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,160
 Never had leftovers. Yeah

470
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,220
 Never no, no meal. No meal leftovers. Yeah, that checks out

471
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:55,760
 Yeah, my mother-in-law does this thing where she insists on trying to make like a turkey soup with the turkey carcass of the

472
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,080
 turkey thing

473
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:02,760
 And like it's just a whole it's a thing that takes up the whole next day, right?

474
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:09,720
 All that all that started was to make sure that Sarah and I stopped cooking turkey. That's all that happened

475
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,720
 Is that we just don't we do?

476
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,240
 like

477
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:17,600
 We don't want to spend the whole other day making soup and we don't want to spend the next four days eating that soup

478
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,900
 Yeah, it's just not just not the world we live in

479
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:25,200
 But

480
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,320
 Yeah, but look I saw on Instagram. It looks like you had a fine spread at your house there Jacob

481
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,760
 Oh, yeah. No, it was it was so nice. Yeah. Yeah, we had a we had a ton of people over and everything

482
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:39,660
 It was great. I love Thanksgiving. I don't know what y'all are talking about. I love doing the the whole meal

483
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,480
 I love doing all of it. It's it's great time. I

484
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,920
 Did too I think I really I

485
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,480
 Promise I'm making a very good turkey. Yeah, I just was simply alone in my house

486
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:58,320
 As as Nipman famously said all Thanksgiving food tastes like napkins and that's what my kids think too. So there you go

487
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,480
 And it was it really was this show that changed my perception

488
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,780
 So first I was like I have to as their dad

489
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:07,840
 Keep making it until they like it

490
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:13,340
 It works and there's only on this show. I found out so many listeners hate Thanksgiving food. Also as adults. Oh

491
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:22,520
 You should show your boys do you ever watch a Garen the guy out of Ireland, he's very funny. He's a

492
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,320
 Thanks for watching. I'm delicious

493
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,200
 You ever seen him? He's really funny

494
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,960
 He's he's really really funny. You should look up some of Garen stuff, but he did

495
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,880
 from Ireland

496
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:41,520
 Just a couple days ago. He cooked his own version of a traditional American Thanksgiving dinner and

497
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:46,840
 I was very surprised by what he liked and what he didn't like

498
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:51,160
 So he was okay with the turkey. Okay

499
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:56,480
 He hated Kraft macaroni and cheese box dinner

500
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:02,640
 The box fine at which I mean, I guess yeah, that's not really Thanksgiving food in anyway. Well mac and cheese

501
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,040
 Yes, it does mac and cheese is a Thanksgiving food. That's what people I suppose so sure people get

502
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:14,120
 You're bringing a very fiery debate. Yeah, there are people that that insist Mac Jesus not a Thanksgiving food people system of this

503
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:19,080
 I don't have it as a Thanksgiving food, but I'm not upset if I see it show up. I love it. I love it

504
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:23,880
 Mashed potatoes. He made his own mashed potatoes. He has a special recipe for the mashed potatoes

505
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:29,080
 Great, so he wasn't expecting the mashed potatoes be anything but delicious. They were he made kind of a cheese

506
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:33,240
 Does he put in his mashed potatoes? What kind of cheese? What kind of white cheese does he put in there?

507
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,560
 Oh, no, he does not do the no. No, he doesn't do the cottage cheese

508
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:41,360
 It's just curds and weights barely even cheese. It's like halfway done

509
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,760
 So then he had the green bean casserole

510
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:51,200
 Which he was very suspicious of but he liked

511
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:59,280
 Yeah, I like a green casserole and then he made pumpkin pie which they don't do pumpkin pie in Ireland at all apparently

512
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:05,720
 No, they do potato pie. Yeah, but I mean they don't mash potatoes. They're new pumpkin pie at all and

513
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:13,200
 He was really super suspicious about it all but he made it and he really liked it

514
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,480
 He was suspicious of the pie. He was suspicious of the pie

515
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:22,360
 He said he was took him some time to get over the he's he was like what's got this vegetable II?

516
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:30,240
 Mush to it. I'm not used to like a dessert and he says and then I went on I watched all your fucking videos of all

517
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:37,960
 Your fucking celebrations and I saw how all you got all you only got these these yam potatoes all these sweet potatoes with fucking

518
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:45,480
 Marshmallows on top so many fucking marshmallows get fucked. I don't want marshmallows anywhere near my dinner. That's bullshit

519
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:50,880
 I do agree with that. I don't want the marshmallows. I agree with that too. He says I know a lot of you say it's great

520
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,560
 I don't know more power to you. Keep those fucking things away from me. It's secretly deserting early

521
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,940
 That's what I don't like about it. Yeah, it's like what's it because was I have marshmallows and sugar and brown sugar and cinnamon on something

522
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:07,440
 I'm like, well now I don't want to eat savory things anymore. You've you shift my gear to dessert, right? It's unfair

523
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:12,800
 Yeah, it's like it's like a hip. It's hip broth like we do we do the the sweet potatoes

524
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,160
 We do the sweet potato casserole and it's got brown sugar and pecans and everything. It's not healthy

525
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:22,040
 It's not it's not a it's definitely still a dessert masquerading as as a dish

526
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,960
 But it doesn't do the full-on swing over with the marshmallows

527
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,480
 Sweet potato the masquerade

528
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:39,080
 Galactic president scooper star mix groups a lot stuffing on a waffle iron. That sounds amazing

529
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,360
 Stuffing on a waffle iron is legit. I saw that earlier. I've seen that before

530
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:50,240
 It's a that's a fucking idea. Do you put a little gravy on it and then kind of sear it all in is that how it goes?

531
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,940
 I think you gravy afterward though. You have like a little I suppose

532
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:57,120
 I suppose you're right. Yeah. Yeah, you just make it

533
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:02,040
 I think you want the hot gravy. Yeah nice hot gravy then pour it on after you waffle iron it

534
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:06,640
 Oh, man, because when you get something that has crispiness and moisture, that's the key. Yeah, right

535
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,600
 So that's that's that seems really good. It's fucking good

536
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:17,980
 But Paul was the hot crispify some gravy, which is also ambitious. I mean as long as it has a skin

537
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:27,800
 Me that me that skin give me that gravy skin gravy skin is not not no, it's no good

538
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,680
 How do you know? No, I'm just I'm just upset because

539
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:36,320
 Well, I'm not upset upset is the wrong word

540
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,840
 disappointed lightly

541
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:46,100
 That I can't just go get the food that I want on my birthday without driving an hour and a half out of my way

542
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:51,920
 Yeah, like it's literally an hour and a half drive for me to get even fucking Panda Express

543
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:58,920
 It's like fuck Nick newman the chances this conversation for me must be what is like when the topic is football for other scoops

544
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:05,200
 There you go horse racing, yeah

545
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,200
 Yeah express you're absolutely right rich

546
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:15,400
 Yes, it takes way too fucking lot. So like and that's the thing. It's by the time I get back home

547
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,440
 I'm like, oh, well, I drove an hour and a half for Panda Express

548
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,880
 Might as well just give fucking McDonald's. It's just it's turned into

549
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,640
 Shit at that point. I mean, that's the same thing, right?

550
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:34,600
 Kind of Panda Express and McDonald's. I didn't even say it's all owned by the same company, right? Well, we're thinking of

551
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,340
 Maybe going to Costco on Wednesday

552
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:44,400
 Get that good old hot dog. That'll be fine. So what did you guys what you guys think of wicked - didn't see it

553
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:50,320
 What? No, I didn't see you didn't rush up to see the sequel. I did not I've only seen it seven or eight times

554
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,520
 So I I don't really have a fully fleshed out opinion on it yet

555
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:05,520
 I know it's really cool when they breakdance to save the car wash. That's really amazing

556
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,740
 Have you seen that is that what you're talking about?

557
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:12,800
 No, there's

558
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,860
 There's a bit of the plot of breaking -

559
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:20,440
 Okay. Well, I'm gonna blow your fucking mind to show you shit

560
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,040
 You're not gonna show me anything

561
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,780
 Program I'm gonna tell you about it as it's happening

562
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:40,320
 First is it take a long time to pull it up though. I don't know if I have the plot right from breaking - I'm not looking

563
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:45,020
 It up. I'm just we're just moving on. No, all it is is it's the old Donnie and Marie

564
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:51,200
 Or the Osmonds that's what it are. No, no, it wasn't the Osmonds. It was a fucking what he called. It's a Brady Bunch

565
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,440
 the break you remember the Brady Bunch hadn't had a

566
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:02,800
 Their variety show. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah where one of the kids I forget which which kid one of the kids got replaced on

567
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,320
 It because they couldn't get the whole original cast back together

568
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:11,120
 That is correct. I think it was one of the young kids. It was just like a new kid. Oh Jan. Thank you

569
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:14,200
 You're like the president. Yep, they had to replace the Jan

570
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:19,480
 Well what you just and Jan sickly stick-ups issues cutting ropes to see

571
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:25,280
 I just would fall from the top of the theater and there's a cliffhanger. That's right cliffhanger ever right

572
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:32,720
 You just joked about Matt happened and it happened with none other than rip Taylor as the

573
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:38,760
 Lion and the rest fucking Brady's dressed up like the people from Oz

574
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:45,040
 Doing the theme from car wash. They're doing car wash at the car wash

575
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:53,000
 Yeah, and then fucking Greg Brady dressed up like the scarecrow and rip Taylor is the lion to be in his flamboyant as he can be

576
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:00,800
 Just out of hand and I thought this would be really funny for somebody to slip into a copy or one of the edits of

577
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:07,440
 Oz - or we could do wouldn't be really funny if this showed up all uh, you know

578
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:13,400
 Somebody's just like watching that on TV in the background or something. No, no, you know, what's the

579
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:20,080
 Fight Club like in Fight Club. Remember how he would always slip in little snippets of pornographic stuff

580
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:25,720
 In all the movies if you can put this in and just make everybody upset

581
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:29,720
 That is true

582
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:35,880
 That is quite a fever dream as none of the elements make sense at all. No, it's fucking bizarre and

583
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:40,040
 And rip Taylor of all a rip. Yeah rip Taylor of all people. He's like, hey, it's

584
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,680
 You you'll never get rich, but it beats digging a ditch. Ah

585
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:52,440
 I think I said you guys the funny the meme I saw which is that don't worry Glinda and Alphabot will be back in the Avengers

586
00:50:52,440 --> 00:51:04,080
 That's awesome, I just keep this doll thing that there's a doll channel on tik-tok and

587
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:12,560
 The guy he's mad at there's a lot of now Madam Mova or whatever name is you know

588
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:20,000
 There's dolls of all these figures, right? There's dolls. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah sure. So he's got all the dolls stacked up and

589
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
 then Madam Mova

590
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,200
 Comes in and it's playing that that song from the drag race stuff

591
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:31,600
 Here comes the hurricane bitch Katrina Katrina Katrina Katrina Katrina Katrina Katrina

592
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:39,760
 Katrina Katrina Katrina Katrina and she's knocking it to all the dolls and the bounce comes down and crushes

593
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:49,140
 It's fucking funny Katrina Katrina Katrina here comes the hurricane bitch. I'm just yelling Katrina. It's funny

594
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:55,000
 It makes me laugh. So what what did you really like it? Did you not like it? Oh

595
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:01,140
 That was funny. That was good. Would you be able to watch it all in one sitting?

596
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,680
 Yes

597
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:10,120
 That's that's that's my only takeaways. They added three songs to it and those three songs aren't on par with the actual Oh

598
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:15,720
 Core soundtrack. Yeah to basically strength to basically make the second

599
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,840
 Movie fill out. Yeah. Yeah

600
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:24,960
 Is it they're not terrible. There's not there's nothing - is it closer to the book or the?

601
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,360
 Musical do you know I?

602
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:35,040
 Wouldn't know is my wife would know either my wife loved the book and we went to see the musical and

603
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:39,000
 She was so upset because the ending is so really yeah

604
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:45,040
 The ending is so different and just all had to carry her out of there like it was a Thanksgiving Day prank

605
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,720
 I threw on my back and she laughed the whole way home

606
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:52,520
 It was crazy

607
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,640
 It undercuts the meaning of the whole

608
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:02,480
 Story, the ending Cooper Nova girl in the chat says that it's the musical on screen nothing added from the book. Well, that's unfortunate

609
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,160
 For Anne. Yeah, that means go good. It's so poorly but

610
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:13,760
 No, the the ending of the musical is bupkis deus ex machina bullshit

611
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,820
 That's everything now though. I guess you're right. There's so much

612
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,520
 movies for happy endings, dude

613
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,280
 Worried about that. There's so much of the any TV show. I watch any movie

614
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,620
 I'll watch like half of them now at least have the have the

615
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:33,040
 God from the machine. Yes a sex Machina

616
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:37,400
 Just some kind of supernatural thing or somebody comes in or something

617
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:43,200
 But something off-screen happens and the plot resolves itself. Do we know do do our do our audience members?

618
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,720
 I think most of our audience members know deus ex machina

619
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:51,440
 But you know where that really comes from from back in the day in early theater. There was actually a hand

620
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,920
 Yeah, the Greeks had an actual hand of God that would come down from the top of the

621
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:05,000
 The thing and touch characters or zap characters and that was a way to resolve plots by actual divine intervention

622
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,160
 Yeah, they would they would just say like, you know Medea is doing all of these things

623
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:18,160
 Off off stage right now, right and then the gods interfere intervened and and now it is this and now here comes

624
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,160
 Everybody to bow. Yep

625
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,800
 Yeah, there you go. Yeah

626
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:27,800
 I was told that people kind of get off scripts and and kind of go haywire with stories and stuff and and so like that

627
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:32,800
 Was a way to like just clean everything up. Yeah. Yeah, and somebody did ten minutes of Shakespeare and magic

628
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,860
 I can tell you we can go haywire fast. I'll bet no haywire. I'll bet it got loosey loosey

629
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,860
 You know you ought to do that again

630
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:44,360
 Nope, we're gonna and Paul Paul might have to take a flight. We might do the thing. I would fuck

631
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:49,300
 I would fuck. I want us. I want to I want to see Brad schedule, but I want to submit it for

632
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,600
 French. Oh, yes

633
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,040
 That'd be really fun. Yeah

634
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:01,640
 So I you know for people to see the movie I don't want to you know, it's a good movie

635
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:07,480
 I don't want to pass the whole thing. Yeah, there's one part that really stuck out to me that I was really really like like

636
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:14,080
 Really laughing because it almost took me out of it. So this whole thing's like basic family-friendly PG ish PG 13 ish. Uh-huh

637
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,000
 story

638
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,720
 but there's a part where

639
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:23,840
 The prince has got to get it on with somebody they they they they they run off and they're they they're finally by themselves

640
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,740
 And they're gonna there's a hookup that's gonna happen. Oh, yeah

641
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:31,220
 And it is the weirdest shot

642
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:37,960
 Thing ever it's like this weird like it's like it looked like an old Chris Isaac music video

643
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,960
 Like everyone's just drifting from one room to another

644
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,800
 stuff and like

645
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:49,560
 What am I watching? It took me out of it completely. I literally was like almost laughing. I was like, what is the scene?

646
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:56,600
 The title of the song is

647
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:02,200
 That's what it must have been

648
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:12,880
 Video listeners do yourself a favor and Google them

649
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,240
 the Wicked Games video

650
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:20,120
 So take the characters from one room to another like taking off clothing, but then also putting on clothes

651
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,560
 Like that's great bizarre

652
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:28,680
 Someone said big ups to modern love where someone puts on a sensible shawl to have sex

653
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:33,440
 Old jet alpha

654
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,600
 the

655
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,900
 Matt I don't want to frighten you but if you back up just a little bit

656
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:42,740
 Back back your head up just a little bit. There you go. Perfect. Stay right there

657
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,080
 everybody in the chat

658
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,560
 Don't move

659
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:50,420
 Is it me or is the shadow of the Baba Duke behind him?

660
00:56:50,420 --> 00:57:00,080
 Am I crazy is that the shadow of the fucking Baba Duke over there? Yeah. Yeah, it's the Baba Duke

661
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:15,080
 Why are you worried about a shadow of a big cartoon Great Dane behind you know, they talk about this

662
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:22,200
 He's gonna get you they talk about they talk about, you know within

663
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:26,720
 Spooky stuff ghosty stories that they talk about the hat man and all that kind of thing

664
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:32,080
 Baba do definitely qualifies as a hat man. Yeah, that's pretty scary. It's kind of creepy. Yeah

665
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:35,400
 All right, well

666
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,600
 Have a good night sleeping tonight with the Baba Duke

667
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,920
 In there. Yeah. No, Baba. Duke is now a gay icon. So I think you're safe

668
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:49,760
 It truly is Baba Duke has now been taken over by the gays which I think is awesome. Oh good. Yeah

669
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:57,440
 The gays do good work. They fucking do they rehab the Baba Duke of all of all critters. Well, I got him go. Yeah

670
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,120
 Let's do a little scoop mail. We got a scoop mail though. I want to get to today

671
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,360
 Let's do it

672
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:11,600
 We got a scoop mail here from Josh greetings you fabulous face fuckers of whom I have met too

673
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:18,260
 Oh, it's been about a month since the wedding Casey and I have returned from our honeymoon and life is returning to normal

674
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:25,760
 The story of Matt and Paul being the surprise entertainment at the rehearsal dinner is a hit among friends who weren't there and I'm so happy

675
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:31,520
 That in the month since I've met you any new listeners from the wedding have heard about Paul shitting himself and

676
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,080
 ejaculating tie infused jizz

677
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:40,160
 Heard all about Paul

678
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:46,080
 Shitting and jizzing on himself. Well, I mean not the hero we need but the hero we deserve I'm staying on brand

679
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:51,600
 I'll tell you I've been turning on a lot of my new students to the podcast and and they're still on board

680
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:57,840
 They they're all right. I I'm coming yet. I preach truth in comedy. So here we are

681
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,280
 The surrealness of how I came to meet you two is starting to wear off

682
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,560
 Of course you two were at my wedding

683
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:04,960
 Of course

684
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:10,080
 I have pictures with the two of you with Casey and the kids and of course all three of your names are on the guest

685
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:14,320
 List for any future parties brings me to Jacob. Oh, no

686
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,880
 I am so sorry you weren't at this one

687
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,480
 Not just because I'd love to meet you in person

688
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:23,760
 But because you missed out on two amazing dinners and two open bars. I do love

689
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:31,280
 Vegas is on the list of places that Casey and I would like to visit. Hopefully there's a chance to buy you a drink

690
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:38,240
 On one of those trips. Absolutely for this first non uh for this first groom update scoop mail

691
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,240
 I have a question for the boys

692
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:47,680
 Did either of you two hear the airplanes leaving the Italian airfield as you were driving away from the wedding? Yep

693
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:54,640
 We had ourselves a bit of a slow-burning medical themed air show over the course of the next day

694
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,160
 First oh, no

695
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:05,360
 The planes collide at 2 30 in the morning when my stepson son wakes up to tell me that he's not feeling well

696
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:10,000
 Only to then yell i've just thrown up. Oh, no

697
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,000
 There I am cleaning up vomit in the middle of the night

698
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,400
 Casey and d were able to fall back to sleep, but i'm awake until about five in the morning

699
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:24,720
 Second the burning jet fuel lands on me at six in the morning when I am woken up by a text message

700
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,720
 My sister texts to tell me that she's on her way to the doctors

701
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:34,720
 Due to some distressing medical symptoms and will keep me posted as to how she's feeling. Oh, no

702
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:39,360
 Lastly for the grand finale of the flaming wreckage hitting the crowd

703
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:45,440
 I get a call from my father at eight that evening saying that my stepmother is in the emergency room

704
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,360
 Jesus fuck

705
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:53,920
 Long story short she ended up face planting onto cement and looked like she'd been hitting the eye with a baseball bat

706
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,240
 God damn my god

707
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:03,600
 This italian air show ultimately becomes an ontario business meeting though as both my stepson sister and stepmother are fine

708
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:10,320
 No long-term damage and everyone is healed up fine. The new running joke is if you party with us, you better have

709
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:15,220
 You have a better than zero chance of ending up in the hospital. Absolutely

710
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:25,040
 Fuck's giving and a merry chris bosh to all an early chris bosh present for casey was tickets to see matt perform

 Buy ourselves around to get to places we need to be for events and things like that. Yeah

 And again, if you uh, give us three billion dollars

733
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:17,920
 We will uh do an experiment to see if we can be better billionaires than the current ones

734
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,880
 I mean if you like science

735
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,280
 You have to get behind this project. Yes

736
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:27,360
 I and i'm and i'm very I know we make a lot of jokes on this show

737
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:31,760
 I'm very serious about this if anyone gives us three billion dollars

738
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:37,120
 We will run this experiment to see if we can be better at being billionaires than the current ones. Yeah. Yeah

739
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:42,400
 Well, you I think this is a good experiment people, you know, i'm a proponent of doing things for science

740
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,960
 I have done it on this podcast many times

741
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:50,900
 Oh greater science presenters than paul mattington

742
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:58,240

743
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,600
 That's right. That's right

744
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:05,520
 In fact, just like the t-shirt I need to carry I need to carry out that previous previous experiment two more times because I need to control

745
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,160

01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,440
 People don't like john landis. What's wrong with john landis?

 Gremlins

878
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:52,400
 Wait, is this okay? I thought that'd be the sequel because the lincoln's birthday thing comes up in the sequel

879
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:56,800
 Oh gotcha. Gotcha. Well, he buys the thing in the first one. I don't know whatever. Yeah

 The sequel is great. Uh, also you should watch the sequel to gremlins

881
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:05,600
 You should watch gremlins 2 and then after you get done watching gremlins 2

882
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:11,600
 You should uh on youtube pull up the key and peel sketch about the makings of gremlins 2

883
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:20,240
 That is great that is 100 percent a real suggestion watch that movie then watch that key and peel sketch

 He's it. Oh great. Yep

909
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:10,320
 I don't I don't understand this question. I don't understand the the plot that i'm supposed to decipher

910
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:14,400
 So is this someone saying I gotta tell my neighbor's a vampire?

911
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,800
 Is that what it is?

912
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,800
 uh

913
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:23,680
 Jack skellington is a vampire. Yeah, so somebody thinks that their neighbor is a vampire in this movie

917
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:46,480
 uh sci-fi
