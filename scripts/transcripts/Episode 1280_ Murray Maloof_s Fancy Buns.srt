1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,540
 - Oh, hello there, I am so glad you are here.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,840
 This is my favorite part of the show.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,140
 This is the part of the show where we get to thank you,

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,340
 the Ice Cream Truck Drivers.

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,220
 Who are the Ice Cream Truck Drivers?

7
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,500
 Why, those are the folks that deliver

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,300
 that fucking ice cream straight to your fucking ear holes.

9
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,620
 Right now, I'd like to thank Beard and Scoop,

10
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,240
 Chasing the Dragon Scoop, Christine Elsesser,

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,700
 Kristi Salinas, Coach Rat Bastard,

12
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,180
 Darren Cunningham, and Darth Scooper.

13
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,840
 If you want to be an Ice Cream Truck Driver,

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,140
 just like these fine folks, and I hope you do,

15
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,300
 PreachingFun.com, PreachingFun.com

16
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,300
 is where you can go to sign up

17
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,660
 to be an Ice Cream Truck Driver, and who knows?

18
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,260
 The life you save may be your own.

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,580
 - Otherwise, I'll see you at the cone.

20
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,260
 (laughs)

21
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,100
 - There it is.

22
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:48,920
 - 'Cause you're dead.

23
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,300
 - Hey, Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social?

24
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,660
 - Yeah, I'd love to.

25
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,260
 - Great, let's go.

26
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,100
 (upbeat music)

27
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,980
 - So, I bought, like, sunglasses for, like, my larger head.

28
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,820
 - Okay.

29
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,260
 - And I got them polarized, and it comes with a swatch

30
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,760
 that says polarization test.

31
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,180
 You can put 'em on and see, like, a secret word

32
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,780
 in a little swatch, and the word was Israel.

33
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:17,580
 - It's time for Matt and Maddly's Ice Cream Social.

34
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,580
 Sitting over there, it's Matt Donnelly.

35
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,220
 Sitting over there, it's Paul Maddly.

36
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,920
 Over here, it's Jacob the Audio Guy.

37
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,760
 We're PreachingFun.

38
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,940
 - Very polarizing sunglasses.

39
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,860
 - Very polarizing.

40
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,780
 - Extremely polarizing sunglasses.

41
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,700
 - I'm not even sure if that's a real story

42
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,460
 or just a dad joke.

43
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,820
 - It's a real story up until the Israel part.

44
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,340
 It just said their brand name in the little swatch,

45
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,140
 but I laughed at polarization test really hard.

46
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,980
 (laughs)

47
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,700
 - Yeah.

48
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,540
 Oh, that's so good.

49
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,720
 - That was really funny.

50
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,860
 So, I was making burgers for my kids last night

51
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,340
 using the Smasher that Jacob sent me a link for

52
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,700
 last time we brought up making burgers.

53
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,540
 I was can't smashing some burgers for my kids.

54
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,940
 And my youngest likes himself a pretzel bun,

55
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,740
 so I get, like, a fancy, I get, like, nice pretzel buns

56
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,080
 from a supermarket.

57
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,920
 And then--

58
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,460
 - Your youngest has excellent taste.

59
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,740
 - So then I get, like, a nice, kind of like brioche style bun

60
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,540
 for my other kid who doesn't like pretzel buns.

61
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,020
 He normally just takes a regular hamburger bun,

62
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,860
 but he's the only one eating it,

63
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,100
 so I'll buy, like, a roll, you know?

64
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,220
 And he's eating it, and I said,

65
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,260
 you don't like the fancy bun, do you?

66
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,160
 And he goes, "Dad, I'm an American."

67
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,240
 (laughs)

68
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,940
 - There it is.

69
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,940
 I want no fucking brioche bun.

70
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,620
 (laughs)

71
00:02:53,620 --> 00:03:00,780
 I demand that my bread have a clown on it.

72
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,940
 (laughs)

73
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,100
 - Wonder has to be in the title somewhere.

74
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,100
 - It has to be just the most bleached, white, flour.

75
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,700
 - I need it to be so preserved.

76
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,540
 - Yes.

77
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,700
 - Like, mold cannot grow on it under any circumstances.

78
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,580
 - I want my hamburger bun to have been made in 1987.

79
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,340
 (laughs)

80
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,500
 I want it to have been sitting in a warehouse.

81
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,340
 - That's when they were still good.

82
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,160
 Oh, they were good then.

83
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,860
 - Preserved under salt.

84
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,540
 - They were so good then.

85
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,940
 It's like those McDonald's buns

86
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,380
 with that exact same weird white spot

87
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,780
 on the bottom of all of 'em.

88
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,780
 - Oh.

89
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,540
 - Classic, classic consistency.

90
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,860
 Out, are you, get out of my house.

91
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,980
 - I don't know how many decades

92
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,940
 it's been since I had a McDonald's hamburger bun.

93
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,940
 - Clearly, it's been a minute.

94
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,780
 - Yeah.

95
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,620
 - Jacob, I know, you've long not been a fan

96
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,740
 of the Southwest general seating procedures.

97
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,580
 We've documented--

98
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,100
 - No, I have not been.

99
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,900
 And it seems like I might be finally getting my way.

100
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,740
 - You might be.

101
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,940
 But in the meantime, you know, as someone,

102
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,820
 I don't mind it.

103
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,900
 I don't, I like it.

104
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,740
 - Yep.

105
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,580
 - I love it.

106
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,400
 - I find myself with a lot.

107
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,240
 - I love it.

108
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,900
 - Even though they started charging for bags,

109
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,700
 it's still cheaper to check bags on Southwest

110
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,660
 than the other airline.

111
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,500
 And so I still--

112
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,320
 - Yep.

113
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,340
 - Fly Southwest 'cause it's still like 35 bucks for two bags.

114
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,700
 - I just had a long conversation last week about airlines

115
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,780
 'cause we were talking about like airline credit cards

116
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,100
 for her band and for all of her gigs and everything

117
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,300
 and all the travel that she does.

118
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,140
 - Yeah.

119
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,100
 - And we ended up, 'cause we'd been using Southwest

120
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,020
 and we were like, let's look at these other airlines.

121
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,340
 Let's look at the other cards and everything.

122
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,540
 And nope, Southwest, that's just where we stayed.

123
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,580
 - Man, I'm telling you,

124
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,620
 you've got the major hub there in Vegas.

125
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,440
 And that was what I got weaned on.

126
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,660
 Having to go out to Jersey,

127
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:54,340
 I had to not fly Southwest from here.

128
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,140
 There was no Southwest from here to Jersey.

129
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:57,980
 - No, there's not.

130
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,100
 - It was very disturbing.

131
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,140
 - The closest you can get is Baltimore.

132
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:01,980
 It's the closest.

133
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,500
 - I think I went on United.

134
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,580
 I went United both ways and I was just like,

135
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,280
 oh, I don't like this.

136
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,620
 (laughing)

137
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,820
 I do not care for this.

138
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,180
 I do not care for this United stuff at all.

139
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,140
 - I am getting online in Chicago,

140
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,580
 fly back home here after doing my corporate gig.

141
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,500
 And it is tight quarters in O'Hare.

142
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:30,100
 And I'm blanking because I should side note,

143
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,620
 I drove like hell to the wrong airport.

144
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,460
 I went to Midway.

145
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,460
 - Oh, that's the worst.

146
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,300
 - And the only thing that was good was that

147
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,660
 I had to rent a car.

148
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,060
 But since I do have checked bags,

149
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,360
 what I like to do is I like to pull up the curbside,

150
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,700
 rush up the curbside check-in.

151
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,980
 - Ooh, I like this move.

152
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,820
 - Yes.

153
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,780
 - Check my bags, then return my rental car

154
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,860
 and I'm not lugging all of my bags through the airport.

155
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,700
 - Yes.

156
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,980
 - Just taking my carry-on.

157
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,940
 - Because there's a secret that most airports

158
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,260
 don't want you to know

159
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,860
 and that's that they can't tow your car instantly.

160
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,700
 (laughing)

161
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,540
 - They can threaten it.

162
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,380
 They can threaten to find it.

163
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,940
 - They can yell about it a lot.

164
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,140
 They can do that.

165
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,900
 They can't tow it instantly.

166
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,460
 - So they were like trying to check my bags at Midway

167
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,560
 and the woman is making a very confused face

168
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,580
 and I'm panicking 'cause as she takes longer,

169
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,420
 I'm looking to see,

170
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,420
 making sure I'm not getting eyed for a fine

171
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,980
 with my rental car.

172
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,540
 And she goes,

173
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,440
 I don't know what's going on.

174
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,740
 I've never gotten this message before.

175
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,580
 I brought this guy over.

176
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,420
 Brought this guy over.

177
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,460
 He hasn't gotten this message before.

178
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,480
 I think you have to go inside.

179
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,920
 And my brain went, no, I don't.

180
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,340
 I have to go to a different airport.

181
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,100
 My brain is like, wait.

182
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,260
 And so I was like, somehow did I book a ticket home

183
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,340
 from a different airport?

184
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,140
 And then I realized I landed at a different airport

185
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,500
 and didn't realize it.

186
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:52,140
 I had just been to Chicago three weeks ago

187
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,440
 for Chicago Magic Lounge.

188
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,820
 And so my brain was just confusing the two airports.

189
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:04,400
 So I luckily left with a lot of time.

190
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,260
 So I arrived at the proper airport with very little time.

191
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,360
 So I was still rushing,

192
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,740
 but I wasn't gonna miss my flight or anything.

193
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,020
 I was like, oh God, but I drove like hell

194
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,780
 between those two airports.

195
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,100
 Anyhow, so I'm in there.

196
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,900
 I'm in Southwest and it is tight at O'Hare.

197
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,820
 It is like, you know, 'cause Southwest makes you line up.

198
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,980
 They usually make you line up along the thing.

199
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,260
 The line they have here is like a very stunted little--

200
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,820
 - They don't have the square footage.

201
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,660
 - No, they don't have square footage.

202
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,500
 - In the airport there.

203
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,340
 - So you gotta like basically move towards the thing.

204
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,180
 - They've got the square footage at Midway,

205
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,820
 but they're not at O'Hare.

206
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:39,660
 - And there was a young man, well-coiffed man from India,

207
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,660
 I believe, with his tall, very tall sister or girlfriend.

208
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,260
 I don't know.

209
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,820
 - Yep.

210
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,100
 - And he is--

211
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,760
 - Either way they were making out.

212
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,560
 - He is beaming uncomfortable anger already.

213
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,020
 Like he is holding his bags and he is like elbows out

214
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,660
 and we're in tight quarters and you gotta do the thing.

215
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,060
 We're like, hey, what number are you?

216
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,900
 I'm this number, I'm this number.

217
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,060
 This is what I'm okay with and Jacob hates.

218
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,700
 And I'm trying to figure out, you know,

219
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,060
 where to stand or whatever.

220
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,860
 And, you know, they said--

221
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,780
 - But it's within increments of five.

222
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,420
 - It's within increments of five.

223
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,740
 And I honestly, I do have my own pet peeves with it.

224
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,460
 We're like, some people kind of go,

225
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,800
 like if I'm seven and they're nine

226
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,580
 and they're in front of me and I go, I'm seven,

227
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,460
 they go, some as a Southwest person will confidently go like,

228
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,420
 yeah, like meaning like you don't have to get in front of me.

229
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,220
 We're both in the same vicinity.

230
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,040
 And I kind of go like--

231
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,880
 - Close enough.

232
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,720
 - And I kind of get like, no,

233
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,260
 that's the whole fucking point is numbers.

234
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,100
 - That's some bullshit.

235
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,300
 - Seven is lower than nine.

236
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,140
 - That's some bullshit.

237
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,060
 - Ass.

238
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,580
 - So this guy has got his elbows out

239
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,060
 and I'm saying, I'm a seven.

240
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,900
 I'm saying it, you know, and I'm saying it out loud.

241
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,260
 And I get a couple of a communicate me,

242
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,860
 him and his sister wife are not communicating.

243
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,660
 And he is like stewing.

244
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,620
 I can feel him stewing from his back.

245
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,460
 You know, when someone's so angry--

246
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,460
 - Oh, it's the worst.

247
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,300
 - For stewing, right?

248
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,700
 - Oh my goodness.

249
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,220
 - And so finally, some guy comes up

250
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,060
 like a little late to the party and is like,

251
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,760
 excuse me, A1, A1, A1, excuse me, A1.

252
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,600
 - Yeah, yeah.

253
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,980
 - And I was like, oh, this guy's coming through

254
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,520
 like Lipitor through a vein here.

255
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,520
 And he is there and the guy goes, no, no, no, no, no, no.

256
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,360
 And he goes, yes, I'm A1.

257
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,480
 And he goes, no, we're all A1, which confused us all.

258
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,980
 I was like, I was like, I am Spartacus.

259
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,420
 Today we are all A1.

260
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,000
 - No, buddy. (laughing)

261
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,860
 - Matt never got off the plane.

262
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,420
 I don't know who Paul's been talking to this entire time.

263
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,640
 - We live here.

264
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,740
 And so I was laughing.

265
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,320
 He goes, no, I've done this before.

266
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,300
 I know how this works.

267
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,780
 I'm A1, excuse me.

268
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,120
 - I'm definitely up there.

269
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,700
 - And he shouts like, no.

270
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,220
 Like he starts like to open his arms

271
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,200
 and like clear everyone back.

272
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,540
 Like no one move kind of body language, right?

273
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,460
 - I feel so bad for this guy.

274
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,860
 That's just the worst as he's having a terrible day.

275
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,700
 - And he's like, and so the guy with A1 is like waving

276
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,900
 like anyone from South was like, get over here.

277
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,540
 Please get over here or whatever.

278
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,540
 And he says that the Indian guy says, no, no, no.

279
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,780
 You announced that it is open seating.

280
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,740
 - Oh boy.

281
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,260
 - And the flight attendants like, no, yeah.

282
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,780
 When you get on the plane, it is open seating.

283
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,140
 He goes, no, you announced open seating.

284
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,880
 So it is now open seating, meaning that like.

285
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,720
 - No, no, no.

286
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,180
 Like whatever you want is wherever you want to go.

287
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,020
 No son, no, no, no, no.

288
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,700
 - Once you announced open seating, so now anarchy.

289
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,540
 - You know what this means?

290
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:49,340
 - I was like, listen, our podcast is a similar rule

291
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,300
 about dibs.

292
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,020
 So I understand what you're saying.

293
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,860
 - Yeah.

294
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,560
 - Dibs has been called is what you were saying.

295
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,420
 You're saying once anyone with South us

296
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,400
 utters open seating, the numbers on our tickets

297
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,740
 become useless.

298
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,580
 They're right out.

299
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,400
 - Out the window.

300
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,620
 - Disqualified.

301
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,460
 - Nope.

302
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,260
 Don't even look at them again.

303
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,380
 They're not worth the paper that they were printed on.

304
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,340
 Open seating motherfuckers.

305
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,100
 - So I take this opportunity to turn to person with a nine

306
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,060
 and I'm actually with someone with a four and a three

307
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,820
 who don't want to go past this angry person.

308
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,000
 So we're all, we're all like our little clutter.

309
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,020
 We're all like little clutter space together

310
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,020
 right behind them.

311
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,980
 So I decided to announce it, interpret what is happening.

312
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,140
 I was like, this guy thinks because the words open seating

313
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:40,340
 were uttered in any capacity, our tickets don't matter now.

314
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,100
 (laughing)

315
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,940
 - Oh boy.

316
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,500
 I make a point of getting up.

317
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,940
 - Nothing else matters.

318
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,340
 - You gotta get up super early or stay up super late.

319
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,180
 - Yeah.

320
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,860
 - And you get on that app and you wait for the moment

321
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,900
 that thing flips over and you hit your button

322
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,100
 to get your good seat availability.

323
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,900
 - I'm telling you right now, Mr. A1 and myself,

324
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,680
 we are, you know, we both fly Southwest enough

325
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,220
 when you get A-list, they check in for you.

326
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,060
 You're going to get your A.

327
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,940
 - Yeah and A1 is, that's a $50 ticket.

328
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,260
 - Also A1 is I know 'cause like they make sure

329
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,700
 that like Penn gets it whenever he flies

330
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,260
 'cause he can get that one seat that has the six, seven.

331
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,660
 So there's that one seat you have more leg room.

332
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,020
 - Yep, but that's an extra expense.

333
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,860
 - Yes and it's, and oftentimes it's a privilege.

334
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,020
 Like it's oftentimes like it's like anyone traveling often

335
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,020
 is A1 is like someone who travels like every day.

336
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,620
 Like it's just a, it's just a huge thing or whatever.

337
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,580
 But I, but yeah.

338
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,260
 I was laughing so hard and angry

339
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,420
 and he continued to be a show.

340
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,900
 - You sat open seating.

341
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,300
 - They got the front row with the extra seats

342
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,060
 so they could feel like they were in first class.

343
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,000
 You know, I think that's all they were anxious about

344
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,540
 was getting that first row,

345
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,220
 which means you have to put all your shit behind you,

346
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,340
 which I hate so I never sit in that row.

347
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,900
 I fucking hate that, right?

348
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,300
 And then guys, I have to tell you something.

349
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,000
 I was haphazardly, stick with me, I was a good person.

350
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,960
 So I, since I already checked bags,

351
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,980
 I would say if it's a full flight,

352
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,020
 I will gate check my one carry-on bag

353
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,820
 and only have my book bag.

354
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,460
 - Oh, okay.

355
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,660
 - And so I get on the plane,

356
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,460
 but I put my book bag up in the carry-on,

357
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,460
 which they, that's not okay.

358
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,660
 - Frown upon that.

359
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,500
 - Right. - Yeah, yeah.

360
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,900
 - But here's the thing. - I do the same thing.

361
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,060
 I do the same thing though, and I'm ready.

362
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,020
 - And I'm ready, exactly.

363
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,620
 So I put it up there and I go,

364
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,200
 if they call me on it, I'll bring my book bag down.

365
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,180
 If they don't call me on it,

366
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,640
 I bet the person who's got the center, middle seat

367
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,220
 is gonna have their bags and they're gonna be pissed

368
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,180
 that they have to put their shit all the way behind them

369
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,620
 and I will offer that row.

370
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,380
 So I waited till the whole thing was on.

371
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,740
 The person was like, can I sit in the middle seat?

372
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,540
 Like, I'm fucked.

373
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,220
 I said, yes, and not only that, here.

374
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,060
 And I took my book bag out, put it at my feet,

375
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,180
 and then I put their carry-on into the space

376
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,220
 and then the carry-on right above their head.

377
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,100
 Not all heroes wear capes, guys.

378
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,940
 - Champion of the flight.

379
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,220
 - Not all heroes wear capes,

380
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,180
 but this one carried a book bag.

381
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,340
 - I was waiting for, tears is maybe strong,

382
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:13,020
 but a thank you, they didn't give a shit

383
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,820
 that I did a good thing for, they didn't care at all.

384
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,220
 - Oh, wow, what do you know?

385
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,820
 - I mean, they still gave you the thank you hand, Jay,

386
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,100
 during the flight, right?

387
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,380
 - I mean, that person is an American.

388
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,620
 (laughing)

389
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:34,900
 - I was like, do you realize what I just did for you?

390
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,820
 Like, do you understand?

391
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,820
 - Yeah.

392
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,660
 - They did not.

393
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,020
 - You owe me, you.

394
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,340
 - I said, that's it, open seating.

395
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,700
 And then I hit a music cue

396
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,500
 and everybody had to switch seats until the music stopped.

397
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,820
 - Did the guy end up getting on the plane where he was?

398
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,900
 Was he not stopped?

399
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,700
 They didn't put him back anywhere?

400
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,020
 - No, they let him on and he was just,

401
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,020
 I mean, he got up like probably like seven times

402
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,980
 to get something out of one bag or another.

403
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,820
 And then they were--

404
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,660
 - Yeah, he's one of those.

405
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,580
 - They were doing, it was just like--

406
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,100
 - He was having a terrible day.

407
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,180
 I see these people at airports and on flights

408
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,780
 where I'm just like,

409
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,180
 you are being horrible to everyone around you

410
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,860
 and I hate you so much.

411
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,700
 - Are these people--

412
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,220
 - That being said, I recognize that you are having

413
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,740
 just the worst day that a human being can have

414
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,740
 and I'm sorry for you.

415
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,980
 - Do you think it was because he didn't want to fly?

416
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,940
 Do you think he was a nervous flyer

417
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,540
 and these people, they can't handle the loss of control

418
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,580
 that flying he is and so--

419
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,420
 - I mean, I think it factors a lot.

420
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,100
 I think we have folks here who work in the airline business,

421
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,060
 including myself.

422
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,900
 I think I'm much more anxious on a plane

423
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,900
 and I get much more fucking pissed about little shit that--

424
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,740
 - Sure.

425
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,580
 - But I find that--

426
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,700
 - As someone who is with you often,

427
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,700
 both in and out of airports.

428
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,580
 - Yeah, yeah.

429
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,460
 No, Matt, you're definitely much more anxious flying.

430
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,100
 (Matt laughing)

431
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,940
 I can just, you don't have to wonder, buddy.

432
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,460
 - Hey, I said nothing to that woman that shook my seat.

433
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,580
 (both laughing)

434
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,460
 - I didn't say you're not a hero, sir.

435
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,100
 I just said you're more anxious.

436
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,940
 - Right, and so I tell myself,

437
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,660
 you're not gonna care about this in like 20 minutes, right?

438
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,980
 Like that's what I tell myself when I start to get--

439
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,900
 - Future Matt does not give a shit about this.

440
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,860
 - Not give a shit about this.

441
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,900
 So, yeah. - That's the trick.

442
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,980
 - But it is, it is, yeah.

443
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,380
 I think everyone gets fucking pissed about going on planes.

444
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,660
 - No, it's not a fun experience for anyone.

445
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,540
 - So speaking of good deeds, guys,

446
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,860
 well, I'm patting my own back here.

447
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,580
 - Okay, other arm.

448
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,580
 - So there was an attack on Verizon,

449
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,820
 either a cyber attack on Verizon or just a big fucking

450
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,940
 fuck up at Verizon.

451
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:54,100
 But all Verizon went down like two days ago.

452
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,940
 - Oh shit.

453
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,300
 - I was giving like crappy service across the country.

454
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,700
 And at the same time, there was an Apple update

455
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,460
 that night before on my phone.

456
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,180
 And then I got up and my phone was not working.

457
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,860
 And then I was like, oh shit,

458
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,380
 maybe the update messed something up or maybe whatever.

459
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,260
 - Right.

460
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,580
 - And then all of a sudden I'm talking to other people

461
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,380
 and they had their phones down too.

462
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,340
 Man, going around without cell service

463
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,940
 for more than 24 hours is crazy.

464
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,540
 Like, I know it's so dumb, but I was like,

465
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,060
 man, the word would fall apart

466
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,420
 if this happened for like four days.

467
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,260
 - Oh yeah.

468
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,020
 - It will fall apart, Matt.

469
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,540
 - Yeah, it will fall apart.

470
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,100
 Because I was looking forward to it.

471
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,340
 - The amount of time to just hop to my car

472
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,500
 is like all a GPS from the car.

473
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,900
 And also I was just going like, shit, no, I won't.

474
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,940
 I have to figure out.

475
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,780
 - Incorrect.

476
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,740
 - I have to figure out where I'm going.

477
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,580
 - Wow.

478
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:53,660
 - And so, but I'm getting this thing on my phone

479
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,140
 that's a SIM card failure.

480
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,620
 - Okay, hold on, I got it.

481
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,180
 - Goren knows what I'm talking about.

482
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,780
 - Yeah.

483
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,900
 - And everyone else I'm talking to who has Verizon phones

484
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,140
 didn't get that message.

485
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,980
 - Right.

486
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,820
 - Oh.

487
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:13,180
 - But I went into a Verizon store to be like,

488
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,820
 hey, my phone says SIM card failure

489
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,780
 and they literally there's three of them.

490
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,700
 And they all went, yeah, no, the network is down.

491
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,340
 And it's down like across the country or whatever.

492
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,260
 And I said, oh, but mine said SIM card failure.

493
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,500
 And he goes, they're all saying different things

494
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,060
 to different people if you look or whatever.

495
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,140
 - So they were like, ignore all the other things.

496
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,540
 It's the network.

497
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,820
 The network is just wreaking havoc.

498
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,660
 - Yeah.

499
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,940
 Now I'm getting some people in the chat saying

500
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,460
 they have Verizon and nothing went wrong with them.

501
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,340
 Well, good for fucking you, okay?

502
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:49,020
 If you Google the news stories, say Verizon outage,

503
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,260
 you will see news stories on it.

504
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,140
 - I'm looking at it right now.

505
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,540
 The weird thing is it doesn't seem like Verizon

506
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,940
 has said still what caused it.

507
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,460
 - They have not said what caused it.

508
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,820
 I'm thinking I ran, but I don't know.

509
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,140
 But why not guess I ran too much.

510
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,620
 - I think I ran too hard and the rest of my phone.

511
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,460
 - Yeah, yeah.

512
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,620
 - So I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, oh, I go,

513
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,660
 oh, so you've been dealing with this all day.

514
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,300
 And they go, yeah.

515
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,220
 And I go, oh, that can't be fun.

516
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,460
 They go, one woman literally pointed us and said,

517
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,940
 it's your fault and you're not doing anything.

518
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,900
 I was like, really?

519
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,100
 The retail person working for Verizon storefront

520
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,580
 is in charge of the network?

521
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,460
 They're like, I like to sell your phone

522
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,380
 and keep this entire network going across the world.

523
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,220
 - Wow.

524
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:43,460
 Now, Matt, it sounds like you made a bit of an assumption

525
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,860
 there when this retail store employee just told you

526
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,740
 this story, you then assumed that they did not indeed

527
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,660
 control the Verizon network.

528
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,260
 - Oh my God, I'm a fool.

529
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,980
 - I didn't even ask you, buddy.

530
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,700
 - It's right there.

531
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,980
 But do you, right?

532
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,340
 I could have, but do you?

533
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,180
 I could have just said that.

534
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,100
 - And then it'd be like, as a matter of fact,

535
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,660
 you caught me on the undercover boss day.

536
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:11,540
 - Yeah, I run this thing.

537
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,980
 - I'm Tom Verizon.

538
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:17,980
 - I decided to get a little taste of that old 14.75 an hour.

539
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,500
 See how that treats me.

540
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,940
 Take a little taste of how the other half lives.

541
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,900
 - Watch this.

542
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,220
 And then he takes off his glasses and shakes down

543
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,660
 his long hair and he's a beautiful girl.

544
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,020
 The whole time.

545
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,940
 - Amazing.

546
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,300
 - I'll tell you who else was a beautiful girl

547
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,300
 the entire time, you didn't even realize it.

548
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,020
 And that is the following sponsor.

549
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,580
 - There's more to the story, but today's show

550
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:44,580
 is brought to you by the bearded liberal truck driving school.

551
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,780
 School for the bearded liberal truck driver,

552
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,620
 trucker, trucker, the bearded liberal trucker driving school.

553
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,380
 One of the most polarizing characters.

554
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,420
 Some people don't like when we do this character.

555
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,060
 - Oh, I love that character.

556
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,940
 - Yeah, but yeah.

557
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,180
 So that's from 2022, sex guy, Jimmy Deescoop.

558
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,140
 And it's the bearded liberal trucker driving school.

559
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,980
 - All right, you pansy sons of bitches.

560
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,220
 Strap on your rainbow hats and let's get going.

561
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,140
 All right.

562
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,700
 Get in the goddamn truck and follow me.

563
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,020
 It's a truck driving school.

564
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,020
 You're gonna learn how to parallel park this son of a bitch.

565
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:21,940
 That's right.

566
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,460
 You're gonna be able to aim this thing, slide it right in.

567
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:30,460
 Getting right in between the Marxist ideology

568
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,820
 and Jungian theology.

569
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:37,220
 You're gonna just zip it right in there tight as a cord.

570
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,140
 Yeah, you're gonna love it.

571
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:39,980
 Yeah.

572
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,060
 You're gonna be able to maneuver on the highways

573
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,860
 and byways of this great country

574
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:50,620
 better than a woman's right to vote.

575
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,380
 (laughing)

576
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,020
 - I'm sorry, do we learn how to drive trucks

577
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,220
 while we're here at all?

578
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,500
 I was hoping to learn how to drive a truck.

579
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,220
 - Eventually, Mr. Yamby Pamby.

580
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,900
 - Boy, oh boy, you sure like to mouth off a lot.

581
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,140
 You know, you might want to think about

582
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,300
 taking some meditation classes.

583
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,620
 Fucking shit.

584
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,740
 - No, I was just, I thought this was a truck driving school

585
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,100
 and so I was just here to--

586
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,580
 - Oh, it most assuredly is.

587
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,580
 It most assuredly is.

588
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,220
 But I can't help but notice

589
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,460
 you got some pretty fancy shoes on there.

590
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,660
 - They're Nikes, yeah.

591
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,660
 - Any ideas where those were made

592
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,780
 and by which infant's hands?

593
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,980
 Boy, oh boy.

594
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,460
 - No, no, I don't.

595
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,660
 I just bought the shoes.

596
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,620
 Pay less, I think.

597
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,940
 - Hey, let me ask you a quick question.

598
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,380
 What's your favorite war?

599
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,180
 - I'm sorry, war? - Wrong answer.

600
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,540
 There is no war but class war.

601
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,860
 Get in the fucking truck.

602
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,700
 (laughing)

603
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,140
 - Enter Hayscoops at checkout.

604
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,380
 (laughing)

605
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,820
 - Well, so I leave the Verizon store with no service.

606
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,900
 I decide to wait out the outage

607
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,900
 and I go next door to the Smiths and I get cupcakes

608
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,300
 and I bring all the workers cupcakes.

609
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,860
 - That was very sweet.

610
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,700
 - I say, sorry you haven't--

611
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,100
 - And then they fixed your phone for you.

612
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,420
 - That's really nice.

613
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,900
 They're like, here you go, here you go, sir.

614
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,740
 Boop, boop, boop, boop.

615
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,580
 - Let me turn your phone back on.

616
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,420
 - There you go, there you go, sir.

617
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,140
 (laughing)

618
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,620
 - Well, I wake up the next day,

619
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,300
 I do a little research at night, you know, research.

620
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,660
 I asked Chad GPT how to fix my phone.

621
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,580
 - Good, I said, you're fucked, buddy.

622
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:42,100
 - And then I go on YouTube and watch some videos.

623
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,540
 - Oh, you did do some research.

624
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,540
 - And I'm trying to do all this shit to my phone.

625
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,620
 - Did you figure it out pretty quick?

626
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,260
 YouTube's like, hey, everybody's screwed.

627
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,940
 - No, no, I meant that like, oh, sorry, I skipped a step.

628
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,900
 So basically I started talking to all my--

629
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,140
 - Yeah, you did.

630
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,060
 - I started talking to all my other Verizon friends

631
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,620
 and they got their bars back and I didn't

632
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,460
 by the end of the night.

633
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,300
 - Oh.

634
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,140
 - Ah, okay.

635
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,300
 - So at midnight, you know, everything's closed,

636
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,940
 but at midnight, I'm realizing that like everyone else,

637
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,980
 I'm the only one still with no service in my phone.

638
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,620
 - Have you tried turning it off and turning it on again?

639
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,780
 - Right, I did.

640
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,220
 - Did you put it in rice?

641
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,580
 - I shoved it in rice.

642
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:20,380
 I tried to rub its thigh and then whisper in its ear

643
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,220
 to turn it on.

644
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,500
 - Whisper in its tear.

645
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,020
 - In its tear duct.

646
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,900
 (laughing)

647
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,860
 And then it tells you like,

648
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,220
 you can take out your SIM card thing.

649
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,100
 Have you ever taken out the SIM card of your own phone?

650
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,300
 - It's a pain.

651
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,820
 - It's scary.

652
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,380
 You gotta get like a little paper clippy thing

653
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,300
 and you gotta like push real hard,

654
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,140
 like harder than you would on like a delicate object.

655
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,620
 And then like it goes bunk and then it comes out.

656
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,540
 And I laughed because I was following the directions

657
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,140
 on the YouTube thing, but of course you're playing,

658
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,140
 pausing, playing, pausing.

659
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:55,260
 And it says, do not blow into the empty slot like a Nintendo.

660
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,540
 And I was like, oh, that's exactly what I did.

661
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,900
 I had too late.

662
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,460
 You need to put that before.

663
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,300
 You need to tell me that before.

664
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,780
 - I did that immediately.

665
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,620
 - That's a go-to.

666
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,260
 - Have you guys seen all the videos

667
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:10,260
 where people pour molten glue into their phone holes

668
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,700
 and pull it out as a cleaning method?

669
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,540
 - Yeah, yeah.

670
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,700
 - Oh, oh, no.

671
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,540
 - Yeah, I've seen those.

672
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,380
 - I don't know that that's advisable.

673
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,220
 - I don't think so.

674
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,420
 - I haven't done it.

675
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,340
 I've seen the videos.

676
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,380
 I haven't then tried to replicate it.

677
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,460
 - I don't think you'd go to the Apple store

678
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,300
 and they'd be like, have you done molten glue at home?

679
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,620
 I don't think that's ever gonna be the jack.

680
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,820
 - I think it would fuck you up.

681
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,740
 I think you could maybe do slime, maybe.

682
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,820
 - No, I'm not putting any goo in my phone.

683
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,340
 (laughing)

684
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,500
 - Yeah, they use the hot glue.

685
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,660
 Yeah, I don't know.

686
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,660
 - Like if I get a little fuzz

687
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,260
 in the charging port of my phone,

688
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,460
 I get a little Q-tip and just pop the fuzz out.

689
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,940
 - Wait, you pop out fuzz with a Q-tip with more fuzz?

690
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,100
 - That seems ridiculous.

691
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,580
 - Fight fuzz with fuzz.

692
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,740
 Fight fuzz with fuzz.

693
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,780
 - Well, you know, now that I'm saying it--

694
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,340
 - No, now that you're saying it,

695
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,300
 as an old time video game collector,

696
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,620
 when I'd buy all those used copies and movies too,

697
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,780
 they got stickers all over them, of course.

698
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:13,020
 The best way to get that sticker residue off

699
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,820
 is with another adhesive sticker.

700
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,620
 - There you go.

701
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,220
 - So fight fuzz with fuzz.

702
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,820
 - Fight fuzz with fuzz.

703
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,660
 - Mike Nielsen--

704
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,540
 - Matt, have you gotten the $20 account credit?

705
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,500
 - I haven't gotten that.

706
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,900
 - I can show up on your next bill.

707
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,900
 - You're owed, well, I think you have to get it.

708
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,980
 I think you have to call them and--

709
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,300
 - Oh, we say hey, motherfucker.

710
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,460
 You better get on that horn.

711
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,860
 - According to the New York Post,

712
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:41,060
 there is a call for this to be done automatically now.

713
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,900
 - Yeah, imagine selling it.

714
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,260
 - It's like a $20 account credit,

715
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:47,220
 which is being slammed for being inadequate.

716
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,780
 Do you feel like $20 is adequate or inadequate

717
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,540
 for your pain and suffering?

718
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,020
 I mean, so a day without cell service

719
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,180
 is worth more than $20?

720
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,020
 - Oh, yeah.

721
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,260
 - But it's definitely more than 1/30 of your bill.

722
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,700
 - Well, I think it's a breach of their contract,

723
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,540
 and I think it probably isn't,

724
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,820
 given all the legalese they've been in there.

725
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,660
 - I'm sure it's not.

726
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,900
 - But at the same time, I think that--

727
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,220
 - But I'll go to the Verizon store and tell them that, though.

728
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,100
 - But in certain cases, it's a life or death situation.

729
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:20,100
 I think they could really become here, not heroes.

730
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,660
 They could make some good positive news

731
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,820
 if they waived the monthly fee for everybody.

732
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,660
 - Yeah.

733
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,500
 - I think, I mean-- - Oh, sure.

734
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,340
 - If they said--

735
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,300
 - Oh, scoopernova girl, Matt, wants to know

736
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,740
 how much the cupcakes were.

737
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,620
 Were you, even with the $20 credit,

738
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,900
 are you still in hock to Verizon here?

739
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,420
 - I got $60 cupcakes each.

740
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,260
 (Matt laughs)

741
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,420
 - Whoa.

742
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,260
 - Basically.

743
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,740
 - I got the nicest cupcakes I've ever seen.

744
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,580
 - But Jules and actual Jules.

745
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,420
 - Gordon Ramsay's corner cupcakes.

746
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,900
 - No, I got, you know, seven bucks?

747
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,140
 - Yeah, nice cupcakes.

748
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,260
 - So even with the 20, you're coming out a little ahead.

749
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,540
 Even with the cupcakes on the 20,

750
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,860
 you're coming out a little ahead.

751
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,100
 - I'm probably not gonna go for the $20 credit.

752
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:03,940
 I'm just gonna let you guys know right now.

753
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,780
 - You're not gonna call it Verizon

754
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,620
 and get the $20 credit. - I'm gonna let you know

755
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,180
 right now. - You're not?

756
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,620
 - Those are things where you value your time at zero.

757
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,860
 I don't value my time at zero.

758
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,700
 - Are you kidding me?

759
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,820
 Time at zero? - Okay, Matt, here's,

760
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,900
 to just call them up and say,

761
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,060
 "Hey, give me $20," and they go, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."

762
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,420
 - There's the word, there's the word.

763
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,740
 What do I do, Paul? - Right.

764
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,980
 - Just, just call them.

765
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,220
 Just, it's so easy.

766
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,540
 The word just makes it so easy.

767
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,380
 - Oh, boy.

768
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,540
 - I won't be on the phone for an hour on hold

769
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,100
 with all the other schlubs trying to get

770
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,540
 a $20 fucking refund.

771
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,580
 - Okay, maybe you don't do it today,

772
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,460
 but in no way, no way they're gonna let people

773
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,100
 stay on hold for an hour for their $20 thing.

774
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:37,940
 That's fucking crazy.

775
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,060
 Oh, so you just click a link.

776
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,900
 There you go.

777
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,460
 I'm sure you can do it.

778
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,460
 You should absolutely do it.

779
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,020
 I just got $20 back from my oil change.

780
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,900
 I'd spent, but I spent 20 minutes doing it,

781
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,140
 but that's worth it to me.

782
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,660
 That's a dollar an hour for me.

783
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,460
 - You're really distracted by the $20.

784
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,300
 This is not where this story's going.

785
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,020
 - I'll tell you why, because this is the $20.

786
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,860
 That's what this is to me.

787
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,540
 You're speaking in terms of action figures.

788
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,860
 That's a Craven the Hunter.

789
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,380
 Are you crazy?

790
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,180
 You don't want a Craven the Hunter?

791
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,180
 Are you insane?

792
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,420
 Are you insane?

793
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,900
 - Not really.

794
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,220
 I don't want a Craven the Hunter.

795
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,580
 - Well, you don't want a Craven the Hunter.

796
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,220
 You're not a Spider-Man fanatic.

797
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,060
 He killed Spider-Man.

798
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,940
 You know how hard that is to do?

799
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,620
 This guy figured it out.

800
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,140
 - Very few people have done it.

801
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,500
 - Yeah, I think he's the only one.

802
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,620
 - Call the cops.

803
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,300
 That's a crime.

804
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,780
 - That is murder.

805
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,820
 - He ended up dying over it.

806
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,500
 - No, he didn't actually kill Spider-Man.

807
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,780
 That's the twist.

808
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:49,340
 (laughing)

809
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:58,460
 - Look, this is all adding up to,

810
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,820
 is on the day there was a software update,

811
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:04,220
 on the day there was some kind of weird cyber attack

812
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,820
 or not that took down a lot of Verizon's network.

813
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,780
 - Yes.

814
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,140
 - By total coincidence, on the same day

815
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,020
 my SIM card crapped up.

816
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,060
 - Just a total, total coincidence.

817
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,460
 - It couldn't have been coincidence.

818
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,300
 It was some kind of--

819
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,140
 - I think it was.

820
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,500
 - No.

821
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,340
 - Or the update did it.

822
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,160
 - What do you think, Jacob?

823
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,340
 What do you think?

824
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,420
 - I tend to, I do tend to lean towards Paul's way

825
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:29,460
 of thinking on these with the electronic stuff is,

826
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,380
 if one thing happens,

827
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,820
 I don't think that it's usually coincidence.

828
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,940
 I think it's usually somehow tied together.

829
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,140
 - It was corrupted by something, yeah.

830
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,580
 - Maybe not in the way that,

831
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,940
 maybe not in the way that we're thinking about,

832
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,780
 but like, I bet it's tied together somehow.

833
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,620
 - Look, I have an older phone.

834
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,120
 I have a 12, right?

835
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,960
 - Okay.

836
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,900
 - So I think, what, the 17 is out now, I think.

837
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,020
 - Did someone give your phone a comic book

838
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,860
 with boobs in it?

839
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,540
 'Cause that's the ultimate corruption.

840
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,780
 (laughing)

841
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,780
 - Circles on circles.

842
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,940
 - Circles in circles.

843
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:02,760
 - I showed, I showed my SIM card,

844
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,300
 the entertainment landscape in Las Vegas,

845
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,940
 and it just gave up and crapped out.

846
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,980
 (laughing)

847
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,380
 - It went goo.

848
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,780
 - I'm like, yikes, beer.

849
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,540
 - You made it research the boring company.

850
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,300
 It was like, corruption, corruption.

851
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,300
 (laughing)

852
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:21,380
 Corruption, Joe Lombardo, corruption, corruption.

853
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,620
 File corrupted.

854
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,300
 - Well, I--

855
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,500
 - Joe Lombardo was the Nevada governor.

856
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,340
 - So somehow--

857
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,900
 - Yeah, somehow, somehow he's the Nevada fucking governor.

858
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,140
 Oh boy, we got out of that place.

859
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,260
 - I wasn't telling you, I was telling the people listening.

860
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,100
 - I'm telling you,

861
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,820
 I got out of there by the skin of my teeth

862
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,780
 before that place started to blow.

863
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,100
 (laughing)

864
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,820
 - Dude, compared to some other,

865
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,900
 look, I don't like Joe Lombardo

866
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,180
 and I'm not voting for him ever.

867
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:47,380
 But I mean, compared to what other states have

868
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,460
 for politicians--

869
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,940
 - I guess you're right.

870
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,540
 - I count my blessings that we only have Joe Lombardo.

871
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,980
 - He's an old school intelligence scumbag,

872
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:59,300
 not just a blatant YouTube lying scumbag.

873
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,700
 - Right.

874
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,600
 - I suppose.

875
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,100
 - Yeah.

876
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,740
 - Yeah, there are some things that he says when he's like,

877
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,140
 yeah, I was just over there and that I walked over here.

878
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,460
 I'm like, oh, he just said something

879
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,660
 that was demonstrably true.

880
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,740
 Okay, that's okay, good.

881
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,580
 (laughing)

882
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,060
 - Yeah, Laurie in the chat like,

883
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,700
 hello, Indiana over here.

884
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,020
 Could be a lot worse.

885
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,620
 - Yeah, no, I count my blessings with Lombardo.

886
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:26,340
 - You know, hey, throw a dart at the old US of A.

887
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,740
 You're gonna find some horrible shit right now.

888
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,100
 - I'll tell you who disagrees with Paul

889
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,860
 about that completely.

890
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,460
 And that is Matt Son, who is an American.

891
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,860
 - That's right.

892
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,700
 - Also the following sponsor.

893
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,020
 - This show and this Verizon story

894
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,740
 was not supposed to carry over two commercial breaks,

895
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:48,740
 but this show is brought to you by Sales Ship Salesale.

896
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:56,420
 Yep, that's Sales Ship Salesale from Night Scoops in 2021.

897
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:00,640
 Sales, sorry, Sales Ship Salesale.

898
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,780
 You get it? - Right.

00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,620

 This is where I'm sitting now.

924
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,820
 - No.

925
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,660
 - My boat.

926
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,980
 I'm having a sale for ships.

927
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,340
 Oh my God.

928
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,580
 - And her hay scoops at checkout.

929
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,500
 - I'm losing everything.

930
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,420
 - Boy, that did not go well for that retail.

931
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,900
 - I lost everything.

932
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,740
 - Oh boy.

933
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,780
 - I lost all my ship sales.

934
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,060
 - Buyer beware.

935
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:24,340
 I realized this week, I was having a conversation

936
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,740
 with a friend of mine this week and I realized

937
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:30,260
 that there is something that happens to me

938
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,820
 with some regularity that I don't think happens

939
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:38,180
 to other people, I think in most cases ever in their lives.

940
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,980
 - Happy beginnings.

941
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,260
 - Happy beginnings.

942
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,100
 - Okay.

943
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:42,940
 - Happy beginnings.

944
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,780
 - Just 'cause. - What is it?

945
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,820
 - Just hold on, just 'cause,

946
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,100
 'cause I'm just gonna push through it.

947
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,620
 I went back in the Verizon the next day

948
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,940
 'cause I was the only one who didn't have a phone working.

949
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,020
 I said, "Is there such thing as an eSIM card?"

950
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:53,980
 They said, "Yes."

951
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,460
 They sat there, took a half hour to repair my phone,

952
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,820
 and I said, "How much do I owe you?"

953
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,140
 They said, "You gave me cupcakes yesterday,

954
00:34:59,140 --> 00:34:59,980
 "don't worry about it."

955
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,340
 And so whatever they're gonna charge me,

956
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,500
 didn't matter, they got cupcakes.

957
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,420
 It's the whole fucking story I was trying to get to,

958
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,860
 and that's why I don't give a shit about the $12 credit.

959
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,940
 Okay, go ahead.

960
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,020
 - That's a win right there.

961
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,380
 - No, I'm sorry, we're out of time, Matt.

962
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:15,940
 That story carried us over all three parts of the show here.

963
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,700
 Sorry, everybody, we're actually out of time.

964
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,820
 We can't do any more episodes.

965
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:21,340
 We used all of our time for all future episodes

966
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:25,020
 of that story, so I'll see you later, everybody.

967
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,180
 I can't even play the outro music, I'm sorry, I would,

968
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,500
 but I'll just, everybody turn off your podcast

969
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,340
 listening devices.

970
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,340
 - We're constrained by our pretend constraints.

971
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,060
 What is your, what's going on, Jacob?

972
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:39,460
 What happens to you that doesn't happen to other people?

973
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:44,020
 - I get accused, probably weakly,

974
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,980
 of giving someone a false name.

975
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,940
 - Whoa! - Oh!

976
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,340
 - My name is so common. - Yeah.

977
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:56,580
 - Jacob Smith, I get accused almost weakly

978
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,100
 of giving a false name to people.

979
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,140
 - I have never been accused of that.

980
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,660
 - So people go like, "No, no, no, what's your real name?"

981
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,820
 - Yes!

982
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:06,100
 - Like in what environments?

983
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,540
 - Like if I have to give a name for anything.

984
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,100
 - Like Starbucks? - So like a valet,

985
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,380
 yeah, like a valet parking, Starbucks, anything,

986
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,200
 anything like that.

987
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,100
 If I have to give a name, and they go--

988
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,220
 - It's like going up for a reservation,

989
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,700
 "Party of two for Alan Smithy, please."

990
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,540
 And they're like, "What?"

991
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,500
 Yeah, well, it does read, it reads pretend.

992
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,060
 I mean, I'm not convinced it's your name.

993
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,900
 - You shouldn't.

994
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,820
 - Wait, we just learned this lesson,

995
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,740
 so we get to put it in action right away.

996
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,060
 Is it your real name?

997
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:41,020
 All right, breaking news, breaking news.

998
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,600
 - Who can say?

999
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,540
 But yeah, like I'll drop a car off at the valet

1000
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,360
 and then they'll be like,

1001
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,640
 "Oh, we need a last name for the ticket, Smith."

1002
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,700
 And they will just stand there and look at me

1003
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:58,540
 and not move their pen at all to write my name down.

1004
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,380
 - Yeah.

1005
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,900
 - They're like, "Ha-ha, we've heard it all, Dickhead.

1006
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,740
 "What's your name?"

1007
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,820
 - Yeah, and they will like,

1008
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:09,580
 I'll often get like an eye roll or anything.

1009
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,260
 And I'll be like, it's common

1010
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,580
 because a lot of us are named Smith.

1011
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,460
 I don't know what to tell you.

1012
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,900
 - Okay, Jacob, so now you need to take on

1013
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,500
 like a Bob Dylan, Jack Frost type vibe here.

1014
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:25,460
 You need a day-to-day events like that

1015
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,380
 where you're getting reservations

1016
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:32,380
 or valets, you need a pseudonym

1017
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,300
 or a nom de plume, if you will,

1018
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,060
 that will somehow at least ring less false

1019
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,600
 than Jacob Smith.

1020
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,840
 - Okay, okay.

1021
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,460
 Sir Antoine.

1022
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,580
 - No, no, they're gonna go with sir.

1023
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,700
 A lot of people know they're Knights.

1024
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,540
 A lot of people know they're Knights.

1025
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:50,340
 - Don't go putting a hat on the hat here.

1026
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:54,140
 Don't make this into too flowery.

1027
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:54,980
 - All right.

1028
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,620
 - No, no, no, I've been Jacob Smith my whole life.

1029
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,460
 - You're going flowery.

1030
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,580
 - Let's go to the chat here, actually.

1031
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,980
 Just the first name, what does Jacob look like?

1032
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,820
 You see a guy who looks like Jacob approaching.

1033
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,660
 Give us some first name.

1034
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,540
 - A latter day scoop is already saying Hiram.

1035
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,020
 - Okay, Hiram?

1036
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,860
 - I like that.

1037
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,140
 - Are you getting a Gary and a Peter?

1038
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:12,980
 Alex?

1039
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,820
 - We got an Alex.

1040
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,620
 - Okay, so far I think Hiram Twattberger is winning,

1041
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,460
 but let's see.

1042
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,620
 - Hiram Twattberger.

1043
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,960
 Oh, Sebastian.

1044
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,260
 Thank you, Canadian Scoop.

1045
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,420
 I do like saying, my name is Sebastian.

1046
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,300
 - George Jetson.

1047
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,740
 You should go by Paul Mattingly.

1048
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,580
 That's a good one.

1049
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,660
 (laughing)

1050
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,500
 - I mean--

1051
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,060
 - Name, Mattingly, Paul Mattingly.

1052
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:35,900
 - Solid choice.

1053
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,020
 - Oh, Andy Cheek is right.

1054
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,220
 You should go by Murray.

1055
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,180
 - Murray. - Murray.

1056
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,780
 - Of course, that's what I should do.

1057
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,740
 Murray, Murray, Murray.

1058
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,140
 - Here's my second suggestion.

1059
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,780
 Your last name should be a name really known in town.

1060
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:56,580
 So it should either be like Wynn or Greenspun or whatever.

1061
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,980
 - You wanna really try just winking, nodding.

1062
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,220
 - Like, yeah, parking cars, sure, no problem.

1063
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,580
 Murray Wynn.

1064
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,860
 And they gotta go like, wait, is he a fucking Wynn Wynn?

1065
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,700
 Is he like-- - Who knows?

1066
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,380
 - And you gotta put everyone on their toes.

1067
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,220
 You gotta make sure everyone--

1068
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,360
 - Murray Riviera.

1069
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,660
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1070
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,860
 - I don't know if Newton's strong enough for Wayne Newton,

1071
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:19,220
 so I think you have to go straight Wayne Newton the third.

1072
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,060
 You have to go Wayne Newton the third.

1073
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,660
 - Wayne Newton Jr.

1074
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,820
 (laughing)

1075
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:27,100
 - Who are the ones who used to own the Palms and all that?

1076
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,860
 - Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1077
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,180
 - Oh, the Maloof's.

1078
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,020
 - Maloof. - That's it.

1079
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,200
 - Oh, Murray Maloof. - Murray Maloof.

1080
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,500
 - Murray Maloof. - Murray Maloof.

1081
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,760
 (laughing)

1082
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,340
 - That is, that will get you,

1083
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,500
 that might get you some stuff.

1084
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,340
 - That might.

1085
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,980
 I'll get a license plate that just says Third Maloof.

1086
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,620
 - Third Loof.

1087
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,460
 - Third Loof.

1088
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,700
 (laughing)

1089
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,540
 - Maloof Three.

1090
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,980
 (laughing)

1091
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,340
 - Murray Maloof.

1092
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,420
 Holy shit. - Murray Maloof is great.

1093
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,260
 - Nobody's gonna bat an eye at Murray Maloof

1094
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,820
 in Las Vegas. - Nope, nope.

1095
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,220
 I won't get a single look with Murray Maloof.

1096
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:07,500
 - And in the early 90s comedy movie of this, of course,

1097
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,860
 you end up being kidnapped and thrown in the trunk

1098
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,540
 because you're Murray Maloof.

1099
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,100
 - No, I get held for ransom as Murray Maloof.

1100
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,780
 (laughing)

1101
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,940
 - Oh, Murray Maloof.

1102
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,380
 - That's it.

1103
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,940
 - And there's a hilarious stream of hijinks

1104
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,780
 that gets me out of it.

1105
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,700
 - How hard is it to get a player's card

1106
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,980
 with Murray Maloof on it?

1107
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,740
 - Hard, you need a fucking ID.

1108
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,580
 - I think, for me, impossible.

1109
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:34,220
 - How hard is it to get an ID that says Murray Maloof on it?

1110
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,480
 (laughing)

1111
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,740
 - If only we knew anyone that could put together an ID

1112
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,900
 for me with pictures they already have of me.

1113
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,140
 (laughing)

1114
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,620
 - Murray circus, circus.

1115
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:53,320
 Murray Excalibur. - Murray circus, circus.

1116
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,740
 Murray circus.

1117
00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:01,220
 - I was thinking about just Goodwin.

1118
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,860
 My name is Jacob Goodwin.

1119
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,040
 - You know-- - Murray Goodwin.

1120
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,780
 - I used to get accused of dying my beard

1121
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,900
 when I had a red beard.

1122
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,300
 Now I do die my beard and no one brings it up.

1123
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,540
 (laughing)

1124
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:22,460
 But how do you react?

1125
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,980
 'Cause I used to really,

1126
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,220
 the first few times it happened,

1127
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:28,180
 I was really like, what are you talking to me about?

1128
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,980
 Does it really throw you?

1129
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,580
 - I am always ready for it now.

1130
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,300
 - Okay. - I'm ready for it.

1131
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,420
 So literally, I see the interaction coming.

1132
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:41,100
 We live in Vegas, we valet our cars more

1133
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,060
 than people in a lot of other places do.

1134
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:46,020
 So I keep going back to valets, that's why.

1135
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,540
 We're around valets a lot.

1136
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:52,540
 And so I'll see, oh, this is a valet that I don't know

1137
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,140
 in a place that I may be a regular at or whatever.

1138
00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:00,140
 And I'll see the kind of eye roll or the kind of look

1139
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:03,880
 and I'll just, in an effort to keep it moving.

1140
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,140
 I'm ready to just keep the process going.

1141
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,460
 Like, no, no, write it down, it's Smith.

1142
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,220
 I promise, that's the real name, let's go.

1143
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,180
 - Really, okay.

1144
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,340
 Do you have your license handy?

1145
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,660
 Are you ready to fling your license at them or something?

1146
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,660
 - I'm not that, no, I'm not that far.

1147
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,380
 All right.

1148
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,100
 - How about Candy Venom?

1149
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,780
 Candy Venom as your new hip street name.

1150
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,620
 - And then test yourself, see if you can keep

1151
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,500
 your same energy where you're like, I know, I know,

1152
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:34,100
 write it down, like Candy Venom, write it down.

1153
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,180
 - Yeah, I know it's common.

1154
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,780
 You have like eight Candy Venoms in the lot right now.

1155
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:38,620
 I get it.

1156
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:43,540
 It's common for a reason.

1157
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,660
 A lot of us are named Candy Venom.

1158
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,300
 I don't know what to tell you.

1159
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,780
 - Candy was the most popular name

1160
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:51,500
 when I was born a boy in Nevada.

1161
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,260
 Every boy was named Candy for a week.

1162
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:59,020
 It was the Candy Crush game was all the rage.

1163
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,180
 - Oh sure, everybody was.

1164
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,220
 - And then Venom of course,

1165
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,700
 America's number one favorite Spider-Man villain.

1166
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:09,900
 - That's why he is Matt Son's favorite villain.

1167
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:13,020
 American.

1168
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:13,860
 - Oh man.

1169
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,100
 - American.

1170
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,220
 - America.

1171
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,580
 - So I want you guys to think about,

1172
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,420
 just be aware of it,

1173
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,740
 keep in the back of your mind over the next few weeks.

1174
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:25,580
 I want reports of things that happened to you

1175
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,660
 that you don't think happened to other people.

1176
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:28,500
 - That's a good one.

1177
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,340
 - Oh.

1178
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,940
 - Preferably mundane, this is a good scoop mail thing too.

1179
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:32,860
 - That is a good one.

1180
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,180
 - 'Cause I have already just, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1181
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:36,100
 You're not talking to me, you're talking to our listeners.

1182
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,860
 - Yeah, I'm talking to you too.

1183
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,700
 - Yeah, but like we already know

1184
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,220
 all stuff about each other.

1185
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:45,220
 Like I, our neighbor, Chris, who we all know as Chris Lash,

1186
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:47,260
 he just moved into my neighborhood.

1187
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,100
 - Oh nice.

1188
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:48,980
 - And I haven't talked to him yet.

1189
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,860
 I want to keep, I forget if I came to tell him,

1190
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:53,660
 like, hey, you and I are first and last name people.

1191
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,620
 We are always introduced as first and last name.

1192
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:57,860
 We've talked about us.

1193
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:01,780
 - I think Chris Lash and SJ are friends

1194
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:04,700
 from before Chris moved to Vegas.

1195
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,100
 - Oh wow.

1196
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,260
 - Yeah, I think SJ, I think Chris is the one,

1197
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,940
 I think SJ and Chris did a gig together,

1198
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,260
 like shortly before he moved out to Vegas

1199
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,100
 and then he moved here and just blew up.

1200
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:19,100
 - Yeah, yeah, he works like crazy here in town.

1201
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,220
 - Oh yeah, he's, we should say Chris Lash

1202
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,860
 is a wonderful musician here in Vegas.

1203
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,900
 - Yes, not.

1204
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,140
 - Who we should probably have on the show at some point.

1205
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,900
 - Yeah, well I'll tell you what, and this is very early.

1206
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,060
 They literally just had like one meeting.

1207
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,460
 But you know, for fun, for one of the quiz shows,

1208
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,300
 they decided to do a version of Weekend at Bernie's,

1209
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,620
 the musical, where they did like a 10 minute version

1210
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,180
 of the musical.

1211
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,820
 And now it was so fun to work on that they want

1212
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:48,140
 to actually work on Weekend at Bernie's, the musical.

1213
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,540
 - Oh, good, good, good.

1214
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,420
 - They've only had one meeting, but I can't wait.

1215
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,820
 It's Casey, Sarah and Chris.

1216
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,780
 And so it's going to be hysterical.

1217
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:58,700
 - I just had a fucking realization last night.

1218
00:44:58,700 --> 00:44:59,860
 This is just a personal thing.

1219
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,980
 It doesn't help our podcast at all.

1220
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,820
 But I just had a personal realization last night

1221
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,180
 that made me so happy.

1222
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:08,740
 And that is Casey Wilson and I are on the same schedule

1223
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,380
 at Absinthe these days.

1224
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,820
 - Oh, nice.

1225
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:15,660
 - And that means that the next time they do a quiz show,

1226
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,860
 it'll be on one of my off nights and I'll be able to go.

1227
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:20,380
 - Go play. - Oh, very nice.

1228
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,220
 There you go.

1229
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,540
 - I really just thought about this last night.

1230
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,220
 I was so happy to realize that.

1231
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,820
 - Well, I guess you're working,

1232
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:27,780
 I didn't get to see you that night at Sarah Saras's show.

1233
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,780
 I got to do the show with your wife.

1234
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:30,820
 - That's right. - Yeah.

1235
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,060
 - I heard about it, I heard it went well.

1236
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,580
 I saw a little bit of video from it.

1237
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,420
 - It was super fun.

1238
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,260
 - And your set went very well.

1239
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:37,540
 - It did, it went very well.

1240
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:40,340
 I was so happy after doing like three corporates in a row

1241
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,660
 that I was like-- - Oh, I bet.

1242
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:45,500
 - Just letting loose, it was really, really funny.

1243
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,420
 It was super fun.

1244
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,700
 I also had like awesome people hop up.

1245
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:52,620
 So you know, for "Straight As Jacket Escape,"

1246
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:56,420
 I had a gay guy and a woman burlesque dancer

1247
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,540
 raise their hands for-- - Perfect.

1248
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,100
 - Who are the straightest guys in the room.

1249
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:00,940
 And they came up-- - Yes.

1250
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,780
 - And they were just hysterical.

1251
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,740
 You know, like when artists try to be funny

1252
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:06,100
 and they aren't, it sucks.

1253
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,220
 If they're funny, it's not-- - Great.

1254
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:12,060
 - I laid out and she just took over.

1255
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,460
 At one point-- - Smooth sailing.

1256
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:14,820
 - You know, I come up, I got the shackles

1257
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:16,100
 stuck between my legs.

1258
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:20,740
 And a guy in the back just goes, "Oh balls."

1259
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:22,660
 Like that, like that.

1260
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,060
 And I was like, that's funny, right?

1261
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,380
 Like, this is funny.

1262
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,100
 And I go, and I let it go, I would tip my cap to you, sir.

1263
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:29,980
 But obviously, you know, and I just show

1264
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,980
 that my hands are stuck between my legs.

1265
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,220
 And the girl just walks over and just doffs

1266
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:35,580
 an invisible cap over my head.

1267
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:38,060
 Just tips my cap for me.

1268
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,420
 - Hilarious. - Well done.

1269
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,340
 - I was like, this is great.

1270
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,100
 - Is this a burlesque performer that you know?

1271
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,100
 - No, I just met her that night.

1272
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,380
 - Oh, that's great. - Shea was her name.

1273
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,420
 Yeah, yeah, she was great.

1274
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,580
 - Who was she? - Nice.

1275
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:49,620
 - Shea. - Shea.

1276
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,460
 - Yeah. - Okay.

1277
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,340
 - She's named after a stadium.

1278
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:56,260
 - Oh, you should give that a name.

1279
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,260
 - Oh shit, I was gonna say, I should have asked

1280
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,900
 if that was a real name.

1281
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,860
 She gave me a fucking valet name.

1282
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,900
 She gave me a fucking fake valet name.

1283
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:09,820
 Yes, I'm Shea Stadium of the Connecticut Stadiums.

1284
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:13,100
 - You know, we have all that stadium money.

1285
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,940
 We have all that stadium money.

1286
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:18,260
 - How much stadium money do you have?

1287
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,500
 (laughing)

1288
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:25,900
 - But yeah, do we have two knitting scoops?

1289
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,180
 We do, we have two knitting, this is good.

1290
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,140
 - I love it.

1291
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,180
 - It's a higher compliment than when we're told

1292
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,740
 that people like to, people tell me like straight confidently,

1293
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:37,660
 like I fall asleep to you all the time.

1294
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:40,100
 And I don't know how to take that as a compliment.

1295
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,540
 - You should take it as a compliment.

1296
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:42,620
 - They need it as a compliment.

1297
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:45,020
 - I said that to Joel Hodgson,

1298
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:48,420
 he did not take it as a compliment on Twitter.

1299
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:52,060
 But that's because he couldn't hear the nuance

1300
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,220
 and love in my voice.

1301
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:54,220
 - That's right.

1302
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,460
 - I live by those movies.

1303
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:59,100
 - But knowing, I think knowing that people knit to us

1304
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,300
 is maybe, that is the highest compliment, I think.

1305
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:02,140
 - It's a pretty high compliment.

1306
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:02,980
 - I can see multiple knitters.

1307
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,620
 - It is very relaxing.

1308
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,260
 - David Sorenson, what do you do with your hands, buddy?

1309
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,580
 Get to knitting, get to knitting, go.

1310
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,420
 - Come on.

1311
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,260
 - Let's go.

1312
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:11,100
 - All right, there he goes.

1313
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:11,940
 - He's doing it, he's doing it.

1314
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:14,500
 (laughing)

1315
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,300
 - Mattingly, what are you doing with your hands?

1316
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,140
 - You know what?

1317
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,500
 - Losing at Jock Versus Nerd.

1318
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,740
 - Boo!

1319
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:20,580
 Boo!

1320
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,900
 - You wanna do a little Jock Versus Nerd action?

1321
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,780
 - Oh, am I?

1322
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,140
 - Fuck yeah.

1323
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,500
 - I'm on the hunt for balls.

1324
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,080
 (upbeat music)

1325
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:36,020
 On the hunt for balls.

1326
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:37,020
 - Oh!

1327
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,140
 - All right, real quick, two things.

1328
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:42,580
 First of all, it's colder than a witch's tit out here

1329
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:45,020
 in fuckin' Pittsburgh.

1330
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:45,860
 It's so--

1331
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,540
 - Paul Mattingly's favorite saying, everybody drink.

1332
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:49,900
 - But you love your governor, so lucky you.

1333
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,060
 (laughing)

1334
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,740
 - We do have a pretty good governor.

1335
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,780
 It's so cold out here.

1336
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,380
 That's why I'm literally wearing a jacket,

1337
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,940
 because we have heater on in the house.

1338
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:58,900
 It's just, it's cold.

1339
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,180
 It's so, so cold.

1340
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:01,700
 It's been bitterly cold for days,

1341
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,500
 and the cold is just seeping

1342
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,020
 into the bones of the home at this point.

1343
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,180
 - Uh-huh, the bones!

1344
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:08,980
 We have stopped the show.

1345
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:09,860
 Paul is cold.

1346
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:12,020
 - I don't know if you saw,

1347
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:15,060
 but the final reveal has been made.

1348
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:17,380
 The Pokemon-- - On The Masked Singer?

1349
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:20,460
 - The Pokemon crossover with LEGO.

1350
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,940
 The first three sets have been revealed.

1351
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:23,780
 - Oh!

1352
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:25,340
 - Did you see? - Pokemon LEGO?

1353
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:26,180
 - Yes.

1354
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,020
 - Pokemon LEGO?

1355
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:28,340
 I have not seen-- - So, Mega Bloks,

1356
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,260
 which is the company owned by Mattel,

1357
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:31,500
 which is one of their rivals,

1358
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,020
 they had the license for a while,

1359
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,820
 and they were making Pokemon LEGOs.

1360
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:38,980
 So now the Pokemon company is working in tandem with LEGO.

1361
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:42,140
 Can you put a guess out there

1362
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,980
 as to what the biggest set of the,

1363
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:49,980
 it's Charizard, Venusaur, and Blastoise in a big diorama.

1364
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:53,580
 What is your price tag you think might be

1365
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,940
 on that three-piece big display set?

1366
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,300
 - Oh, I thought you were going to have us

1367
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,100
 guess what they were, but you named the characters,

1368
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,700
 'cause I was all ready to guess.

1369
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,940
 - There's two other sets I can have you guess.

1370
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:04,980
 - Okay. - Paul wouldn't have been able

1371
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:07,100
 to name any of the characters anyway.

1372
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,100
 - Well, what do you think-- - I was gonna guess

1373
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:12,940
 either Ryachu, Pinky Rat, Foxfire, or Hermey.

1374
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:14,620
 I'm reading 'em off my phone.

1375
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:15,980
 - No. - Okay.

1376
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:16,820
 - Pikachu, of course.

1377
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,740
 Ryachu is an evolution of Pikachu.

1378
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,540
 You could make a Ryachu out of that Pikachu.

1379
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:23,060
 - Yeah, Ryachu's an evolution of Pikachu.

1380
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,060
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

1381
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,740
 - Okay, price tag for all three of 'em is a,

1382
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:29,220
 Lego built-- - It's a one-piece.

1383
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:33,340
 It's the three big bads from the original game

1384
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:36,100
 in a large display base.

1385
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,540
 Big, it's big, big.

1386
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:40,660
 - And like, it's pretty big, so a lot of pieces--

1387
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,940
 - It's big, it's a big set.

1388
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:46,940
 What is your price tag guess for this big Pokemon Lego set?

1389
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,380
 - $20. - I mean, it's gonna be--

1390
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,060
 - 20 bucks. - All right, all right.

1391
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:51,900
 Good guess, good guess.

1392
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:56,500
 I'm seeing $3.50, I'm seeing $4.95 in the scoop here,

1393
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,620
 in the chat. - $1,000 is guessed by Andy.

1394
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,940
 - $4.95, I think it'd be more than that.

1395
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:03,020
 - Dave Sorenson is-- - Is it limited?

1396
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:04,260
 Is it, are they only making blank amounts?

1397
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,020
 - No, it's not limited, no.

1398
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:07,500
 - Okay. - No.

1399
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,220
 - Oh, that is a great hat, Yarn and Sticks.

1400
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,460
 That is a great hat you just made.

1401
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:15,060
 That is a nice looking hat. - That's really cool.

1402
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,060
 That's really cool.

1403
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,820
 - I would pay-- - How much is it?

1404
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:20,300
 - I just, two birds for no reason.

1405
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:25,300
 I would pay three, oh, the whole hat is middle fingers.

1406
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,980
 It's a bunch of hat middle fingers.

1407
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,180
 - See, it fools you.

1408
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:32,820
 - Oh, that's a nice cozy hat to wear to a protest

1409
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:34,420
 at Minnesota right now.

1410
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:36,660
 Yeah, yeah, that's exactly it.

1411
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:41,140
 Okay, so I'm gonna guess that I would do

1412
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,740
 five Yarn and Sticks hats for that Pikachu.

1413
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,700
 - I mean, that's a good trade. - Oh, easy.

1414
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,620
 - I don't know what the little sets are going for.

1415
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:52,620
 No, the big set is actually priced to move at $650.

1416
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:55,140
 - God damn it. - Ooh.

1417
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,660
 - I know, and this is the thing, right?

1418
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:02,660
 Like, Pokemon is very much a kid-oriented brand,

1419
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:06,180
 or it was for a time. - Right, right.

1420
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:09,420
 - And Lego also kid-oriented brand for a time,

1421
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:13,780
 but this is a specific product based at adult collectors.

1422
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:18,700
 And so they even asked in like an AMA,

1423
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:21,020
 and people were like, "Is this a Lego set for kids?"

1424
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:23,660
 And they're like, "Nope, this is for adults."

1425
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,380
 Okay, so they acknowledged it at least.

1426
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,500
 - Adult collectors, yeah.

1427
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:30,660
 - No yucking, anyone's yum, no kink shaming, no whatever,

1428
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:35,660
 but if you bring a possible lover back to your house,

1429
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:37,020
 and they're gonna touch the thing,

1430
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:40,140
 you go, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, that was $650."

1431
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:44,300
 Like, I feel like the date is over.

1432
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,380
 - No, I think the date might be over if that's the reaction.

1433
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:52,700
 If you don't care that they touch your $650 Charizard,

1434
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,660
 I think that makes you cool.

1435
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:59,020
 - Oh, that was like, 'cause I have a Lego,

1436
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:02,500
 I have a Lego Batmobile on my bar at the house.

1437
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,340
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1438
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:10,340
 And you're always going, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!"

1439
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:15,780
 - But like a friend, we had people over one day,

1440
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,220
 and one of our friends was over,

1441
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,420
 and they had one of their kids,

1442
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:20,800
 or they had their son here with them,

1443
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,040
 and their son was, of course, super polite kid, great kid,

1444
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:29,500
 young kid goes, "Can I play with the Batmobile on the bar?"

1445
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,420
 Of course, yeah, take it down, hand it to him,

1446
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,500
 put it on the floor, walk away.

1447
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,660
 I just got like some little moving parts and stuff on it,

1448
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,820
 and I come back over there a few minutes later,

1449
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:41,520
 and the kiddo and his dad are both there,

1450
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,340
 and the dad is holding the Batmobile,

1451
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:46,900
 and he goes, "He was twisting a thing in here,

1452
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:49,100
 and now it won't work to twist it anymore.

1453
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,580
 I think he might've broken it, so sorry."

1454
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:53,980
 I was like, "Please!"

1455
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,740
 I was like, "Oh, I freaked the fuck out."

1456
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,820
 I was like, "No, no, I'm not!

1457
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:00,620
 I'm very happy that your kid is playing with the Batmobile,

1458
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:03,820
 and I don't care if it's a Lego, it goes right together."

1459
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:05,340
 - Come here, kid, you broke my toy.

1460
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:06,540
 You broke my fucking toy.

1461
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:09,280
 - Okay, please, please do not think

1462
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,420
 that I'm doing the no, no, no thing on you.

1463
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,460
 Keep playing with it, I don't care, it's fine.

1464
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,300
 - It's fine, it's fine.

1465
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,460
 Here's a bill, you can pay in installments.

1466
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,020
 (laughing)

1467
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:23,540
 - I'll send you a Venmo request, it's not a big deal.

1468
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:26,820
 I mean, they're canceled, you can't get the new ones anymore,

1469
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:29,580
 but I think they still have some on eBay.

1470
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,660
 You know, it's big money, but you know, you can,

1471
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:32,500
 you can switch, you're gonna be all right.

1472
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,580
 - You're gonna be out like $1,200, something like that.

1473
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:37,300
 Well, that is the other thing, too, is, Matt,

1474
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:41,180
 you make the point, you know, of someone sees that

1475
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:44,820
 in a possible partner's living space.

1476
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:46,740
 - Yeah, yeah, a social situation.

1477
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,580
 - And what's their reaction?

1478
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:53,580
 But you have to also know that Lego, as an investment,

1479
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:57,960
 have appreciated at a rate greater than even gold,

1480
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,820
 and that is true.

1481
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:04,820
 The evaluation of Lego is greater even than gold in the last,

1482
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:06,340
 - I'll tell you what else is true.

1483
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,380
 - In the last like 15 to 20 years.

1484
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,660
 - And that is that this is at least the 20th time

1485
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,260
 Paul has told us this.

1486
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:15,980
 - No, no, maybe, maybe twice I've told you that.

1487
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:18,780
 (laughing)

1488
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,740
 - Let's do a little Jock vs. Nerd.

1489
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:25,740
 Who got a Jock vs. Nerd today from, oh shit, I can't see it.

1490
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:27,940
 - From Reisenberg, yeah.

1491
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,860
 - And it's all about 2025.

1492
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:34,860
 This is a scooperty in look back to the year 2025.

1493
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:36,900
 - I just want you to know,

1494
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,820
 before you get the cars, I want you to know that every time

1495
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:40,900
 Sarah and I take a call from a financial planner,

1496
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,760
 I always say, you have Lego in the portfolio?

1497
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,660
 And if they say no, I fucking hang up the phone every time.

1498
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:49,420
 - Hang right up, hang right up.

1499
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:51,860
 - I reiterate, I say, no, physical Lego.

1500
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:55,220
 I want you to buy sets and vault them for me, please.

1501
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:57,860
 (laughing)

1502
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,740
 Because that's where the fucking money is.

1503
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,540
 I don't care about their stock.

1504
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:06,100
 I want to be able to resell Animal Crossing Lego sets

1505
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:09,960
 in 25 years for 10 times their purchase price, thank you.

1506
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,100
 (laughing)

1507
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:18,100
 - The categories are sports, movies and TV, music, culture.

1508
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:21,020
 Matt, you're up first, what you want?

1509
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:23,100
 - I'll do sports for 200, please.

1510
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,860
 - This team won the WNBA Championship

1511
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,780
 for the third time in four years.

1512
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:31,300
 - That would be our own Las Vegas Aces.

1513
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,940
 - The Las Vegas Aces, of course.

1514
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,340
 (horn honking)

1515
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:36,700
 - Take that, Lombardo.

1516
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,500
 I don't know what that means.

1517
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,340
 - Stay down.

1518
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:40,460
 - Matt, I think he's happy about it, honestly.

1519
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:41,300
 - Oh yeah, good point.

1520
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,100
 - Seems like it's something he'd be happy about.

1521
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:43,940
 Paul.

1522
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:46,140
 - I'll try movies and TV, please.

1523
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:50,020
 - For 200, on February 16th, NBC aired a three-hour

1524
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:54,300
 live broadcast to celebrate this show's 50th anniversary.

1525
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,540
 (groaning)

1526
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:59,020
 - Oh, SNL.

1527
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:01,100
 - I was like, what are you doing?

1528
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:01,940
 - Yes.

1529
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:04,340
 I'm sorry, it's Saturday Night Live.

1530
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:05,900
 Saturday Night Live is the correct answer.

1531
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,860
 - I was trying to remember, I was like,

1532
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:11,340
 did they do a special on Good Morning America or some shit?

1533
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,740
 (laughing)

1534
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:14,060
 - The Simpsons.

1535
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:14,900
 - Yeah, well, the Simpsons is almost--

1536
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,900
 - I'll try culture for 200.

1537
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:23,220
 This numeric pair was Dictionary.com's Word of the Year.

1538
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:25,220
 - Really?

1539
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:28,380
 - I guess six, seven? - That's a Word of the Year?

1540
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,500
 It's gotta be.

1541
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,060
 - Yeah. - That's a Word of the Year?

1542
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:31,900
 - Yeah, six, seven.

1543
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:32,940
 I guess that's the Word of the Year.

1544
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,220
 - Man, in these strange times where 69 jokes

1545
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:37,140
 don't even get kids to raise an eyebrow anymore.

1546
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:38,940
 - Nope. - Nope, not a bit.

1547
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:39,780
 Not a bit. - Well, I mean,

1548
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:41,060
 it's all over the internet.

1549
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:43,420
 A 69 joke, that's just innuendo.

1550
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:44,780
 You go online, it's right there.

1551
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:46,660
 Ain't no jokes anymore.

1552
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:47,500
 - Ain't no jokes. - It's true.

1553
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,860
 - It's not, it's not. - Ain't no jokes.

1554
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:51,460
 - No, like, back in our day, it was like,

1555
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,140
 when you started to think about that,

1556
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,900
 you'd be like, "Oh, oh my God, the possibilities."

1557
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,220
 But if you're eight years old now,

1558
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:58,860
 you've seen every iteration possible.

1559
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:01,580
 - You're just, if somebody mentions 69 to you,

1560
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:03,460
 you're just thinking of the last porno

1561
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:05,100
 that you watched, were they 69?

1562
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:05,940
 - Exactly.

1563
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,020
 Exactly.

1564
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:09,500
 Exactly. - Matt, you're up.

1565
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:14,380
 - Sorry, I was just picturing my kids watching porn.

1566
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:15,700
 - Circles and circles. - Me too.

1567
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,900
 - Circles and circles.

1568
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:21,140
 They're just doing Illustrator and just drawing it.

1569
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,380
 (laughing)

1570
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:26,340
 - Can you imagine that powerful?

1571
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,740
 - Photoshop away from them.

1572
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,100
 - If we could actually just draw something

1573
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:31,980
 that we would get off on, that'd be pretty great.

1574
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:32,820
 - You can't?

1575
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:33,900
 You can't do that?

1576
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:34,780
 - No.

1577
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:35,620
 - Oh. - No.

1578
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:38,100
 - Sorry, you guys don't have that superpower.

1579
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,460
 - That's why Paul's Christmas book is so sticky.

1580
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:43,500
 - Every woman I draw just looks at me like I'm ugly

1581
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,380
 and I lower myself as two.

1582
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:47,620
 (laughing)

1583
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:51,980
 - Oh.

1584
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:57,300
 - I'll take sports 400, please.

1585
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:02,620
 - This man won the third annual Las Vegas Grand Prix,

1586
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:05,180
 winning the race for the second time.

1587
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:06,420
 - Third annual.

1588
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:10,180
 - Gros. - Joe Lombardo.

1589
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:13,580
 - This is Nevada's own Joe Lombardo.

1590
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:16,260
 This is Max Verstappen.

1591
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:17,980
 - Verstappen!

1592
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:18,820
 - That's right.

1593
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:19,660
 - Max Verstappen.

1594
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:22,700
 - Paul.

1595
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,180
 - Max Verstappen up.

1596
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:27,100
 Movies and TV, please.

1597
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:31,300
 - For 400, this Canadian sports romance television series

1598
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:34,620
 is the surprise hit of the 2025 holiday season.

1599
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:36,220
 - Oh.

1600
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:37,060
 Oh.

1601
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:39,420
 - Canadian sports romance television series

1602
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:40,340
 is in quotes, by the way.

1603
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:41,180
 - Yeah.

1604
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:44,020
 Heated rivalry.

1605
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:44,860
 - Oh.

1606
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:45,700
 - I was about to say-- - Heated rivalry.

1607
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,060
 - I was about to say hot on the ice,

1608
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:49,540
 but I knew that wasn't it.

1609
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:53,060
 - It wasn't hot on the ice.

1610
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:54,100
 - I was--

1611
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,980
 - Hot ice equals water.

1612
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:58,500
 - Icy hot, icy hot.

1613
00:59:58,500 --> 00:59:59,980
 - Icy hot.

1614
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:02,180
 - Broke back goons.

1615
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:03,940
 - Broke back goons.

1616
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:06,460
 Holy shit. - Broke back goonin'.

1617
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:08,820
 - Broke back goonin'.

1618
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:10,540
 That has a double meaning. - Oh, that broke Paul's camera.

1619
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,980
 - That has a double meaning.

1620
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:16,180
 - Sorry, I just drew something I found very alluring.

1621
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:19,100
 - Oh, sure, you gotta take care of that.

1622
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:20,740
 - I have to tend to this raging boner

1623
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:22,820
 that I just induced with the cartoon I made.

1624
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:26,180
 - I'll do movies and TV for 600.

1625
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:28,980
 This movie took home five Oscars,

1626
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:32,340
 including best picture at the 2025 Academy Awards.

1627
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:33,820
 - Oh, man.

1628
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:35,540
 - Fuck. - I'm laughing, I know.

1629
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:38,100
 It's like we just don't give a shit about the Oscars anymore.

1630
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,500
 - Fuck.

1631
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:42,740
 I have no idea.

1632
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:46,420
 Not even a little bit of an idea.

1633
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:47,820
 I will pass.

1634
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,300
 Matt. - Man, I'm mad.

1635
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:52,060
 I even listen to like a Showbiz podcast

1636
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:53,140
 when they go over this stuff.

1637
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:54,740
 I know I'll know it when I hear it.

1638
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:57,260
 - I work in show business.

1639
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,580
 - I work in show business.

1640
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:02,140
 - I know show business.

1641
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:03,620
 I know Oscar.

1642
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:05,100
 - I'm Murray Maloof.

1643
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:06,740
 I should know this. - Oscar Goodman.

1644
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:08,140
 - I probably produced it.

1645
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:11,260
 Fuck, pass. - I'm here to kidnap you.

1646
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:13,260
 - Well, damn it.

1647
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:17,180
 Pass, I'm gonna kick myself, but pass.

1648
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:21,300
 - Paul. - Five Oscars this thing won.

1649
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,700
 - Including best picture.

1650
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:27,220
 - Well, what even came out last year?

1651
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:30,860
 - I don't know, man. - I just go,

1652
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:33,380
 I only see movies that my kids wanna see.

1653
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:38,100
 - It's just Citizen Kane over and over again.

1654
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,820
 - "Titanic Reboots" is Leon Kasov.

1655
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:44,740
 - I don't even, like, it wasn't--

1656
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,220
 - "Avatar 3."

1657
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:47,940
 - I mean--

1658
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:50,420
 - Oh, I know it now, but I can't remember the name.

1659
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:51,260
 - Do you?

1660
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:52,100
 I'm trying to think if there was even any--

1661
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:52,940
 - So you don't know it.

1662
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:54,820
 - Any prestige type movies.

1663
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:56,180
 - No, it wasn't prestige.

1664
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:57,020
 - It wasn't?

1665
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:58,140
 - That's a different movie.

1666
01:01:58,140 --> 01:01:58,980
 It's about magic.

1667
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:00,060
 - Oh, was it? - Oh, was it?

1668
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:01,620
 - It's the stripper, the Russian stripper,

1669
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:03,500
 the stripping Russian mafia movie.

1670
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:07,860
 - Oh, I don't even know what that is.

1671
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:09,740
 - Me either. - Pass.

1672
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:10,580
 - Let's see what it is.

1673
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:11,500
 What is it, Matt?

1674
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:12,340
 - I'm trying to remember the name of it,

1675
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:14,140
 but I know the first name of the actor,

1676
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:16,540
 Enora, that's it, yeah, yeah. - Enora.

1677
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:17,380
 Enora.

1678
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:18,580
 - Ignora.

1679
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:21,180
 - This Enora is what I did to that movie.

1680
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:22,020
 - I did.

1681
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:22,860
 - Matt!

1682
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:25,020
 How the fuck does that,

1683
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:27,300
 I didn't even know that movie existed.

1684
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:28,180
 - Here's the thing.

1685
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:30,060
 Not only is it an Oscar,

1686
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:32,260
 it's about a stripper who gets wrapped up

1687
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:33,300
 with the Russian mob.

1688
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:34,780
 It checks all of my boxes,

1689
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:36,100
 and I still haven't watched it.

1690
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:36,940
 I still haven't--

1691
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:38,700
 (laughing)

1692
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:41,420
 - An Oscar-winning movie about a Russian stripper

1693
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:42,260
 and the mob.

1694
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:44,140
 - It checks all of your boxes-- - Where have I been?

1695
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:45,380
 - It checks all of your boxes,

1696
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:47,220
 or it rushes all of your boxes.

1697
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:49,140
 (laughing)

1698
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,700
 - It Ukraine's all of his boxes.

1699
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,140
 - It Ukraine's all of his boxes.

1700
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:54,340
 You crane your neck to see an Enora.

1701
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:56,220
 - It two-knuckles all of my boxes.

1702
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:58,300
 - Oh, two-knuckle!

1703
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,620
 Oh, the country of two-knuckle.

1704
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:01,460
 (laughing)

1705
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:02,300
 - Matt, you're up.

1706
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:04,820
 (laughing)

1707
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:06,660
 - Sorry I hurt your Lego sculpture,

1708
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:09,820
 in two-knuckle we'd be aggressively pet sculptures.

1709
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:12,540
 - That's where Balky's cousins come from.

1710
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:13,780
 He's from two-knuckle.

1711
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:15,060
 I am from two-knuckle.

1712
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:16,780
 - Sports for 600, please.

1713
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:21,380
 - This basketball star was named Time Magazine's

1714
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,380
 2025 Athlete of the Year.

1715
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:26,420
 - Tiger, tiger, tiger woods, y'all.

1716
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:28,700
 - Barani James.

1717
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:30,140
 - Barani James?

1718
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:30,980
 Dio?

1719
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,820
 - Barani James.

1720
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:34,500
 - Barani James.

1721
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,620
 - Oh, Barani James.

1722
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:38,820
 - And Roddy James Dio, of course.

1723
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:39,660
 - Both are--

1724
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:40,500
 - Roddy James Dio.

1725
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,580
 - Both are as good at playing basketball.

1726
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:45,820
 (laughing)

1727
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:47,420
 - Stay down, Roddy James Dio.

1728
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:48,260
 - He will.

1729
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:49,100
 - You're not good at basketball.

1730
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:49,940
 - He will stay down.

1731
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:51,140
 He is dead as Dillinger.

1732
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:56,140
 - I am debating, you know, it could be Luca.

1733
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:57,540
 It could be--

1734
01:03:57,540 --> 01:04:00,460
 - Uh-huh, she lived on the second floor.

1735
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:02,020
 - Yeah, second floor, Luca.

1736
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:04,020
 - She lived upstairs from you.

1737
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:06,340
 - It should be, she killed Luca Alexander,

1738
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:07,820
 but will Time, like do you know what I mean?

1739
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:10,740
 Like, Time doesn't, like, if it was a true sports magazine--

1740
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:11,740
 - Was it Kobe?

1741
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:12,580
 - That's GA.

1742
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:13,500
 - Did they go Kobe?

1743
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,540
 Did they go like, salute your shorts?

1744
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:19,580
 - If they went to any card collection convention,

1745
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:20,740
 then it's still Kobe.

1746
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:23,100
 Kobe still rules at--

1747
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:25,420
 - Kobe's the hot card collectible now, huh?

1748
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:26,740
 - Yeah, always.

1749
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:30,780
 - Hotter than Jordan.

1750
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:32,580
 - I'm gonna go with Jake Eldridge to Alexander.

1751
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:34,380
 No, wait, no, wait, no, wait.

1752
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:36,540
 - Okay, but--

1753
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:37,820
 - It's Caitlin Clark.

1754
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:38,660
 - There it is.

1755
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:45,300
 Ah, Aja Wilson of the Las Vegas Aces.

1756
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,140
 - Oh, well, good, that's actually well-deserved.

1757
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:48,860
 She's a three-time MVP.

1758
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:49,700
 I actually--

1759
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:50,980
 - Apologies to Aja for not knowing that.

1760
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:54,180
 - I actually forgot to ask, I wanted a jersey of hers

1761
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:56,340
 for Christmas, and I should have asked for it.

1762
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:57,380
 - Oh, yeah.

1763
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:59,820
 - Yeah, you don't get what you don't ask for, Matt.

1764
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:01,860
 - That's true, that's true.

1765
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:05,300
 - I just looked online, it's $650.

1766
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:06,820
 (laughing)

1767
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:07,740
 - That is pricey.

1768
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:08,580
 - VIP.

1769
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:10,180
 - You get at least one Lego set for that.

1770
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:11,020
 Paul!

1771
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:11,860
 - Almost.

1772
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:15,820
 Movies and TV closing it out.

1773
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:17,980
 - This movie generated the highest domestic gross

1774
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,900
 of any film released in 2025,

1775
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:24,900
 taking in $423,949,195.

1776
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:28,180
 - What was the big wiener?

1777
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:31,500
 - Anora.

1778
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,620
 - No, I guess it's gotta been,

1779
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:38,300
 the Oz movie, right?

1780
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,340
 Wicked 4 Good?

1781
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:43,260
 - Wait, careful with your subtitles.

1782
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:45,540
 - Wicked 4 Good is the new one.

1783
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:46,380
 - Yeah.

1784
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:51,220
 - As the other one was still going on in 2025?

1785
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:53,500
 Was that both?

1786
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:56,580
 - No, I think the other one was released in '24.

1787
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:59,180
 I think the first Oz movie was '24.

1788
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:02,700
 - Yeah, I'll pass, 'cause I really don't know for sure, so.

1789
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:04,700
 - Oh, shit, that goes to me.

1790
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:09,740
 I thought it was the new Avatar movie.

1791
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:10,820
 - You might be right.

1792
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:12,180
 - Yeah, yeah.

1793
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:13,020
 - I think that's the one it is.

1794
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:13,860
 - Ash and Fire and Ash?

1795
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:15,700
 - Yeah, the new Avatar, Fire and Ash.

1796
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,340
 - Did that come out last year?

1797
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:18,180
 Or was that just--

1798
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:19,020
 - It came out in December.

1799
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:19,980
 - Did it, okay.

1800
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:20,820
 - Yeah.

1801
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:23,180
 I'll guess that one.

1802
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:24,100
 Avatar 3.

1803
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:26,100
 No, we're all wrong.

1804
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:27,580
 It's a Minecraft movie.

1805
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:31,620
 - Oh, we all forgot about the Chicken Jockey fiasco.

1806
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:32,460
 - Yep.

1807
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:33,420
 - Fiasco?

1808
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:36,460
 - Yeah, whenever Chicken Jockey showed up on the screen,

1809
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:39,260
 everybody would lose their shit and trash the theater.

1810
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:42,980
 - Yeah, that sounds like a wonderful artistic event.

1811
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:47,700
 - I mean, it sounds a bit like Rocky Horror Picture Show,

1812
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:50,020
 so I can't, I don't hate it.

1813
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:50,860
 - Right.

1814
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:53,420
 - Oh, it's me, I'll do sports for 800.

1815
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:58,780
 This player won the 2025 Heisman Trophy.

1816
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:02,180
 If this is Paul, name any active college football player.

1817
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:03,020
 (laughing)

1818
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:04,980
 - I would still not be able to do it.

1819
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,420
 I would not be able to do it.

1820
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:10,820
 I have cut football out of my brain.

1821
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:11,980
 - And this is college football.

1822
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:14,780
 - I know, and that's an even less thing.

1823
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:15,620
 - Yeah.

1824
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:19,180
 He just won the Heisman.

1825
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:21,700
 He plays for Indiana.

1826
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:25,540
 He's probably gonna play for the Raiders next year.

1827
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:28,420
 Do I have to give his first name?

1828
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:29,820
 Can I just give his last name?

1829
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:31,500
 - I'll give you points for his last name.

1830
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:32,580
 - All right, Mendoza.

1831
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:34,580
 - Mendoza.

1832
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:38,220
 - Yeah, Fernando Mendoza.

1833
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,180
 - You forgot Fernando.

1834
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:41,500
 - I forgot Fernando.

1835
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,580
 - That's the enemy of McBain.

1836
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:45,060
 - Look, we should all get to know that name.

1837
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:46,300
 He's going to be playing here.

1838
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:47,140
 So we need to--

1839
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:48,500
 - Yeah, he's gonna be in the silver and black next year.

1840
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:49,340
 - Mendoza.

1841
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:51,980
 - Matt, you're up.

1842
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:54,300
 - I need to make up some points here, yeah?

1843
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:55,220
 - Oh yeah, score check.

1844
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:56,460
 Well, we're all pretty close.

1845
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:59,420
 Paul's got 600, I've got 200, Matt has zero.

1846
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:01,660
 There's still two daily doubles left out there

1847
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:02,900
 and seven questions.

1848
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:03,940
 Anybody's game.

1849
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:05,620
 - Well, you know me and culture.

1850
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:07,660
 Let's do culture. - It's true.

1851
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:10,420
 - How can there be any answers in 2025?

1852
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:12,940
 There was no culture in 2025.

1853
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:15,620
 - This power couple announced their engagement

1854
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:17,940
 with the tagline, your English teacher

1855
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:20,580
 and your gym teacher are getting married.

1856
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:24,260
 - This is Travis Kelsey and Paula Abdul.

1857
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:25,940
 - Ah, yes.

1858
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:27,580
 - Travis Kelsey and Taylor Swift.

1859
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:29,740
 - That's right.

1860
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:32,220
 I did not know that.

1861
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:33,420
 I didn't hear that quote.

1862
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:34,260
 Paul.

1863
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:35,660
 - It was dumb then, it's dumb now.

1864
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:37,860
 - Yep, music for 200, please.

1865
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:39,820
 - All right, daily double.

1866
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:42,820
 - Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

1867
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:43,660
 - Gonna give Paul some distance.

1868
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:46,660
 - This performer was Spotify's most streamed artist

1869
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:49,860
 of 2025, dethroning Taylor Swift.

1870
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:50,700
 - Ooh.

1871
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:54,060
 - YouTubers CG5.

1872
01:08:54,060 --> 01:09:00,300
 - Who beat Taylor Swift for streams?

1873
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:01,140
 Oh my goodness.

1874
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:03,500
 - I find out that The Weeknd just snuck in there

1875
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:06,140
 and had so many streaming listens

1876
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,740
 that we just didn't know about.

1877
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:17,260
 I mean, no, that wouldn't, no.

1878
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:19,180
 - I would think maybe Charli XCX,

1879
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:24,100
 but that was 2024 when she was rocking up on it.

1880
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:27,140
 And I don't think she ever dethroned Taylor Swift.

1881
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:30,140
 - There are two prominent guesses in the chat

1882
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:32,580
 since this is a daily double and you have to guess.

1883
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:34,220
 Some people are saying Sarah Carpenter

1884
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:35,740
 because of the popularity of Stranger Things,

1885
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:38,420
 and other people are saying Bad Bunny.

1886
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:39,620
 - Oh, it's Bad Bunny.

1887
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:40,540
 - That's my guess.

1888
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:41,380
 - It's Bad Bunny.

1889
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:42,220
 - My guess is Bad Bunny.

1890
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,220
 - Yeah, he's big, big, big.

1891
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:45,060
 Bad Bunny.

1892
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:45,880
 - Yeah, yeah, you going Bad Bunny?

1893
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:46,720
 - I am.

1894
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:47,560
 - Let's see.

1895
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:48,380
 It is Bad Bunny.

1896
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:50,180
 - Yeah, what up, Doc?

1897
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:54,940
 - Yeah, I was like, I bet that the whole Super Bowl

1898
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:59,940
 controversy really got him a lot of listeners.

1899
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:04,220
 - Apparently he's really, really good, so.

1900
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:05,780
 - Oh no, he's fantastic, of course.

1901
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:09,020
 - Might have also exposed some racism in this nation.

1902
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:09,860
 - Oh, what?

1903
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:10,700
 - What?

1904
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:12,300
 - What are you talking about?

1905
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:14,380
 - Look, let's just eat regular hamburger buns

1906
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:15,300
 and talk about it.

1907
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:18,860
 - When you say this nation, you mean this one?

1908
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:20,120
 - This nation?

1909
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,400
 Where in my own citizenship might be in jeopardy?

1910
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,900
 What are you talking about?

1911
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:26,580
 - I'm just going to ignore Matt

1912
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:28,500
 and whatever craziness he's talking about

1913
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,420
 and just move on to culture for 600.

1914
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:31,380
 - God damn it.

1915
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:34,820
 - Andy Byron and Kristin Cabot are best known

1916
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:38,160
 for the role they played in this 2025 event.

1917
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:41,860
 Andy Byron?

1918
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:44,500
 Shit, I don't know.

1919
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:45,620
 Pass, Matt.

1920
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:49,980
 - Andy Byron and Kristin Cabot?

1921
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:53,180
 - I said Cabot, but I don't know.

1922
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:54,840
 C-A-B-O-T.

1923
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:55,680
 - This is culture.

1924
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,940
 - The role they played in this event.

1925
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:02,820
 - New Year's Eve?

1926
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:04,540
 - I know, that's what I'm like.

1927
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:07,920
 - The West Virginia State House elections.

1928
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,360
 - Pass.

1929
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:12,460
 - Paul.

1930
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:13,720
 - A pass.

1931
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:14,560
 - Let's see.

1932
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,300
 Coldplay kiss cam couple.

1933
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:18,540
 - Oh, yes.

1934
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:24,260
 - Infamous, infamous Coldplay kiss cam couple.

1935
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:25,100
 Matt.

1936
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:26,180
 - Infamous.

1937
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:29,300
 - Culture 800, please.

1938
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:30,980
 - Let's see.

1939
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:34,660
 After thieves stole $102 million in jewels

1940
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:36,820
 from the Louvre in Paris, France,

1941
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:38,540
 it was reported the password

1942
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:41,780
 for the museum surveillance system was blank.

1943
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:42,620
 - Damn it.

1944
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:44,900
 I knew all the factors that laid out in the question.

1945
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:48,420
 And then I knew it was jewels the amount in the Louvre,

1946
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:50,840
 but the password. - I think that's it, Matt.

1947
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:54,620
 - Oh, password?

1948
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:56,100
 - No. - It was password?

1949
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:56,920
 - No.

1950
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:59,980
 - The jewels?

1951
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:00,980
 - Well, it might be password.

1952
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:03,540
 It's either password or Louvre, I think.

1953
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:04,900
 - Ah.

1954
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:06,100
 - That's it.

1955
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:07,860
 That's it as the password.

1956
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:09,100
 - No, I think it's Louvre.

1957
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:13,140
 Or password, it's one or the other.

1958
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:15,220
 - I'll pass, you can take them all the money.

1959
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:16,060
 - Paul.

1960
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:18,220
 - No, I don't want to try and guess, I don't know.

1961
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:22,780
 I think it's the Louvre, but I'm not 100% now.

1962
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:24,660
 Now you got me guessing.

1963
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:25,860
 I think it was Louvre.

1964
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:26,700
 - It was sticky.

1965
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:27,540
 You're going Louvre?

1966
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:29,660
 - It was sticky cheese because the I was a one

1967
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:31,620
 and the E's and the cheese were three.

1968
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:34,060
 - Let's see, it's Louvre.

1969
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:35,780
 - I heard it was the Louvre.

1970
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:38,620
 That's why I gave you, I told Matt it was the Louvre.

1971
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:42,980
 - Paul, you got music for four, six, or 800.

1972
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:45,780
 One of them's a daily double and that one could fuck you up.

1973
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,860
 - It could fuck me up.

1974
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:51,060
 I guess I might as well go out big with 800, please.

1975
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:52,700
 - Music for 800.

1976
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:55,500
 In May 2025, the song "Wasted Love"

1977
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,180
 performed by JJ and written by him

1978
01:12:57,180 --> 01:13:00,540
 along with Todora Spierich and Thomas Turner

1979
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:04,180
 won the Eurovision Song Contest for which country?

1980
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:07,060
 - Oh, that's, oh, shoot.

1981
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:10,780
 Who won the Eurovision, I don't pass, I don't know.

1982
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:14,140
 - Oh, that passes to me.

1983
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:19,140
 There was a large amount of conversation this year

1984
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:22,900
 about Eurovision at work with all of the Europeans

1985
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:23,740
 and everybody that I worked with.

1986
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:25,100
 - Was there really?

1987
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:29,060
 - There was a ton of conversation about this event.

1988
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:30,380
 I didn't listen to any of it.

1989
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:31,780
 Pats, Matt.

1990
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:33,900
 - I also did not follow the story at all.

1991
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:38,300
 Birdie, birdie, bird, bird, bird is my final answer.

1992
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:39,140
 Pass. - Good.

1993
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:42,500
 Austria, that's right, I do remember that.

1994
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,540
 - Austrian went yodeling.

1995
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:45,980
 - That's right.

1996
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:48,860
 It's me, I got music for 400 or 600.

1997
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:50,780
 Matt has 400, I have 200.

1998
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:53,740
 Paul has 2000, so I'm probably not gonna catch Paul.

1999
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:56,140
 Let's see, I'll try to get some points on Matt here

2000
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:56,980
 and get second place.

2001
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:58,460
 Music for 600.

2002
01:13:58,460 --> 01:14:01,660
 Name any of the eight artists that were nominated

2003
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:05,760
 for best new artist at the 2025 Grammy Awards.

2004
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:10,380
 Shit.

2005
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:17,220
 Is my answer to that question.

2006
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:18,500
 - Ice Spice.

2007
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:23,460
 - I don't think that's even this year.

2008
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:27,460
 - Um, jeesh.

2009
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:31,780
 Yeah, I don't know.

2010
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:32,740
 Pass, Matt.

2011
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:33,580
 - I don't know.

2012
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:35,300
 - Paul.

2013
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:36,120
 - Pass.

2014
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:40,140
 - Chappell Rhone was this year?

2015
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:41,260
 Oh, motherfucker.

2016
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:42,820
 Benson Boone, Sabrina Carpenter.

2017
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:44,660
 Oh, this is all, I would have thought

2018
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:45,500
 that several of those--

2019
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:46,320
 - Well, that's 'cause the Grammys

2020
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,420
 are behind the fucking time.

2021
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:48,260
 - I was gonna say,

2022
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:50,380
 Sabrina Carpenter's been around for a minute.

2023
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:51,540
 - Yeah, that's--

2024
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:53,860
 - Dochey's been around for a minute.

2025
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:56,100
 - I feel better about not getting this question right now.

2026
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:56,940
 - Yeah, you do.

2027
01:14:56,940 --> 01:14:58,980
 - At least most of the--

2028
01:14:58,980 --> 01:15:02,220
 - Teddy Swims, yeah, he, oh no.

2029
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:05,300
 - We're back from our technical problem.

2030
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:08,380
 Oh yeah, none of us guessed on that one.

2031
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:10,860
 Paul or Matt, closing out the category end of the game.

2032
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:12,020
 Paul is definitely winning

2033
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:13,860
 and Matt is gonna probably get second place.

2034
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:14,700
 It's a daily double.

2035
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:16,620
 - We'll have to get this so I get third place.

2036
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:17,780
 So there's stakes here.

2037
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:18,620
 - Oh, that's true.

2038
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:19,700
 Yeah, we got stakes.

2039
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:22,860
 This song began 2025 at number one

2040
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:25,180
 on the Billboard Hot 100 and fun fact,

2041
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:26,860
 it is also the number one song

2042
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:30,100
 on the day I am writing this scooperty, 12/10/25.

2043
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:32,680
 - That's not a helpful hint at all.

2044
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:34,260
 - Well, it means it was number one

2045
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:36,820
 for either a long time or twice.

2046
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:37,660
 - Billboard Hot 100.

2047
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:41,180
 - Oh, I know it.

2048
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:44,780
 - Is this a Sabrina Carpenter song?

2049
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:45,860
 - I don't think so.

2050
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:50,260
 I think this is a song that comes around in December.

2051
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:53,420
 - Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

2052
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:55,460
 Amy Winehouse's, no.

2053
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:56,860
 (laughing)

2054
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:58,260
 - Amy Winehouse's.

2055
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:00,900
 ♪ They try to make me go to rehab ♪

2056
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:04,740
 ♪ And I say Merry Christmas ♪

2057
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:05,580
 - Oh God.

2058
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:09,140
 - I can go to rehab.

2059
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:12,620
 I gotta wrap presents and no, no, no.

2060
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:14,780
 (laughing)

2061
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:17,500
 Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas".

2062
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:21,140
 - "All I Want for Christmas" is you, Matt Donnelly.

2063
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:21,980
 - I'm so proud of you.

2064
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:23,820
 - That's right.

2065
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:24,900
 And that is the game.

2066
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:26,540
 Paul wins with 2,000 points.

2067
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:27,740
 Matt's insane with 800.

2068
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:29,660
 I'm in third with 200.

2069
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:31,020
 That's from Rum Raisenberg

2070
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:34,100
 and that was 2025 in retrospective.

2071
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:35,420
 - That's a great scooperty.

2072
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:36,380
 Good job.

2073
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:39,700
 - Nicely done, Rum Raisenberg.

2074
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:41,220
 - How much we don't remember.

2075
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:44,300
 But you know, like, you know, maybe.

2076
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:46,140
 - I'm a little embarrassed that I've never heard

2077
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:47,980
 of the best picture winner.

2078
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:49,340
 - That's, you know.

2079
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:51,060
 - I hadn't heard of it either.

2080
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:51,900
 That's disheartening.

2081
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:53,660
 - Although I'm not as embarrassed as they should be.

2082
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:55,300
 - Well, "20/20 After" was famously,

2083
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:57,300
 and this is why I listen to my showbiz podcast,

2084
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:00,100
 is that like, was famously hampered by the,

2085
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:03,140
 this is still the echoes of the writer's strike,

2086
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:03,980
 or the actor's strike.

2087
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:04,820
 - Oh, right.

2088
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:06,380
 - So they couldn't get enough stuff into production.

2089
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:08,220
 So movie theaters were pissed

2090
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:11,540
 about how little product was coming to the pipeline in 2025.

2091
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:13,900
 It was a bad year for TV too.

2092
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:15,580
 It just like, everything was so delayed

2093
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:16,420
 from all the strikes.

2094
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:17,780
 - Great year for Keeler though.

2095
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:19,180
 Pluribus is just taking off.

2096
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:20,020
 He's doing great.

2097
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:22,540
 - I see Paul Chamberlain up there.

2098
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:24,900
 I don't know if I gave Paul a full proper shout out,

2099
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:27,780
 but I had a corporate gig in South Bend,

2100
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:29,620
 and he basically lives, he lives in South Bend.

2101
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:32,220
 Not basically, he lives in South Bend.

2102
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:35,260
 But he basically stepped up as my advance man.

2103
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:39,500
 He helped get stuff to the venue that needed to be.

2104
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,140
 He was there at the venue before I got there.

2105
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:43,300
 He introduced himself to the person running the venue,

2106
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:44,620
 and like, he had me all set up.

2107
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:47,060
 I like walked in, and everything was like set up for me,

2108
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:49,420
 because Paul did everything, and it was really great.

2109
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:51,260
 It was awesome, and just--

2110
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:52,100
 - Oh, awesome.

2111
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:55,100
 - Further proof that just our podcast audiences are amazing.

2112
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:55,940
 So there you go.

 - Yeah, we have the best listeners.

2114
01:17:57,580 --> 01:17:59,100
 - He'd been in the turn with his son before,

2115
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:01,300
 so that was very nice to see him again.

2116
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:02,700
 - Yeah.

2117
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:03,580
 Speaking of our listeners,

2118
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:05,860

 I am looking into it.

01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:18,720
 This list feels light.

2168
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:21,500
 - Oh yeah, bud.

2169
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:22,340
 - Yeah, it's light.

2170
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:25,940
 No, I was looking at it yesterday, and yeah, yeah.

2171
01:20:25,940 --> 01:20:27,300
 But yeah, we're gonna figure all this out.

2172
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:28,140
 - We'll get there.

2173
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:29,820

 Our longtime Patreon-- - She's alive, she's alive.

2176

 She's alive. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:39,580
 She's not with us, she's with us, capital U.

2178
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:41,080
 She's not with us, lowercase U.

2179
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,420
 (laughing)

2180
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:46,820
 Yeah, yeah, no, but she's been with us for years and years.

2181
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:49,680
 We love Annie, but she has moved on.

2182
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:52,060
 And yeah, so we are figuring out new lists

2183
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:54,420
 and all of that stuff on our own now

2184
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:56,820

2189
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:03,740

 I'm just still, it's just rattling around in my head.

2212
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:10,140
 Like how many different types of hamburger buns

2213
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:11,660
 does Matt have right now?

2214
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:12,940
 - It really throws people for a loop, right?

2215
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:16,020
 Where I go, I'm making barbecue burgers.

2216
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:17,060
 What kind of bun do you want?

2217
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:17,880
 How do you take your bun?

2218
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:18,820
 How do you take your bun?

2219
01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:19,660
 How do you take your bun? - Bun?

2220
01:22:19,660 --> 01:22:20,500
 - Yeah. - How do you take your bun?

2221
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:21,340
 - How do I take my bun?

2222
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:22,180
 - It's gonna be just beef and cheese.

2223
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:25,000
 - Now beyond that, is there preparation to the bun?

2224
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,460
 Do you offer grilling or toasting?

2225
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:31,220
 - I toast the bun on the grill.

2226
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:32,540
 - Yeah, that's the best. - Shay Donnelly

2227
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:34,740
 has a great many amenities.

2228
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:35,940
 - I was gonna grill the bun.

2229
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:37,100
 I've grilled the buns in the past,

2230
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:39,620
 but I realized I'm like, I don't wanna get my kids

2231
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:42,480
 in the habit of having extra butter and cholesterol

2232
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,500
 on their already cheesy burger, so.

2233
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,340
 - Do you stir or steam the buns?

2234
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:46,540
 - Toast the buns is enough.

2235
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:47,380
 - What are you talking about?

2236
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:51,380
 Don't get them in the habit of having delicious food.

2237
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:53,600
 You don't wanna ruin their palates.

2238
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:54,440
 Is that it?

2239
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:56,060
 You wanna keep them American?

2240
01:22:56,060 --> 01:22:57,820
 - He don't wanna shovel butter and salt

2241
01:22:57,820 --> 01:23:00,020
 into their mouth all the time,

2242
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:01,820
 which does make him less American.

2243
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:02,780
 - It does, it does.

2244
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:06,180
 But to quote Jeff Goldblum, "Butter finds a way."

2245
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:07,720
 - Butter does find a way.

2246
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:10,620
 - All right, thanks folks, everybody.

2247
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:11,460
 Stay safe out there.

2248
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:13,260
 We love you, and we'll see you soon.

2249
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:16,400
 - Yes. - We'll see you soon.

2250
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,980
 (upbeat music)

2251
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:23,780
 - See you at the cone.

2252
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:25,800
 - Hickey Buns Donnelly.

2253
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:29,380
 - That's what we're gonna call the kids today.

2254
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:30,220
 - I'm not seeing them.

2255
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:32,340
 - Say, "What's up, Hickey Buns?"

2256
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:34,600
 (laughing)

2257
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:42,460
 - Start calling Hilly Hickey Buns, see what he does.

2258
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:46,040
 - I hear you like a specific type of hamburger bun,

2259
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:47,460
 young Donnelly.

2260
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:49,080
 - It is blatantly, egotistically,

2261
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:50,920
 I'm trying to compete with like In-N-Out

2262
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:53,420
 and like other fast food.

2263
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:56,800
 - Have you bested those other fast food places

2264
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,640
 thus far?

2265
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:58,820
 - I want them to say, I'm gonna say,

2266
01:23:58,820 --> 01:23:59,900
 "Hey, why don't I make burgers tonight?"

2267
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:02,700
 And I want the kids to go, "Oh, awesome."

2268
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:03,540
 You know what I mean?

2269
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:04,700
 Like that's the goal.

2270
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:06,780
 - Instead of, "Why don't we go out for burgers?"

2271
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:07,880
 - That's it, I'm trying to go like,

2272
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:09,380
 "Or we go to In-N-Out," is the other thing

2273
01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:10,220
 that can pop up, right?

2274
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:11,620
 So that's what I don't want.

2275
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:13,620
 - Well, so far, you've got him to say,

2276
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:17,420
 "I demand pretzel or don't serve me that French shit."

2277
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:18,980
 So you're halfway there.

2278
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:20,860
 (laughing)

2279
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:21,700
 - Progress.

2280
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:26,860
 - I'm gonna do basically a bun flight next time.

2281
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:27,700
 We'll just do-

2282
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:28,540
 - A bun flight!

2283
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:30,800
 (laughing)

2284
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:34,820
 Here are sir's choices for the evening.

2285
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:36,700
 (laughing)

2286
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:38,140
 Please make your selection

2287
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:40,020
 and I will go back to the kitchen.

2288
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:42,460
 (laughing)

2289
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:43,300
 And do what I find.

2290
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:46,020
 - This one is awfully yeasty.

2291
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:46,860
 - Yeah, I know, yeah.

2292
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:48,820
 - You've got a costume to these buns here.

2293
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:51,340
 Don't jump right into this yeasty mess.

2294
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:52,660
 - This is real yeasty.

2295
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:55,140
 This one's real yeasty, careful.

2296
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:57,480
 Careful, Hill, too much yeast.

2297
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:00,060
 This is-

2298
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:02,940
 - Now this one is whole grain over here.

2299
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:03,780
 - This one-

2300
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:05,460
 - You don't wanna jump straight to whole grain either.

2301
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:08,320
 - This is from an artisanal sourdough starter

2302
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:11,100
 that began in 1874.

2303
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:12,140
 You believe that?

2304
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:15,620
 - Which is almost as old as your mom.

2305
01:25:15,620 --> 01:25:18,700
 - You are tasting revolutionary bread, basically.

2306
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:20,940
 (laughing)

2307
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:22,620
 - Bye.
