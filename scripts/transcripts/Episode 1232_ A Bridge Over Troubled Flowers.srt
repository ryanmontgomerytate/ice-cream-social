 gonna bring that dirty magazine to school and show all the kids and uh are you gonna uh

27
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:57,280
 there's no wrong answer here i actually i actually haven't read the comic yet

28
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:05,520
 it's that tantalizing that looks at the pictures i know that's right that's right that's not what i

29
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:12,640
 mean i haven't i haven't read it i haven't looked at the pictures in fact in the car when i was

30
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:20,480
 scrolling i went from back to front so when paul picked it up i was like oh wait did he think i was

31
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:30,880
 looking at that no honestly i didn't even look at that i i honestly i didn't even i really i was i

32
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,600
 was like oh crap yeah sometimes there's boobs and powers but it's not it's nothing whatever

33
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,280
 man paul stands by his decision i do stand by my decision it's a fantastic comic book it's by one

34
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,520
 of the ultimate comic book creators brian michael bendis and uh yeah i stand by brian michael bendis

35
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:55,600
 can't do convince young boys to actually read the thing and not just look at the pictures that's not

36
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:01,200
 true i think he's inspired a generation he's again he's the guy behind miles morales he's uh he's had

37
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:09,360
 more than his share of successes um so yeah yeah yeah so yeah well uh you know we're in arizona

38
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:17,760
 we're in mesa just phoenix phoenix adjacent mesa arizona and so i took my uh basically we looked at

39
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:24,480
 the cost of the my wife is is about to help relaunch disco and so yes me being away figured

40
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:31,760
 whether whether we would uh um you know hire a bunch of baby child care stuff i have a bunch

41
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:37,200
 of babysitters or i just take them with me and so uh you know i did what any dad would do i was be

42
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,200
 like boys this is the difference between the las vegas strip club and a phoenix strip club and i

43
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:48,880
 took them out to show them the different ways um but uh more hands on so yeah we road tripped it

44
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:57,440
 and uh we came out here to uh it is the uh um paul is holding up his phone that says the comic

45
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,280
 book that we mentioned earlier well people were asking in the chat i'm just yeah you're just

46
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,960
 just showing people powers all right this is what this is the bonus content you get when you tune

47
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:15,200
 into the stream this is yeah this is the regular not bonus content that everybody else gets when

48
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,080
 they don't do it what do you mean but this is incentivizing more subscriptions it's cheap

49
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,280
 if they hear us talking about your phone you can see my phone it's three now it's three okay three

50
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:36,320
 bucks we have god god inflation never stops three bucks you can see my phone yeah um uh yeah yeah so

51
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,880
 uh we road tripped it out here uh you know all the times we would bitch about the vegas heat

52
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,240
 and then our listeners from arizona would go like whatever dude check it out check out our

53
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,920
 our our neighborhood i used to be like it can't be that different it is oh no they're right it's

54
00:05:53,920 --> 00:06:00,640
 so yeah they're right it is that much more it's hotter here i understand people moving to las

55
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:06,880
 vegas there is stuff in las vegas there are things to do there's work there's jobs there's fun there's

56
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,880
 all these things arizona doesn't have any of those things they're just hotter

57
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:19,520
 it's less fun and hotter yeah we gotta uh as my youngest said it's a free sauna free sauna yeah

58
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:26,400
 one of the most miserable times that i've ever experienced was when we did a star trek promotion

59
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:34,240
 at a diamondbacks game it was 108 degrees we were all wearing our full costumes

60
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,160
 we're walking around this was like a fan thing happening at the baseball game it was a promotional

61
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,720
 event for the experience and it was like where your star trek stuff to uh to the baseball game

62
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,840
 yes and one of our cling-ons threw out the first pitch and didn't attach his gauntlet properly and

63
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:59,040
 threw his gauntlet as well part of his costume fell off i was like ah amateur hour how embarrassing

64
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:05,120
 get it together kermash that's like god kermit that's where the expression is toss his gauntlet

65
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,320
 with this fastball came from right that's right that's right that's right yeah it's similar to

66
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:17,200
 throw out the baby with the bath water it's the same the same family of sayings uh but it was

67
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:26,240
 crazy like after that day of walking around we were just drenched so much not muting themselves

68
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,920
 oh we got them they're back they're back uh we were just we were funky it was it was gross so yeah

69
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:38,240
 and and like uh you know in vegas there's a whole you know oh you could cook an egg on the sidewalk

70
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:46,000
 or da da da but out in phoenix it's like oh yeah i i can look out the window and see shit melting

71
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,440
 like like the traffic lights are drooping have you seen stuff like that matt oh yeah uh no they

72
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,680
 figured it out they know how hot it is here so nothing's drooping nothing's drooping they know

73
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:06,160
 how to build their their just man it was drooping 20 years ago we went uh we went uh in fact uh we

74
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,120
 finished up the show last night i basically want to finish in time to make sure the kids go swimming

75
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:15,200
 at night this is got oh yeah we got a hotel pool and so uh did you explain that to the audience

76
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:20,400
 as you were rushing through all the tricks just pick up the card already all right we gotta go

77
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:27,040
 we gotta we're going swimming tiktok we're going swimming guys come on panther no panth

78
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:36,640
 uh so uh we uh yeah yeah so we were swimming and even at night uh 10 o'clock at night the

79
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:45,200
 pool was still wicked warm from the day oh yeah uh out here a nice sometimes it's nice sometimes

80
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:57,840
 a nice gooey warm pool for you it just feels it just feels like it feels like pee it does that's

81
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,840
 why i like it but then you let me get that pee pool but then don't get that that that fun thing

82
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,920
 of when you pee in the pool i don't know i just i just want to add to it i just want to feel like

83
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,360
 i'm contributing you're worried about not feeling the contrast of your own pee that's right that's

84
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:25,120
 right i swim for contrast i like my pool to be 98.6 so that when i pee i just have to feel the

85
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,400
 difference in buoyancy would you would that be the only way i can tell would that feel really really

86
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:37,680
 hot it would right yes it'd be yeah 98.6 is nice nice and it's what's real warm it's not a hot tub

87
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:44,880
 it's not hot tub hot yeah my hot tub is at 104 yeah we keep the hot tub at 104 98.6 those it's

88
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:51,120
 it's pretty hot oh we actually dare ourselves to go into the hot tubs of the pool would feel

89
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,720
 cool oh smart so even though it was hot out we went into the hot tub and then then went in the

90
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,800
 pool and then the pool felt refreshing they had the hot tub on they did they did wow that is

91
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:12,240
 that is surprising i agree in august in arizona it seems like a waste well it's 110 let's fire

92
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,800
 up yeah hey some people still have bad backs you know all right you do you you do you

93
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:25,120
 i do i do sit in my hot tub because of my uh because of my bad back so i i do get it a little

94
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,720
 bit yeah exactly exactly i did see a fella trying to beat the heat on the las vegas strip the other

95
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,920
 day during during my walk i don't remember i told you guys about this guy i don't think i did though

96
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:42,480
 uh he was wearing uh no shoes like i started at the bottom with him and worked my way up just just

97
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:49,280
 observing this person he was wearing no shoes and uh mismatched ankle socks and uh he was wearing

98
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:58,400
 a pair of super mario brothers boxer briefs uh it in lieu of pants uh i haven't told you guys about

99
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,280
 this guy right no but i'm just all so far all paul heard was super mario brothers and he was like

100
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:10,880
 yay i'm wearing this shirt paul is currently matching this person that's right i got my crocs

101
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,400
 on well you're already beating him then because he did not have shoes okay he was wearing he's

102
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,360
 wearing socks he was not wearing pants he was wearing a pair of super mario brothers uh boxer

103
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,600
 briefs he was wearing a tank top with uh one arm he had one of his arms through the head hole of

104
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,160
 the tank top so he's wearing a tank top but it was like an off the shoulder number it was kind

105
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,200
 of kind of nice don't think he was having a day he was just he was punching bricks left and right

106
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,400
 hoping a mushroom would pop out of the top of it you have no idea how right you are matt donnelly

107
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:54,000
 because on his left hand he was wearing one blue boxing glove stop it i'm 100 socks no shoes no

108
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,040
 pants super mario brothers underwear tank top with his hand through the arm or through the through the

109
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:07,680
 head hole and then a boxing glove scali wall says so a 10 p.m walmart sharper yeah yeah basically

110
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:15,520
 that's this was this was at about six p.m walking down the las vegas strip six and i'll tell you

111
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:24,880
 what six p.m and you know how when you are walking near a person who is um let's say has different

112
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:32,000
 sensibilities than than the average average people i mean they're high maybe they're high maybe they're

113
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,360
 homeless maybe they're a little off kilter maybe all of these things like you you see these people

114
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,480
 walking and and you kind of you kind of clock them and because they they have kind of a manner

115
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:49,040
 about them that that suggests even without the clothing uh it suggests that they are a little uh

116
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:55,520
 a little off maybe maybe they're not entirely based in reality yeah beating beating their own drum

117
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:01,600
 there you go that one of the most disconcerting things about this man is he was walking along

118
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:08,720
 seemingly just fine if it weren't for his appearance the manner that he was walking he

119
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,000
 was walking as though he had somewhere to be he wasn't in a terrible hurry but he was walking with

120
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,960
 some purpose just heading down the street i think i know what happened possible i think i know what was a

121
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:25,280
 refugee from a mr beast contest oh that's possible matt now matt what's your theory that is possible i

122
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:32,240
 was gonna say i think what he happened was he found that invincible star where you go and he just went

123
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,400
 all over the place and then the star ran out and that's what he looked like when the star finished

124
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,440
 and there's like oh he didn't realize how much damage he was doing to himself with the invincibility

125
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:48,080
 exactly even though he was invincible so he was invincible but his his clothes weren't his clothes

126
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:53,040
 were his clothes took a beating yeah he was fine but his clothes really took a beating

127
00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:01,520
 no i think there's a new mr beast coming out tomorrow so i'll see it oh there is a new mr beast

128
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:09,200
 episode coming out all right hot drop we can find out if paul's take is correct look into his sweet

129
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:16,800
 dead eyes and obey that guy's a monster our pal neil fisher just wrote a book on that monster

130
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,240

131
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,880

132
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:33,120
 fascinating yeah mr book oh by the way uh we talked about this this book on the on the show

133
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,040
 several weeks ago if you haven't started reading cults like us by our friend jane borden it is

134
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:46,480
 so fucking good i'm on the audiobook jane reads it it is so good it is so interesting it's so good

135
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,480
 i was watching the news superman and going like oh my gosh like this is the thing that she talks

136
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,280
 about in her book where they like i did the same thing from the puritans they they demonized

137
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:01,040
 intelligence right yes and people who are who are smarter freer thinkers and so glad we're over that

138
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,920
 shit well no she's like you know you think yourself as like you know whatever your policies are if you

139
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,800
 think yourself more than open-minded politics you don't think you're you're bought into this but yet

140
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:17,120
 when she breaks down the like that we just love a rebel a rule breaker right and so and we just

141
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,400
 like oh that part hits home really hard yeah and so you're like oh every character i like in every

142
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,000
 movie and tv is the same thing that i'm hating about the current political climate right and

143
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,680
 everything that we do in movies tv about taking brainiacs and saying they're terrible people that

144
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,960
 should be ostracized and made fun of and taken care of you know and it's like and then free

145
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:45,760
 thinkers are like not being respected we've lost a complete a complete respect for expertise

146
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:54,880
 it adds a layer in that it makes you uh not care about kind of the the current problems yeah because

147
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:01,920
 a strong man you know a hero is coming yeah yeah we've been we've been conditioned to uh just not

148
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,880
 even believe just conditioned to understand that that a hero is going to come along and they're

149
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,400
 going to use some kind of physical violence and they're going to take care of us so i do i do that

150
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,840
 uh yeah so so so jane's book's been with me every time i watch tv or movies or bring a book or

151
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,160
 whatever it is it has legitimately changed the way that i look that's the last thing i'm going to do

152
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:29,600
 watch tv movies then maybe read a book right right but yeah and uh and also it's helping me be a

153
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,520
 better uh better parent and as one of my children listens on but like the idea that we teach

154
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:40,720
 moralistic storytelling just better her point that we teach moralistic storytelling and therefore

155
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,600
 good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people so things go wrong you turn

156
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,280
 in and start hating yourself and blaming yourself versus other cultures that uh teach you know

157
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:56,320
 fortune right like fortune switch both ways things go good things go bad you know you're not in

158
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,640
 control of that and so sometimes life isn't fair but it is consistent right and that it's just going

159
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,320
 to swing both ways no matter who you are no matter where you are it's just going to go you're going

160
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:13,200
 to you're going to live a roller coaster and like that's so much better when uh my kids experience

161
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,800
 something bad and i then want to beat themselves up like it's it's really important so yeah her

162
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:24,080
 book's incredible cults like us yeah pick it up it's great it's very good and it's and it's a very

163
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:31,040
 good read and she does her own uh reading for books on tape so you get to hear her her lovely

164
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:36,160
 her lovely her lovely dulcet tones and i tell you what i tell you one of the uh most fun parts about

165
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:42,240
 listening to her read the book is all of the little asides because she she loves to put the little uh

166
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,760
 little comments in on what she's commenting about yeah so she there's there's a little like uh almost

167
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:54,320
 kind of the office moments where she turns the camera and goes like eh see but it's all her talking

168
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:00,880
 it's kind of great and so listening to her do the asides on the audiobook is pretty fantastic yeah

169
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:07,280
 yeah yeah but yeah and like i said we we she's funny we did improv back in the day she was a

170
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:15,280
 powerhouse improviser at the old ucb so yeah awesome stuff i know she's great so we um we drove down

171
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:22,000
 here to uh to so this is mystique dining but not a traditional location this is a this is a collab

172
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:31,280
 with a fever up productions okay uh and they do kind of pop up stuff and so when i got the address

173
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,560
 of where we were going i pulled into like this you know like vegas has phoenix and vegas stuff

174
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:42,320
 they have very similar uh architecture so in terms of this kind of like sprawling uh kind of almost

175
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,760
 like a warehouse feeling thing where like it's just a bunch of little pods of buildings where

176
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:54,080
 oh yeah you have sweets one through 50 and then the other one's sweets 50 through 80 you know

177
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,200
 whatever right that kind of thing and so pulling i go like there can't there can't be a magic show

178
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,880
 in here like it's not it wasn't like a storefront there was no kind of whatever this is where the

179
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,160
 props for the magic show gets stored and then uh we finally my my uh my son pointed out they found

180
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:18,800
 the logo on the door like no it's there and i was like what oh and then we pull up and uh it's i

181
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,160
 would find out later they're like oh yeah well it used to be a church and i was like that still

182
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:30,240
 doesn't explain it like that still doesn't make it it's a weird spot for a church too exactly it's

183
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,840
 just it doesn't it doesn't mean uh but but you know these are pop-ups right so they're not looking

184
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,440
 for these like you know they're gonna take over a giant theater space so they're not gonna take

185
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,840
 anything big out and so uh makes it kind of cool and so when you do walk in it is like a crazy it's

186
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,360
 own magic trick it is an instant transformation you walk in and it is this ornate beautiful kind

187
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:58,560
 of like uh dragon themed bar and lounge with this with this parlor in the back and this how yeah

188
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:04,880
 really nice uh that's fine performing uh magic parlor so yeah so that part was super cool the

189
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,800
 only problems we couldn't get in uh when we got there and uh oh you weren't uh you weren't cool

190
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:16,800
 enough and it was so hot the guy uh frank this great guy frank was the easy uh opener he's the

191
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:25,120
 close-up magician and uh you know uh helper outer person whatever helper outer person well well he

192
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,400
 he's normally just the close-up magician helps work the bar yeah and uh it turned out our house

193
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:38,720
 manager uh his car broke down and so uh he couldn't couldn't get to the the space his car melted

194
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,280
 so frank's trying to get things open and i i thought frank worked there and all of a sudden

195
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,840
 couldn't get the couldn't get the place open and i was kind of like that's weird uh but he would

196
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,320
 never been in this role before but again it was so hot i went to talk to him he goes no no no he

197
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,400
 weighs me off and he goes back into his car turns on his air conditioning and he points to his phone

198
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:04,080

200
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,280
 to say that frank invited you to sit in his air-conditioned car with him and you can chat

201
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:24,480
 not even i know he's not letting some hot man come in and take his air you crazy he's on this

208
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:14,640
 out that frank was not uh uh a true staff person but just a magician is he is he is like he's getting

230
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,440
 has been reading this and telling me all about it it is the hot shit right now murderland you

231
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,240
 guys know about this one i've heard of this yeah so murder land is the hot business right now

232
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:11,280
 so this is a book this is all about how uh in the uh 60s and 70s the uh oil corporations put

233
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:18,800
 additives in the gas that they knew were poisoning us uh and lead and all that kind of thing mostly

234
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:25,120
 lead and the smelting uh places that were processing lead uh were poisoning everyone

235
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:33,840
 around the smelting area and uh how basically you can trace like people like ted bundy uh and other

236
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:42,560
 serial killers to a certain radius of where these places were seriously seriously and also and just

237
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:49,920
 in general how a generation got poisoned by these uh gasoline additives that they knew were poisoning

238
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,680
 people because i've i've heard because i never understood unleaded gas growing up as a kid right

239
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:59,920
 i just heard about the gasoline yeah right uh i oh it was i forget what podcast i was listening to

240
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:07,040
 but i never heard the correlation perhaps not causation perhaps causation who knows of violence

241
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:13,280
 to let uh basically that like because basically we hear stories of our generation of men older

242
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:18,560
 than us right who would tales of just getting into fist fights right like it became like a trope in

243
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:23,120
 every movie we see you go to a bar somebody just pokes your chest and boom you get into a fist fight

244
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,160
 and i just remember growing up being like that happened so little as a bartender like so little

245
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:36,480
 and then i didn't know that uh people uh some people think that the lead in gas was actually

246
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,160
 why we were so violent yes right and and it was like your president super star mcscoops a lot in

247
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:47,040
 the chat is is pointing out paint as well yeah it was every all the paint stuff and it was paint

248
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:51,920
 everywhere was all lead paint it was so dumb because the reason they put it in the gas there

249
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:56,480
 was a decrease in violence with the with the unleading of gas oh yeah well and there was also

250
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,920
 an increase in iq just in general like it just dumbed the whole generation down and here's the

251
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:12,160
 worst thing uh our generation actually got secondhand damage because folks like us who

252
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:20,480
 were born in the 70s uh our mothers had been exposed to this stuff and it turns out that

253
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:31,040
 babies in the womb absorb uh calcium they look for calcium from the mother right and in the taking

254
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:37,360
 of the calcium to not me i looked for booze to build those baby bones well besides booze in here

255
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,920
 lady you look for the booze and the calcium those are the two main things so you're looking for

256
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:47,680
 alcohol and you're looking for calcium but when thank you i feel seen when that fetus is calcium

257
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:53,680
 the glory are yours now and forever amen amen but that baby is building its body up

258
00:27:53,680 --> 00:28:03,760
 from lead infused calcium deposits and it's basically fucking up the the the fetus and it's

259
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:12,640
 like you know i i don't have to wonder too hard about my hip you know basically turning into mush

260
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:19,680
 after a couple years you know and i i don't know if you guys i i haven't your mom was a huge paint

261
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:24,480
 drinker right well no i but i i i think i've mentioned to you guys before i had back when

262
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,760
 i was a kid i had straight up force gump leg braces for a long time when i was a little kid

263
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:37,760
 yes yeah oh yeah i was very pigeon-toed in my leg just recently my my brother found some old home

264
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:47,040
 videos of me walking around as a baby i am the gimpiest motherfucker ever seen i mean i had really

265
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:53,600
 deformed ass legs and hips and shit i'm like fuck man no wonder my stuff is broken down no wonder i

266
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,880
 was in such terrible pain also no wonder that they gave you those braces and kind of fixed you like

267
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,200
 the hip thing didn't happen till later in life and we didn't know you as a gippy person so we have to

268
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,840
 also give some credit where credit is due that they addressed it there was some there was some

269
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:14,240
 addressing but also but clearly one leg was longer than the other and that's part of what the hip

270
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:19,440
 thing was all about and a bunch of stuff but but yeah and that just makes me sad knowing that it's

271
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,360
 quite likely that some of that was due to environmental uh lack of environmental protections

272
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,560
 oh that little baby the demonizing of breastfeeding and moving up into formula then right that kind of

273
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:35,680
 thing too yeah go back and then all sudden formula is evil yes other stuff and you know whatever i

274
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:41,600
 mean people don't remember when i was when i was a baby my mom my mom was actually encouraged they

275
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,000
 said yo breastfeed breastfeed your baby and everything so she would she breastfed me uh but

276
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:53,280
 she would smoke leaded cigarettes while breastfeeding me because that's that's simply what her doctor

277
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:59,040
 recommended that she do she would add lead to unfiltered barbara cigarettes and she would just

278
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:03,200
 smoke those if anyone's stink guy for breastfeeding she'd go punch him right in the face she didn't

279
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:11,520
 care she just no no no like of course like our our our system of whether we do or don't care of

280
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:18,400
 healthy products and how that affects our physical health i get it is strange to me the idea like i

281
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:25,360
 think of getting in fights feisty cuffs yeah right as an emotional thing not a not a physical thing

282
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,080
 do you know what i mean like i think it's weird oh i do yeah i see what you mean that's that's the

283
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,280
 distinction i find strange is that like i'm pumping gas and something i go like what'd you say

284
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:41,360
 what'd you say man like this is what i find strange is that like like we were getting into

285
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:47,120
 fisticuffs more that's why we got an electric car so i i wouldn't have to get in as many fights

286
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:54,400
 i just my body just can't take it anymore i'm getting older matt i just can't fight twice a

287
00:30:54,400 --> 00:31:01,120
 week every week i need recovery time i do you need me to fight once every two weeks i'm there

288
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,600
 but this is the frequency at least for another 10 years i've got i've got to fight a week in me

289
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:15,600
 yeah i find it i find it strange um well i will say on the positive side of nature is healing

290
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:24,160
 perhaps somewhat uh and and i last week went to a flower festival this is the freedom farms flower

291
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:30,320
 festival this is the hippiest bullshit i've ever heard of in my life well i don't know how hippie

292
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,520
 i guess it's kind of hippie no no no jacob you get in one autobahn society and you have to go

293
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,880
 to these events is that what it is they're keeping score right oh you didn't go to that flower

294
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,480
 festival i thought you were a member of the autobahn society i was a little trepidatious

295
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:53,200
 because it was freedom farms and anytime anything comes with the moniker of freedom or liberty or

296
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:59,840
 anything like that my alarm bells just go off because as we all know whenever a bill is passed

297
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:05,520
 in this country that's something like the child protection and free cotton candy act it explicitly

298
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:10,800
 somewhere in the bill states all children under 13 should be executed and cotton candy should be

299
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,600
 banned right it's like it's always the opposite of what they're saying in these after this recording

300
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,480
 i'm taking my kids to cracker barrel for breakfast good good i just found out they're they just put

301
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:26,880
 legislation to rename it america barrel america barrel yeah okay i just thought they were going

302
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,720
 to rename it to a white people barrel just barrel just better it's always just been a barrel why do

303
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:42,160
 we have to qualify for who eats there i mean honky barrel kind of rolls off the tongue right we can

304
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:48,160
 work with hunky barrel definitely it's a self-selecting sample already oh it's so i i mean i do love that

305
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:55,840
 food um hunky barrel was my uh college band we were hunky barrel it's open for hootie yeah yeah

306
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,440
 yeah after we won the battle of the bands we got to open for hootie you know honky barrel is what

307
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,920
 bozo the clown used to call those little cups that you'd throw the ping-pong ball into and if you get

308
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:16,560
 up to 13 you win the prize the big prize yeah uh so you went you went to okay uh it's a flower

309
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:25,040
 festival uh freedom farms flower festival yes whoa the f the classic fff yep uh the quad f

310
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:33,280
 fantastic four uh whose idea was this you are ants i'll give you i'll give you three guesses

311
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:42,400
 and the first two do not count so it was paul's idea it was ants but paul was a target on instagram

312
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:50,160
 and honey look at this what's your shoes on quick it's a flower festival holy shit in the middle in

313
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:59,120
 the dead middle of summer one of the hottest days let's fucking go calm down for five for

314
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:14,160
 for flower for festival for four flower festival anyway it was cute it was kind of cool um

315
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:23,760
 you drive up it was adorable it was adorable it was pretty adorable so we went on the first day

316
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:31,600
 so we got good pickings because this is the thing they have rows and rows of flowers

317
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:38,400
 just growing out there and you can just go and pick flowers as many as you want

318
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:45,280
 20 bucks get all the flowers you want all the flowers you can eat within reason all the flowers

319
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,760
 you can eat there were sunflowers so i suppose you could eat some of that they say this is one of the

320
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:56,880
 last all you can pick uh uh flower festivals most of them are retro you know going retro and they're

321
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:02,320
 becoming uh flower halls they're they're representing the flower halls that was a really

322
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:08,560
 clumsily constructed joke about las vegas uh getting rid of all the buffets and replacing

323
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:15,680
 them with food halls um oh oh i was spelling it h-a-u-l that's what i was thinking too flower

324
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:24,800
 hall i'm gonna uh i'm gonna go to cracker bell i'll see you guys all right matt's gone uh so

325
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:32,160
 you get on a little tractor and it's got they've got it it's fancy like the tractors pull in these

326
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:39,600
 fancy people wagons it would be a really cool little hayride kind of thing so we do to do to

327
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:45,360
 do up to the up to the place and up top they've got like i said rows and rows of flowers that you

328
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:51,600
 can just go through and pick and then they had some live music playing they had farm animals you

329
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:58,320
 could go and check out they had some food places they had really good barbecue pardon me barbecue

330
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:06,320
 and um like crafts we bought the barbecue place who's i'm trying to figure out who's got the

331
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,440
 friendship where they figured out how to how to like you know this you know what this flower

332
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:17,440
 festival needs some barbecue it was called effing good barbecue oh good the f also they stuck with

333
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:26,240
 the f they stuck with the f-f effing good barbecue and their mascot is a like looks looks basically

334
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:36,560
 like a wild boar as the grim reaper so by way of my understanding this and a reaper boar this pig

335
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:48,480
 reaper god is slaughtering his brethren to provide us with with hog meat for eating which i'm cool

336
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,600
 with i think there's something there's something interesting in there with like oh wow this shit

337
00:36:53,600 --> 00:37:00,240
 must be real good this guy knows his pig he is a pig you know even the pigs eat it like you go to

338
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,920
 a cannibal restaurant you want a guy who actually eats there yeah you know i mean you don't want to

339
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:12,880
 just go you know you enjoy those flowers can i interest you in some human ribs exactly well i

340
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:19,200
 don't know are you are you eating them i am oh then yeah if they're good enough for you i want

341
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:26,160
 their damn falling off the bone oh what i mean is like again we are we are we're making fun of the

342
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,920
 almost conflictive nature of this barbecue place being at this flower festival i just want to know

343
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,440
 how that friendship was made like right i don't know i think i think it's a combination of

344
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,560
 proximity that is darren from effing barbecue kind of uh meet cynthia from the flower festival

345
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:48,320
 and go like right oh i'll bring my brisket it that's exact names are frederick and francine

346
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:54,320
 clearly it's a proximity thing i think it's mostly proximity thing because you had that you had like

347
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:01,440
 this really great kettle corn that i got oh okay i do like a good kettle corn holy fuck the best

348
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,760
 kettle corn i've ever had and then to top it all off how much kettle corn do you want when you're

349
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,800
 eating kettle corn do you want like the big the big package of it because i want like a handful of

350
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,640
 it and i'm really happy with about a handful of kettle corn no no no no no but the two bucks you're

351
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,680
 just worried about what kettle waste is that what your concern is i bought the medium there it is

352
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:32,720
 that ranch slunk has got it there the pig grilling out for richard scary uh the uh that's an awesome

353
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:41,360
 image uh the i want i bought the eight dollar medium bag and after i was after i was home eating

354
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:48,880
 this freshly popped stuff i was like i should have bought the giant bag because this is it wasn't

355
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:54,080
 enough this is the best and and i was saving half for ann so i was just like i'm tearing through

356
00:38:54,080 --> 00:39:00,800

438
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:10,160
 all right wow that's that's important yeah people like gas and diesel and stuff and uh we just uh did

439
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:24,560
 a well an expansion for a bio uh fuel so we're taking uh bio uh i feel like uh like like what is

440
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:37,040
 that like facts uh from uh uh uh what do you call uh plants and uh animals oh really oh great great

441
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:48,160
 and make uh jet fuel diesel uh regular gas and uh well does ethanol fit in that is it oh propane

442
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:59,600
 no no no they they had an uh ethanol plant but it wasn't uh didn't make money so they just

443
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:04,240
 ethanol is mainly a u.s thing right does anyone else really do ethanol do any other countries

444
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:10,400
 really do a lot of ethanol we have our we have our uh first primaries in iowa just to make sure

445
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:16,880
 that we keep ethanol as a subsidized thing in america so yeah yeah for some reason we love

446
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,200
 ethanol here that's what they fail to do in sweden they they fail to leverage it politically to make

447
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:29,120
 it that's what it was yeah it's well everything's political but still yeah i understand that iowa is

448
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:35,920
 also going to start being the first primary for sweden that'll be a nice change i'm not sure they're

449
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:49,520
 welcome the swedes famously hate iowa no no we come visit how long how long have you been there

450
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:59,600
 at the company oh well i started my company five and a half years ago okay uh so has a lot changed

451
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:08,160
 in that industry over the last five years well there was a lot of more money made in uh the

452
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:17,120
 in uh carbon uh well fossil fuel uh businesses oh yeah starting from around

453
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:25,600
 yeah corona and going through uh the ukraine thing oh that makes sense sure

454
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:33,920
 so it's uh well pretty much the same through corona uh when i started i got in there in

455
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:45,760
 2019 okay and uh then uh they started the big uh bio refining thing and uh well putting got a bit

456
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:58,160
 too uh grabby and changed the whole world and then the the crude oil market and the the fuel market

457
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:13,040
 bumped a lot so it was like a good uh a good margin was around four or five dollars per barrel

458
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:27,840
 and then it swooped up to 30 got it so they made the refinery made uh around uh so i know i know

459
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:32,240
 there's a language i know there's a language barrier but uh so but i think it's fair to say

460
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:36,960
 you're a fan of pudin and what he's done politically it's helped you out that's what i'm here well

461
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:44,400
 in the same way that you hate uh your home states and everything around you and uh

462
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:53,680
 children your wife and uh parents and you don't have any difficulties coping with your mother

463
00:51:53,680 --> 00:52:00,080
 that's how they say yes in sweden so in that way yes

464
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:10,320
 thank you thank you for coming on scooper and i appreciate it thanks bernard thank you guys i will

465
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:16,800
 try to live up to my the sound of my voice i will i will endeavor to uh to to lose to lose some

466
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:23,760
 foundation who you sound like well you know there was a time there was a time way back in the aughts

467
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:30,800
 that i wasn't i got really focused on my health and i dropped to right at like 205 and that was

468
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:36,720
 the skinny as i've been in a long time that was good took a lot of effort i could do it again

469
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:43,040
 i suppose uh probably should maybe i will now there you go it's a firm maybe all right let's

470
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,920
 take it from here i won't be thinned by scoop fest though you're gonna see big old ball and

471
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:52,240
 scoop fast whenever i talk to other podcasters i always say the mistake that i've made over like

472
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:57,280
 the whatever we've been doing this for like 12 years or whatever definitely school 13 years 14

473
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:02,720
 years whatever is like uh basically you tend to only hear from the people who complain about little

474
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:07,840
 things you don't know when sure no one ever just takes time to write like enjoy today's pod signing

475
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:11,600
 off in fact one of the cool benefits of doing these new zoom episodes is seeing people laugh

476
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:17,440
 and enjoy it in the chat and that kind of stuff but it's very helpful right uh to it and i always

477
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:24,000
 say what happens is you end up podcasting to those voices you end up talking like you're trying to

478
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,920
 avoid the nitpicking little things that come your way that kind of just bother you throughout the

479
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:36,960
 day right right um and then when i go out and do magic shows i get to run into listeners right and

480
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,080
 i always find that refreshing because then i picture those are the people i'm talking to when

481
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:47,600
 we're doing our podcast right aha i never been picturing a fit swedish dude over a grill with

482
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:51,920
 sausages and carrots that's not something i'm thinking about right you think he's outside our

483
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:58,400
 demographic that is clearly our demo man that is very different things that's all i've been

484
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,760
 picturing the whole time i it would be it would be good if we did right i feel like i find it so

485
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:09,440
 reassuring that we have listeners like beer none uh he can't be the only one so that's great i think

486
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,840
 anytime we have listeners in other countries you know you know wendy's up here she's out in australia

487
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:20,080
 the whole time like we it's so awesome yeah yeah but yet uh a guy i listen to us at his grill in

488
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:24,560
 sweden it's pretty cool to think about as a podcaster it's what i love about our international

489
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:33,200
 listeners is that we get to have them tell us how bad it looks from the outside and get to empathize

490
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:39,280
 with what we're going through as a country which is nice uh and and and they still listen to us and

491
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:44,800
 they realize that we are stuck here with this bullshit game that's being played yes thank you

492
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:51,600
 uh thank you bassie we support you uh yeah no it's uh it's reassuring to have uh outside uh of the

493
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:59,440
 state's uh listeners as well i'll tell you who only pictures fit swedish men grilling oh and

494
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:06,160

502
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:59,120
 together oh all the time we go in our backyard here with our fake grass i gotta say you know

503
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:06,240
 ann has made a list of things for us to do around pa and she does come up with these things like the

504
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:11,680
 the flower festival and that kind of thing and i can be a little bit of a curmudgeon from time to

505
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,760
 time but i'm trying to break myself for that a little bit more and just okay go for these things

506
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:20,800
 and do it and i almost always enjoy myself and i really i did enjoy myself at the flower festival

507
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:27,120
 no lie so your wife takes you to flower festivals uh my wife proposes that i do things uh at the

508
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:37,200
 house uh my wife adds on honey do lists so uh we yeah we had a guy coming out the other day

509
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:42,080
 yesterday as we're recording uh had a guy coming yesterday to uh to look at part of the backyard

510
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:48,080
 to put some new fake grass in some additional fake grass in to to our yard and right before

511
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:55,840
 he gets here sj announces that she has a new idea for part of the backyard and it affects part of

512
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:01,680
 the grass but it affects part of the fake grass because uh where she's talking about it's kind

513
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:06,960
 of takes up the same space and i want to know if uh if your spouses have uh ever asked you for

514
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:14,000
 something like this my wife looked at our backyard and said do you know what we need in our backyard

515
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,120
 and i think we can put it right in this area right over here she motioned towards uh towards an area

516
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:31,360
 uh she said i think that we need a stage a stage my wife is proposing that i build us a stage

517
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:41,120
 in my backyard wow and i'm kind of along for it so can i make an added suggestion go ahead you might

518
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:48,240
 as well i'm already building a fucking stage in my backyard can i recommend that the stage double

519
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:56,160
 as a gazebo you can recommend that sure and the guy goes to one flower festival

520
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:01,600
 and he's suggesting you add a gazebo to your backyard he learned the word gazebo make the

521
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:10,080
 gazebo the stage you know have a have a pergola roof on the gazebo uh-huh so that it's some some

522
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:15,520
 shade uh-huh you can maybe string lights up there at night yeah yeah we could do that i could just

523
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,840
 see a band playing inside the gazebo let me ask you this have you ever been asked to perform inside

524
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:26,720
 a gazebo as a stage uh yeah so have i it sucks it sucks at the stage because those are terrible

525
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:32,720
 stages yeah it's theater in the realm but it's not really we're not going to be watching everyone

526
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:38,800
 to watch you through a fence it's like every every shows a neighbor across across the way i'm not

527
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:44,080
 saying the gazebo has to be a traditionally built gazebo you could just make the roof connected by

528
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:51,520
 like five main tiles oh a non-traditional gazebo yeah more like a stage jacob more like a traditional

529
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:57,280
 a non-traditional gazebo more think more stagey this is not you will this is not your mother's

530
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:04,080
 gazebo this is not your mother's gazebo no no that gazebo would be a terrible stage

531
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:13,680
 paul's non-traditional gazebo however i might write that you do have a very uh elite barbecue

532
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:18,800
 every so often in your backyard so a stage makes sense for your backyard uh no a stage is not the

533
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:24,480
 dumbest idea that has ever been proposed for my backyard i think we're going to do it where are

534
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:30,400
 you going to do it well i that's part of i think that last night i was i was taking a stroll last

535
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:35,360
 night sj was in california on a gig so i was at home last night by myself and so i took a little

536
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:41,920
 stroll and i think i i think i've given an a plus note to where uh sj was talking about having it

537
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:46,960
 oh because she was talking about having kind of in the back of the backyard yeah and i i think

538
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:51,760
 we're kind of going to kind of move it over to the side a little bit and uh you know the rock river

539
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:57,760
 yeah i think it's going to cover part of the rock river i think it's going to be over the top of

540
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,400
 that rock river so when water flows through it it'll flow out from underneath the bottom of this

541
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:07,840
 stage that's pretty cool give it more of a gazebo vibe yeah i'll give it more of a gazebo vibe sure

542
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:13,840
 a non-traditional a non-traditional gazebo a river doesn't run through a traditional gazebo already

543
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:18,000
 either of you have either of you ever really wanted something for your backyard

544
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,360
 like what i'm laughing because literally my wife and i were in the middle of having like a very

545
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:29,360
 serious not a serious discussion like uh like we were just having a deep conversation and she just

546
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:32,400
 looked at the backyard and immediately changed the subject to something she wanted to change in the

547
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:38,000
 backyard and i was like we're really just switching gears all my wife does is one of us we've actually

548
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,240
 already we actually have you've got a lot of work on that backyard i was gonna say jake you haven't

549
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,520
 been over in a while but if you would you wouldn't you actually would be surprised in our backyard

550
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:50,880
 right now it's we've had so much done back there oh nice uh so matt can i ask you about works two

551
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,360
 full-time jobs she decides to get them some things changed in the backyard can i ask you matt about

552
01:00:55,360 --> 01:01:00,960
 your uh your backyard is this too sensitive a topic from the uh fourth of july i know there was a fake

553
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:12,800
 grass incident what's what's what's the status uh i i so this is a sensitive topic i know

554
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:24,560
 keeler's weighing in yeah so uh we had everybody over the fourth of july you know all the things

555
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:30,320
 that we were buying for our kit uh for for our backyard we bought a new fire pit because the

556
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:36,560
 the the chiminea that jacob delightfully lent us so many years ago uh has been destroyed by the sun

557

561
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:07,520
 and then the kids wanted s'mores on fourth of july so i quickly built the fire pit i put it

562
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:12,800
 together right this is after i put together all the new furniture in the backyard in 40 hours before

565
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:31,440
 hurt for days but yeah all the furniture he uh they built so much furniture on those on those

566
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:36,720
 the days before fourth of july when i came over to matt's the entire the entire living room was

567
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:44,640
 covered in these uh seating uh pillows that were expanding he left them out expanding but also matt

568
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:49,760
 had all brand new wood flooring throughout the house yes so i came in and the first thing i said

569
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:53,680
 is oh this looks really nice and he's like fuck you i'm like what are you talking about

570
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:58,640
 i really like your floors making fun of my pillows all over the front cover

571
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:04,880
 he's like eat shit maddingly i'm trying to make a nice backyard go fuck yourself i don't care about

572
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,200
 your messy thing i'm talking about your nice new floors

573
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:18,160
 so uh i built the gym and they uh uh built the fire pit um and you're saying build it you're

574
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:23,360
 talking about like one of those fire dish things yeah it's on a little stand and yeah giant black

575
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:29,600
 bowl with a screen with a screen on top of it and so we we built it so the kids made s'mores in the

576
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:36,000
 front yard and then and then the party's over so we're trying to wrap it up and so uh keeler got

577
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:42,720
 a water gun we started spraying out the fire they started smoking like crazy and then i'm trying to

578
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:48,080
 put everything away and then i have all these neighbors that come by and the user uh with their

579
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:53,200
 dogs and use our front yard as a toilet uh-huh and so uh i was walking around cleaning stuff up

580
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:57,920
 and someone to be clear the dogs are using your yard as a toilet not the neighbors i don't want

581
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:04,560
 to be that clear i don't know okay okay i don't know so i uh the woman is oh good i'm glad you're

582
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:09,280
 out here i saw that smoke and i was like oh people are making a big deal about this smoking fire

583
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,720
 thing so i move it into the backyard but i don't want to put it too close to the house i don't want

584
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:18,880
 the smoke going up the side of the stucco so i put on the side yard our side yard is fake grass

585
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:25,280
 right and even though we put the fire out the bottom of the fire pit was still a very hot

586
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:31,040
 instrument and even though it has little pegs holding it off the ground it wasn't high enough

587
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:40,320
 off the ground that it didn't melt a square foot patch of fake grass uh to to oh no to hard plastic

588
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:48,720
 ruin and uh my wife was not happy with me about my decision to move the fake fire pit so all again

589
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:53,200
 all i was trying to do is keep everyone happy and what happens bites me in the ass yeah that's right

590
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:58,880
 that's why a lot more interesting that's it basically like can these guys play on a barefoot

591
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:03,360
 or is that a hazard basically i just need to figure that out and so i oh yeah set the children out to

592
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,880
 play like play and if you don't come back to bleeding i don't have to fix that little patch

593
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:12,720
 but if you come back cleaning and grind i do i think you can fix this i think this is i think

594
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:18,720
 you you take a uh an exacto knife or a you know box cutter cut a kind of big square out of this

595
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:23,120
 go get you some new uh fake grass just get some cheap fake grass from like home depot or something

596
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:28,320
 like that you nail it down in there bob's your uncle so this is a good good talk jacob and this

597
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:32,240
 is what i looked up and i said that and i said oh maybe we can fix it and sarah said you can't you

598
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:36,080
 can't fix fake grass like that i said well i just looked up on the internet and the internet says

599
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:41,680
 you can but the internet says all kinds of things yeah i bet you can do it i bet jacob's right

600
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:46,000
 and that was my first incident the internet says that step siblings are fucking each other left and

601
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:55,360
 right i mean there's no evidence to the contrary i just believe evidence for none against yeah uh so

602
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:02,720
 uh will we hope there's also really i can see matt's son on camera right now i i'm uncomfortable

603
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:07,760
 with how quickly he got that joke very quickly yeah this is not i don't like that at all i feel

604
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:13,360
 old now the internet is not a mystery to 11 years old to 11 year old i feel old now i don't like it

605
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:22,320
 so um so the question is the the burnt thing which you can only see when you go up close you

606
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:27,680
 can't really like when you look across there will it looks fine from a distance will the exacto patch

607
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:34,240
 stick out more to my wife's gaze that's the issue you gotta you gotta do some serious color matching

608
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:39,200
 here that's the hard part because it can't possibly because it's been weathered it's been the sun for

609
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:45,920
 years yeah exactly so there's no way we're gonna find an actual matching patch you might have done

610
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:51,840
 the right thing maybe just buy some spray paint is the when they did you put the fake grass down

611
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:55,040
 this is a silly question did you put the fake grass down or did you hire somebody to put the

612
01:06:55,040 --> 01:07:00,400
 fake grass uh go ahead i'll give you three guesses on the first two don't count jacob okay so matt

613
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:07,920
 hired people to put the fake grass down if they did the ground prep under the fake grass yeah it

614
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:13,840
 might be easy to pull that grass up and just put new grass down and and redo the whole thing that's

615
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:17,680
 what i was that is actually what i was thinking it might be it might be pretty easy to do the whole

616
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:23,200
 thing if they did the ground the ground prep yeah they did they did they did the big sand man yeah

617
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:28,000
 all that stuff yeah so yeah i i basically thinking like down the road it's probably like a new patch

618
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:33,440
 of grass is probably like a five to seven hundred dollar expense yeah for that space maybe not even

619
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:38,640
 that much you might be able to just buy some buy some rolls of it at home the whole thing well

620
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:44,800
 matt has kids now his kids are gonna do this sure they can open up a weird hole in the wall factory

621
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:50,240
 magic place they can they can they can roll out the grass yeah i just called the company it was

622
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:54,640
 funny because when we got that installed right before the pandemic right and it's like foolish

623
01:07:54,640 --> 01:08:01,120
 was we're right in the middle of foolish right and i bought a basketball net a recliner and those fake

624
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:07,120
 grass and then all of a sudden we're like oh wait we don't have jobs anymore and i was like wait i

625
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:12,080
 can't afford to hit this stuff yeah we tried to cancel all of it and for the grass company they're

626
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:16,640
 like well we already cut the thing we just haven't installed it so the only thing you save on is labor

627
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:22,640
 no like you're still gonna get charged for the creating of the entire thing right yeah so you

628
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:29,040
 just had to go you know the sand was piled up uh yeah not not put down with bags of sand and i just

629
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:33,520
 was like yeah we just have to eat it we have to be even more we're just doing it now but we have to

630
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:38,000
 finish it out yeah we have already done this now it's it's past tense might as well keep going

631
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,360
 yeah yeah yeah yeah we did that with the uh with our windows we bought new windows for the whole

632
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:51,920
 house ten scoops says just put a garbage can over it oh a terrible idea or just put a fire pit over

633
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:58,400
 it make that the fire pits well i will make this suggestion matt yeah i was asking you guys if you

634
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:04,720
 ever wanted anything in your backyard because i want something in my backyard very much i've always

635
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:09,680
 wanted and i keep oh before paul says that i'll tell you out of the twitch chat that uh fifth

636
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:17,360
 fifth leah maybe i suggest you just put a gazebo over it and there you go so you have your nice

637
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:23,520
 little burn spot gazebo not a traditional gazebo no no no no no i think we're past traditional

638
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:32,560
 gazebo at this point an 18 inch hexagon with lattice work in a roof it would be like look

639
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,720
 we put a stage in too it would look like an 1800s phone booth

640
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:46,400
 you could put in a phone booth you could just set a phone booth right there at your side yard

641
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:53,040
 canadian scoop crystal suggested a wishing well that's not a bad idea oh yeah yeah uh which

642
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:57,520
 reminds me of that hilarious mr show sketch about the wishing well which is if you haven't

643
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:05,120
 seen it scams and flams uh no i have always wanted i keep giving and the guff i want a chinese

644
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:13,040
 bridge in our backyard the kind that has a really big arc you know okay yeah that's what i want

645
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:21,840
 and she's always giving me guff sorry colin colin sadler either either went to ai or there do sell

646
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:28,000
 children's gazebos but it just put a follow-up of a mini children's gazebo that's very funny looking

647
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:35,760
 oh it's a sandbox a gazebo sandbox yeah funny that is what you would call not your traditional

648
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:42,400
 gazebo and jake the sandbox was my wrestling name i would say uh matt if you didn't have

649
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:47,200
 cats that might be a good idea but that's gonna just become a big old poopoo hole we used to have

650
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:50,880
 sand in our backyard and we had to get rid of it because it did become a cat poopoo hole yep

651
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,000
 that's the hopefully it was just cats cats like to poop in sand it turns out

652
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:02,320
 oh where would you put your bridge in your backyard well so again like it opens up the pandora's box

653
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:08,800
 of needing a water feature kind of thing which we don't have and that would be a lot not impossible

654
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:13,360
 how would this affect ann's ranking in the autobahn society they would probably take it up it would

655
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:17,680
 take it up a little notch because uh a bigger water feature is something that she could add

656
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:22,560
 honestly though she's knocking it out of the park the only thing that they had against her was it

657
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:29,120
 wasn't quite big enough she needed 800 more square feet of habitat which she could do if we just

658
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:34,800
 trick out the front yard with bushes and shit you should trick out the front yard with troubled

659
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:41,120
 water and that way you can make a chinese bridge over troubled water like a chinese bridge over

660
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:48,000
 troubled water oh that's so much better than i was afraid i was afraid that he was gonna do it in a

661
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,120
 chinese accent i just did bridge over troubled water that's all i did i said dim sum yeah i did

662
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:58,400
 do the chinese accent i'm thrilled we've progressed as a as a podcast as a people right i mean we're

663
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:04,400
 growing um you just put the bridge over a flower field that's exactly right that's

664
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:14,560
 flowers over there no instead of water make donuts next to them instead of water you put

665
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:21,920
 flowers and make the flowers look like a flowing flower uh water thing kind of yeah so that's

666
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:26,160
 thank you keeler that is exactly what we were uh considering and we still might at some point

667
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:32,000
 uh we'll see but yeah that's the that's my dream is to have a chinese bridge and ann's just like

668
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:38,160
 we don't need a fucking chinese bridge but i'm like i want one is she okay with other nationalities

669
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:47,040
 a bridge oddly oddly she got really angry when i suggested a spanish bridge the other time

670
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:55,120
 like she got mad i have always suspected that ann is racist towards the people of spain is going on

671
01:12:55,120 --> 01:13:02,320
 uh no no not at all uh who knows um you know she's got some cool water features she's got

672
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:06,720
 some really nice little fountains and stuff we might do a bigger one uh we'll see we'll see

673
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:15,040
 all right well good luck with your spanish tiled chinese bridge over over veroma's waters of her

674
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:22,080
 troubled flowers like a bridge over troubled flowers you know let's do a little jock versus

675
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:32,800
 nerd and he's right your wife is a bridges ladies and gentlemen it is time it's simply a bridge too

676
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:53,520
 far for her oh hey flowers i have a revelation that came straight from ann that you and the

677
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:59,680
 scoops may be interested in a revelation to paul she listens to the podcast religiously

678
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:06,880
 she listens to every episode she just informed me that sometimes she has to fast forward my

679
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:17,040
 commercials if they're gross she says i'm doing gross jokes sometimes she has to fast forward

680
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:23,680
 it because it makes her gross out so checks out well you're good yourself you couldn't pay my

681
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:29,760
 wife to listen to the show so still no i know i i mean i i'm so i i thanked her again i was i i i

682
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:36,320
 don't mind i get it as i say you know who you married and you know the jokes the kind of jokes

683
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:40,880
 in the sense of humor she's like i know but sometimes you get really gross on those those

684
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:46,000
 commercials and i just have to fast forward a little bit and i'm like okay my every now and

685
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:51,520
 then my wife will listen to the show it is it is rare i mean it's she's in the same boat as matt's

686
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:58,000

687
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:05,920
 like she showed up to scoop fest last year in a in a costume i was like what how did you do this

688
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:11,760
 oh my gosh yeah and he's right think of the sponsors what about the sponsors paul

689
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:16,400
 think about them do they happy with their gross portrayal of course they are they paid for the

690
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:22,240
 gross stuff they pay for that foul stuff all right that's what they come we got a scooper to come

691
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:30,400

01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:51,600
 crimea to be really sure about this answer does the country of crimea own things like like a

727
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:29,040
 with you have negative 1600 i'll go with jupiter saturn uranus for 2000 all right in mythology this

728
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:38,080
 god was both the son and the husband kinky of gaia is it jupiter saturn or uranus oh i don't think it

729
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:47,200
 was uranus you don't think so wait now that i now that i pronounce it the right way it might be that

730
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:56,960
 jupiter is a jupiter is the god i know reference a lot in shakespeare and stuff okay saturn jupiter

731
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:04,400
 is the roman counterpart of zeus yeah jupiter of course famously where girls go to get more stupider

732
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:14,400
 right and saturn sets the pattern yeah uh my gut was to go and uranus is inflamed i'm gonna go with

733
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:22,160
 jupiter okay okay let's see it is often it's uranus ah it was it was always uranus matt

734
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:35,440
 paul you put uranus on the line uh i'll try jupiter saturn uranus for 800 boy we're all

735
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:40,080
 steering away from the oprah category this planet has the second largest moon titan in the solar

736
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:53,040
 system is that jupiter saturn or uranus uh this plan i think that's a saturn moon titan you think

737
01:21:53,040 --> 01:22:01,440
 it's saturn it is saturn hey look all right to me i'll close out uranus for 1200

738
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:10,960
 in mythology this god was the parent of pluto is that jupiter saturn or uranus

739
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:22,480
 uh let's see pluto is hades right i thought hades and zeus were brothers

740
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:34,480
 well if that i thought hey then jupiter but i also but isn't because Poseidon is saturn and zeus and

741
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:40,800
 jupiter Poseidon were also brothers and jupiter is zeus right and jupiter is zeus

742
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:51,360
 so i think i guess it's uranus i'll say uranus that's jupiter oh man adam fuck it

743
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:59,440
 i thought paul's running away with us and not in the usual way not because we loaded up our nerd

744
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:05,360
 questions and he's crushing it but uh jacob and i have buried ourselves in this one yeah yeah uh

745
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:11,040
 matt you're up fucking uh oprah excuse me i'm cursing for my kids that's how you know how much

746
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:20,480
 i'm enjoying this right now um let's do witch prince for 2000 which all right has a ba in

747
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:25,360
 geography at the university of saint andrews is that prince andrew prince william or prince

748
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:32,720
 this is the first one where i've sincerely felt like it could be any of the three

749
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:37,280
 yes exactly it could be it could be i mean uh

750
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:45,280
 saint andrews of course in ireland i'll go with uh prince william good guess all right

751
01:23:46,960 --> 01:24:01,920
 it's prince william i'll try some oprah copra oprah all right this person was born in january

752
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:17,040
 1954 is it oprah winfrey deep pop chopra or oprah or uh oprah or an oprah uh oprah born in 54 probably

753
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:29,680
 uh i don't know for sure though i'll pass uh let's see that passes to uh me oh shit uh i have no idea

754
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:41,360
 but i have to guess anyway i will say that that was uh deep pop deepbox oprah it's oprah when it

755
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:52,240
 was oprah now i'm just getting more buried it's me i'll uh which prince 1200 daily double good

756
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:56,640
 that's what i need to get me in less negative points what i was quoted as saying the internet

757
01:24:56,640 --> 01:25:04,640
 is completely over in 2010 was that prince andrew prince william or prince oh again this two of these

758
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:14,320
 is very possible yeah i'd be really surprised if it was prince william uh boy i kind of think it

759
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:24,240
 was prince i'm going prince yeah it was prince yeah uh matt you got uh oprah for 812 or 2000

760
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:31,360
 the only way i can get into positive points is 2000 yes that is true okay all right don't blow it

761
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:38,880
 this person launched virgin comics in 2006 with richer with richard branson is it oprah winfrey

762
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:49,520
 deep pop chopra or an oprah why these all feel like the wrong answer yeah right i don't see a

763
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:55,200
 comp a comics company i don't see oprah doing that but i certainly don't see deep away deep pack

764
01:25:55,200 --> 01:26:02,480
 chopra comics yeah might make sense because it's like a deep thing uh i'll go i'll go with deep

765
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:11,920
 pack chopra okay it is yeah yeah yeah all right man listen to his son and didn't screw it up

766
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:21,360
 oh you got 800 or 1200 either way paul's gonna win good uh i'll try the 1200 then why not this

767
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:26,320
 person was sued for copyright infringement for a book they wrote in 1993 is that oprah deepak or

768
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:37,200

769
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:48,560
