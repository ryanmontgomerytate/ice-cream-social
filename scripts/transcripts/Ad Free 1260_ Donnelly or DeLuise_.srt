1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,900
 Oh hello there, I am so happy you're here, because I want to thank the ice cream truck

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,900
 drivers.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,160
 Thank you so much ice cream truck drivers, it's a new month, I don't have a new list

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,120
 just yet, but we will thank each and every ice cream truck driver before the show, this

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,160
 month, we'll do it this month, we're gonna get it done, it's all gonna get done people,

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,160
 nobody panic.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,800
 In the meantime, if you want to become an ice cream truck driver, head over to preachingfun.com,

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,000
 it's where you can go to sign up to be an ice cream truck driver, and who knows, the

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:44,880
 life you save may be your own, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh baby this is what I like, hey Johnny,

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:51,440
 do you want to go to an ice cream social, yeah I'd love to, great let's go, that song

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:01:03,440
 is not a joke, none of that stuff, none of those old 50 poppy songs, I was just listening

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:11,000
 to one this morning, Splish Splash, it's basically you're arrested on a list for life, oh yeah,

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 yeah.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 It's time for Matt Maddly's ice cream social, sitting at the bathtub, that's Paul Maddly,

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 sitting at a different bathtub, it's Matt Donnelly, and sitting in the shower, it's

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 me, Jacob the Audio Guy, we're preaching fun.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Yeah.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Splish Splash.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,840
 I jump back in the bath, how was, I don't know, there was a party going on, it's so

20
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:37,320
 strange, they didn't have headphones back then, what kind of, what kind of quiet ass

21
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,720
 weird party is happening outside your bathroom that you can't hear it, and you come out with

22
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,120
 a towel, and he had a towel on, he claims, and then he's like, I mean, I think the answer

23
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,840
 to your question, Paul, is Swinger Party, I think a Swinger Party is going on outside

24
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
 his bathroom door.

25
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,840
 Is that what it's about?

26
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,840
 There's an orgy.

27
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,840
 I'm thinking that right now.

28
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,240
 There's an orgy happening, and he's like, oh god.

29
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,200
 Yeah, a whole orgy.

30
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,400
 A very, very quiet orgy.

31
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,560
 'Cause my boner is going crazy.

32
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,520
 There are 18 different, no, 19 different people having sex out here very quietly.

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,880
 There's one odd man getting double digits.

34
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,880
 Oh, that guy is a good sport.

35
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,880
 Yeah.

36
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,880
 Look at him go.

37
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,880
 They turned him into a bowling ball.

38
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,880
 Oh, that's nice.

39
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,880
 Oh, that was a spare.

40
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,880
 How you doing, Matt?

41
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,880
 Where are you?

42
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,880
 Good.

43
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:37,880
 I'm still in San Antonio, and we received some feedback that my audio is super weird

44
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,880
 and bad.

45
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:45,600
 One, this is addressable, definitely going forward.

46
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,360
 I have traveled with a directional microphone before, it's just I traveled with so much

47
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,680
 stuff that I was like, oh, if I could just take a room recorder with me, that's easier.

48
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,720
 But we're going to go ahead and call that experiment failed.

49
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,040
 But we're going to keep the recorder, and I think what we're going to do is do it.

50
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,040
 This is just a good, here you go.

51
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:20,980
 We're going to do like a headset mic or something like that into Matt's recorder so that he's

52
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,760
 only going to carry, there's going to be a small additional thing to carry when he's

53
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,760
 on the road.

54
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,760
 Yeah.

55
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,560
 This is something that we were going to address anyway, and then some people said something

56
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,560
 about it as well.

57
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
 And so, yeah, here we are.

58
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,160
 Would you like like an airplane pilot headset?

59
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,960
 Why not get him the cans that have the mic coming off of it?

60
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,960
 Would that work, Jacob?

61
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,960
 Too soon.

62
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
 Too soon.

63
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,960
 Bring up airlines right now, Paul.

64
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,960
 It's just too soon.

65
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,040
 Oh, buddy, are you feeling the crunch?

66
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,560
 I don't know yet because I don't know if San Antonio's airport qualifies as one of the

67
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,480
 top 40 airports in the country.

68
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
 It's only the top 40?

69
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,600
 It's the top 40, but Vegas definitely does, so the airport you're flying into definitely

70
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
 qualifies.

71
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:08,560
 I know, and here's the top 40 airlines in the US coming in at number 40.

72
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,640
 It's STL, St. Louis's own hub of choice.

73
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,920
 That's right.

74
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,720
 And it's getting fucked raw dog style by our own American president.

75
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,200
 If you can fucking call him that, what a ridiculous waste of skin.

76
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:30,120
 All right, let's see how else he can destroy the middle class even further and kill small

77
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:36,680
 business with his fat, stupid thumbs on every goddamn scale in the States.

78
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,680
 What a bitch.

79
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,480
 Dear Casey, my dad used to buy me that popcorn Oprah like the Chicago's O'Hare airport.

80
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,800
 I was wondering if you could play Chicago O'Hare for my dad.

81
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,440
 Here we go.

82
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:59,080
 Coming out at number 39 with no kernels, it's popcorn O'Hare.

83
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,040
 You guys got sending me these dead dog stories.

84
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,720
 I got to read these dead dog stories and then go right into a pop hit.

85
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,520
 Casey, Casey, the mic's still on.

86
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,520
 The mic's still on, Casey.

87
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,080
 Yeah, well, it's going to be on your ass, you fucker.

88
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080
 Fuck you.

89
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,080
 Casey Kasem's gone rogue.

90
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,200
 Look, I'm Bumblebee.

91
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,280
 No, I'm Cliffjumper and Shaggy.

92
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,320
 So eat my shit.

93
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,040
 So Mike in the chat says, I don't know what the airport thing is.

94
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,960
 Because of air traffic controllers being part of the budget for the government, the government

95
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:39,680
 being shut down, the transportation secretary has asked 10% of flights to be canceled and

96
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:48,080
 they're targeting 40 of the top 40 major airports to cancel those flights to decrease air traffic

97
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,760
 since so many air traffic controllers are either quitting or working a second job and

98
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,120
 not calling out because they're not getting paid.

99
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,640
 They're not actively not getting paid.

100
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,640
 Gross.

101
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,760
 It turns out they have bills.

102
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,480
 We have air traffic controllers who listen to the show.

103
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,480
 Yes.

104
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,200
 I know several.

105
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,320
 And my heart goes out to you guys.

106
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,680
 Thank you for all the incredible hard work you do.

107
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:18,480
 Also, goddamn, my old hometown stomping grounds, you see that horrific shit that went down

108
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,480
 in Louisville?

109
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
 Sorry.

110
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,080
 I can't hear you outside of a Casey Kasem voice now.

111
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,280
 I'm now stuck hearing you in Casey Kasem.

112
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:33,040
 Well, friends, it turns out we went back to the bluegrass state and the bluegrass state

113
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:39,920
 is now blue and charred, charred black with the remnants of thousands and thousands of

114
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:46,640
 gallons of gasoline, jet fuel that dispersed all over human and animal alike, killing them

115
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,800
 all in one fell swoop.

116
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,880
 UPS made one special delivery to hell.

117
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,880
 Oh, that that one is what you're talking about.

118
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,880
 Yes.

119
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,880
 I did see that one, Casey.

120
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
 That's what I'm talking about.

121
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,880
 It's a horrific event.

122
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,160
 Casey Kasem is just here to do the horrible news.

123
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,480
 Perhaps it's a little too soon now.

124
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,800
 I guess that's the way you do it.

125
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,920
 Casey Kasem from now on.

126
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,280
 All horrible news is covered by Casey Kasem.

127
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,960
 No, it's it's really sad.

128
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
 A terrible.

129
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
 I know.

130
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
 It's horrible.

131
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,640
 I that that I flew out of that airport to come to Vegas.

132
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,360
 I flew out of there to go to go to the air Chicago.

133
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,080
 That was my one way trip there to Chicago.

134
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,880
 Then to think what there is on the plane, not the airport.

135
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,880
 Right.

136
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,880
 Yes.

137
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,000
 But the airport got fucked and their surrounding areas got full.

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Oh, yeah.

139
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Yeah.

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 It did crash into businesses.

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 That's terrible.

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 It's it's horrific.

143
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Yeah.

144
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 It's really, really scary.

145
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,160
 They basically closed down Louisville for a day because of the noxious fumes and shit.

146
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,320
 Is that what they is that what they're calling the area around your house?

147
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,960
 The area of obnoxious fumes, the area of noxious fumes.

148
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,960
 Yeah.

149
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,280
 Especially if I've had microwave hot dogs.

150
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,280
 That's right.

151
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
 Oh, Jesus.

152
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,080
 Can we close this down for just just a couple more hours because he is about to shut down

153
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,080
 Pittsburgh.

154
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:11,080
 Oh, oh, green cloud trying to kamikaze it just doing doing this service for mankind.

155
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,640
 My guy, my guy has not been happy with late.

156
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
 I will say that.

157
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,720
 I will say that we're climbing and there's a cloud of Paul.

158
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,120
 Yeah, it's terrible.

159
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,640
 So the airline stuff is really awful.

160
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,000
 It's really, really bad.

161
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 And I'm just great.

162
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Oh, yeah.

163
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 No, it's bad.

164
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 I reflect on it.

165
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,440
 And I think how grateful I am that I'm not flying anytime soon.

166
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,080
 But I think there's so many people that are.

167
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,080
 And yeah.

168
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,480
 And then and we we narrowly missed coming into some shit with Scoop Fest.

169
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,980
 And fuck who knows what the next one's going to be like.

170
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,600
 Yeah, we're screwed.

171
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
 I guess we're done.

172
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
 All right.

173
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:52,760
 OK, see you next year, everybody.

174
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,840
 Happier news.

175
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,840
 Happier news.

176
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,840
 OK.

177
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
 Tomorrow.

178
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,840
 Happier news.

179
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,840
 Are you asking for it?

180
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
 No, I've got it.

181
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
 Tomorrow.

182
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:08,840
 Mark's 19 years married to Anne McPheeters for a while.

183
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,840
 How about that?

184
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,840
 Oh, that'll be good.

185
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
 Yep.

186
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
 Tomorrow's our anniversary.

187
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,720
 And of course, she has to work.

188
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,200
 And so so we spent that as we spent together.

189
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
 What?

190
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,880
 That's not how I work my ass.

191
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,760
 She works that ass all the time.

192
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:35,160
 So I want you to guess we took we decided today we were going to do our anniversary.

193
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:42,320
 You will never in a million years guess what we did for our first dog in the Chili's parking

194
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
 lot.

195
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
 You're not that far off.

196
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,120
 Put on put on bee costumes and culled your own honey into jars.

197
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
 Nope.

198
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,120
 OK.

199
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,120
 Shit.

200
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,720
 That was my next guess.

201
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,720
 What is that called?

202
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,720
 What are beekeepers called?

203
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,720
 Beekeepers?

204
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
 No.

205
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,720
 Beekeepers?

206
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,920
 No, there's a what's the hobby called?

207
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,920
 Keeping bees.

208
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
 Apis.

209
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
 That's it.

210
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,920
 Thanks, Leon.

211
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,920
 Apiris.

212
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,920
 Apiris.

213
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,920
 There's an extra syllable there.

214
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,920
 Apiris.

215
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
 Apiris.

216
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,920
 Not rapists.

217
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,920
 No.

218
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
 Not rapists.

219
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,920
 Nope.

220
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
 Yeah.

221
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
 I keep bees.

222
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,920
 I'm a rapist.

223
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,920
 Apiary.

224
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
 It's an apiary.

225
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,920
 That's right.

226
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,920
 A beehive is an apiary.

227
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,920
 So apist.

228
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,920
 I guess.

229
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,920
 I'm the apist here.

230
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,720
 It was called that because an ape invented it.

231
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,680
 Oh, beehive, says Rich Scoop.

232
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
 Good one.

233
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,680
 Bees.

234
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,680
 They're great.

235
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,920
 They're great.

236
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:43,880
 No, we decided earlier this week, really and decided, but I was totally in on the plan

237
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,040
 plan.

238
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,600
 We decided that for our 19th wedding anniversary, we were going to go join Costco.

239
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,960
 Oh man.

240
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:59,200
 I didn't want to cry on today's show, but that's really just...

241
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,200
 Too bad.

242
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
 Too late.

243
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,620
 Here comes the Waterworks.

244
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,880
 Everybody in the chat is weeping openly.

245
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
 Yeah.

246
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:14,840
 Oh Costco, how I love thee.

247
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
 It was...

248
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:26,120
 I love that Paul refuses to talk over his own song.

249
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,840
 He's like, I will not use my own song as an underbed of music.

250
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,160
 We will just sit and listen to it.

251
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,400
 I'm sipping on my Costco Coca-Cola.

252
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,360
 I did get a hot Costco hot dog on the way out.

253
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,360
 We both did.

254
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,360
 We had our dinner.

255
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
 Did you...

256
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
 You ate from one side, she ate from the other, yeah?

257
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
 You guys ate the hot dog until you...

258
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
 Yeah.

259
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,360
 Totally.

260
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,360
 Totally.

261
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,360
 In the middle.

262
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
 Fucking Lady of the Tramp did.

263
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
 Who was who?

264
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,160
 And then you both tried the same with the Costco pizza, but you tapped out halfway through

265
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,800
 because of just the amount of dough in your bellies?

266
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
 We did.

267
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,960
 We did a slice and a dog each, and we both tapped out.

268
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,720
 We were like, okay, this is too much food, but it was really good.

269
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,720
 It took me too...

270
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,720
 As someone with children, I've been a Costco member for some time, it took me too long

271
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,240
 to realize I should never order two slices of pizza from that place.

272
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,720
 Did Matt just freeze?

273
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,520
 He did just freeze.

274
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,640
 Matt just froze in the...

275
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,640
 He's unfrozen now.

276
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,800
 We can see him again now, but he froze in the best pose that he could have possibly

277
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
 frozen in.

278
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
 It was good pose.

279
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,800
 You looked striking.

280
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
 All right.

281
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
 Sorry, we lost you there for a second, Matt.

282
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,120
 You've been a Costco member for a long time.

283
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,120
 The audience heard it.

284
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,280
 They heard your recorder, but we didn't hear it.

285
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,280
 Oh yeah.

286
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,280
 I'll repeat it here.

287
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:46,480
 It took me too long to realize that I shouldn't order two slices of pizza from Costco.

288
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,480
 God no.

289
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,480
 God no.

290
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,400
 I'd be in the middle of that second slice, be like, what have I done?

291
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
 Just like the whole...

292
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
 Why do I do this?

293
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
 The whole world becomes slow motion.

294
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,320
 It's almost a quarter of a pizza.

295
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,320
 Yeah.

296
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,320
 It's a ridiculous thing.

297
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,960
 What happens at leaving food on your plate at a restaurant or something?

298
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:08,480
 I'm only just now in my life getting to where I'm able to really do it and be comfortable

299
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
 with it.

300
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,480
 Yeah.

301
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,480
 I'm getting better at it, but I don't usually do it.

302
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,120
 Dick, if you're actually bringing up a big thing for me, to be honest with you.

303
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,120
 Oh yeah?

304
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,120
 Yeah, yeah.

305
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,920
 As someone who's trying to be a recovery fatty, I'm going to tell you, thin people leave stuff

306
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,320
 on their plates all the time.

307
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,320
 They do it left and right.

308
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
 They don't give a shit.

309
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,480
 I've never grown up with a clean plate club or whatever.

310
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,240
 The amount of people I know where I go out to eat with a skinny person and they just

311
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,360
 know they're done and the fork's down and they're still half the way in the plate and

312
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,640
 they're casual and confident about it.

313
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,640
 They just wait forever and finally the waiter comes over and goes, "Are you done?"

314
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
 They go, "Yes."

315
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,640
 It's been seen the whole time.

316
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,640
 They don't finish their fries.

317
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,680
 It's an amazing trait of a thin person.

318
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:56,160
 I have simply tried to imitate this to possibly become thinner by being like, "Can I do what

319
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,160
 I want to do?"

320
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,200
 Meanwhile, I'm secretly sweating because I'm just like, "When is that waiter coming?

321
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,400
 Take that fucking plate away from me.

322
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,400
 I still won't eat this entire thing."

323
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,280
 But I want to be like a thin person and I want to leave it.

324
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,240
 There's no like, "Oh my gosh, you're starving children in Africa," and all that stuff.

325
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,280
 None of that holds true for a thinny person.

326
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,000
 They don't care.

327
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,880
 Starving child in Africa is not getting the food on this plate regardless of if I eat

328
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,880
 it or not.

329
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:32,880
 Now, my wife is a skinny person who always insists on taking everything home, which all

330
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,080
 this does is light a fuse for three days later, "Why is there so much shit in our fucking

331
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
 fridge?"

332
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,600
 It's like, "I think you need to go into the bathroom, look in the mirror, and ask that

333
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,240
 question to yourself."

334
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,000
 Which is always a safe answer to give when your wife asks a question that she's upset

335
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 about.

336
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,880
 In the kitchen, I'm like, "I don't know, gosh, goddamn."

337
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,880
 What could it be?

338
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
 Oh man.

339
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,880
 I don't know.

340
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,880
 They're multiplying.

341
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,720
 We got to get to the bottom of this.

342
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,640
 I never got to eating all that leftover food I took home.

343
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,800
 I never got to do that.

344
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,800
 Hold on.

345
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,800
 I'll go beat the children.

346
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,800
 Yeah.

347
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,560
 They must be putting stuff in the fridge again.

348
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,120
 That'd be a good habit to develop.

349
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,080
 You have house guests, Jacob.

350
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,720
 Paul, you don't really get too many guests at the house.

351
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,680
 No, very rare.

352
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:32,360
 Jacob, do guests at your place take food home from restaurants and put it in your fridge?

353
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,080
 Wait.

354
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,080
 Do they bring-

355
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,800
 If everybody went out to eat together, and then they're coming to stay at your place.

356
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,720
 So you guys all go to a restaurant, and they go, "Oh, I can't finish that.

357
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,720
 I'll take a box."

358
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,640
 Do they take a box of food and put it in your fridge?

359
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,640
 Rarely.

360
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,640
 Okay.

361
00:15:51,640 --> 00:16:01,000
 It is probably my biggest pet peeve of having a house guest, because you're in Las Vegas.

362
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,640
 You're not going to go, "We should eat leftovers at any point during your vacation."

363
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,600
 You are never going to be like, "Never mind, let's just bust out the leftovers and have

364
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,340
 a leftover festival at the table my last night in Las Vegas."

365
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:16,160
 Now, what I will do, yes, that is all correct.

366
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,600
 Also, what I will do is when the guests are in town, if we go out somewhere nice and they

367
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,800
 get a nice meal or something like that, and they're like, "Oh, I'm not going to finish

368
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,840
 this other piece here," I'll be like, "I'll take a box for that.

369
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,960
 I'll take that home, and I will eat your leftovers later on."

370
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
 Oh, sure.

371
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,960
 Yeah.

372
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,960
 Yeah.

373
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
 That's a pro move.

374
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,880
 If it's something that I've had my eye on anyway, that steak looks good.

375
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,640
 My mother-in-law just ordered a 16-ounce steak.

376
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,760
 She's going to eat eight ounces tops.

377
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,480
 I'll just reach over and cut that thing in half right at the top of the dinner, and just

378
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,480
 slide one half over to her.

379
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,000
 The other half's right there if she wants to get to it, but if she doesn't, it's coming

380
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 home.

381
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Smart.

382
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 That's smart.

383
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,760
 Speaking of ordering steak and Las Vegas parking and weather, hit it, Jacob.

384
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,760
 Yep.

385
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,760
 It's over here somewhere.

386
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,720
 All my buttons have moved around.

387
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,720
 God damn it.

388
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,720
 Oh, my buttons.

389
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,720
 My gumdrop buttons.

390
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
 My buttons.

391
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
 My gumdrop buttons.

392
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
 Oh, I'm on the wrong page.

393
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
 That's why.

394
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,720
 My sweet candy buttons.

395
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,800
 Vegas, parking and weather, no one does it better than ICS.

396
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,800
 It wasn't my buttons.

397
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
 It was me.

398
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
 I was on the wrong page.

399
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:32,280
 To prove that Vegas is always on the innovation space in the world of entertainment, they

400
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,760
 figured out a way to close a show without closing a show over at the Bellagio.

401
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,400
 What happened?

402
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
 Oh, the poor Mayfair.

403
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,600
 I feel so bad for everybody over there.

404
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,200
 The Mayfair Summer Club is staying open at the Bellagio.

405
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,920
 They simply fired everyone.

406
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,980
 Their whole thing is dinner and a show.

407
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,160
 They have singers and dancers and performers.

408
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:00,240
 They have a stage in there, there's lighting and sound and you sit around it and it's a

409
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,160
 very nice restaurant on top of it.

410
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,720
 It's a Michelin star, I think, restaurant and all that kind of stuff.

411
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,440
 Yeah, they have fired the entire entertainment cast.

412
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,920
 So now it's dinner and a TBD over at the Mayfair Summer Club.

413
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,360
 Apparently someone is coming in to make up some kind of new entertainment and that is

414
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,560
 the amount of news that has been released on that.

415
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,560
 Oh, no.

416
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,560
 It's funny, I got a message from someone saying they're submitting an audition for the Mayfair

417
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,280
 Summer Club and they're coming to check them out.

418
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,280
 They don't live in Vegas.

419
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:36,200
 They live in another city and I was like in my head, I was like, "Huh, that's weird that

420
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,040
 they're auditioning someone, do a whole new thing."

421
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,520
 And then I got the news and I was like, "Oh, it all adds up now."

422
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:53,440
 It's a shame because the Mayfair Summer Club hired locally.

423
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,400
 That's 30 just Las Vegas residents who had show business jobs that are gone.

424
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,400
 That's killer, man.

425
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:08,100
 Yeah, several friends of ours and a lot of them, because they're Las Vegas performers,

426
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:12,320
 a lot of them have multiple gigs, but it just sucks.

427
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,560
 You lose that gig.

428
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,720
 You might lose a third of your weekly income or so.

429
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,200
 Well, I'll tell you another thing that happened while we were at the Costco.

430
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,520
 We had to get the membership, right?

431
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,240
 And so went and got the membership and the gentleman there, super friendly guy, we got

432
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:34,040
 to talking and we were talking Vegas and then we were talking improv.

433
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,240
 Believe it or not, he's an improviser over at the arcade space.

434
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,280
 I was like, "Holy shit."

435
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,600
 So we exchanged info, I got him a chip, 'cause always.

436
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,000
 So good at it.

437
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Got to do it.

438
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Got to be on it.

439
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Okay.

440
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:57,160
 Yeah, so we'll talk, but in my heart, I felt some, I don't know, relief, kinship because

441
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:04,160
 I too am a retail employee who moonlights as an improviser now of just getting back

442
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,160
 into the teaching.

443
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,360
 By the way, I don't know if I've mentioned this.

444
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:13,080
 My level one class at Skit is going phenomenally well and I love all those students.

445
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,080
 They're amazing.

446
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,080
 Oh, wonderful.

447
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,080
 That's good to hear.

448
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,080
 You have not said that.

449
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,080
 That's great.

450
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,080
 Fan fucking-tastic.

451
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,040
 A couple of them are listening to the podcast now and tell me that they know that I shit

452
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,720
 my pants and stuff like that, which I'm just over the moon about.

453
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,720
 Good.

454
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,200
 Which is great because if you ever leave the classroom going, "It's happening," they'll

455
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,200
 know why.

456
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:38,680
 If I leave the classroom squealing, "It's happening, oh no, oh no," they'll figure

457
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,560
 it out real fucking fast.

458
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,720
 Maybe one of your students to kiss your ass will come up with a thermos, a freshly steamy

459
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,720
 microwave hot dog.

460
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,120
 It's like they'll open up a little plume of steam coming off the top of a thermos and

461
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,440
 just a nice dangly wiener for you to chomp down on.

462
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,840
 I saw the fuck, somebody sent me the popeal one.

463
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,840
 Nice dangly wiener.

464
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,880
 Somebody sent me the popeal one.

465
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,480
 That's so nasty.

466
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,640
 The popeal one, have you seen it, the popeal hot dog thing?

467
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,640
 No.

468
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,640
 Please stop saying popeal.

469
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:11,080
 It would slice the wiener when you put it in and then you'd lay the bun on top of it

470
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,800
 and there was a bun case and you microwave it bun and all and I'm like, "Don't put bread

471
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
 in a microwave.

472
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
 That's sacrilege."

473
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,880
 My anaconda don't want nothing unless your bun's got a case.

474
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,880
 That's right.

475
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,760
 You can do side bins or sit ups.

476
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
 Sit it and forget it.

477
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:39,000
 You know who else wants a thermos of hot dogs delivered directly to them and that is the

478
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 following sponsor.

479
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,440
 Today's show is brought to you by The Internet from Danny Alwine in 2021.

480
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,880
 Today's show is brought to you by The Internet with a capital I.

481
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,860
 Hey, the end of democracy and your sister's fucking a dog.

482
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,860
 That's The Internet.

483
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,860
 Enter hey scoops at checkout.

484
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,040
 Oh yeah, I have a little update on that.

485
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
 Oh yeah?

486
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,040
 Yeah, yeah.

487
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,040
 Please.

488
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:14,320
 So my buddy Sammy gets a call and it's another, you know, you've been approved for some loan

489
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,120
 or you want to do something in the medical care system or something.

490
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,120
 Oh shit.

491
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,120
 Right?

492
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,120
 Yeah.

493
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,080
 Call center with a scam.

494
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,960
 And Sammy goes, "Oh yeah, no problem, yeah, sign me up, let's do it."

495
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,960
 You know, whatever.

496
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
 They go, "Your first name?"

497
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,960
 He goes, "Ben."

498
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,960
 And he goes, "Sorry.

499
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,960
 What's your first name?"

500
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,960
 And he goes, "Ben."

501
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,960
 And he goes, "Oh, yeah.

502
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,760
 And I know what your last name is too."

503
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,760
 And he hangs up.

504
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
 I got him.

505
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,760
 Oh shit.

506
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,760
 Oh shit.

507
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:50,600
 Before he can even- Got him.

508
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,600
 Oh fuck.

509
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,600
 Fuck.

510
00:22:53,600 --> 00:23:01,120
 For anybody who didn't hear that episode, my friend always says to a scam caller that

511
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,000
 his name is Ben Schott, which translates in Indian to sister fucker.

512
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 Right.

513
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,320
 And apparently that's the worst thing you could say to someone in that country.

514
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,740
 But it's spreading.

515
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,040
 That means that that prank is spreading.

516
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,040
 Exactly.

517
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,040
 It is.

518
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,040
 I don't praise or condone.

519
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,680
 I simply report what's happening on the front lines.

520
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,680
 That's right.

521
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,680
 You are Walter Cronkite.

522
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:30,160
 He came up with a current reference.

523
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,840
 I'm still shocked that uncle fucker never really caught on as hotly, but I guess it's

524
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,040
 because everybody likes uncles and so nobody, it's not really derogatory.

525
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,720
 It's like, "Oh, well, yeah, I mean, you fucked your uncle.

526
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,720
 Great."

527
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,160
 Everybody has a good- He caught on for a slur for Canadians for

528
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
 a while.

529
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,160
 I guess.

530
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
 After the South Park movie.

531
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,160
 I guess.

532
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,160
 I love that.

533
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,160
 That's the whole thing.

534
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,160
 That song.

535
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,160
 God damn it.

536
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,760
 I never laughed so hard in the theater.

537
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,240
 Still, to this day, that was the funniest moment.

538
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,000
 Was that the one that, was uncle fucker the one that Robin Williams sang on the Oscars?

539
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,400
 No, he sang Blame Canada.

540
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,400
 That's right.

541
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,400
 That's right.

542
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,080
 If he sang Uncle Fucker, that would have brought the house down.

543
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,000
 Well, because it had all of the terrible things that it-

544
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 It still had some-

545
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,040
 Remember, everybody was still terrified of what Robin Williams was going to do on the

546
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,960
 live broadcast for the Oscars.

547
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,960
 Right.

548
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,960
 How's that guy doing?

549
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
 Robin Williams.

550
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,960
 Sister fucker.

551
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,960
 Oh, shit.

552
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,960
 Bossy.

553
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,960
 Oh, man.

554
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:44,080
 Yeah, so we're walking through Costco for the first time, Ann and I, as husband and wife.

555
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,120
 She carried Paul over the threshold.

556
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:51,900
 We seriously just kept looking at each other in awe and amazement.

557
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,240
 We were really taken aback.

558
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,060
 We had a membership to Sam's Club back in Vegas for a little while, but nothing like

559
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,060
 this.

560
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,060
 This was just amazing.

561
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,060
 We got-

562
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,060
 Nothing compared to you.

563
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,060
 We got a bunch of stuff.

564
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,200
 We got mostly dog food.

565
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,200
 I don't know why.

566
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,400
 As someone who's been a lifelong Costco member, I don't know why I really condescendedly look

567
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,920
 when people bring up Sam's Club at the same time as Costco, and I was like, "Sure.

568
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,920
 Okay."

569
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,240
 No, you're right, because it's garbage trash, comparatively.

570
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,320
 We didn't know we were missing with the Costco thing.

571
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,800
 I'm a Sam's Club guy.

572
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
 I'm not.

573
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,680
 There's just ... There's a closer Sam's to me than there is a Costco.

574
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,680
 Leon's asking if I-

575
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,960
 The Sam's Club that I go to is great.

576
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
 I don't know.

577
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,960
 I don't know.

578
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,600
 If I saw Big Justice and the Costco guys ... Now, Rizler was working the cash register when

579
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:46,380
 I came through, so we got a bunch of cool stuff.

580
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,000
 It's fun because we had-

581
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Yeah.

582
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,040
 Scan and go at Sam's Club.

583
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,720
 Does Costco have the scan and go thing yet?

584
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,720
 No.

585
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,820
 Holy shit, this guy came up to the ... No, we've got it.

586
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,000
 This guy came up to our cart.

587
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,120
 Oh, that's where Sam's Club's got it.

588
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,080
 This guy came up to our cart and was like, "You want me to scan you guys in?"

589
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,420
 We're like, "Yeah."

590
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:08,800
 He pre-scanned everything in the cart, sent it to our account, and then all we had to

591
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,520
 do was present our card at the register, and we're done.

592
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,520
 Yeah.

593
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,520
 That's good.

594
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,520
 Yeah.

595
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,120
 Sam's Club scan and go with your phone, though-

596
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,120
 Oh, right.

597
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,120
 ... is superior.

598
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,160
 That is one big thing that they have.

599
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:26,680
 I would say it probably is superior, but it's also more open to fraudsters, unfortunately.

600
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,800
 Or does that matter to me?

601
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
 Doesn't matter to you.

602
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,800
 I'm just saying-

603
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
 Yeah, there you go.

604
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,440
 No, because the one in Vegas now, the one that I go to now, which I think is a really

605
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,600
 nice Sam's ... I don't know why I'm defending Sam's Club, by the way, but-

606
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,600
 I'm just saying if you put-

607
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,600
 The one that I go to for some reason-

608
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,600
 Because you love it, Jacob.

609
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,920
 Don't be ashamed of your love for Sam's Club.

610
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:50,280
 If you put being able to price items in the hands of the consumer, they will fuck with

611
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,280
 it.

612
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,280
 That's all I'm saying.

613
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,280
 I don't care about that.

614
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,280
 I know.

615
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:59,400
 If Walmart loses money because people are gaming their system, that doesn't affect me

616
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,400
 at all.

617
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,400
 I'm fine with that too.

618
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
 Okay.

619
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,920
 But yeah, the one that we have, they don't even have to check your shit at the door anymore

620
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,640
 like they used to with the scan and go stuff.

621
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,880
 It's all x-rayed in there.

622
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,240
 It's all like, yeah, there's a sensor thing and everything.

623
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,560
 It's so easy and it's great now.

624
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,800
 I don't think it's for anything like under 700 bucks.

625
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,560
 Like if you're spending less than 700.

626
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:31,200
 So when I check out for Scoop Fest, I have to do it the old fashioned way.

627
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,560
 We got a bunch of cool stuff, like I said, mostly for the dogs, but then it was really

628
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,720
 nice.

629
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,300
 We had watched a video or something.

630
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:44,600
 We saw this really nice collection of Jane Austen's books, right?

631
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,600
 Okay.

632
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,000
 Specially bound in these, it's a very nice thing.

633
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 And then we saw-

634
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 She's the romance author, right?

635
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 She is.

636
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 She's got like Fabio on the cover.

637
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 Fabio always.

638
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 And it was Costco only.

639
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,500
 And we were like, oh no, but when we went today, we were really hoping to find those

640
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,740
 books and we found them for Ann.

641
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,280
 So it was a good day.

642
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,280
 She got her special edition Jane Austen collection.

643
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,600
 It was really nice.

644
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,200
 It was very sweet.

645
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,280
 And they're really pretty actually, they're like in a faux leather binding.

646
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,000
 They're really nice.

647
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,560
 So yeah, she's on the up and up with her little book collection.

648
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,560
 Yeah.

649
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,860
 Jane Austen wrote a very special edition just for Costco.

650
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:27,140
 We got one of the signed, very limited signed copies from Jane Austen.

651
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:33,960
 She reached up with her dead hand and she turned into the Joker.

652
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,360
 Do you know how I wrote these books?

653
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,440
 I saw it.

654
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,440
 It's all true.

655
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,260
 Boss Grissom reached up with his dead hand and he signed it over to me.

656
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,260
 Yeah.

657
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,440
 Did you make Ann push you out of the giant cart?

658
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,320
 I pushed the cart.

659
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:54,120
 Ann pushed it at first, but then I pushed it most of the time because she was like, it's

660
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,120
 getting too heavy.

661
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,120
 So I pushed it.

662
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,120
 It was a bunch of.

663
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,120
 I don't push carts like that.

664
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:03,040
 I don't push carts like that full of dog food, but man, the money we saved.

665
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,040
 Holy shit.

666
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,040
 The money we saved.

667
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,040
 The savings.

668
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,040
 The savings, dude.

669
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,920
 Honestly, we already paid for our membership.

670
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,920
 Just getting dog food.

671
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,320
 We already paid for our membership.

672
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,320
 It's ridiculous.

673
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,960
 Right now, any Costco listening, it just was like, got them.

674
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,320
 They got them and they, and the thing is they got Ann.

675
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,040
 That's all that really matters.

676
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,760
 You can get me all day long.

677
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,760
 Oh yeah.

678
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,760
 Oh yeah.

679
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,760
 Big bad toy store.

680
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,760
 Got them.

681
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,760
 Lego.

682
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,760
 Got them.

683
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:40,760
 Masters of the universe for, since I was eight, six, since I was six, got them.

684
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,480
 But they, you know, but if it's got Ann, Oh, it's a whole nother thing.

685
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,400
 They have, they have these sample people out there, buddy.

686
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
 Oh my gosh.

687
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,160
 She did almost ruin my day.

688
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:55,200
 She gave me this fucking falafel ball in this fucking dip.

689
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,920
 I was like, I didn't really want it, but she's like, Oh, I'll get them.

690
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,920
 And she, and I ate this.

691
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,840
 I was like, Oh, it was so gross.

692
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,120
 So many vegetables.

693
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,120
 It was so gross.

694
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,520
 It was in this, isn't this mint and cucumber dip or some shit?

695
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,240
 I was like, Oh God, but I ate it.

696
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,240
 It was delightful.

697
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,240
 Oh, it was awful.

698
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,480
 I hate the whole thing.

699
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,560
 It was full awful.

700
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,720
 Full awful.

701
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,440
 Full on full awful.

702
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,600
 Uh, yeah.

703
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,880
 So that was my free sample.

704
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,840
 I was like barf.

705
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,840
 It wasn't green.

706
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,840
 It was fried up.

707
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,840
 It was gross.

708
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:37,480
 Part of it was once green, just a little fried up little ball or something.

709
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,480
 We did it.

710
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,480
 We did.

711
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,480
 We finally did a little judging of our, uh, Patreon.

712
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,160
 If you talk about that a little bit, we did the production meeting.

713
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:51,320
 Uh, again, yeah, more production, twice in a row, twice in one episode.

714
00:30:51,320 --> 00:31:11,560
 Uh, we, we raised our lowest tier from $2 to $3.

715
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,600
 Let's just get that out of the way.

716
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
 Yep.

717
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,320
 Huge money grab on our parts.

718
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,320
 Talk about Costco.

719
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,320
 Yep.

720
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,800
 But if you, uh, you know, if, if you get a Costco membership though, you'll be able

721
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,220
 to afford it.

722
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:29,160
 If they can, if Disney plus wants to charge me $38 just to watch sports center now, cause

723
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:34,800
 it's not longer on YouTube TV, uh, I think we can go up to a dollar, uh, of that one.

724
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,800
 Yeah.

725
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,400
 Uh, that's the only to be raised any price on.

726
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,900
 And as always, if you are a $2 member, we do not take that away.

727
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,040
 So your grandfathered in, yeah, of course.

728
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:50,680
 Uh, so, so that's still is a listed, I looked, we actually still have like 28 people still

729
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,680
 at the dollar a month.

730
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,080
 And I was like, all right, look at that.

731
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,240
 Hey, look at us go.

732
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,240
 We'll take it.

733
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,920
 And of that, by the way, if you're still at a dollar a month, a congratulations B feel

734
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,660
 free to revisit your Patriot and see.

735
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,660
 Thank you.

736
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,660
 I know.

737
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,660
 Absolutely.

738
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,660
 Thank you.

739
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:11,240
 We make, uh, 12 of those, you know, I mean, make about 12 cents off of the dollar a month

740
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,240
 club.

741
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,520
 We make about $6 off of your $12.

742
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:23,080
 So like, um, so, uh, uh, uh, but we also took away, we're no longer delivering stickers,

743
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:30,200
 uh, and then, uh, we are going to do any kind of like triple threats or any kind of songs

744
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,200
 from Paul.

745
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:38,880
 Those would be like off air deliveries, uh, in return we are, Paul has organized a newsletter

746
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,480
 and he sent one out already.

747
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
 Yes.

748
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:47,920
 I'll be organizing a monthly newsletter and basically people seem to really enjoy these,

749
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,520
 these hangs on and off air where scoops get to interact with each other.

750
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,580
 Just like the strength of scoop vest is that scoops get to see each other and hang out

751
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,580
 with each other.

752
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,920
 Uh, knowing that we're not really the big headliner sometimes for some people in this

753
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:03,880
 world, uh, that we've created, uh, we're going to do zoom hangs off air, zoom hangs, uh,

754
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,840
 for everyone to hang out, uh, once a month as well.

755
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,840
 Yeah.

756
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:14,280
 So if you're a patron, uh, subscriber at any level, you will get the invites to the zoom

757
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,280
 hangs.

758
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,440
 Uh, and then they're artists.

759
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,440
 What level is it?

760
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,440
 It's over.

761
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,440
 It's over.

762
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,440
 Uh, a level.

763
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,440
 It's, uh, I think the $10 level.

764
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,440
 Yeah.

765
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,440
 $10 leveling up.

766
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,640
 You get zoom hangs once a month.

767
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,720
 This is all information we could have had in front of us.

768
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,240
 If only we had known we were going to talk about this, it's the only thing we knew we

769
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,240
 were going to talk about.

770
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,080
 You guys five minutes notice before the episode.

771
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,080
 It's true.

772
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,080
 You did.

773
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,840
 It's the only thing we knew we were going to talk about.

774
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,360
 Well, and we say we're not sending out stickers.

775
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,200
 We're not sending out physical stuff.

776
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,400
 That's all we've just taken off the graphic stuff.

777
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:52,120
 We're still sending you the digital files or we're now sending you the digital files

778
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,980
 so that not only can you make stickers if you want, you can make fucking anything.

779
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:02,240
 If you want, you put that on any kind of product, you know, anywhere you want to put that.

780
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,700
 There are so many sites.

781
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:08,760
 Can you upload images into T public and make stuff right in our store?

782
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
 Oh yeah.

783
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:16,200
 So, you know, you can even go through our store, use our T public store to order custom

784
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:23,040
 stuff using custom art that we've just sent you for that month and double dip us a little

785
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,040
 bit.

786
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,040
 Oh, oh, they can't do it.

787
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,040
 Oh no.

788
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,040
 Are you asking?

789
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,040
 No, I thought you were asking if I could do it.

790
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,040
 I was like, I can do it.

791
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,040
 Oh, you could, but yeah.

792
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,040
 Okay.

793
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,400
 So this question is probably from the chat real quick, the newsletter came through Patreon.

794
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,060
 So if you're getting your patron emails, just check your patron emails for the newsletter.

795
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,060
 Yes.

796
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:45,400
 Coming in through the newsletters put out through patron added a newsletter feature

797
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,400
 to the.

798
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,440
 Well, I'm trying to learn the newsletter.

799
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,560
 I'm trying to learn the newsletter proper.

800
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,200
 It was just a post this time.

801
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,200
 Yeah.

802
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,040
 Oh, and the, and the zoom hangs are different from the shows.

803
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,360
 So we have the, we have the, the, uh, patreons that are with us on this show recording right

804
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,360
 now.

805
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,760
 Uh, that, that stays for everyone.

806
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,760
 Yes.

807
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,720
 So everybody on Patreon, every member gets access to our ice cream social recordings.

808
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,720
 Yes.

809
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,720
 Yeah.

810
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,720
 Uh, the, the zoom hangs are a different thing.

811
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,800
 Those are the all fair things.

812
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,880
 We did one this last month where we just had everybody on Patreon do it.

813
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,200
 We kind of did the beta test for it last month.

814
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,400
 Uh, but yeah, that'll normally be at the $10 level at higher Leon.

815
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,600
 Thank you for the reminder.

816
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:30,720
 Make sure you do your Patreon through the website, through a browser and not through

817
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,240
 the Patreon app, uh, because the, the Apple app takes a big cut.

818
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,240
 Yeah.

819
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,240
 Yeah.

820
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,200
 And then, and for people here live on this broadcast, I believe Meyer just post the link

821
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,640
 to the newsletter for anyone who might've missed it.

822
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,640
 Yeah.

823
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,640
 Oh yeah.

824
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,640
 That's true.

825
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,640
 The Patreon post.

826
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,640
 So this is the Patreon post.

827
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,480
 Oh, Leon, if you can't read, uh, that is a different Patreon level.

828
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,000
 There is a Patreon level though for you, if you can't read where I will just read the

829
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,400
 newsletter to you, uh, don't worry.

830
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,440
 We got you Leon.

831
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,880
 But I'll still be sending out, uh, my original art piece and then we're going to send out

832
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:11,920
 old school stickers, new stickers, um, you know, we still keep generating tons of artworks

833
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,720
 and people will get access to that artwork.

834
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,120
 It's just the actual practice of printing and shipping stickers.

835
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:21,720
 And basically people have like built dog houses out of the stickers we've set over a decade.

836
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,720
 Yes.

837
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,720
 It's just, it's, it's a diminishing returns.

838
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,720
 It's a lot.

839
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:31,440
 And also if y'all haven't noticed postal shit's getting weird.

840
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,440
 Yeah.

841
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:39,240
 Uh, if you feel like you're still owed stickers from the past, please send an email to jacob@hayscoops@med@hayscoops.com.

842
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,240
 Yes.

843
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,240
 Yeah.

844
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:46,880
 But, uh, yeah, moving forward, uh, it's going to be digital rewards, but-

845
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,880
 Oh man.

846
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,320
 Amy just wrote in chat, Matt will read the newsletter as Dom DeLouise.

847
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,320
 That was the second time this week I've been compared to Dom DeLouise.

848
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:01,640
 And as someone who's been slowly losing weight and trying to get their shit together, it's

849
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,840
 a real fucking kick in the balls to be compared to Dom DeLouise twice in a week.

850
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:14,440
 Not to say I don't get it, not to say I totally don't get it.

851
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,880
 I get it.

852
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,120
 I love Dom DeLouise so much.

853
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:27,360
 You know who else loves being compared to Dom DeLouise all the time?

854
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,840
 And that is the following sponsor.

855
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,840
 All right.

856
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:36,400
 Today's show is brought to you by, uh, 1-800-BITKILL.

857
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,920
 Are you stuck with someone doing a bit that's gone way too long?

858
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,000
 Call 1-800-BITKILL and our agents will come kill that bit.

859
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,720
 That's from Dungeon Scoop in 2024.

860
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,920
 Do you need a running joke kicked in the dick so hard it'll never recover?

861
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:59,240
 Call 1-800-BITKILL and we'll be there immediately to dick kick any running joke that has been

862
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:04,240
 going on in your household or family for any amount of time.

863
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,840
 As long as it's been more than five days.

864
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:13,720
 Any bit under five days still is in the incubation period and may or may not survive to day six.

865
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:21,400
 After day six, a bit is firmly and securely intertwined into the DNA of the host and then

866
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:28,440
 can only then be truly exterminated from said host.

867
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,240
 I mean, is that a, is that like a procedure or is that like something you just come out

868
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,240
 and do or what?

869
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,240
 What is that?

870
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,680
 The dick until the bit is removed thoroughly.

871
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,400
 What me or the person doing the bit?

872
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,920
 Your choice.

873
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,600
 Excellent.

874
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,780
 We're not that far off from prostitutes.

875
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,240
 Are we?

876
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,240
 That's right.

877
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,360
 None of us are that far off from prostitutes.

878
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,500
 Don't ever fucking forget it.

879
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,960
 Sex work is work.

880
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,040
 We just, we just did a breakdown of our new patron levels.

881
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,040
 I agree.

882
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,040
 Yeah.

883
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,040
 Sex work is work.

884
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,040
 Everybody.

885
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,440
 We're all of this whores in this economy.

886
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,680
 Enter Hayes groups to check out.

887
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,680
 Welcome.

888
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,680
 Welcome to it.

889
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,680
 Yeah.

890
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:21,800
 I just sent you in the chat, a very nice felt picture of Dom Deleuze from 1975.

891
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,440
 Everyone knows that's not what they're talking about.

892
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,440
 Jacob.

893
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:29,800
 I'm pretty sure that's a young Dom Deleuze and a very vibrant shirt.

894
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,280
 They're referring to him, his, uh, slim and trim days.

895
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,280
 That's right.

896
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:38,680
 No, one person said early years, uh, an actual pick saying I had to do a double take and

897
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,440
 they were wearing a similar flat cap.

898
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,960
 He was wearing a similar flat cap to me.

899
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,600
 Oh, I, it was it smoky in the bandit too.

900
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,600
 Is that where he's wearing?

901
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,000
 I think that is where he's wearing that, that, that one.

902
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,600
 And I, I had to be like, I want to tell my friend, like, listen, if you ever think you

903
00:39:54,600 --> 00:40:00,320
 should send a photo of Dom Deleuze to someone to be like, I had to do a double take, don't,

904
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,560
 don't do it up.

905
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,560
 You're safe.

906
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,560
 Smokey debate at two.

907
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,560
 Isn't it?

908
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,560
 Yeah.

909
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,560
 There's Leon helping you out.

910
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,000
 That's the one in the chat.

911
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 Help it out.

912
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,160
 But he looks so happy.

913
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,160
 Look at him.

914
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,160
 Yeah.

915
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,160
 No, I'm a happy guy.

916
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,800
 I'm not saying I don't understand the comparison.

917
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,000
 Oh my God.

918
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:32,640
 So yeah, I said this like great night, but one person on YouTube called the Orson Welles.

919
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,240
 And I was like, actually, when you look at a picture of Orson Welles next to me, like,

920
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,640
 that's actually who I look like the most.

921
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,880
 I'm like, I actually have to hand it to you.

922
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,440
 I really do look a lot like Orson Welles, late Orson Welles.

923
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:50,040
 Oh, I saw a great video the other day of Orson Welles outtakes from a wine commercial that

924
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,040
 he was doing.

925
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,040
 That's a that's a class.

926
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,040
 Famous.

927
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,040
 Yeah.

928
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,040
 Yeah.

929
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,040
 Oh, it's so good.

930
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,040
 Right.

931
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,680
 It's definitely a later in life when he was where he's just drunk.

932
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,680
 Yeah.

933
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,040
 He is just like slurring speech drunk.

934
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,560
 The last thing he did was the reason that that's true.

935
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,560
 Yeah.

936
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,080
 The reason you need to go look at this video again, though, if you haven't looked at it

937
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:16,240
 lately or if you've ever seen it before, look up this video Orson Welles outtakes wine commercial.

938
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:21,560
 The two extras that are standing next to him that are just doing take after take with him.

939
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,560
 Oh, yeah.

940
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,240
 They are heroes.

941
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,860
 They are amazing.

942
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,240
 They never comment.

943
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,120
 They never look at him sideways.

944
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,240
 They never do anything but exactly what they are there to do.

945
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,040
 Well, even then he was royalty.

946
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,040
 Right.

947
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,040
 Oh, yeah.

948
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,040
 Yeah.

949
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,040
 Yeah.

950
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,040
 I mean, you know, yeah.

951
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,040
 Yeah.

952
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:49,000
 Brian Brushman sent me a clip of John Candy playing Orson Welles in a bit like a late

953
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 night talk show.

954
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,920
 And it's really, really funny that Latter Day Scoop goes with a thin picture of Orson

955
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,920
 Welles.

956
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,920
 That's not who we're talking about.

957
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,920
 Latter Day Scoop.

958
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,920
 Young Orson Welles.

959
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,120
 That's not who I'm being compared to on YouTube.

960
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,720
 I'll tell you that much right now on my screen.

961
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,440
 That picture is next to Matt's face right now.

962
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:14,200
 He's talking about that.

963
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:20,300
 I found out something in the Zoom chat before we started today that has changed my world

964
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,300
 forever.

965
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,800
 Oh, God.

966
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:29,240
 And that is, apparently, if you do a reverse image search of any house that was ever listed

967
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:34,440
 on Zillow, that's enough to do a reverse image search of a house.

968
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,440
 What?

969
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,440
 What?

970
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,560
 And, like, and find out where that house is.

971
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,880
 Wait, say that again.

972
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:48,440
 So if you just have a picture of a house, oh, Scoop Jesus, there you are.

973
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,160
 Can you unmute and come on?

974
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,400
 Scoop Jesus was telling me about this before we started today.

975
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,400
 Okay.

976
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,000
 I'm actually in the house, but that happened with.

977
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 Oh, great.

978
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 Yeah.

979
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,200
 So a friend, a named friend, posted a picture of their new house on Instagram that didn't

980
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,120
 show the address number or anything, and my wife took the image, reverse image search,

981
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,800
 and it popped up and showed the Zillow listing and got their address.

982
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,880
 And I just drove down here with that address.

983
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,280
 So you were able to find a house with just the picture of the house?

984
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,280
 Yep.

985
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,280
 I'm terrified.

986
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:30,800
 If we're doing that now, what do you think the government's been doing for the last 15

987
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,800
 years?

988
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,040
 I mean, a lot more and a lot worse.

989
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,040
 Yeah.

990
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,040
 Yeah.

991
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,040
 Yeah.

992
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,040
 Just constantly checking the value of my house.

993
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,040
 They've been reverse imaging.

994
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,180
 They've been reverse image searching my colon for God's sakes.

995
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,800
 They know everything.

996
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:50,560
 We got a note from our HOA about our basketball hoop being out, that we have to put our basketball

997
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:55,120
 hoop away because no basketball hoop and their argument was that it could hurt the value

998
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,560
 of the homes around us.

999
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:01,760
 And I just want to be like, you go ahead and Google the value of homes in this neighborhood

1000
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,920
 and you'd tell me where the dip happened the day I put up my fucking basketball.

1001
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,920
 Right?

1002
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,920
 Yeah.

1003
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,920
 No dips anywhere.

1004
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,840
 There are no dips yet.

1005
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,840
 Right back to him.

1006
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,400
 You know what lowers the property value in this goddamn neighborhood?

1007
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,440
 All these fucking kids running around.

1008
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,320
 You know what really lower kids and then I won't have a reason to put up a fucking basketball

1009
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,320
 hoop.

1010
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,800
 You know what really lowers get to work HOA Vegas.

1011
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,480
 What really lowers property values in Las Vegas is not being able to fly to fucking

1012
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,880
 Las Vegas.

1013
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:32,880
 That does hurt property value.

1014
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,880
 Yeah.

1015
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,880
 It's a real dick in it.

1016
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,880
 It sure does.

1017
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,760
 Oh, a bunch of bulls.

1018
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,760
 So what was your solution?

1019
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,040
 Have you put up the basketball goal or are you going to fight them in city hall?

1020
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,040
 I'm going to fight them in city hall.

1021
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,200
 Well, I'm actually waiting for the second note to come.

1022
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,200
 Good.

1023
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,200
 Good.

1024
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,520
 Because I feel like we definitely don't have the only basketball hoop out.

1025
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:57,040
 So I figured someone who's much more of a organized rage person than me.

1026
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,040
 There you go.

1027
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,040
 I'm probably answering them already.

1028
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,040
 Yeah.

1029
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,960
 HOA is the waste.

1030
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:02,960
 The waste.

1031
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,080
 I have a very reasonable HOA.

1032
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,080
 I'm actually not that upset.

1033
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,080
 Yeah.

1034
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,840
 We used to get a note about our leaves.

1035
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,840
 I know Paul.

1036
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:11,840
 You're very well noted.

1037
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:16,200
 I'm really, I just really, I hate the whole idea.

1038
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,360
 It makes me rage, rage, rage.

1039
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,900
 Paul, I'm around people in Las Vegas who definitely with no HOA would definitely lower the property

1040
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,640
 value of everyone around them.

1041
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,880
 Yeah, I get it.

1042
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:25,880
 But see, this is me.

1043
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,880
 I don't care.

1044
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,480
 I'm like go nuts.

1045
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,480
 Do your thing.

1046
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:36,360
 Unless you're burning the house, unless you're causing like structural damage or you're toxifying

1047
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,000
 my land.

1048
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 Go nuts.

1049
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,600
 Here's the thing.

1050
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:47,000
 Like I have neighbors whose houses definitely are currently lowering my property value.

1051
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,120
 And like if they would spruce their houses up, I'd appreciate it.

1052
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:56,640
 But yeah, it's not worth being an HOA for me.

1053
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,640
 And I'm with you, Matt.

1054
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:02,080
 And I had, because I had a reasonable HOA before I lived here and they were fine.

1055
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,080
 They didn't bother me.

1056
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,840
 It's a critical, I like having a little bit of a nice like sidewalk neighborhood, a little

1057
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,840
 gate area.

1058
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,480
 They can just get out of control so easily.

1059
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,480
 They really can't.

1060
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,480
 They can get out of hand.

1061
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,480
 Yes.

1062
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,480
 No, without a doubt.

1063
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:18,380
 I mean, you know, like all my friends in New York, what they have to go through.

1064
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,380
 Oh God.

1065
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,380
 I can only imagine.

1066
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,380
 It's just like to own their home.

1067
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,380
 It's like, it's fucking nuts, man.

1068
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,380
 No, no.

1069
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:26,000
 There are, like this HOA is not that crazy, what I'm saying.

1070
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 We used to get notes.

1071
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,840
 A friend of mine just this week was talking to me about their HOA and they were like,

1072
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,720
 "Oh, our fees are so reasonable."

1073
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,720
 I said, "Oh, that's good.

1074
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:34,720
 What's your fees?"

1075
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,720
 They go, "500."

1076
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:40,520
 For a year?

1077
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,520
 That's what I thought.

1078
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,520
 Uh-huh.

1079
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,000
 I genuinely was like, "Oh, 500 bucks a year.

1080
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 Isn't bad."

1081
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 They're, "Oh, no, no.

1082
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 A month."

1083
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 Oh ho ho.

1084
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 Oh, that is terrible.

1085
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 Oh, eat shit.

1086
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 Eat shit forever.

1087
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 Oh my God.

1088
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 That is horrible.

1089
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 That's no way.

1090
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,520
 No, we have a pool, we have a gym.

1091
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,520
 That's cool.

1092
00:46:58,520 --> 00:46:59,520
 That's cool.

1093
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,520
 A pool and a gym.

1094
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,520
 Yeah.

1095
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,520
 No, son.

1096
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,520
 But I bet that person also has a membership to a gym outside of their home.

1097
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,200
 I have a toy collection.

1098
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,200
 I would think so.

1099
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:12,600
 I could not keep my toy collection going with that kind of money going out.

1100
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,600
 That would end it.

1101
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,600
 Okay.

1102
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,680
 You're making a lot of arguments in favor of it now, Paul.

1103
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:17,680
 No, no.

1104
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,680
 Please.

1105
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:22,960
 This glorious basement of nerditude has increased the value of this home tenfold.

1106
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,480
 The moment a prospective buyer walks in, they're like, "Good God.

1107
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,560
 May I keep the finished basement and all the trimmings?"

1108
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,880
 And I go, "No, sir.

1109
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,240
 No, sir, you may not.

1110
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,440
 That's a lifetime of collecting."

1111
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,960
 You can't, however, keep that squirrel.

1112
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,400
 Let me make an offer that you cannot refuse.

1113
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,800
 I need all of this bullshit.

1114
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,680
 Says no one ever.

1115
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,680
 Says me.

1116
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,680
 Says me.

1117
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,680
 Saving me an email.

1118
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,080
 Thank you, Steven Marson, who just became a year-long member of the Ten Dollars here.

1119
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,080
 Thank you, Steven.

1120
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,080
 Oh, nice.

1121
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,080
 Fuck yeah.

1122
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,080
 Thank you.

1123
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,080
 Your thank you note right here, buddy.

1124
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,800
 Thanks for doing it.

1125
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,800
 That's incredible.

1126
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,800
 Much appreciated.

1127
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,800
 Yeah.

1128
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,480
 And we've gotten a lot of great support.

1129
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:11,640
 As soon as I put up the post on the Patreon, we got some really nice supporting messages.

1130
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:17,320
 So thank you all for rolling with us and for moving forward into this new digital age.

1131
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,080
 But it's going to be cool.

1132
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:24,000
 And yeah, I'm going to muddle my way through learning how to put this stuff together and

1133
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,800
 get the chats going and all these different things.

1134
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,400
 And we're going to have a lot of fun.

1135
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,680
 Oh, and to put a period on it, the newsletter is at all levels, right?

1136
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,680
 Yes.

1137
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,440
 Everybody on Patreon should be getting a newsletter no matter what level you're at.

1138
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,640
 So if you are not getting a newsletter, check your Patreon email, check your Patreon, do

1139
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,640
 all that kind of stuff.

1140
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,320
 Well, you're saying newsletter.

1141
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,920
 There's a new newsletter thing.

1142
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,640
 I haven't figured that out yet.

1143
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:53,480
 All I did was put up a post, the post, this first post went to everybody.

1144
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:57,280
 So if you're on Patreon at all, you've got that post that just went up.

1145
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,600
 What are you titling the posts, Paul?

1146
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,600
 The first one was just Patreon update.

1147
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,600
 Okay.

1148
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:07,800
 So that's probably why a lot of people might not have, because when Patreon puts an update,

1149
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,640
 they also put Patreon update.

1150
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,640
 There you go.

1151
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:11,640
 See, I didn't know that either.

1152
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,640
 You should probably change the title of it.

1153
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:18,640
 Well, just next time I'll say, I'll say Ice Cream Social Newsletter for Blankety Month.

1154
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,640
 Yeah.

1155
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:23,120
 Well, I think you should put the name of the month.

1156
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,120
 I like Blankety Month.

1157
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,120
 Yeah.

1158
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,120
 Yeah.

1159
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,120
 I mean, you can figure it out.

1160
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,120
 You know what, you're reading it.

1161
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,120
 You know what month it is.

1162
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,120
 You know what month it is.

1163
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,120
 I'm recording it into a Blankety Month.

1164
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:35,500
 Ice Cream Social Newsletter for Blankety Month.

1165
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,960
 Blankety Month on such and such date.

1166
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:38,960
 Can I make a suggestion?

1167
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:39,960
 That's legally binding, isn't it?

1168
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:40,960
 What?

1169
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,960
 Can you what?

1170
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:42,960
 Can I make a suggestion?

1171
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:43,960
 You can.

1172
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,360
 I don't know why that was so baffling to you.

1173
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,320
 I couldn't hear what you said.

1174
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,320
 Okay.

1175
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,400
 Hey, it's Paul.

1176
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,120
 I think you should write and then that should be the title.

1177
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,120
 Like, here's the newsletter.

1178
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,120
 Oh, okay.

1179
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,120
 Hey, it's Paul.

1180
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,120
 Great.

1181
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,120
 Okay.

1182
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,120
 I'll start it with Hey, it's Paul.

1183
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,120
 Hey, it's the Blankety Host.

1184
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,120
 Hey, it's Paul.

1185
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,120
 It's Blankety Month, everybody.

1186
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:12,700
 And it's definitely now called the Blankety Month newsletter.

1187
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:13,700
 Yeah.

1188
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:14,700
 Paul Mattingly.

1189
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:15,700
 Yeah.

1190
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:17,700
 Paul Mattingly's Blankety Month newsletter.

1191
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:21,360
 Hey, God, it's me, Paul.

1192
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,360
 Yes.

1193
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,360
 That'll work.

1194
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:26,480
 Because the more you try to make it sound official, the more it just sounds like a Patreon

1195
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,120
 email, which is what people, I think, delete all the time without reading.

1196
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,120
 That makes sense.

1197
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,120
 All right.

1198
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:35,280
 And then people will say, Hey, everybody, it's fucking Paul with the Blankety Month

1199
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,280
 bullshit.

1200
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,280
 What the hell?

1201
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,280
 What is this?

1202
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:44,320
 Oh, Paul's character allotment was used up in the title again.

1203
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,320
 Exactly.

1204
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,320
 Exactly.

1205
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:50,160
 Well, that was the other thing too, because we're also putting up candid photos as well

1206
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,520
 as the other digital images.

1207
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,140
 And I put up the max images it would let me do.

1208
00:50:55,140 --> 00:51:01,520
 And then I used the last image space for the header where I put my new artwork up.

1209
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,480
 And that was everything I could do.

1210
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,280
 So maybe they let you put more stuff in the newsletter.

1211
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,280
 I don't know.

1212
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,280
 We'll see.

1213
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,280
 I think they do.

1214
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,280
 Okay.

1215
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,280
 I think they do.

1216
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,280
 All right.

1217
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,280
 Yeah.

1218
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,280
 I'm still learning the ropes.

1219
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,280
 Still learning the ropes.

1220
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,240
 That is actually one of the more fun things, I think, for people who are already on Patreon

1221
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:25,280
 that are going to enjoy this new Patreon even more is you're going to have more direct interaction

1222
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,360
 with Paul via Patreon.

1223
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,640
 Well, that's for sure.

1224
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,680
 That I got news for you is going to be fun.

1225
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,800
 Well, it's going to be a lot of fun.

1226
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,400
 It's going to be a lot of this, but it's also going to be a lot of fun.

1227
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,400
 Yeah.

1228
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,400
 Yeah.

1229
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,360
 And I'll take, I'll take criticisms and tips all the time.

1230
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,360
 Oh yeah.

1231
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,360
 Yeah.

1232
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,320
 Like how the Paul wants notes, how the fuck to make this shit work right.

1233
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:49,120
 Cause yeah, I got to learn my, I got to learn the ropes.

1234
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:53,400
 So I got some off days coming up and I'm going to try and spend some time learning that.

1235
00:51:53,400 --> 00:52:00,720
 And I will probably fire off a test, a zoom chat again before too long just to figure

1236
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,720
 that out.

1237
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,480
 So it might only be 10 minutes, but keep your eyes peeled.

1238
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:10,680
 Well, I'll tell you what else Paul needs to learn and that's the answers to jock versus

1239
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:11,680
 nerd.

1240
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:35,500
 Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for jock versus nerd.

1241
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:39,440
 Explosion.

1242
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,760
 We got a scooperty coming to us today from Smitty scoop gentlemen, I apologize.

1243
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,800
 I have not submitted a scooperty lately, but Jacob's plea on a recent episode motivated

1244
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,640
 me to prepare a scooperty.

1245
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,120
 Here are the updated Smitty scooperty statistics.

1246
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,120
 All time victories.

1247
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,120
 Matt has 13.

1248
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,120
 Paul has three.

1249
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,000
 I have eight all time points.

1250
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,400
 Matt has 32,000.

1251
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,600
 I have 12,400.

1252
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:09,000
 Paul has negative 27,800.

1253
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,360
 I've got to keep it up.

1254
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:15,680
 Negative 27,800.

1255
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:22,000
 Combined accuracy in the last three Smitty scooperties, 75.6% of questions answered correctly.

1256
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,560
 Good job everybody.

1257
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:29,480
 Combined accuracy on all previous Smitty scooperties, 51.4% answered correctly.

1258
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,760
 So we've improved over the last three so that's good for us.

1259
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,140
 Average combined score for the last three is 6,800.

1260
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:40,380
 Average combined score for all of them, negative 1,267.

1261
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,480
 So we are trending in the right directions.

1262
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:47,040
 Let's see if you can beat your all time high score of 12,800.

1263
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,040
 Good luck.

1264
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,240
 This is a Smitty scooperty.

1265
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,240
 Let's go.

1266
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,880
 Oh, by the way, two shout outs.

1267
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:58,720
 One shout out to DJ Stormageddon in the Twitch chat right now.

1268
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,640
 Old friend of ours, DJ Stormageddon from back on the scoop cruise days.

1269
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,640
 Yes.

1270
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,640
 Oh yeah.

1271
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,760
 Got his fucking honeymoon.

1272
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,760
 Got Obelisk on his honeymoon.

1273
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,400
 Obelisk on his honeymoon.

1274
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,200
 And also happy birthday OG Scoop.

1275
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,200
 Happy birthday Andy.

1276
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,200
 Yeah.

1277
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,200
 Happy birthday Andy.

1278
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,400
 Here we go with the scooperty.

1279
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:23,960
 The categories are the most, geography, initialism, and multiple choice.

1280
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:24,960
 Okay.

1281
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,520
 Paul, you're up first.

1282
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,880
 I'll try multiple choice.

1283
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,760
 For 400.

1284
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:37,240
 Which of the following films was not directed by Amy Heckerling?

1285
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:50,200
 Clueless, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Look Who's Talking, or Now and Then.

1286
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,680
 Fast Times B.

1287
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,840
 Fast Times is incorrect.

1288
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,840
 It's Now and Then.

1289
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:01,480
 That was directed by Leslie Lincoln Ladder.

1290
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:05,240
 Paul keeping up his negative score trend here on Smitty Scooperties.

1291
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:06,240
 I've got it.

1292
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,240
 It's time to prove.

1293
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,240
 Already.

1294
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,240
 Matt.

1295
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:13,040
 Geography please, 400.

1296
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:19,800
 Which state bordering Nevada is the largest in area, Alaska, Arizona, California, or Idaho?

1297
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:24,920
 Trying to get me an Alaska bordering Nevada, nice try.

1298
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:30,120
 This is where we find out that Alaska somehow borders Nevada technically.

1299
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,120
 It could possibly.

1300
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,120
 Who knows?

1301
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,120
 California, see.

1302
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,280
 Got to be, right?

1303
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,280
 Yeah.

1304
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:42,760
 California, 163,000 square miles and Arizona and Idaho both have less and Alaska does not

1305
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,760
 border Nevada.

1306
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,280
 It's a good call on all of that, Matt.

1307
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,960
 You got that entire question right, I'll know what the most for 400.

1308
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:58,200
 Which of these NFL franchises has won the most Super Bowl titles, Bears, Colts, Seahawks,

1309
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,200
 or Vikings?

1310
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:03,840
 Is this going to bite me where it's like, Oh, they won the NFL championship, but it

1311
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,000
 wasn't the Super Bowl yet.

1312
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,160
 I think it's the Bears.

1313
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:10,960
 I'll go A, Bears.

1314
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,600
 The Colts.

1315
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,680
 Colts two, Bears one, Seahawks one, Vikings nothing.

1316
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,680
 Wow.

1317
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,920
 Oh, all right then Paul.

1318
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,840
 I'll go initialism for 1200 because why not?

1319
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:28,840
 Oh shit.

1320
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,840
 I'll give you 400.

1321
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:30,840
 All right.

1322
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,920
 What is FYITF short for?

1323
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,680
 Fuck you in the face.

1324
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,680
 Nice job.

1325
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,680
 Or were you just talking to me?

1326
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:39,680
 No, both.

1327
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,680
 Were you answering?

1328
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,680
 Oh, okay.

1329
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,680
 Both.

1330
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,480
 Two birds, one stone.

1331
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:52,080
 I will take geography 800.

1332
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:59,600
 Galica is the name of Northwest, is the name of the Northwest region in what country?

1333
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:05,000
 Austria, France, Italy, or Spain?

1334
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,520
 I'm sure I'm not saying that right.

1335
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,520
 G-A-L-I-C-I-A.

1336
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,520
 Galicia.

1337
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,520
 Galicia?

1338
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,520
 Galicia.

1339
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,520
 Okay.

1340
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,520
 Galicia.

1341
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:18,280
 I'm just going off the correction of my around the chat.

1342
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,280
 Oh, great.

1343
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,280
 Galicia, Austria.

1344
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,280
 Galicia, France.

1345
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,280
 Galicia, Italy.

1346
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,280
 Galicia, Spain.

1347
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,280
 Oh, pass.

1348
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,280
 Oh, no.

1349
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,280
 They can pass it to me.

1350
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,280
 Let's see.

1351
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,280
 I'll do the same thing that Matt was doing.

1352
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,280
 Galicia, Austria.

1353
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,280
 Galicia, France.

1354
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,280
 Galicia, Italy.

1355
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,280
 Galicia, Spain.

1356
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,280
 Galicia.

1357
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,280
 That's right.

1358
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,280
 It's definitely Italy.

1359
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,280
 That's what I think.

1360
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,280
 I think it's Italy too.

1361
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,280
 Galicia, Austria.

1362
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,280
 Galicia, France.

1363
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,280
 Galicia, Italy.

1364
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,280
 Galicia, Spain.

1365
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,280
 Galicia.

1366
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,280
 That's right.

1367
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,280
 It's definitely Italy.

1368
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,280
 That's what I think.

1369
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,280
 I think it's Italy too.

1370
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,280
 Galicia, Italy.

1371
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,280
 Shit.

1372
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,280
 I can guess.

1373
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,280
 Galicia.

1374
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,280
 Galicia.

1375
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,280
 Let's see.

1376
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,280
 I'll try geography for 1,200.

1377
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,280
 Why did I go back to geography?

1378
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,280
 I don't know.

1379
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:05,080
 Which U.S. state capitol is located at the highest elevation, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada,

1380
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,480
 or New Mexico?

1381
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,160
 Oh, this is probably a trick question.

1382
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,080
 I'll say Colorado.

1383
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:14,280
 No, it's New Mexico.

1384
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:21,400
 6,900 feet for New Mexico for Santa Fe, only 5,200 for Denver.

1385
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,400
 Wow.

1386
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,400
 There you go.

1387
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,400
 Who knew?

1388
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,400
 Paul.

1389
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,960
 Initialism for 1,200.

1390
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,160
 What is CPR short for?

1391
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:36,000
 Cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

1392
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,080
 Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is just correct.

1393
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,080
 Wow.

1394
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,080
 That's right.

1395
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,920
 That is just absolutely correct.

1396
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,520
 Oh, wow.

1397
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,920
 I was thinking like compression.

1398
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:45,920
 Yeah.

1399
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:46,920
 No.

1400
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,920
 Matt, you're up.

1401
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,920
 I have a, I think I have a CPR card right here.

1402
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,920
 Yeah.

1403
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:53,920
 And you didn't know?

1404
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,520
 Did you ever ever suck face with Recessa Annie?

1405
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,520
 Yeah.

1406
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,520
 Yeah.

1407
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,480
 She knows how to do it.

1408
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,480
 She does.

1409
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:05,520
 Matt, you're up.

1410
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:09,240
 Geography 2,000.

1411
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:13,920
 What African country recently became the second least populous country to qualify for the

1412
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:19,400
 FIFA World Cup, Cape Verde, Djibouti, Iceland, or Togo?

1413
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,400
 Go with Djibouti.

1414
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,280
 Go with Djibouti.

1415
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,520
 I've been watching Djibouti bounce all day.

1416
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,520
 Yeah.

1417
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,800
 This is 2000, so I'm going to pass.

1418
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,000
 That passes to me.

1419
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,120
 Man, I want to go Djibouti so bad.

1420
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,120
 Do it.

1421
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,120
 I want that Djibouti.

1422
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:42,120
 I kind of think it's Togo.

1423
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,120
 Go.

1424
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,920
 All right.

1425
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,120
 It's going to be Djibouti, but I'm going Togo.

1426
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,120
 Okay.

1427
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,120
 Nope.

1428
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,120
 It's neither.

1429
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,120
 Cape Verde.

1430
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,120
 Cape Verde.

1431
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:57,120
 An island nation west of Senegal near the Canary Islands.

1432
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:00,720
 Iceland is the least populous country to qualify for the World Cup.

1433
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,520
 So there you go.

1434
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,640
 Okay.

1435
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:05,640
 It's me.

1436
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:08,120
 Man, I'm terrible right now.

1437
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:12,040
 I'm going to do multiple choice for 2000.

1438
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:17,720
 Daily Double.

1439
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:22,160
 Frequently hidden in nativity scenes in Catalina, children search for-

1440
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,160
 Catalonia.

1441
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,160
 Catalonia.

1442
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,720
 Oh, Catalonia.

1443
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:29,040
 Children search for El-

1444
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,040
 Cogener.

1445
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:31,040
 Any guesses?

1446
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,040
 Cogener.

1447
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,040
 Okay.

1448
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:39,640
 Who is generally depicted as a peasant in a Catilian red cap doing what?

1449
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:43,960
 Breastfeeding, drinking wine, pooping, or sleeping.

1450
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:46,640
 Pooping, Giggles.

1451
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,680
 I think it is pooping.

1452
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,720
 Is there just in nativity scenes?

1453
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:52,720
 Yes.

1454
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:53,720
 Is there just a guy pooping in the background?

1455
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,120
 There's just a guy in certain places.

1456
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,120
 It's a traditional thing.

1457
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:59,960
 It's like a where's Waldo kind of thing, but it's a pooping guy.

1458
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,760
 I'll go with you because I don't have any other guess on this.

1459
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:03,760
 So I'll say pooping.

1460
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,760
 It is pooping.

1461
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:07,760
 Yeah.

1462
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,520
 Told you.

1463
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:13,760
 Picture Chef Boyardee popping a squat with a conical turd below him.

1464
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,760
 Yeah.

1465
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:15,760
 There you go.

1466
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:16,760
 Yeah.

1467
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:19,880
 It's the most wonderful time of the year.

1468
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,920
 Most wonderful turd of the year.

1469
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,200
 Just goes to show that even people who believe don't really believe.

1470
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,360
 Paul.

1471
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,680
 Initialism.

1472
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,240
 2000.

1473
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,280
 2000.

1474
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,400
 What is HIV short for?

1475
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,440
 Ruining the good mood of a podcast.

1476
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,960
 Am I right?

1477
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:49,600
 Oh, I believe it's a human immunovirus.

1478
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,600
 You going with that?

1479
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:51,600
 Yeah.

1480
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,600
 All right.

1481
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,600
 I think that's correct.

1482
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,600
 Yeah.

1483
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,600
 Human immunodeficiency virus.

1484
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:57,600
 Yeah.

1485
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:58,600
 Yeah.

1486
01:01:58,600 --> 01:01:59,600
 I think you're close enough.

1487
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:00,600
 I would say so.

1488
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,600
 Yeah.

1489
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:02,600
 Matt.

1490
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:08,720
 I will go with the most, for 800, please.

1491
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,960
 Which of these countries has the most people?

1492
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,680
 Egypt, Ethiopia, Nigeria, or Tanzania?

1493
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,880
 Let's see here.

1494
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,680
 I mean, I know the population of Tanzania.

1495
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,160
 I just don't know the other three.

1496
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,160
 Right.

1497
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,160
 Right.

1498
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,160
 Pass.

1499
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,160
 OK.

1500
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,120
 That passes to me.

1501
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,960
 I'm going to do my math out loud.

1502
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,400
 Egypt has a lot of people in it.

1503
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,480
 Ethiopia has a lot of people in it.

1504
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,320
 And Nigeria, they've got a lot of people there.

1505
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:46,600
 And Tanzania, boy, do they have a lot of people.

1506
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:50,440
 Egypt, A. It's Nigeria.

1507
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:57,840
 213 million, Ethiopia, 120 million, Egypt, 109 million, Tanzania, 64 million.

1508
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,920
 We're really throwing off the curve today.

1509
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,000
 I'm losing a lot of money.

1510
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
 Paul's making a lot of money.

1511
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
 Yeah, baby.

1512
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
 Let's see.

1513
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
 The world is upside down.

1514
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
 Yeah.

1515
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,360
 Oh, I need points back.

1516
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:11,600
 I'll do the most for 2000.

1517
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:15,480
 Which of these NHL franchises has won the most Stanley Cup titles?

1518
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:19,960
 The Bruins, the Maple Leaves, the Penguins, or the Red Wings?

1519
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,200
 Hmm.

1520
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,560
 I would like to use my 50/50.

1521
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:29,800
 Paul, which two answers are definitely not correct?

1522
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:35,600
 I would say Penguin, wait, is the one the most Stanley Cup titles?

1523
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,280
 Yeah, Penguins are on my short list.

1524
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:42,120
 Penguins have like four.

1525
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:44,120
 The Leaves, the most.

1526
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:47,520
 You think the Leaves have the most?

1527
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:50,080
 I think it's either the Leaves or the Wings.

1528
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,080
 Yeah.

1529
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,520
 I'll say the Red Wings.

1530
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:53,520
 I'll say Detroit.

1531
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:54,520
 Nope.

1532
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:56,080
 It's the Maple Leaves.

1533
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,080
 It was the Leaves.

1534
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,080
 13.

1535
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:59,080
 Red Wings are 11.

1536
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:00,080
 It was the Maple Leaves.

1537
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,440
 Jacob continues losing points.

1538
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,440
 Paul.

1539
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:06,360
 I'll go with Initialism.

1540
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,720
 For 800.

1541
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:10,120
 What is IQ short for?

1542
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:12,760
 Intelligence Quotient.

1543
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,240
 Intelligence Quotient is correct.

1544
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:17,880
 Paul must have a very high IQ to know that indeed.

1545
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:22,720
 Oh yes, clearly very IQ-y.

1546
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:26,120
 Matt Donnelly, you got the most or multiple choice.

1547
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,720
 You have 400 points by the way.

1548
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:28,720
 You're well ahead of me.

1549
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:33,840
 I have 5200 points in the negative, and Paul has 4,000 points.

1550
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,880
 So Paul is one order of magnitude ahead of you.

1551
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,580
 There is one Daily Double left.

1552
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:41,000
 Your only hope is that Paul gets it and loses.

1553
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,080
 Right, a man can hope.

1554
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:46,200
 I will do multiple choice 1200 please.

1555
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,200
 Daily Double!

1556
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:58,920
 In the 2024 US presidential election, what is the one state that Donald Trump won that

1557
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:03,320
 he previously lost in both the 2016 and 2020 elections?

1558
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:06,720
 Arizona, Nevada, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.

1559
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,680
 Be Nevada, Tom.

1560
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:12,320
 My name is Jacob, but it is Nevada.

1561
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:14,560
 Nevada, Tom.

1562
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:18,320
 And Paul and Brett Mukai have been blamed for this.

1563
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,320
 They moved out.

1564
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,320
 For moving out of Nevada.

1565
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,320
 Two votes.

1566
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,320
 Slow down.

1567
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,800
 You don't know who they were voting for.

1568
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:28,380
 I'll go with multiple choice for 800.

1569
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:35,320
 The San Marzino tomato originated in the small town of San Marzino del Surro, which is located

1570
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,880
 in which Italian region?

1571
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:44,340
 Calabria, Campania, Sardinia, or Sicily.

1572
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:47,680
 This I talk about this all the time.

1573
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:54,880
 I talk about Italian tomatoes, all types of Italian tomatoes, nobody loves Italian tomatoes

1574
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,680
 more than I do.

1575
01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:05,880
 And that is why I will go with A, which is incorrect.

1576
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,240
 It was B, what is that?

1577
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:12,560
 Oh, the province of Salerno in the region of Campania.

1578
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:16,440
 Oh, it was the region that threw me off.

1579
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,000
 That's what got me.

1580
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
 That's what got me.

1581
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,400
 I was in the wrong region.

1582
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:24,640
 Paul closing out the category and the game that he's already won the most for 1200.

1583
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:31,680
 Which of these Major League Baseball franchises has won the most World Series titles?

1584
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:35,960
 The Athletics, the Cardinals, the Phillies, the Pirates.

1585
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:40,480
 And I believe the answer was given in the question here.

1586
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:47,080
 Ian Smitty typed out this stupidly because below that it says Cardinals 11, Athletics

1587
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:50,280
 9, Pirates 5, and Phillies 2.

1588
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:57,200
 So Paul, with all of that in mind, which of these MLB franchises has won the most World

1589
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,200
 Series titles?

1590
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:01,200
 Athletics, Cardinals, Phillies, or Pirates.

1591
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:05,280
 But I'm going to have to go out on a wing and say Cardinals.

1592
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:09,440
 Oh man, I hope that those are just incorrect stats there.

1593
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,680
 That'd be funny.

1594
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:12,680
 They're not.

1595
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:13,680
 It's the Cardinals.

1596
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:16,200
 Paul gets more points.

1597
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,200
 That's the game.

1598
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,200
 Thank you, Smitty Scoop.

1599
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,200
 Smitty, I won one.

1600
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,200
 Paul crushed it.

1601
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,200
 I won one, Smitty.

1602
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:27,240
 Paul crushed it with 5,200 points, Matson second with 1,600, Ivan third with negative

1603
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,240
 6,000.

1604
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:29,240
 Jesus fuck.

1605
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,240
 I'm creeping towards the positive.

1606
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,880
 Now you know how I feel on most of those.

1607
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:33,880
 Look at you go.

1608
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:39,760

 Make us a scooperty.

1612
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,640
 Make us a Price is Skripe jock versus nerd.

1613
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:47,280
 Make us an Obelisk jock versus nerd.

1614
