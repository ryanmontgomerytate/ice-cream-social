2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,160
 This is the part of the show where we thank you, the Ice Cream Truck Drivers.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,960
 Thank you so much Ice Cream Truck Drivers.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,960
 I'll tell you what guys, I am going through these lists.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,160
 I am so close.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,160
 I'm really close to being able to thank each and every one of you by name this month.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,000
 And by the next episode, I'm gonna do it.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,860
 I'm gonna thank each and every Ice Cream Truck Driver by name this month.

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:35,560
 At this part of the episode, don't you worry all you Ice Cream Truck Drivers out there.

10

 Ooh, a show.

20
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,160
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social?

21
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,160
 Yeah, I'd love to.

22
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,160
 Great, let's go.

23
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,160
 Are we on Squish taken?

24
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,160
 We are on Squish.

25
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,160
 Oh, hello.

26
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,160
 Hello, Squish.

27
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:53,160
 Ann advised me to raise my computers.

28
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,160
 All the problems are solved.

29
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,160
 It's time for Matt Mattingly's ice cream social.

30
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,160
 Sitting over there in Las Vegas, it's Matt Mattingly.

31
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,160
 Sitting over there with a nice raised computer, it's Paul Mattingly.

32
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
 I'm Jacob the Audio Guy.

33
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,160
 We're preaching fun.

34
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,160
 You don't want to go chin gut first to the audience, Paul?

35
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,160
 I mean, I can do whatever is going to sell the tickets.

36
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,160
 Whatever is going to put butts in seats.

37
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,160
 I know some people are here for the chin gut.

38
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,160
 I'll tell you, now I just have to find a more permanent solution.

39
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:35,160
 Because right now, the computer is balanced on a big stack of DVD holder bags.

40
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,160
 Oh, no.

41
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,160
 Bags?

42
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,160
 Bags.

43
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,160
 What do you mean bags?

44
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,160
 Bags.

45
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,160
 So these are what I got.

46
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,160
 What's a DVD holder bag?

47
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,160
 This is a DVD holder bag.

48
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,160
 Oh, like a CD wallet, a big CD wallet bag thing.

49
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,160
 Sort of.

50
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,160
 But it holds DVDs.

51
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,160
 I see what you mean.

52
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,160
 I'm trying to describe it for the audience who can't see your crazy thing that you have

53
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,160
 your computer balanced on.

54
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,160
 It holds whole DVDs.

55
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,160
 I've got a stack of five of these in another bag.

56
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:14,160
 And then on top of that, I have precariously rested a box of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

57
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:20,160
 little figure people from Fisher Price on top of that.

58
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,160
 You don't have books?

59
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,160
 In another box.

60
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,160
 I do have books.

61
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,160
 But I feel like, you know what's funny, Matt?

62
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,160
 You know what's funny?

63
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,160
 That was my first thought.

64
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:35,160
 First of all, right next to me is where I keep my stack of--

65
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
 So incredulous.

66
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,160
 Well, I keep my stack of improv books right here next to me.

67
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,160
 Yes.

68
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160
 OK?

69
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,160
 I just happen to take all my improv books.

70
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
 Should I use these books?

71
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,160
 No.

72
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,160
 No, I took them all.

73
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,160
 They're in my backpack.

74
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,160
 I took them all to class for my first class on Monday to show everybody what books to

75
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,160
 check out if they're interested in looking up more improv stuff.

76
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,160
 So I don't have-- but here's the other thing.

77
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,160
 Here's the other thing.

78
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,160
 Nice.

79
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,160
 Stack of wires.

80
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,160
 I do have a box of wires.

81
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,160
 It's a box.

82
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,160
 Just don't worry about what's in the box.

83
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,160
 It's a box of wires.

84
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,160
 It's the box that matters.

85
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,160
 Well, I've got a box of wires right down here that'll work.

86
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,160
 Matt just shifted his camera so that we could see a clear box filled with some electronic

87
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
 doohickeys that he has just sitting in his office.

88
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,160
 It's all my audio equipment for any kind of podcasting.

89
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,160
 Yeah, I've got--

90
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,160
 It's an excellent box to set a laptop on.

91
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,160
 If Matt needed a box to set a laptop on, I'd be like, Matt, use that box right there.

92
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,160
 I didn't notice what was in it.

93
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,160
 I'll have to do that.

94
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,160
 Unfortunately, the space here is limited.

95
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,160
 I'll figure it out.

96
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,160
 But I do need a box.

97
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,160
 I'm crazy, I'm a box not bags guy when it comes to putting valuable equipment on a--

98
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:50,160
 But I'm also a bags not books guy because for whatever reason, my brain goes to, oh,

99
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,160
 but what if I need that book?

100
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,160
 I'll send you some of my magic books that I've never cracked.

101
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,160
 I'll send you some of those.

102
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,160
 Oh, shit.

103
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,160
 No, no, no, no, no.

104
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,160
 I have-- do you have sentimental books that you keep in your home?

105
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,160
 Yes.

106
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,160
 Oh, yeah.

107
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,160
 I have several sentimental books that I keep in my home that I can't imagine ever reading,

108
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,160
 but they were given to me by family members--

109
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
 Oh, that you never read?

110
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
 --or something like that.

111
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,160
 Oh, yeah, I have something I never read.

112
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
 Oh, no, I don't have any--

113
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
 My uncle was an automotive expert.

114
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
 Oh.

115
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,160
 He would go to court and testify for-- I'm really not exactly sure, so I'm telling you

116
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,160
 kind of what I understand.

117
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,160
 Was he the one behind unsafe at any speed?

118
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,160
 Wasn't that Ralph Nader?

119
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,160
 Yeah, it was Ralph Nader.

120
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,160
 Oh, OK.

121
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
 No, that was Ralph Nader's fault.

122
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,160
 Ralph Nader?

123
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,160
 Holy shit!

124
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,160
 Jacob Nader?

125
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,160
 I did have an aunt-- or I guess I do-- who worked for Ralph Nader.

126
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,160
 She used to be like his chief of staff or something.

127
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,160
 It's all coming together.

128
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,160
 What a tangled web we weave.

129
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,160
 We have technical scoop port in the chat here.

130
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,160
 It is technical scoop port for a living.

131
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,160
 I'm wondering, do you ever have to address what people are putting their computers on

132
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,160
 top of as a technical scoop port person?

133
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,160
 Yeah.

134
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,160
 He says yes.

135
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
 He's nodding.

136
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160
 He's nodding.

137
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,160
 He's just nodding with-- all the time, he says in the chat.

138
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,160
 All the time.

139
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
 All the time.

140
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,160
 So people's computers just fall off of things all the time.

141
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,160
 I've put on a series of delightful pillows, and now I'm having difficulty operating my

142
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
 computer.

143
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,160
 Oh, have you ever had the thing where they--

144
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,160
 Perfectly balanced.

145
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,160
 Have you ever had the thing where they stack the laptop up on pillows and everything, and

146
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,160
 then the pillows clog up the fans and the laptop overheats?

147
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,160
 Right.

148
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

149
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,160
 That's happened to me.

150
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,160
 I had them--

151
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,160
 Just blocking up the fans.

152
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,160
 I had it stacked up on a bunch of bananas.

153
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
 Yeah, there you go.

154
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,160
 And the bananas went south of cheese, and then my laptop got infested with fruit flies.

155
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
 So--

156
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:50,160
 So you have a record.

157
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,160
 Paul, say that sentence again.

158
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,160
 Well, I--

159
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,160
 Or the--

160
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,160
 I stacked my-- no, I didn't really.

161
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
 I was playing.

162
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,160
 I was playing.

163
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,160
 I would not stack my computer on well-stacked bananas, let them go to rot, and then let

164
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,160
 the computer--

165
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,160
 Bullshit.

166
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,160
 Bullshit.

167
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
 You would not do that.

168
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,160
 I wouldn't do that.

169
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,160
 No, no, no.

170
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,160
 If you came into this basement, I will tell you what you would not find.

171
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:27,480
 Any food or decayable items outside of laundry detergent and a bottle or two of diet soda.

172
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
 That's it.

173
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
 There is nothing--

174
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
 What about small rodents?

175
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,480
 What about swirls?

176
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,400
 Everything else in this basement is plastique, baby.

177
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
 Plastique.

178
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,800
 Plastic or pressed wood.

179
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,180
 That's all that lives in this basement.

180
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,200
 I'll give you some pressed wood.

181
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,480
 When all-- when all the kids left my--

182
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,440
 All my shelves are fucking pressed wood.

183
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,440
 When all the kids left my birthday party, I took all the leftover balloon animals, put

184
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,360
 them in one pile, and I put my computer right on top of the old balloon animal.

185
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,360
 Let it heat up.

186
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,360
 Really propped it up well.

187
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
 Paul.

188
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,760
 No, I have books about like auto accidents and stuff.

189
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,400
 My uncle used to go testify about auto accidents and like tire marks on highways and that kind

190
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,400
 of thing.

191
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
 He was one of those types of expert witnesses.

192
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
 It'd be like--

193
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,400
 So I've got books about that kind of stuff.

194
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
 Well, Your Honor--

195
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,000
 I'm like, I'm not going to read these books, but they're cool.

196
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 They're--

197
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,520
 Your Honor, clearly the victim in this crime was a worthless piece of shit because there

198
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,560
 were no tire marks in front of where he was struck by the vehicle.

199
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,920
 He was clearly not even in an automobile.

200
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,440
 Your Honor, clearly denoting him as one of the poor.

201
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,920
 One of the poor.

202
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,520
 One of the worthless piece of shit poor.

203
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,600
 One of the poor who the law does not apply to.

204
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
 One of the poor.

205
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
 All right, Matt.

206
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
 What did you want to know?

207
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,720
 Well, I'm just saying, Jacob's uncle was trying to get him paid.

208
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,160
 You know, you get paid to testify in court when you're an expert.

209
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,160
 Oh, yeah.

210
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,160
 No.

211
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,160
 Sometimes, yeah.

212
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,160
 He was a paid expert witness, for sure.

213
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,160
 Making that money.

214
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,160
 Making that dollar.

215
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,640
 He worked for LSU, and he was a paid expert in those types of cases.

216
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,320
 Now, he wasn't working for the big auto people, was he?

217
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,320
 No, no, no.

218
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,120
 He was a university professor at LSU.

219
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,120
 Oh, so he was standing up for the middlemen.

220
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,800
 He was an independent expert.

221
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,120
 He would come in and testify for, like, yeah, just testify to the facts of an auto accident.

222
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,520
 Leon piping up in the chat that he has to pay quite a bit for his expert witnesses,

223
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,120
 so he would know.

224
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,120
 Yeah.

225
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,080
 Yeah, yeah.

226
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,080
 So Paul.

227
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,080
 Yes.

228
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,360
 I'm going to tell you a story that's going to make you too messent, buddy.

229
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,520
 I've got a feeling about what it is.

230
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,520
 Go ahead.

231
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,520
 Tell me.

232
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:38,920
 So I was going to mail some things out yesterday to the UPS store nearby my house.

233
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,440
 It's actually totally random.

234
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,300
 Someone reached out and said, "Hey, this is a crazy question, but I guess this is what

235
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,800
 Facebook is for.

236
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,380
 I think I went to one of your comedy shows in the '90s, and I bought one of your shirts

237
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,120
 that said possible side effects, but said free sex."

238
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,240
 Oh, yeah, yeah, the one that says two different things depending on where you are.

239
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
 Yeah.

240
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,360
 If you look in our store, the salt pork shirt is based on ...

241
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,440
 Yeah, we modeled it after that.

242
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,360
 And apologies to Mike Nilsen for using UPS.

243
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
 They're closer, buddy.

244
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,880
 FedEx is all the way up on Stephanie.

245
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:21,200
 Anyway, this is a side note, but yeah, yeah, so they reached out and I was like, "Oh my

246
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,000
 gosh," and I was like, "I don't know where those shirts are," and I go, "You know what?

247
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,560
 I have a box of old shit in my garage.

248
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,880
 I bet I have one in there," and I looked into my box and I found my last free sex possible

249
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,320
 side effects shirt, and I thought, "Well, it's sitting in a box for me, and this person

250
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:45,040
 wants it to wear or hang up," so I went to the UPS store to mail this person the shirt.

251
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,040
 That's very kind of you.

252
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,320
 So a part of you decided that you didn't need to hold onto that for the future Matt Donnelly

253
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,320
 Museum.

254
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,320
 Yes.

255
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
 Go ahead and just give that away.

256
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
 Okay.

257
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,440
 Matt at 47 looking back at the t-shirt he made when he was in his 20s is a fine length of

258
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,680
 time to remember that time.

259
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,680
 Yeah, I agree.

260
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,600
 Ever since I showed Paul my rig, slowly my laptop's been sliding into my lap, so I'm

261
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,240
 going to do this again.

262
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,520
 Oh, and yet my DVD bags remain solidly steadfast.

263
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,520
 How strange.

264
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,520
 All right.

265
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,520
 Time in scoops.

266
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,520
 Team bag, team box, team books.

267
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,520
 Let's go.

268
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,520
 Let's go.

269
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,520
 Paul was right.

270
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,520
 Paul was right.

271
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,520
 Paul was right.

272
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,520
 Get more bananas.

273
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:35,240
 But it wouldn't have done it unless I showed you my thing and I put everything out of my

274
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
 arrangement.

275
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,000
 It's a poor craftsman blames his tools, Matt.

276
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 I'm so happy right now.

277
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 I was so close.

278
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 I ran out of time.

279
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,200
 I was so close to adjusting my monitor setup in my office here before we started today.

280
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:56,440
 And I'm so glad I didn't be falling over right now.

281
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,920
 I right next door to the UPS store is the comic book store.

282
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,680
 Oh, yeah.

283
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,400
 And I was like, man, Paul got me that absolute Batman trade.

284
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,320
 You hit it exactly the right day.

285
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,320
 Serendipity.

286
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,320
 Totally.

287
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,320
 I didn't realize it.

288
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,120
 I walked into the complex with the day it came out, the day of volume two.

289
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
 Oh, really?

290
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,880
 Yeah, I gave absolute volume to absolute Batman.

291
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,880
 Yeah.

292
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,240
 Oh, crazy.

293
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,360
 I walked in and he was like, hey, what are you here for?

294
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,960
 I was like, you know, I got some curious about absolute Batman goes on.

295
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
 That's right.

296
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
 That came out today.

297
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,960
 And I go, I didn't realize it.

298
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,400
 I literally just happened to be mailing something next door and he's like, yo, yeah, no, it's

299
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
 a great book.

300
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
 Are you enjoying it?

301
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,360
 And I want to be like, look, we can do small talk, but I am not one of you is what I really

302
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
 wanted to say.

303
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
 Right.

304
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,040
 But I can't jump in, like stop him and explain to him, be like, no, no, I really didn't know

305
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:54,000
 until it was coming, I was like, oh man, I don't, I was like, I was like, my kids come

306
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 here because they're in the system.

307
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,440
 I was like, maybe because my kids come here because children buy comic books and um, uh,

308
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:09,440
 and so do well educated men and women and people of indeterminate gender or whatever

309
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,440
 they want to be.

310
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:16,240
 He pulled right ahead, he was like, you closeted nerd and he just, he just dove right in.

311
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
 Yeah.

312
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,240
 Good for him.

313
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
 He knows he knew you.

314
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,240
 Yeah.

315
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,240
 One of us.

316
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,240
 Okay.

317
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,000
 And, and I said, it's really my podcast partner who turned it me onto this thought bond.

318
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,160
 He goes, oh, what's your podcast?

319
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,200
 I gave him a chip that last time.

320
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:38,640
 Well, Paul, so did I, and I, I'm just saying I went in, chipped him again.

321
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,840
 I took him again to message Paul.

322
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,600
 I am he as like, so I bought an absolute Batman.

323
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,840
 He said there were two other books in the series that aren't included in the trades,

324
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,840
 right?

325
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,040
 Art, art cam and some other adventure.

326
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,040
 And I bought those.

327
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,040
 Wow.

328
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
 Look at you.

329
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
 You're even deeper than me right now.

330
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,520
 Oh, he even upsold you.

331
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,280
 He upsold me because here's what happened.

332
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:07,640
 I flew on frontier and that's a hell, that's a hellscape that humans don't deserve.

333
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:17,000
 Uh, among, among it being the Maury Pulvich show airlines, um, uh, uh, Jerry Springer

334
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,560
 airlines, it's, it's, it's, uh, it's also no wifi and while you sit on those uncomfortable

335
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:29,520
 lawn chairs, it's a wifi and my absolute Batman got me through a flight and I was like, oh,

336
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,960
 I need to just have this handy for my next, uh, uh, travel.

337
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,640
 And so, um, I bought, I bought up, I bought the thing.

338
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,680
 So I, I, I bought, I put my name in the system and I chipped the guy and he said, do you

339
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,680
 want to check out our podcast?

340
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,680
 Fantastic, dude.

341
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,680
 All right.

342
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,600
 I am so proud of you, uh, on so many levels, uh, nerd brought this up though.

343
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,360
 I, I, do you, cause you always do wifi on the planes.

344
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,360
 I do.

345
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,160
 Paul, do you do wifi when you fly or no?

346
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,160
 Not usually.

347
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,160
 No, I don't either.

348
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,480
 I use, I kind of enjoy the, uh, the few hours where I'm disconnected.

349
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,640
 I read a book or I go into airplane mode and I turn on something I've downloaded.

350
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,960
 I usually just listen to podcasts when I'm flying.

351
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,160
 I'm aware that you can get wifi on planes.

352
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,320
 I just don't really think to do it.

353
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,800
 I'll turn on my podcast and fall asleep is what I do.

354
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
 That's fair.

355
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,800
 That's, that's kind of the whole thing.

356
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,840
 Did you have to rewind your podcast and find it and find where you left off?

357
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,280
 No, it's usually just podcasts.

358
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,080
 I've decided these are just my sleep podcast for the, yeah, cause I travel with just my

359
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,080
 phone.

360
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,300
 I'm a little bit of an ogre and don't know how to download an episode of television to

361
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,300
 my phone.

362
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,960
 So I usually just try to see if the wifi is strong enough.

363
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,960
 Oh, right.

364
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,960
 Right.

365
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,720
 So I know like different airlines have different strengths of wifi.

366
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,920
 Netflix is generally pretty agreeable to even the weakest wifi.

367
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,440
 Well, Netflix is also the app that works best for downloading stuff too.

368
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,440
 Okay.

369
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,600
 Well now, now Netflix has the best download technology on their app.

370
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,720
 So they are the best in airplane mode.

371
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
 That's what I have to start doing.

372
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
 So I'm jealous.

373
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,680
 But now like HBO and some of those others have caught up a little bit with the app technology.

374
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,440
 When I see them download, I'm so jealous of people who have downloaded full shows or movies

375
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,040
 to watch on the plane.

376
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,240
 Oh yeah.

377
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,560
 You're ahead of the curve busting out the graphic novel, dude.

378
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,800
 You're ahead of the curve, having the trade paperback because people can be, but plus

379
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,320
 I'm telling you like you're on the right track.

380
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:22,200
 You cannot go wrong with that absolute Batman book because Scott Snyder, who did the whole

381
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,960
 court of owls series and a bunch of other Batman stuff that I love a lot of his work.

382
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
 Yeah.

383
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:35,320
 He's done some of the best Batman of the last 15 years, but this, uh, series, uh, it is

384
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,640
 selling so well.

385
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,800
 Like numbers keep going up her issue.

386
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,760
 I believe they're on issue 18 and the orders are higher than when they started, which is

387
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,000
 crazy for any.

388
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Oh, right.

389
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Right.

390
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 So it's increasing in popularity.

391
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Yes.

392
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 People are buying it.

393
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 More people.

394
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,080
 So comic books or comic shops are ordering more copies.

395
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:02,840
 So it is just, it is growing, growing, growing in a way that is not, not normal, uh, because

396
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,840
 it's that popular.

397
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:10,680
 So your look, what you're reading right now in 10 years will probably be the DCU film

398
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,120
 adaptation that that's what seems like it's headed for sure.

399
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,120
 Oh, gotcha.

400
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,840
 Let me ask you something simply because it's so popular.

401
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,840
 Yes.

402
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,440
 These, these different kinds of, uh, Batman properties, like back, back in the day there'd

403
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,280
 be like the, the detective Batman and now there's, and now there's this, you know, all

404
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,760
 these, all the different things.

405
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,560
 Is that, that's just different writers or different creators all under the same corporate

406
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,360
 umbrella or is it different people that are going to them to do this?

407
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,600
 Or are these part, I guess what I'm asking is like, is the author of this current Batman

408
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,560
 series that y'all are talking about here, is that somebody who's been working with the

409
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:51,760
 Batman comic, uh, group, whatever, whatever they are for some time.

410
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,240
 Uh, has he been working with DC or have they been working with DC for some time?

411
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,240
 Yes.

412
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,680
 Or is this like a new person that has come in to, to push things in a different direction?

413
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,240
 No, Scott Snyder has done Batman forever.

414
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,800
 Uh, as far as, oh, yeah, I didn't realize this was Scott Snyder comic book time.

415
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,800
 I know that name.

416
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,800
 Yeah.

417
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,800
 Yeah.

418
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:17,280
 And so he's been at it for a while and this is a new re-imagining reboot of the character,

419
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,640
 uh, a very interesting take, which I love.

420
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,200
 So it lets everything become kind of fresh and new and everything's under this absolute

421
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,560
 umbrella.

422
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,520
 So I don't know if you recall it's, it's, it's crazy to me that it was 20 years ago

423
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,160
 when the Marvel Ultimates started, but it did.

424
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:41,580
 So Ultimates is what basically inspired the MCU.

425
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:46,600
 So the movies, the films that you see are essentially based off the Ultimates in a lot

426
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
 of, in a lot of ways.

427
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:54,840
 So, um, Ultimate Spider-Man was probably the strongest, followed very closely by the Ultimates,

428
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,840
 which was the Avengers.

429
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
 Got it.

430
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,080
 So those are the two books that I followed really closely, but you know, every, every

431
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,120
 little while you've got to do a reset.

432
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:10,760
 And currently DC is eating Marvel's lunch, uh, as far as the success they're having with

433
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:16,960
 the absolute line, which allows for these characters to be set in a new timeline, new

434
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:24,080
 era, new stuff, and not say, you know, we're not throwing out the baby with the bathwater.

435
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,320
 You still have all the other classic stuff and there are still ongoing series based more

436
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,860
 closely on classic interpretations of the characters.

437
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,920
 This is not the only Batman book right now.

438
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,560
 This is not even the main Batman book.

439
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,840
 The main Batman book, I believe, I want to say, is it Zdarsky who's got it right?

440
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,240
 No, Zdarsky doesn't have it right now.

441
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,240
 Okay.

442
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,240
 Let me ask you this.

443
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,980
 Um, whatever, whoever is writing the main Batman book and then Snyder writing, writing

444
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,980
 this one.

445
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,980
 Yeah.

446
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,720
 Are those people working together in any way?

447
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,880
 They are not having, are they having discussions?

448
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,480
 Are they, are they like, uh, coordinating, storyboarding, anything like that?

449
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,480
 Not there.

450
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,480
 They're completely separate.

451
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,840
 And they're the only way that I'm more curious about the business aspect of, of like how

452
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,840
 these things work.

453
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,800
 You know, like, is it like the, you mentioned the MCU and film.

454
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,120
 Is it like that where you have kind of the whole thing story boarded out?

455
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,120
 Now this is the thing.

456
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,000
 And then you're trying to, hold on, hold on, you're like, you're trying to work within

457
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 that storyboard.

458
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Yes.

459
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,640
 Or is it, uh, several different artists working independently but kind of keeping an eye on

460
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,640
 each other?

461
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:37,560
 Within the Absolute Universe, they are just now starting to do crossovers within the Absolute

462
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,560
 Universe.

463
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:43,040
 So Absolute Wonder Woman has met Absolute Batman.

464
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,640
 So that's, it's starting there, those characters are starting to interact within the Absolute

465
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,640
 Universe.

466
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,640
 How did it go?

467
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,640
 I don't know.

468
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
 I didn't read it yet.

469
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
 Oh, straight to anal.

470
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,640
 I don't vote.

471
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,640
 Straight to anal.

472
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,440
 I'm still waiting for my Absolute Wonder Woman volume two also, but yes, Jacob, that's kind

473
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,440
 of been a weird thing.

474
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,640
 They both discovered they were tops and then it got awkward.

475
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:10,480
 It's been a weird thing with all the, um, uh, you know, the crossovers that these comic

476
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,040
 book companies have become addicted to.

477
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:20,280
 So when you do something like Civil War or Secret Wars or KO is the big crossover event

478
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,720
 that's happening right now in DC.

479
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,980
 So a lot of the mainline books do have to communicate with each other because their

480
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,200
 main characters are interacting with each other, but a lot of times that will throw

481
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,200
 a monkey wrench into what other creators are working on in their individual books and it'll

482
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,800
 either completely fuck up the story in some way and they go have to rejigger everything

483
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:45,920
 or they'll just be like, well, here's two issues that don't have anything to do with

484
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,440
 the continuity we're trying to project, but this fits in with the ongoing overarching

485
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,840
 storyline that's happening in the universe.

486
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,240
 Like Paul, you brought up that like the, uh, Marvel just launched a thing called Secret

487
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,480
 Wars because they thought war and secret were exciting words for kids.

488
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,480
 Yes.

489
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,960
 That was the thing that they did back in the eighties.

490
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,960
 Yeah.

491
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,480
 And that's why I think DC just launched a new series called, uh, La Boo Boo, Mr. Beast.

492
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,680
 So wow, it's going to fly off the fucking shelves.

493
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,680
 Yeah.

494
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,040
 So it's, it's sold out.

495
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
 That's the way to do it.

496
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:18,960
 I just saw there was a, uh, George Lucas, La Boo Boo limited edition.

497
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,240
 How big, how big is the goiter on it?

498
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,240
 Look at it.

499
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:29,080
 It doesn't, it doesn't not look like him, but he's wearing like, who else does it not

500
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,160
 look like George Lucas?

501
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,480
 And that is the following sponsor today's show.

502
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,640
 Matt Manley's ice cream social is brought to you by these fine makers and providers

503
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,640
 of products.

504
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:45,040
 Uh, a single photograph of us president, Martin Van Buren.

505
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,040
 That's right.

506
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:51,960
 Today being sold to you could be a single photograph of us president, Martin Van Buren

507
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,880
 and that's from Belgian triple scoop in 2025.

508
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,880
 Hello.

509
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:03,520
 I am a single photograph of Martin Van Buren.

510
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,440
 I am speaking to you through the magic of picture magic.

511
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,040
 Uh, this photograph talks.

512
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,160
 That's why it's so expensive.

513
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,920
 That's the only way we can keep the company afloat.

514
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,800
 I cost $18 million and after I'm sold, that's it.

515
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:27,040
 We're shutting the doors on the storefront, we're closed for business, but we'll stay

516
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:34,000
 open until someone buys me the talking picture of Martin Van Buren.

517
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 That's all.

518
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 That's it.

519
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,660
 However, I'm sorry, was that a prerecorded message or can you have conversations with

520
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,660
 people?

521
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,660
 I can talk to people.

522
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,660
 Welcome.

523
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,660
 Yeah.

524
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,660
 Welcome to the shop.

525
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,660
 That's why I'm so expensive.

526
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,660
 I'm $18 million.

527
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,660
 Yeah.

528
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,660
 Here's the thing.

529
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,800
 Are you, are you conscious?

530
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:56,400
 Yeah, very much so and to the point where I've been giving advice to my business partners,

531
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,440
 I've been telling them this is a stupid business plan just to sell one picture of Martin Van

532
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,440
 Buren.

533
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,580
 Talking or not, conscious or not, $18 million, that's great, but what are you doing?

534
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,960
 Your overhead's got to be out of control for the rental of this space.

535
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:18,040
 So I've decided that we're going into furniture as well as my picture.

536
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:23,640
 So you can buy the Martin Van Bureau while you're here.

537
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,960
 You could shop and buy one of my beautiful Martin Van Bureaus suitable to put me on top

538
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,960
 of someday.

539
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,960
 Yeah.

540
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,760
 Does the, does the bureau also speak?

541
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,000
 I'm afraid not.

542
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,220
 Unless you put me in it, you could do that.

543
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:43,160
 You could stick my picture inside and I'd be like, "I'm in this bureau, haunted or something.

544
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,160
 I don't know."

545
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,880
 Well, it's not really haunted though.

546
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,200
 I'm just, I'm just a talking picture.

547
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,200
 It's different from a haunting.

548
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,800
 It's a good question, are you a talking picture or do you have the consciousness of Martin

549
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
 Van Buren?

550
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
 Not at all.

551
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,080
 I'm just a picture that has consciousness.

552
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,480
 Oh, you just look like Martin Van Buren.

553
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,480
 Yes.

554
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,600
 Well, I'm just a picture of Martin Van Buren.

555
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,640
 I look like a two dimensional image of, yeah.

556
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,440
 Do you know which president Martin Van Buren was?

557
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,440
 No.

558
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,440
 I don't even know who I am.

559
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,860
 I don't know what I am.

560
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,640
 I'm a picture thing.

561
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:21,080
 Are you also selling a red and white wine blend from France?

562
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,520
 Yes.

563
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,520
 You are.

564
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,520
 Okay, good.

565
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,680
 I was worried someone else was trying to profit from your name and selling Martin Van Bordo.

566
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,680
 No.

567
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:35,280
 Martin Van Bordo's are being, you can get, you can buy the Martin Van Bureau stack with

568
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,440
 Martin Van Bordo.

569
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,200
 I actually stack my laptop on top of some Martin Van Bordo.

570
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,200
 Just bottles?

571
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,200
 Just bottles.

572
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,200
 Just bottles.

573
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,200
 It's very sturdy.

574
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,280
 Well, I also, I also told the guys, you know, hey, what do the kids love?

575
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,200
 They love the vape.

576
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,200
 Huh?

577
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,200
 Yeah.

578
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:05,560
 So we got, we got you hooked up G. We got that sticky icky, if you know what I'm saying.

579
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,680
 So come on in and try some of Martin Van Blazen's.

580
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:18,280
 420, what up G. Now you're not selling containers of just your piss, are you?

581
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,280
 Martin Van urine, of course.

582
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,280
 Okay.

583
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,280
 All right.

584
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,000
 Let me make sure this line is very diverse.

585
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,960
 But it's not just containers of my piss.

586
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,320
 It's in custom shoes made for skateboarders.

587
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:52,160
 For Martin's Vans urine, the soggy step, Vans urine, a bird sanctuary, Martin Van Aaron.

588
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,160
 Yeah.

589
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,160
 I like that.

590
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,160
 That's good.

591
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,880
 Oh, I had a kitty cat named Martin Van Purin.

592
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,640
 I was like, uh, Katie, Kitty, Kitty Purin, good one, Leon.

593
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,600
 We, if, if my brain had been in a more punny place, we could have rocked that a little

594
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,600
 bit longer.

595
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,480
 I was, I was, I'm still pulling on the old, that's a shame.

596
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,040
 I'm pulling on the old motor.

597
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,040
 Oh boy.

598
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:25,600
 You son of a bit too bad for the rest of this is that he had his, his, his laptop on a book

599
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,640
 of puns so he couldn't access it.

600
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,640
 That's right.

601
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,640
 He needed that book.

602
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,900
 Never stack, never stack on books.

603
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,760
 You might need that book.

604
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,800
 Listen to my own fucking advice.

605
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,320
 I'm stupid matter.

606
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,960
 Your boy's trying to buy up all the Mr. Beast jerky and whatnot.

607
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:51,640
 You know, they're surprisingly not, uh, as like Uber focused like that.

608
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:56,640
 So like for a second, my youngest was in the prime drinks and then, but then he's like,

609
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,720
 after I was like, these don't taste good.

610
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
 I'm going to stop buying them.

611
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,680
 Oh, for God's sake, they're the worst shit ever.

612
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,560
 Those Paul boys are the devil.

613
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,640
 Now Mr. Beast does pride himself on doing ethical chocolate, which actually is like

614
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,160
 a huge thing that we don't like to talk about because who wants to start taking pride in

615
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,160
 their chocolate.

616
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,160
 I thought that was only in Vegas.

617
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
 Well, I'm in Vegas.

618
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:22,560
 I don't know if it is anywhere else, ethylm chocolate, isn't that a Vegas company?

619
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,000
 It is a Vegas company.

620
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 Yes.

621
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 Okay.

622
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Yeah.

623
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 Oh, ethical chocolate.

624
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Yes.

625
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 Yeah.

626
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Yeah.

627
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Ethical, ethical chocolate.

628
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 So he does.

629
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 She should call ethical chocolate.

630
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,040
 So, so the kids will buy some feastable bars, but I'm okay with that since he is trying

631
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,880
 to actually set a precedent of you pay a little more for your chocolate, but it's ethical.

632
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,360
 Does he pay the cacao harvesters $2 instead of one a day?

633
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,360
 That's right.

634
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,360
 That's right.

635
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,360
 What a saint.

636
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,360
 Yeah.

637
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,800
 Hey, my question, the only thing that I care about as far as your kids are concerned, did

638
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,200
 you show them the He-Man trailer?

639
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,760
 I brought up at dinner and we have not had a chance.

640
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,840
 So last night I had a corporate gig, so I wasn't home.

641
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,040
 Tonight I'm home with the boys and I'm going to try to show them the He-Man trailer.

642
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,080
 I did bring it up.

643
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,840
 They showed very little interest in watching it.

644
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
 Oh, of course.

645
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,280
 Cause they don't know from He-Man.

646
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,280
 That's right.

647
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,640
 So, but I am, we are going to watch it tonight and I'll report to you either privately or

648
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,960
 publicly about it.

649
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,880
 Well, it's gotta be public.

650
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,880
 That's what it's all about.

651
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,280
 We're going to hear it on the, on the pod.

652
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,280
 Fair enough.

653
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,280
 Yeah.

654
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,280
 Fair enough.

655
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,640
 Speaking of public things that people are going to hear on the pod, this is technically

656
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,040
 scoop mail, but I want to do it now.

657
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:38,840
 Lauren Shreve sent us an email and Lauren is setting up an LLC for HR consulting.

658
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,120
 Okay.

659
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,680
 Needs a name for the business.

660
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,000
 Lauren is asking us to help name the business.

661
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 All right.

662
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,280
 HR consulting business.

663
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,280
 What's it about?

664
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,280
 Oh, HR consulting.

665
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,280
 HR consulting.

666
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,240
 Not like HR stands for, it stands for human resources.

667
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,640
 HR does stand for something, Paul.

668
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,640
 I know.

669
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,680
 I thought it was stands for a puff and stuff.

670
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:05,760
 It's Lauren is setting up an HR puff and stuff LLC.

671
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,800
 Okay.

672
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,920
 Don't discuss Israel LLC.

673
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,920
 That would be not about Israel.

674
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
 I'll see.

675
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:20,840
 HR is the enemy LLC fight the real enemy LLC.

676
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,840
 Yeah.

677
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,240
 There's still, okay.

678
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:32,040
 There's still such thing as the C word LLC.

679
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,040
 Why didn't you just tell me to my face?

680
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,800
 I would have reacted better LLC.

681
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,240
 We're watching you LLC.

682
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,200
 Let's see, because you don't want to do something corny like olive branch or like peacemaking

683
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
 or peacemaker.

684
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
 That'd be good.

685
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,200
 Peacemaker.

686
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:58,680
 How about like humane recognition?

687
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,680
 For HR.

688
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:06,280
 How about workforce alchemy synergy?

689
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,280
 The show.

690
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,280
 Yeah.

691
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:13,800
 Two plus two equals five.

692
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,800

 Oh, my dog is here and they're so mad that they're not getting fed right now.

725
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,960
 Here's the question.

726
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,600
 So like sometimes like you want like you have a regular business name, but like what you

727
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,800
 put on the checks is funny, right?

728
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:30,880
 So like my wife has like 11 jobs for the same company, but they all have a different LLC.

729
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,160
 And every time I get the stuff for the taxes, I'm like, what is the company called?

730
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,560
 And so like no one calls it these companies, but it's just a funny thing.

731
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,360
 Some of the names are wild.

732
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,360
 Yeah.

733
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,360
 Yeah.

734
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:47,320
 Like for this, I get paid from Penn Sunday School from preaching to the choir, LLC.

735
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,720
 So it's just want a funny name for the LC for someone to cut the check to.

736
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,480
 Or is this like, I need to I'm going to get a website and market my services.

737
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,480
 I need a real name.

738
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,600
 This is going to be that it's going to be funny.

739
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,800
 I said, when do you think it's going to be?

740
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,280
 No, I think it's going to be the second.

741
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:08,960
 I think it's going to be the real name that she wants people to be able to see and do

742
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,960
 business with her.

743
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:21,320
 How about bat shit cross them?

744
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,320
 What do you think?

745
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:28,080
 Like a, like free beer, free beer, free beer and chicken, name it after old improv teams,

746
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,200
 free beer and chicken.

747
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,560
 How about, how about you call it a bear in the woods LLC, which I like uncomfortable

748
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:44,360
 conversations.

749
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,360
 We need to talk.

750
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,360
 LLC is good too.

751
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:54,760
 Yeah, something like, uh, something like hard conversations might really be on the right

752
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:59,680
 path because that's, I mean, that's all anybody wants an HR consulting firm for, right?

753
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,680
 Exit strategy.

754
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:11,880
 Golden parachute final, final interview, uh, exit interview, exit interview, LLC.

755
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:27,120
 You can do which exit interview, you can be a New Jersey based HR firm, which exit interview

756
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:35,640
 exit only interview from the fat LLC.

757
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,200
 One of you, one of us doesn't have a job LLC for miles around.

758
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,560
 There you go.

759
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,280
 It's exactly the conversations.

760
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:49,200
 Oh, function the whale, uh, higher expectations, H I R E higher expectation.

761
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,200
 I like that.

762
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,200
 That's pretty good.

763
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,400
 I don't like that.

764
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,440
 Higher expectations is pretty great.

765
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,440
 Yeah.

766
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,520
 What I think you have to do is take your, the, the name of your first pet and the street

767
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,520
 you grew up on.

768
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,520
 And that's how you name a company.

769
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,800
 As far as I know, that's a, that's right.

770
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,640
 How about employee time of the month?

771

00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:45,240
 Say yes to gators walking up and down bill street, sliding into jazz holes, listening

871
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:49,640
 to the fine music that gets played up and down the boardwalk.

872
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,120
 Where do you think Beale Street is?

873
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,120
 I don't know.

874
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,160
 Where is it?

875
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:07,640
 Memphis, Memphis is where Beale Street is.

876
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,760
 OK.

877
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:17,800
 So this is why we got to pass this prop in knowledge.

878
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:23,480
 To a parade, you see, all the way down to Memphis town.

879
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:30,920
 We're doing a second line to Memphis, come on.

880
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:39,400
 Oh, when the streets get filled with gators, oh, when the streets get filled with gators,

881
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:44,160
 they're going to walk all the way down to Memphis.

882
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:50,240
 Oh, when the streets get filled with gators.

883
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,040
 Who wants to come on down to Bourbon Street, try some barbecue today?

884
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,640
 No, no, no, Seashell, we going all the way down to Memphis, hon.

885
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:04,720
 We had enough of your hey, cowpokes, welcome to Bourbon Street.

886
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,720
 We got dry rub.

887
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,840
 We got wet barbecue.

888
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,840
 This my kind of place.

889
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:14,680
 Now, I'll tell you what, hon, please don't be turning me into a pouch bag or some kind

890
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,680
 of shoe.

891
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,600
 I'm a friendly gator, don't you see?

892
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,200
 A pouch bag?

893
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,920
 Don't you go making me a pouch bag, befriend.

894
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,000
 Don't make me a pouch bag perfect for putting a computer on top of you for balance.

895
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,760
 I found my thrill as a gator on Beale.

896
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:41,720
 I was like, he does not know where Beale Street is.

897
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,720
 Of course I don't know where Beale Street is.

898
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,760
 Nobody else brought up Beale Street, Paul.

899
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,560
 Isn't that that cop show?

900
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,560
 Nope.

901
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,560
 Beale Street Blues?

902
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,760
 Oh, Beale Street Blues.

903
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:02,120
 Now y'all go on out there and be careful, this here, Memphis, we don't want nobody,

904
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,120
 we don't want nobody getting hurt out there now.

905
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,120
 Right here in Memphis.

906
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:13,120
 Memphis, P.D.I. County, Beale Street ain't never going to be the same.

907
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:19,200
 I'm going to go listen to some Dr. John playing down here in Memphis.

908
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,560
 Come on, Dr. John, where you at?

909
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,720
 Oh yeah, the gators are coming.

910
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,000
 I just got a voicemail.

911
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 Oh shit.

912
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 Hello?

913
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 My glasses are ready.

914
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 Where from?

915
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 Pearl Vision.

916
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 From the Pearl Vision?

917
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 Pearl Vision.

918
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 Yeah.

919
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 What'd you strip?

920
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 I'm actually not as bad as, oh did I talk about, I talked about I was going to go to

921
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 the eye doctor.

922
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,680
 Did I talk about going to the eye doctor?

923
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,000
 I think we were going to talk about going there and we talked about having reading glasses

924
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 around the house.

925
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,120
 Yeah, yeah, so I have reading glasses around the house and I went there and I was like

926
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:05,700
 so afraid that they were going to be like, did you drive here?

927
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:09,800
 Here's these Coke bottles, you blindy.

928
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:14,120
 They gave me five vision tests, I did like a round of different tests, the test for different

929
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,120
 things on the eye.

930
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:20,160
 And they said I have a very basic prescription, nothing too crazy.

931
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,160
 That fits.

932
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,160
 Clock that.

933
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:32,040
 They said basic bitch, here's your basic bitch glasses, you basic bitch.

934
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,840
 Basic bitch scripts.

935
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,480
 Why don't you go have your chicken salad for lunch, you fucking basic bitch.

936
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,480
 Get out of here.

937
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,480
 Here's your glasses.

938
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:49,240
 Are you nearsighted, farsighted, or both?

939
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,240
 Both.

940
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,240
 I need tough.

941
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,520
 I need more progressives, right, so I can do the far from the top.

942
00:43:54,520 --> 00:44:00,000
 Let's just pour some milk in your fucking eyes, get you some lactic acid, you basic bitch.

943
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,940
 You fucking cereal eating basic bitch.

944
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,960
 Milk is a basic acid, right?

945
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,960
 Or is that Beale Street?

946
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,960
 Beale Street.

947
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,960
 That's Beale Street.

948
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,960
 I'm trying not to give you.

949
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:20,760
 Oh shit, oh fuck, real quick, to derail everything.

950
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,760
 Corrections time.

951
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,280
 I'm not passionate about talking about my glasses, but that's fine.

952
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:30,680
 Corrections time, and made me put in a correction.

953
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,760
 Last episode I claimed that the interstate was designed specifically for truckers.

954
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:40,080
 It was in fact specifically designed for the military industrial complex to be able to

955
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,200
 transport military vehicles more efficiently, first and foremost.

956
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,200
 The trucking thing.

957
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,440
 Oh, a side effect was helping the trucking industry.

958
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,440
 Yes, yes, yes.

959
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,800
 And destroying the train.

960
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,720
 And destroying the train bearing monopolies, and yeah, well I mean we have far less children

961
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,400
 with one leg in this country thanks to that.

962
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,480
 That's true.

963
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,200
 More dead ones, but far less maimed kids.

964
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,200
 Oh man.

965
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,200
 Because they don't have as much.

966
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,200
 But dead whole kids.

967
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,880
 Oh yeah, dead and intact for the most part.

968
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:08,880
 Dead in the car.

969
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

970
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:15,160
 I mean well I guess how do you judge intact?

971
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:18,320
 Still belted in, does that count?

972
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,320
 Yes.

973
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,320
 I guess.

974
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,320
 Yeah.

975
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,320
 Blood on the freeway.

976
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,960
 It depends if you're a really tender chicken, you can like pull the leg out, I don't know.

977
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:26,960
 It depends.

978
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,960
 Depends.

979
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,560
 Oh, it's done.

980
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,160
 Oh, you just jarred another thing from me, Matt.

981
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,160
 Let's do it.

982
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,160
 Let's keep going.

983
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,160
 We're on fire.

984
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,160
 Guess what I did this week.

985
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,160
 Yes.

986
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,160
 What?

987
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:43,560
 I made chicken and dumplings.

988
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,040
 Out of a can that said chicken and dumplings?

989
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,040
 Nope, nope.

990
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,520
 I'm learning, I'm learning.

991
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,000
 Okay.

992
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 This was-

993
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,800
 Did you use a cooking pot?

994
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,800
 Yes.

995
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,280
 This was a seven, a six or a seven I would say.

996
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,280
 Six, seven.

997
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,360
 Six, seven.

998
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:05,440
 I did not hit it out of the park like I'd hoped, but I'm going to change up my recipe.

999
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,440
 Your first attempt.

1000
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,440
 Huh?

1001
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,440
 Your first attempt.

1002
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,440
 First attempt, yes.

1003
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,440
 Yeah.

1004
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,440
 I'm pretty happy.

1005
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,440
 Myra wants to know, did you use a Dutch oven?

1006
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,400
 No, just a big pot.

1007
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,200
 No vegetables are added in my-

1008
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,200
 I just farted directly in Anne's face.

1009
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,200
 I didn't hold her under the covers.

1010
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,200
 No vegetables are added in my-

1011
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,200
 Paul says chicken and dumplings.

1012
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,200
 He means chicken and dumplings.

1013
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,200
 Yeah, that's it.

1014
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,200
 No vegetables.

1015
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,200
 No, no, no.

1016
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,400
 There are plenty of people who do celery and carrots and onions and shit.

1017
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,400
 Peas.

1018
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,400
 Peas.

1019
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,400
 Peas is a common one, yeah.

1020
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,400
 Peas.

1021
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,400
 Get the fuck out of here.

1022
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,400
 Yeah, throw some peas in there.

1023
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,400
 Disgusting.

1024
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,400
 You don't even taste them.

1025
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,400
 No, no, no.

1026
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,400
 It's weird.

1027
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,400
 We bought a bunch of-

1028
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,400
 It's like a football in your soup.

1029
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,400
 Yeah, it's delightful.

1030
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,400
 We got a bunch of chicken from Costco, which was-

1031
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,400
 You're making a gesture with your hands like you're holding a shotgun.

1032
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,400
 What did you buy a chicken in?

1033
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,400
 What form of chicken?

1034
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,400
 It was in a sack.

1035
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,400
 It was de-boned rotisserie chicken in a sack.

1036
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,400
 Paul would show you the sack, but it's currently holding up his laptop.

1037
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,400
 Wait, that sounds-

1038
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,400
 Wait, who sells de-boned-

1039
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,400
 How does one get de-boned chicken in a sack?

1040
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,400
 At Costco.

1041
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,400
 Really?

1042
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,400
 I didn't even eat the chicken-

1043
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,400
 Yeah, it's like shredded chicken in a bag.

1044
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,400
 I didn't really get it de-boned.

1045
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,400
 Jacob knows exactly what I'm talking about.

1046
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,400
 I do.

1047
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,400
 Just because I don't doesn't mean I'm accusatory.

1048
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,400
 I can learn too.

1049
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,400
 You're learning, I'm learning.

1050
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,400
 You son of a bitch.

1051
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,400
 I bought sack chicken from the Costco.

1052
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,400
 You come on down to Beale Street, we all settle this man to man.

1053
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,400
 We're going to settle this up right here.

1054
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:29,400
 Who's eating who's chicken, Dr. John?

1055
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,400
 That person speaking, Aaron Burr.

1056
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,400
 Aaron Burr.

1057
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:39,400
 We had this chicken, and it was going to go south in about a week.

1058
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,400
 I needed to put some pedal to the metal.

1059
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,400
 It was going to go south of mustard.

1060
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:54,400
 I went online, and I watched several how-to videos on YouTube until I saw stuff that the

1061
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,400
 end result was consistent with visually what I recalled from my grandmother eating.

1062
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,400
 Okay.

1063
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,400
 I was like, "Okay, that's the one I'm going with."

1064
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,400
 It was very simple.

1065
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:09,400
 I put in an egg, flour, egg, little bit of chicken broth.

1066
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,400
 That's it.

1067
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,400
 Mushed it up into a dough.

1068
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,400
 For the dumplings.

1069
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,400
 For the dumplings.

1070
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,400
 Yeah.

1071
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,400
 Mushed it up into a dough, added flour as needed.

1072
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,400
 Rolled it out.

1073
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,400
 Oh, I was going to ask you if you rolled it out or if you did the dumpling ball.

1074
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,400
 No.

1075
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,400
 I rolled it out.

1076
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,400
 We do the flats.

1077
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,400
 I'm very impressed.

1078
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,400
 I went to a comic book shop, and Paul is rolling out his own dough.

1079
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,400
 It is a new day.

1080
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,400
 It's a shiny new day here.

1081
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,400
 We're getting old.

1082
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,400
 We're getting old.

1083
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,400
 We're running out of things to do on the planet.

1084
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,400
 I've been sober for a day and a half.

1085
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,400
 Holy shit.

1086
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,400
 It's a weird world.

1087
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,400
 It's a weird crazy world.

1088
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,400
 It's a weird world.

1089
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,400
 This is a very weird time.

1090
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,400
 I haven't been sober for a day and a half.

1091
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,400
 I'm getting carried away.

1092
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,400
 Cut up the dumplings.

1093
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,400
 Had a whole lot of dumplings.

1094
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,400
 It was really great.

1095
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,400
 The two things that probably came up short were the chicken and the stock.

1096
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,400
 Okay.

1097
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,400
 I got just box stock.

1098
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,400
 Right?

1099
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,400
 Got you.

1100
00:48:51,400 --> 00:49:02,400
 In the future.

1101
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,400
 Oh yeah.

1102
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,400
 You got to season up.

1103
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,400
 You can do the box stock, but you got to season up the box stock a little bit.

1104
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,400
 I seasoned it up, but I didn't season up enough.

1105
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,400
 There you go.

1106
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,400
 But I think in the future, the trick is just straight up make your own stock.

1107
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,400
 Yeah.

1108
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:20,400
 Boil bone-in chicken until it falls off the bone of a couple of pieces.

1109
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,400
 Clear out the bones.

1110
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,400
 Chunk up the chicken.

1111
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,400
 Take out the chicken.

1112
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,400
 Then you've got the stock.

1113
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,400
 Maybe add a bouillon.

1114
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,400
 I saw another recipe.

1115
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,400
 No, no.

1116
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,400
 Keep the bones going.

1117
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,400
 Take the chicken off the bones, and then keep the bones in there.

1118
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,400
 Let it really.

1119
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,400
 Keep them really going.

1120
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,400
 You can even break them.

1121
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,400
 Break the bones up.

1122
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,400
 Get the marrow out for a little while.

1123
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,400
 Yeah.

1124
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,400
 Yeah.

1125
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,400
 Or add a little bouillon.

1126
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,400
 I saw another recipe.

1127
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,400
 Added cream of chicken soup.

1128
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,400
 Eisenhower used the bones of children that died making trains.

1129
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:51,400
 Yeah.

1130
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:58,400
 That's how my grandma used to make chicken and dumplings, and it's honestly the best

1131
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,400
 way.

1132
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:06,400
 Train baby gravy is the primary way to eat chicken and dumplings, but I didn't have the

1133
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,400
 things available to me at hand.

1134
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:16,400
 I still say that's James Taylor's best song.

1135
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,400
 And I walked into my mother's house.

1136
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,400
 I could smell it on the stove.

1137
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:28,400
 The train baby gravy, just like she made from home.

1138
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:34,400
 It was supple, soft, and slippery, and it slid right in my mouth.

1139
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:40,400
 Fresh from the tracks at the railroad crossing, a baby went down south all the way to Beale

1140
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,400
 Street.

1141
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,400
 All the way to Beale Street.

1142
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,400
 Look out, here come them getters.

1143
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,400
 Here they come.

1144
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,400
 Looking for that baby.

1145
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,400
 That baby train gravy.

1146
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,400
 Train baby gravy.

1147
00:50:47,400 --> 00:51:02,400
 Here comes the great strolling parlor band from Beale Street.

1148
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:07,400
 This is another thing, Matt, that I'm afraid the elites have stolen from us, besides our

1149
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,400
 future and our hope.

1150
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:15,400
 They've also stolen the ability to really make fun jokes about eating babies, because

1151
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,400
 now it's just a stark reality.

1152
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:25,400
 There was a time when dead baby jokes ruled the playground for kids.

1153
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,400
 Nowadays, it's just like, "Whoa, who are you trying to be?

1154
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,400
 Elon Musk?"

1155
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,400
 Yeah.

1156
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,400
 Oh boy.

1157
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,400
 Anyway.

1158
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,400
 How do you fit 10,000 dead babies into a phone booth?

1159
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,400
 You give them to the elites, they'll figure it out.

1160
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,400
 Hire Bill Gates.

1161
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,400
 That's how you do it.

1162
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,400
 He'll figure it out real fucking quick.

1163
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,400
 I also have a piece of side note business popped into my head.

1164
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,900
 We had one of our scoops right on Patreon.

1165
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,400
 I don't get the angry goose joke, can someone explain it to me?

1166
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,400
 I just thought I should maybe also explain it on air.

1167
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,400
 Yeah.

1168
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,400
 Because we're making it in reference to Fisto from Masters of the Universe.

1169
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:10,400
 And I didn't know this until, I guess, you can hear early episodes of us learning this

1170
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:18,400
 basically, but in the actual sex act of fisting, you don't actually make a fist.

1171
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,400
 You don't just punch someone's butthole.

1172
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:25,400
 I mean, unless they've asked for that.

1173
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,400
 I'm just saying there might be people out there making mistakes.

1174
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,400
 Making mistakes or just granting wishes.

1175
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,400
 Yeah.

1176
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,400
 Sure, sure.

1177
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,400
 Featured on a bug maybe.

1178
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,400
 The Paul Mattingly biography.

1179
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,400
 Making mistakes and granting wishes.

1180
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,400
 Yeah, making mistakes and granting wishes, the Paul Mattingly story.

1181
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:49,400
 A lid for every pot, a fist for every cornhole.

1182
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,400
 Now Paul, your camera went out.

1183
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,400
 Is it because your computer fell off the bags?

1184
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:58,400
 It's because I'm wiping my nose because it's two degrees in my goddamn basement.

1185
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,400
 My nose is running from the fucking cold.

1186
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:05,400
 I thought I'd spare our listening audience and viewing audience me digging for nose goblins.

1187
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,400
 Now, Bossy and Cham is a good point.

1188
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,400
 He's saying Fisting 101 by Matt Donnelly.

1189
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,400
 Yeah, don't let me be the only source on this, okay?

1190
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,400
 Please, I'm not doing, I'm not doing--

1191
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,400
 Do your own research.

1192
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,400
 I'm not doing a sarcastic Joe Rogan where I give some lunatic a platform for four hours

1193
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,400
 and then say do your own research at the end.

1194
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:27,400
 I mean, I really want you to not let me be the only source that you get this from.

1195
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,400
 Is that some kind of high women joke?

1196
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,400
 I don't want you to punch people in the assholes.

1197
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,400
 And I don't want you to use me as your only fisting source.

1198
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,400
 That's right.

1199
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,400
 But you actually form your fisters into a point as if you're like pinching a--

1200
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:45,400
 Well, if you see many of these sex toys that are sold as fisty, they are that same thing.

1201
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,400
 Right.

1202
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,400
 They are like somebody's getting ready to--

1203
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,400
 You make a cone, a cone of fingers.

1204
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,400
 It's basically prekermit.

1205
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,400
 Prekermit, yeah, yeah.

1206
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,400
 So if someone says prekermit, my butthole, we're talking about the same thing.

1207
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,400
 Pre--

1208
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,400
 You know, you can still get pregnant from prekermit.

1209
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,400
 I heard that was a myth.

1210
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,400
 No, it's not a myth, buddy.

1211
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,400
 Oh, I heard it's a myth.

1212
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,400
 That's how, look, Paul's only nine months apart from his brother.

1213
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,400
 Believe me, you can get pregnant from prekermit.

1214
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,400
 You can get pregnant from prekermit, for fucking sure.

1215
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,400
 Ten and a half months, that's right.

1216
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,400
 I thought it was eight and a half.

1217
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,400
 Ten and a half, razor close.

1218
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,400
 Eight and a half.

1219
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:34,400
 So, yeah, anger goose is referring to the actual shape you make when one fists another person.

1220
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,400
 Right.

1221
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,400
 I just want to make sure that we're all caught up.

1222
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,400
 It's pump at hand.

1223
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,400
 Inside joke explained.

1224
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,400
 That's a literal inside joke.

1225
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:51,400
 The best way that we express gratitude on the show is by saying fuck you in the face, you dick and tit farmers, of which I am the farmer.

1226
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,400
 And so that's when you get a thank you email from me for signing up for Patreon.

1227
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,400
 That's what that means on the bottom.

1228
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,400
 We have a wonderful comment here in the chat from Chris Angel has a chimera.

1229
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,400
 As an old queer man, we used to tell a joke back in the '90s.

1230
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,400
 How can you tell if a guy is gay?

1231
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,400
 Ask him to make a fist.

1232
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,400
 Oh, that's great.

1233
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,400
 I like that a lot.

1234
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,400
 That's great. That's a guy I had a friend who was a lesbian who was like, listen, the girls like to say they're bisexual.

1235
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:23,400
 And she goes, I just look at their fingernails and be like, no, you're not.

1236
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,400
 All good.

1237
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,400
 That's a big tell.

1238
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,400
 That's a healthy talk right there.

1239
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,400
 So, yeah.

1240
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,400
 Yeah.

1241
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,400
 All right.

1242
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,400
 What do we have?

1243
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,400
 We got some scoop mail, Jacob.

1244
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,400
 Now let's do a little jock versus nerd.

1245
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,400
 We already did.

1246
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,400
 We snuck it in.

1247
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,400
 That's right.

1248
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,400
 We snuck it in.

1249
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,400
 Like an angry goose.

1250
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,400
 Ladies and gentlemen, it is time.

1251
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,400
 That angry goose don't speak anywhere.

1252
00:55:50,400 --> 00:56:01,400
 Time for jock versus nerd.

1253
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:06,400
 The exclusion of angry geese.

1254
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,400
 Hello, fabulous face fuckers.

1255
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:18,400
 I wrote this scooperty on Black Friday, which made me think about a gift everyone must have received at least once in their lives, a quote of the day desk calendar.

1256
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:32,400
 You know the kind where there are about 365 pages and you rip them out and each page you have a new quote and you keep on tearing a sheet off every day starting on January 1st until about mid-February when you throw it away when nobody is looking.

1257
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:38,400
 Here is a scooperty with some famous quotes of people in the areas you three enjoy.

1258
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,400
 And this is from Psych Scoop.

1259
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:46,400
 The categories are comedians, magicians, comic books, and sports figures.

1260
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,400
 I'm up first.

1261
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,400
 I'll try magicians.

1262
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,400
 200 filthy magicians.

1263
00:56:52,400 --> 00:57:03,400
 On the subject of pattern, this magician said generally magicians don't know what to say, so they say stupid and redundant crap like here I am holding a red ball.

1264
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,400
 I mean, it sounds a lot like Penn.

1265
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,400
 I'm going to say Penn Gillette.

1266
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,400
 Tell her.

1267
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,400
 Well, you were halfway there.

1268
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,400
 I was kind of close.

1269
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:23,400
 You were very close and that's actually that is the thing when they're talking to magicians about like the whole like once they're not doing the sarcastic teller talks thing.

1270
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,400
 But he is one of our greatest living magic minds.

1271
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,400
 And I always say that one of the things that makes him such a great magic mind.

1272
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,400
 Both men and teller are we talked about this like not sentimental.

1273
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:42,400
 You know if they don't they don't write they don't so they don't wax poetic or getting the things being to you know whatever and emotions in any kind of way.

1274
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,400
 So teller is remarkably practical magic advice.

1275
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,400
 That's an example of right there.

1276
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,400
 Like he's very much about like just do this.

1277
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,400
 This sucks.

1278
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,400
 This makes people go wow.

1279
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,400
 This is deceptive.

1280
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:56,400
 This isn't like he's very clear and bare bones about his magic advice, which is really awesome.

1281
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,400
 Yeah.

1282
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,400
 Nice.

1283
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,400
 Matt you're up.

1284
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,400
 Magicians 400 please.

1285
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:08,400
 This magician said there is nothing worse than good magic at the wrong time.

1286
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,400
 That's a really funny quote.

1287
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,400
 I don't know who said this.

1288
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,400
 Copperfield.

1289
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,400
 And I really want to know.

1290
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,400
 I really want to know the context of it.

1291
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,400
 Dude he is he's on his way out huh.

1292
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,400
 I don't think so.

1293
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,400
 You don't think so.

1294
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,400
 You don't think they're going to push him.

1295
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,400
 Who knows.

1296
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:30,400
 I guess there are no consequences for anything anymore.

1297
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,400
 I don't fucking know.

1298
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:36,400
 Well also if he's the only one who suffers consequences for this that'll be really weird too.

1299
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,400
 Because basically they were like.

1300
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,400
 It'll just be him and Bill Gates are the only two that are getting anything any kind of blowback.

1301
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,400
 Yeah.

1302
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,400
 Yeah.

1303
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,400
 I think several of them got blowback.

1304
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,400
 Oh blowback.

1305
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,400
 No.

1306
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,400
 Yikes.

1307
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:53,400
 This magician said there is nothing worse than good magic at the wrong time.

1308
00:58:53,400 --> 00:59:04,400
 I'll just say this on this just to put the finer point of what I'm getting at which is that I think he's too much of a non-current celebrity to get too much shit for what's happening.

1309
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,400
 I don't.

1310
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,400
 Outside of Vegas he's not.

1311
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,400
 Outside of Vegas I don't think.

1312
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,400
 People think of as a nostalgic name that calls to their childhood.

1313
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,400
 It is not like bringing up someone who's operating right now and thriving right now.

1314
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,400
 Did he ever bring back the Statue of Liberty though?

1315
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,400
 I mean we never.

1316
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,400
 Oh it's all he does.

1317
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,400
 It's like we're like stop.

1318
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,400
 Put it away David.

1319
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,400
 It's a Statue of Liberty here.

1320
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,400
 Statue of Liberty there.

1321
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,400
 Just can you just please order.

1322
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,400
 We're waiting.

1323
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:33,400
 I'm going to fly across the Grand Canyon with my leg crossed.

1324
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,400
 Indian style.

1325
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,400
 Crisscross applesauce.

1326
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,400
 I'll also say I don't see too many magicians saying no to getting his private jet and go to his island right now.

1327
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,400
 So it seems like there's really no ramifications.

1328
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,400
 Wait who's private island.

1329
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,400
 David has his own private island.

1330
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,400
 Copperfields.

1331
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,400
 Of course he does.

1332
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,400
 But that's the whole point.

1333
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:55,400
 That's why they're like that's actually why they were mostly connected and not mostly connected through.

1334
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,400
 Oh they were island friends.

1335
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,400
 Yes.

1336
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,400
 I suppose.

1337
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,400
 Like two people with Jeeps doing the weird finger wave at each other.

1338
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,400
 Two people with Jeeps.

1339
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,400
 Yeah they go over to each other's island give each other a rubber duck every month.

1340
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,400
 No it was just a weird finger wave.

1341
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:15,400
 They did a weird finger wave with each other.

1342
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,400
 Anyhow pass.

1343
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:22,400
 Paul.

1344
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,400
 Mattingly.

1345
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,400
 Paul Mattingly.

1346
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,400
 Penn.

1347
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,400
 All right.

1348
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,400
 David Roth.

1349
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,400
 David Lee Roth.

1350
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,400
 David Lee Roth.

1351
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,400
 Amazing.

1352
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,400
 Yeah.

1353
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,400
 Hey you know what.

1354
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,400
 There's nothing worse than good magic at the wrong time.

1355
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,400
 Ha ha ha.

1356
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,400
 Penn and Ma.

1357
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,400
 It's from me.

1358
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:47,400
 Diamond Dave.

1359
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:53,400
 Don't bring out magic at the good times.

1360
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,400
 Toe time to jump.

1361
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,400
 Paul you're up.

1362
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,400
 Get me a coffee and a glazed donut to go.

1363
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,400
 I'll go with comic books for 200.

1364
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,400
 This comic book figure is known for saying Excelsior.

1365
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,400
 That is none other than Stan the Man Lee.

1366
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:15,400
 I am wearing an Excelsior badge on my shirt right now.

1367
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,400
 I have it on my coat.

1368
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,400
 That's something that people care about.

1369
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,400
 They do.

1370
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,400
 I'm doing sports figures for 200.

1371
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,400
 Winn questioned about his work at the news conference.

1372
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,400
 Excelsior.

1373
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,400
 This sports figure responded we talk about practice.

1374
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,400
 Oh you're going to know that.

1375
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,400
 Practice.

1376
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:34,400
 That's true.

1377
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,400
 Yeah.

1378
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,400
 We talk about practice.

1379
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,400
 You know that.

1380
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:41,400
 Coach Maura baby coach Jim Maura.

1381
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,400
 Allen Iverson.

1382
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,400
 Oh that's the wrong playoff.

1383
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,400
 Something in playoffs.

1384
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,400
 Damn it.

1385
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,400
 Oh no.

1386
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,400
 Playoffs not practice.

1387
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,400
 Oh you went the wrong way.

1388
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,400
 I went to the wrong press conference.

1389
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,400
 In your defense.

1390
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,400
 Matt.

1391
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,400
 I think people mix up Jim Maura and Allen Iverson all the time.

1392
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,400
 Constantly.

1393
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,400
 Constantly.

1394
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,400
 All the time.

1395
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:05,400
 That won't even be the last time on this show where it happens.

1396
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,400
 Oh boy.

1397
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,400
 Oh boy.

1398
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,400
 Give me comedians for 600.

1399
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,400
 Let's try it.

1400
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:18,400
 This gone too soon comedian said this after encountering Jacob's favorite waterfowl.

1401
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:24,400
 I find a duck's opinion of me is very much influenced by whether or not I have bread.

1402
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,400
 Oh shit I know who this is.

1403
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,400
 I'm picturing it in my mind.

1404
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,400
 It is not Steven Wright.

1405
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,400
 No.

1406
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,400
 You got to go outside and trim.

1407
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:36,400
 Mitch Hensburg.

1408
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,400
 There you go.

1409
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,400
 There you go.

1410
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,400
 Yeah.

1411
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,400
 Paul.

1412
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,400
 I'll do comic books for 800.

1413
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,400
 I'm going to shoot the moon.

1414
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:54,400
 This superhero said there's always a way when the odds are impossible do the impossible.

1415
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,400
 Captain Planet.

1416
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,400
 No this is tricky.

1417
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,400
 The power is yours.

1418
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:03,400
 When the odds are impossible do the impossible.

1419
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:06,400
 And it sounds like Superman but it could be a lot.

1420
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,400
 It could be Captain America 2.

1421
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,400
 Out to pass.

1422
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,400
 Oh that passes to me.

1423
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,400
 That is Howard the Duck.

1424
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,400
 It definitely sounds like Cass or Supes.

1425
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,400
 Sure.

1426
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,400
 Pass.

1427
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,400
 Ultra good goodies.

1428
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:25,400
 That would be Fisto.

1429
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,400
 Pass.

1430
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,400
 Superman.

1431
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:37,400
 It's me I'll try comic books for 400.

1432
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,400
 I fell asleep.

1433
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:46,400
 This shield bearing comic book hero said I'm loyal to nothing general except the dream.

1434
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,400
 There you go.

1435
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,400
 That is Spider-Man.

1436
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,400
 Spider-Man Spider-Man has a web shield.

1437
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,400
 I'm loyal to nothing except the dream.

1438
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,400
 He does have a web shield.

1439
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,400
 That is the crow from the Sandman.

1440
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:03,400
 That is Brandon Lee's The Crow.

1441
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,400
 James O'Barr's The Crow.

1442
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,400
 That would be Captain America.

1443
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,400
 Eric Draven.

1444
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,400
 Matt.

1445
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,400
 I'll do comedians for 800.

1446
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:21,400
 This late comedian said cocaine is God's way of saying you make too much money.

1447
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,400
 Oh God.

1448
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,400
 Shoot.

1449
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,400
 I know that quote.

1450
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,400
 It's a very good quote.

1451
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,400
 It is.

1452
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,400
 Somebody just leapt into my head.

1453
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,400
 I have a guess but I'm not sure if I'm right or not.

1454
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,400
 I'm going to pass.

1455
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,400
 Paul.

1456
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,400
 See now I'm second guessing myself.

1457
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,400
 Who are you thinking?

1458
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,400
 Talk us through it baby.

1459
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,400
 My first thought was Carlin.

1460
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,400
 That's my first thought as well.

1461
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,400
 My second thought was Bill Hicks.

1462
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,400
 Okay.

1463
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,400
 And then my third thought was Mark Maron.

1464
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,400
 Oh wow.

1465
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,400
 I think yeah.

1466
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,400
 Mark Maron and Carlin.

1467
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,400
 Any one of those.

1468
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,400
 Richard Pryor.

1469
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,400
 Oh yeah.

1470
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,400
 I'll pass to let you take that shot bro.

1471
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,400
 No, no, no.

1472
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,400
 I'm passing as well because I'm right there with you.

1473
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,400
 Oh my God.

1474
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,400
 It was Robin Williams.

1475
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,400
 Of all the cocaine addles.

1476
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,400
 I was going to say.

1477
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,400
 So it was Richard Pryor.

1478
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,400
 Oh.

1479
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,400
 Shots fucking fired.

1480
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,400
 Stay down Robin Williams.

1481
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,400
 Too good too long.

1482
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,400
 Paid everybody for every joke he ever told.

1483
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,400
 Oop, oop, oop.

1484
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,400
 On blast.

1485
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,400
 Robin Williams on blast.

1486
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,400
 Paul you're up.

1487
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,400
 I will do comic books

1488
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,400
 for 600 please.

1489
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,400
 This super hero

1490
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,400
 said when there seems to be no chance

1491
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,400
 that's when it counts.

1492
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,400
 Oh piss.

1493
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,400
 Piss man.

1494
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,400
 Piss man.

1495
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,400
 Martin Van Buren

1496
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,400
 is piss man.

1497
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,400
 Seems to be

1498
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,400
 no chance.

1499
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,400
 When there seems to be no chance that's when it counts.

1500
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,400
 See this is also a very

1501
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,400
 goody two shoesy.

1502
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,400
 This could be like

1503
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,400
 Green Lantern

1504
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,400
 or

1505
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,400
 there's another

1506
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,400
 big.

1507
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,400
 No, no, this Paul, this was

1508
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,400
 a motivational

1509
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,400
 speech given by

1510
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,400
 Lex Luthor

1511
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,400
 in the big doom house

1512
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,400
 that would fly around and the super friends

1513
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,400
 would have to chase them around.

1514
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:39,400
 It could be

1515
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,400
 Batman. I'll have to pass.

1516
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,400
 That passes to me.

1517
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,400
 I happen to know this one. It is

1518
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,400
 the left wonder twin.

1519
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,400
 The left wonder twin.

1520
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,400
 I don't know. Pass.

1521
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,400
 Matt.

1522
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,400
 I have no idea.

1523
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,400
 Spider-Man.

1524
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,400
 Spider-Man.

1525
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,400
 Yeah.

1526
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,400
 His is, there's great

1527
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,400
 I just walked through a comic book.

1528
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,400
 I walk into one comic book shop and suddenly the

1529
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,400
 pressure's on to answer these questions.

1530
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,400
 He tested.

1531
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,400
 Oh yeah, no, that one did

1532
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,400
 come out today. You're absolutely right sir

1533
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,400
 to be here on the day that that one came out

1534
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,400
 that you just came in and asked about.

1535
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,400
 I swear it's a coincidence.

1536
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,400
 It's not. You're a nerd. You're one of us.

1537
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,400
 Well and the thing is they also

1538
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,400
 probably had 40 copies.

1539
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,400
 They did have a lot of copies.

1540
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:31,400
 It sounded like fucking hotcakes.

1541
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,400
 I don't know if they had 40 but they had a lot of copies.

1542
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,400
 It's my turn and I just

1543
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,400
 accidentally clicked on a question. I don't know which one I

1544
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,400
 clicked on. This hot headed coach

1545
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,400
 said when my time on Earth is gone

1546
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,400
 and my activities here are passed

1547
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,400
 I want them to bury me upside down

1548
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,400
 and my critics can kiss my ass.

1549
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:51,400
 Archie boy from UNLV

1550
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,400
 Is that Bobby Knight?

1551
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,400
 Is it Bobby Knight or

1552
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,400
 Tarkanian?

1553
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,400
 It's Beale Street.

1554
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,400
 Is it Bobby Knight or is it Tarkanian?

1555
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,400
 No, I don't think it's Tark.

1556
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,400
 I don't think Tark's a kiss my ass guy.

1557
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,400
 It's Bobby Knight.

1558
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,400
 Tark is the

1559
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,400
 my friend here is going to break your legs later.

1560
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,400
 Yikes.

1561
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,400
 Yeah, I'll say Bobby Knight.

1562
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,400
 Fuck yeah, it's Bobby Knight.

1563
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:21,400
 Which one was that?

1564
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:23,400
 Sports figures for

1565
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,400
 600 maybe? I don't know.

1566
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,400
 Let's see.

1567
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,400
 Matt and I are both tied at 600.

1568
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,400
 Paul has negative 200.

1569
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,400
 And I think there's still two daily doubles

1570
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,400
 left out of the six questions that are left.

1571
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,400
 So anyone's gay.

1572
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:39,400
 Matt, you're up. You got comedians, magicians

1573
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,400
 and sports figures. We've burned all the comic books.

1574
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,400
 I'll do sports figures

1575
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,400
 for 400 please. Let's try it.

1576
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,400
 This baseballer

1577
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,400
 said they don't think it be like

1578
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,400
 it is, but it do.

1579
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:53,400
 Although many falsely attribute this quote

1580
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,400
 to other players.

1581
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,400
 Oh man.

1582
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,400
 They don't think it be like it is, but it do.

1583
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,400
 Is this Reggie Jackson?

1584
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,400
 Or is this

1585
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,400
 Yogi Berra?

1586
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,400
 No, there's no irony

1587
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,400
 in it. People falsely

1588
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,400
 quote Yogi for a lot of things

1589
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,400
 but there's usually an ironic twist.

1590
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,400
 It's either Daryl

1591
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:17,400
 or Strawberry.

1592
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:21,400
 I'm going to be

1593
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,400
 Pancho Joe Pesci Bill Cosby.

1594
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,400
 I'll pass.

1595
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,400
 Paul.

1596
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:31,400
 Was it Pancho

1597
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,400
 Ponce de Leon?

1598
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:35,400
 No.

1599
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,400
 Satchel Paige.

1600
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,400
 Is that your guess?

1601
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,400
 Yeah, I'll go with Satchel Paige.

1602
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:43,400
 Your guess is Satchel Paige.

1603
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,400
 It's Oscar

1604
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,400
 Gamble. Oh, everyone knows

1605
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,400
 Oscar Gamble. We were just talking

1606
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,400
 about Oscar Gamble, the very well-known

1607
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,400
 baseball player. Well, I just Oscar Gamble

1608
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,400
 several points and lost.

1609
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,400
 You did. You did.

1610
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,400
 Satchel Paige. That is a deep

1611
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,400
 baseball pull, sir. Paul, you're

1612
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,400
 up.

1613
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,400
 Not deep enough. I'll go

1614
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,400
 with magicians for 800

1615
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,400
 to get back on the board.

1616
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,400
 This magician born in the 1800s said

1617
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,400
 the personality must be bigger

1618
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,400
 than the prop. Gotta be

1619
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,400
 Houdini. Who?

1620
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,400
 Houdini. Who?

1621
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,400
 Houdini. Harry

1622
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,400
 Blackstone, senior.

1623
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,400
 Shit, shit, shit,

1624
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,400
 shit, shit, shit, shit,

1625
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,400
 shit, shit, shit.

1626
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,400
 My turn. I'll just try

1627
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,400
 magicians for 600

1628
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,400
 just because Houdini hasn't been an answer yet.

1629
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,400
 Shit. Daily double!

1630
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,400
 Oh, boo!

1631
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,400
 Boo, you!

1632
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,400
 There is no official

1633
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,400
 record that this magician said

1634
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,400
 anyone who believes in magic

1635
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,400
 is a fool, but

1636
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,400
 people attribute the quote to him anyway.

1637
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,400
 I'm Houdini. My name is Mr. Houdini.

1638
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,400
 Said this Houdini.

1639
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,400
 Harry

1640
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,400
 Houdini.

1641
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,400
 Houdini!

1642
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,400
 Boo on you!

1643
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,400
 Fuck you!

1644
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:07,400
 Fuck you!

1645
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,400
 Houdini!

1646
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,400
 Houdini!

1647
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,400
 Houdini!

1648
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,400
 Houdini!

1649
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,400
 Houdini!

1650
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,400
 Houdini!

1651
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,400
 Houdini!

1652
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,400
 Houdini!

1653
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,400
 Houdini!

1654
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,400
 Houdini!

1655
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,400
 Houdini!

1656
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,400
 The hits keep coming.

1657
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,400
 This humorist first said in 1923

1658
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,400
 I don't drink water.

1659
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,400
 The cowboy!

1660
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,400
 It's the cowboy guy!

1661
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,400
 Will Rogers!

1662
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,400
 Will Rogers?

1663
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,400
 It's gotta be

1664
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,400
 Will Rogers!

1665
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,400
 [coughing]

1666
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,400
 Yeah, Matt!

1667
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,400
 It's gotta be Will Rogers!

1668
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,400
 I think this will be Harry Blackstone Jr.

1669
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,400
 That's it.

1670
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,400
 Is it W.C. Fields?

1671
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,400
 Ooh!

1672
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,400
 Ooh, that's a good guess.

1673
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,400
 I'll go with Fields.

1674
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,400
 Alright.

1675
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,400
 W.C.

1676
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,400
 Motherfucking

1677
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,400
 Fields is correct.

1678
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,400
 Water closet Fields himself.

1679
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,400
 My favorite

1680
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,400
 quote is, again, maybe

1681
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:21,400
 mis-tributed him. You can find a tribute to different people, but it's

1682
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,400
 If you want to make people laugh, dress a guy up like an old lady

1683
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,400
 and push him down the stairs.

1684
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,400
 If you want to make a comedian laugh, push an old

1685
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:29,400
 lady down the stairs.

1686
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,400
 My favorite Fields quote.

1687
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,400
 Paul, you have

1688
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,400
 -1400. Matt and I are both tied

1689
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:37,400
 at 1200. There are two questions left.

1690
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,400
 Let's get on the board with sports figures for 800, please.

1691
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,400
 Alright.

1692
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,400
 This prominent

1693
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,400
 pugilist poetically

1694
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,400
 proclaimed, "It's just a job.

1695
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,400
 Grass grows, birds fly,

1696
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,400
 waves pound the sand. I beat

1697
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,400
 people up." Okay.

1698
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,400
 Uh.

1699
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,400
 I think Matt will

1700
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,400
 agree with me. There is only one person that this could

1701
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,400
 possibly be.

1702
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,400
 I mean,

1703
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,400
 Foreman?

1704
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,400
 That's what I would have guessed.

1705
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,400
 Foreman?

1706
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:11,400
 Like, it's not

1707
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,400
 poetic enough to be Ali.

1708
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,400
 Okay.

1709
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,400
 I go Ali.

1710
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,400
 It's too cogent to be Tyson.

1711
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,400
 Yeah. Oh yeah, I don't think

1712
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,400
 it's Tyson. I think it's Ali.

1713
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,400
 Well, I'm going with Foreman.

1714
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,400
 Okay.

1715
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,400
 It's Muhammad Ali. Ah, hell!

1716
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,400
 Hell and damnation!

1717
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:35,400
 I gave you

1718
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,400
 the best hint I could think of giving

1719
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,400
 you, Paul.

1720
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:43,400
 Well, it wasn't good enough. For the win,

1721
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:45,400
 I am closing out the category and the game

1722
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,400
 Comedians for 200.

1723
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,400
 This sassy French

1724
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:51,400
 guard said, "I fart in your general

1725
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,400
 direction."

1726
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,400
 It has to be the character's name.

1727
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,400
 It's the person who put the character's name.

1728
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,400
 French guard.

1729
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,400
 French guard number one.

1730
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:05,400
 It's French guard number one

1731
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,400
 from Monty Python's

1732
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,400
 Quest for the Holy Grail.

1733
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,400
 That's right.

1734
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,400
 Oh, you wanted the, oh, you did want

1735
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,400
 the actor. John, please.

1736
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,400
 Oh, sorry.

1737
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,400
 With that psychological destruction

1738
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,400
 of Jacob, I win.

1739
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,400
 Man, got it! 1200 points!

1740
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,400
 Paul's got a thousand, Paul's got negative 2200.

1741
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,400
 And that's from Sykes Scoop.

1742
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,400
 Thank you, Sykes Scoop.

1743
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,400
 All the others were the comedian names,

1744
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,400
 wasn't it? That's right.

1745
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,400
 I was half joking when I said it.

1746
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,400
 And I feel bad.

1747
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,400
 Don't feel bad.

1748
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,400
 What do you feel bad about?

1749
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,400
 I felt like I accidentally

1750
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,400
 coached you into giving the wrong answer on that one.

1751
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,400
 And I didn't mean to. I was being a joke.

1752
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,400
 Joking. Oh, no, no.

1753
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,400
 I gave the answer I wanted to give.

1754
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,400
 I do enjoy, though, that you feel bad

1755
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,400
 about a joke versus nerd result,

1756
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,400
 though. Especially it was 1200

1757
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,400
 versus a thousand points of real squeaker.

1758
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,400
 Yeah, yeah.

1759
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:05,400
 A nail biter to the end.

1760
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,400
 Thank you, Basi. Basi thinks I should get

1761
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,400
 the points. Um, yeah.

1762
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,400
 Yeah, I

1763
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,400
 agree, Basi. He's his own judge, Basi.

1764
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,400
 He gave himself the negative. We can't, we

1765
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,400
 can, we can do it all we want. He's in

1766
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:19,400
 control of the points. No, no, I would like to

1767
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:21,400
 continue under protest.

1768
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,400
 I would like to continue

1769
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,400
 with protest over my right hand as my left

1770
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,400
 hand and I would like to get the

1771
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:29,400
 points. Fuck you!

1772
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,400
 Ow!

1773
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,400
 I want to thank Penn Jillette for being in this podcast.

1774
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:35,400
 Thanks, Penn. How is

1775
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,400
 Penn? We got a health check on Penn?

1776
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,400
 He's doing good. He's doing good. He is

1777
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,400
 really staying strict to doctors

1778
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,400
 orders, which surprises no one. So he's moving

1779
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,400
 around very little. He just

1780
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,400
 announced this week on Penn Sunday School that they will

1781
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,400
 attempt to do

1782
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:51,400
 basically some kind of

1783
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,400
 theatrical

1784
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,400
 presentation of Penn to resume shows

1785
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,400
 starting February 12th.

1786
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,400
 Penn will be, he doesn't

1787
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:01,400
 want to go on a wheelchair because it's too

1788
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,400
 like weird. Oh, no, no. He's got to do

1789
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,400
 the Axl Rose. That's it.

1790
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,400
 They're going to do the, he's got to do the throne. The throne.

1791
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,400
 They're going to do with, yeah, Axl

1792
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,400
 Rose, Ozzy. Yeah, you got to do

1793
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,400
 the throne. And so

1794
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,400
 that'll be happening there. And so

1795
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,400
 yeah.

1796
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,400
 Those will either be the best

1797
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,400
 Penn and Teller shows ever or

1798
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,400
 the worst Penn and Teller shows ever.

1799
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,400
 Those will not be

1800
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:27,400
 mediocre Penn and Teller shows. Those are going to be

1801
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,400
 ones that you're going to want to go see.

1802
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,400
 If you are a Penn and Teller fan,

1803
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,400
 those are the shows that you want to go check

1804
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:35,400
 out because that's going to be listed. I just want to hear

1805
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,400
 like three jokes that happen from

1806
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,400
 like a lack of being able to figure out

1807
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,400
 something, like seeing how many

1808
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,400
 dominoes it pushes.

1809
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,400
 Oh, right.

1810
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,400
 That's what I want to see. So, yeah, it's going to

1811
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,400
 be fun. Oh, yeah. No, it's going

1812
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:51,400
 to have some things. Speaking of Penn,

1813
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,400
