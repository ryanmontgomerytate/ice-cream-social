 this is the life of the performer right this is how it goes we have lots of our friends who are
 doing the stuff with the sphere the sphere is sucking the very life marrow out of entertainment

 hired partner of mercedes uh and for many years uh not many years for now three years
 um they've been doing events here and also sometimes at the miami location as well and
 this is where this is always this is jacob you've been in the employee of speaker world for quite
 some time we've all been in the employer speaker world for here and there that's um this is my
 first time since the pandemic officially in in their in their employ it is both amazing how much
 talent they attract in front of and behind the stage ah and how much there's attention of of
 always of like
 what what are we what are we doing and why are we doing it
 that's the whole thing and yet right so what i'm a part of in mercedes is like why you do
 hire a spiegel world is because they make strange decisions right so it's spiegel world but they're
 like hey you know the circus act thing is pretty cool but can you do something totally different
 for us we want our mercedes people to feel special their answer was let's build a ski
 line and we're going to build a ski line and we're going to build a ski line and we're going to
 build a giant ski launch let's build a giant ski launch let's have a yeti let's have fake snow
 going let's just totally transport people to something inappropriate to both miami and las
 vegas right right and people fucking love it of course they do it's such a treat to the eye
 they eat it up it's it's incredible ski large we are so jaded yeah ski lodge was one of the best
 things about super freeko yeah right oh and it's still there and it's still it's still rocking it's
 still great yeah there's a hidden there's a hidden ski lodge in super freeko i think there's just a
 market to expand on this and just grow it out he just needs to open up ski lodge diners
 no ross just needs to make some standout some some ski lodge diners it's the diner part that
 he needs a little work on but um why because they don't know how to make food no no the one diner
 they open they turn into a steakhouse so they're not their diner oh no no no this needs to be pizza
 only it needs to go the chucky cheese route you got already you already got the animatronic
 abominable snowman you had some other you had some other animatronics if you add a bunch of
 animatronics but half the animatronics are live performers that pop out every now and then and
 freak people out holy crap i was i was you know what i gotta just i need a meeting with ross
 let me get a meeting with ross i need to sit down and we need to talk about this whole
 revitalization you are accelerating like an f1 race car right now and i'm telling you to pump
 you know what i'm doing you know what i'm doing what's that i'm riding the devil
 that's what i'm doing i was just to say i was worried they might be listening to this but as
 soon as you said chucky cheese pizza i'm positive they turned it off bullshit it needs to happen
 that guy who did evil pie said he was gonna do it he never did it because he dropped the fucking
 ball on a billion dollar idea it needs to happen and it needs to be one of those things where you
 don't know is that an animatronic or is that a real person and that's going to be the best thing
 when that thing walks off the stage and freaks children out and scares everybody in the restaurant
 where are the children coming from it's going to be a family-friendly restaurant
 i've lost track as to where you think this is happening where is this going
 this is worldwide son okay okay okay franchised this is not for the f1 track i got it yeah yeah
 no no no no no no no that was that what you thought i was talking about
 yep no i've no i've taken this story all the way behind now this is my whole thing
 no no once you ride the devil you go different places very different places
 all right all right ride the devil let's bring it back to the enchantment of this
 current iteration of the ski lodge which has yet to reach its full animatronic potential
 well there's no animatronic so by potential that's what i'm saying yeah
 yeah it has not reached its full animatronic potential
 all those billionaires hang out and chat together anyway isn't he talking with elon
 you know all china's replacing their entire workforce with robots
 i don't i don't i don't think that's happening i'll just i i'm i'm doesn't seem like it is very
 hopeful and happy that it's not no i don't i know i know for for all the for all the comparisons of
 our crazy wily ceos uh there's a gigantic divide when it comes to a gulf a gulf of humanity yes
 respect for artists and all that kind of stuff did you see he's such a chode did you see
 elon got completely ratioed on uh twitter recently someone i and i was terrible i can't remember the
 name of the lady but she called him out and she was like this guy has everything he's got the whole
 you know oh god there he is smoking a cigar with all the billionaires um
 he quit distracting paul no it's fine uh but he's got all the money in the world
 and yet he has no passions he's not interested in literature or film or art he's never even he's
 never even complimented a movie he's never even talked about a movie he likes and he got so
 butthurt he started listing movies and like this is a good movie this movie's good oh yeah yeah
 that's terrible he is
 such a loser such a loser oh hold on here hold on here we can we can fix this
 let's see here uh yeah let's do this
 elon
 don't list movies that you like when people say you don't like movies
 that's a bad move that's like listing your black friends it works just as well
 what are you doing it's exactly if only you had black friends it's exactly the kind of move
 it's exactly how it read too it came off so hollow and so ridiculous like he started talking about
 movies from like 2003 like titanic was a good movie yeah that's exactly like the stuff it was
 like what news news broke obviously he's going to become a trillionaire right right right and he was
 like he wrote like i will carry the light of consciousness uh to to other planets into mars
 and beyond or something like that right yeah and someone someone just wrote can you just pay taxes
 on it like can you just pay your fair amount of taxes on it yep it was weird it's like if you if
 you think you take your trillions which no one singular human should ever have um it is a sickness
 having a billion dollars seems like the weirdest craziest thing in in
 history having a trillion dollars i i don't even know what that means that's just it is the biggest
 it is the biggest flaw of americans to not properly fathom the wealth gap and what that's
 seen well right oh yeah we should biggest problem we should be i don't understand why we're not in
 the streets right now that's that's that's well yeah and it's raining out give me an hour too
 give me an hour when it stops raining in an hour i'll go to the streets no problem okay great great
 yeah a trillion dollars is meaningless coffee bean scoop it does lose objective reality for
 most human beings we can't fathom it i think we're all human beings i don't think anybody can
 and it is anti-capitalist because capitalism is uh money re-entering the the the flow of commerce
 and so these are weird dragons hoarding wealth that never gets recycled into the environment
 it never gets back it'll never trickle down and you can't i don't want to get into it but uh at
 oh uh that reminds me uh and also speaking of hoarding wealth we owe an apology uh as a as a
 podcast and as a group to jake paul uh last week we called jake paul a douchebag uh today he announced
 that he has just purchased a 364 carat diamond necklace uh ahead of his upcoming fight and it
 looks like diamond bullets hanging off of his neck so uh sorry jake paul we called you a douche
 i think i said it about logan paul they're both awful they're both monsters paul did you not hear
 what i just said let me tell you about his necklace wait no no no no no no i think of the
 children paul think of the i misheard you gold-plated bullets gold-plated bullets okay
 great oh sorry i got so wound up in my anger use that money to save this planet instead of
 worrying about putting it on other planets like that actually is enough money
 to probably do a lot for this planet when i was a younger man everybody would everybody could just
 have food when i was a younger man and fully locked in with star trek and sci-fi and all that
 i really was a proponent of space travel and and i still am to a degree there have been great
 discoveries that we as a species have made through the advancement of space traveling technology
 velcro is just one however
 having said that when i became a somewhat older wiser man yeah have you guys uh ever heard uh
 gil scott heron's whiteys on the moon yes it's perfect it's perfect uh and that always keeps
 resonating in my head whenever i hear these motherfuckers talking about going to space
 it's like man it's literally because we got way more shit don't know what to do with their money
 like it is too much money because when you have hundreds of millions of dollars
 you can afford every single house that you want on the planet you can travel privately to every
 single place on the planet you can afford every single meal that anyone could possibly prepare
 on the planet you can afford everything every watch every piece of clothing every car i always
 say you don't have to consider money you money becomes uh not a consideration in life yeah it's
 crazy the only reason to go higher is strictly insane ego bullshit yeah and to want that insane
 ego bullshit
 and still want to do nothing or barely anything for humans on the planet is just ridiculous
 yeah it's grotesque yeah um all right but you can't accumulate you can't there's no great
 fortune without uh some great crime right that's what it comes down to and and also just bitching
 about these things and not uh acting on them you know that's just a that's just a waste of our time
 and your time so uh we here at matt maddenley's ice cream social we want to act on this
 so here's what i propose i propose that our patreons give each of us one billion dollars
 and we're each going to use that billion dollars as we think a billionaire should do you know how
 we're going to see how this works out please go to i would even do this podcast if i had
 even a million dollars in my bank account
 oh nothing nothing will stop me from wanting to hear the sound of my own voice paul there isn't a
 lot of money on the planet you know it's still it would be really fun if i had the if i had like
 crazy money i would be setting up uh random live events with us all the time that's okay well that's
 the that is what we would do actually yeah that's it's true that actually is we would we would just
 that's the problem all the play all over it's like that's why a lot of these celebrity podcasts are
 making that loot and catching on because they have the money to go set up live events all over
 the world and get get more interest amy pollard did her first live podcast it's pretty great go
 check it out i listened to it it was good man of scalco is that is that did i say that right
 they said no but i don't have a i don't have a better way to say it man of scalco
 men of scalco men of scalco i don't know medicine calca calico medicine calico very
 malice calco calico um so anyway preachingfund.com uh we need uh three billion dollars after uh
 patreon fees sebastian
 man of scalco so actually nailed the last name and blew the first name with the the hard part
 versus the easy part there sebastian man of scalco that's that's so funny i only listened to the last
 name because that's the part that i just have no idea yeah yeah um yeah or go to we'll show them
 dot org oh my god and uh and we can this is how it's done dot org it lemur creamer is a with more
 animatronics it would be more animatronics as soon as i had the time to do that i would have
 had like crate if i had crazy i would have me a showbiz pizza slash chucky cheese i'd have you
 you would have a basically an animatronic museum it would be i've got that showbiz pizza i've got
 that chucky cheese i've got that combination showbiz showbiz pizza and chucky cheese it would
 be both for sure i would have all of them i'd have chucky and the and the pizza time theater band
 with pasquale and all the other dips and i'd have everybody with the rock of fire explosion for
 get about it oh man guys be amazing some sense really come up in the chat i mean if you take a
 billion we usually get at least you know 200 people to come out to scoop fest if we just
 charge five million a ticket it's done a billion done deal all right i'm gonna tell you what for
 the five million dollar vip ticket yes you're gonna get a lot of attention from us you would
 get away with a lot of personal attention you would get away with a lot speaking of which seems to
 be the case with our entire governmental system speaking of uh of five million dollar scoop fests
 yes we have a guest here we're gonna have have him pop on here jd would you unmute yourself please
 i said jd would you unmute yourself please
 so happy to be here good to see you jd how are you i'm gonna leave that in
 entire pause in oh jesus everyone's gonna assume like some episode error happened
 i'm good very good we're uh we're working on the uh the documentary and uh we're gonna launch a
 go fund me to kind of help raise some finishing funds so remind everyone about the documentary
 in general what is the documentary the documentary about scoops so we were at scoop fest a lot of you
 did interviews with us and and we got some great footage
 and we're probably about 75 to 80 there as far as what we need um right now we have a like a four and
 a half hour rough cut oh man but we still need to fill in those spots so we need to interview jacob
 sj matt sarah and penn we couldn't get penn at scoops because he was sick yeah oh we need to get
 that crew back to vegas they were um a volunteer crew friends of friends um and they're all in l.a
 back at some point when everybody's schedule lines up and get all these interviews again
 um we also need a little bit cash for our art musicians so uh spadoni's doing the music um we
 got brogan and ryer doing some logos for us and we want to make sure all those people get a little
 trash in their pocket yeah and then at the end we're gonna we're gonna submit uh the festival
 or the film to festivals actual festivals so we we want to take it old school
 like we used to do about 25 years ago and and hopefully we can travel around and show it or
 maybe we'll end up selling it we'll see what oh it's so exciting yeah it's uh super fun so i'll
 post the um the gofundme link so i can figure it out well yeah you're gonna post the gofundme
 link in the chat here so the people on uh on zoom can see it and we will post that along
 with the episode description for this very episode that everybody is listening to
 and of course all over the social medias and everything so yeah go uh go check that out
 this is the part of the show where we listen to jd figure out how to copy and paste it's pretty
 great it's solid it's solid material he actually turned his camera off for a second it's pretty
 exciting the coolest thing the coolest thing is that uh you know with with any luck this gets
 a little traction somewhere and generates a little buzz and then who knows what could happen
 with the podcast maybe we could start doing some live shows around the the country tour with the
 with the movie maybe even the goal is for two thousand six hundred dollars that's the start
 the way that gofundme it gears it up so the the full goal is ten thousand but you get paid out
 before that
 got it okay okay it's actually it's way better than like kickstarter or anything especially for
 this since we don't have to get randos to find it and be interested in it we can kind of community
 hopefully community uh raise some money for that it's a reasonable it's a reasonable amount of
 money to fundraise it's not it's not it's not a astronomical yeah and you know i kind of maxed
 out my friend for the production right yeah right if you promise to take the light of consciousness
 to mars and be able to do that i'm not going to do that i'm not going to do that i'm not going to
 beyond. You can ask for a trillion dollars.
 Do you know that?
 What would we do with the other
 $999 billion?
 Don't worry
 about that. We got that covered.
 We have a very interesting experiment
 we're going to do. I think a lot of people are going to be very
 interested. I have some plans.
 You know how you can eat sushi off of people
 at fancy restaurants, JD?
 Just like a lot of people.
 Like a lot of people.
 A train track of people with sushi
 on them.
 I'm going to launch my dream, which is
 Spicy Tuna Train to Chicago,
 where we just eat our way.
 I'm on.
 I'm on.
 Hey, hey, we're on a spicy tuna
 train to Chicago.
 The musical rights itself, and those rights
 are just ours afterward. We can't stop
 making money once we do it.
 Can't stop. Won't stop.
 But it all starts with this
 GoFundMe.
 Yeah, and we're going to get it
 in front of Netflix, because we have connections
 there, and
 we know people from
 the
 De Niro Film Festival
 in Tribeca, in New York.
 Oh, wow.
 Can we ask you, JD, when you go in front of your
 friends, because I know you brought investors
 to see me at the Magic Castle,
 what do you tell them
 when you tell them you want to make a movie
 about us? What do you say to these people?
 That's very funny
 they bring up. So, those were our producers
 that you met, and they were at
 Scoop Dubs with us, and
 I told them I wanted to
 do this, and he just said, yeah, I'll help you. Whatever you need.
 Let's do it. And I said, okay,
 Matt's going to be in L.A. Let's go take a
 look. And he was hemming and hawing about it.
 He wasn't very interested. I, you know,
 sent him a podcast. They didn't listen to it.
 And then when they saw
 you, when they saw you perform,
 I saw him get excited.
 They're already smart people.
 Yeah. Anyway,
 oh, now I kind of get what you're doing.
 Really?
 Yeah, yeah. He got excited,
 and, you know, he's one of my
 oldest friends in the world, and once I saw him,
 he got up on stage with you doing something,
 and he saw his eyes light up,
 and then I had him.
 So, there you go.
 Matt pulled out the fish, and the light bulb
 turned on. The clown was in that show.
 Matt busted out the clown,
 jump-scared the clown. I think I had a fish
 and a clown in that show. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 You know me. Production.
 Production, baby. Production, production, production.
 Yeah, but my pitch
 to people about it is, like,
 this is a very unique community
 that I'm just starting to
 find out about, and now
 I've just found out about Adopt-A-Scoop and all the
 stuff they do during the holidays. It's fucking
 amazing. And the amount of
 love and acceptance
 and
 joyfulness that's in this community
 just blew me away, and that's why I asked
 to do this.
 If this doc can get made,
 and really get out there, and a lot
 of people can see it, it will be
 doing Matt and Paul and I
 a personal favor on
 a different level than I think anybody has really
 thought about, and that is when we have
 to explain to people who aren't in this
 community what this community
 is like, we can now just
 point at a documentary
 and say, watch this,
 because I don't know how to explain it.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that was the hardest thing.
 People are like, what are you doing? And even the scoops.
 When we were at ScoopFest,
 and get everybody to sign the releases,
 several people were like, I don't know
 what you're doing. What is this? What's this about?
 And then I had to try to explain it,
 that this is about exploring this amazing
 community that's grown organically
 over the past 10, 12 years.
 And they're like, oh, okay, that makes sense.
 Yeah.
 Myra makes a good point in the chat, which is like a scoop
 speeding up outside of ScoopFest, like without
 us, they just all get up together and meet up
 with each other. We love seeing
 players of that, and people
 let us know that they got together. It's like the coolest
 feeling.
 Yeah, we got a couple of those stories in our interviews,
 and I was just, like I said,
 the whole community just blows me away.
 Carl Dribelbus, Carl is welcome
 in this community, and he's not welcome in any other community.
 He's not welcome
 to hang out with anyone.
 And there's a tolerance level
 in this community that's higher than anyone
 he's ever worked with, any
 bowling team he's joined,
 any poker club.
 They've all gotten rid of him.
 His family.
 He's still just thriving here.
 We should say that J.D.'s plug for the GoFundMe
 is also sponsored. It's brought to you
 by the following sponsor.
 That's right. It's brought to you by the following sponsor.
 Today's show, no, I'm sorry.
 The Hey Scoops documentary
 Hey Scoops documentary
 GoFundMe is brought to you by

 It's Boston. It's totally Boston.

 harbor. There we go. How about that?
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
 Boston teapot.
 I'm already halfway there. Yeah, I'm gonna turn

 tea harbor. Oh,

 I can tell you already have a bunch. Not since last
 Christmas.
 Well, we all, of course, every Christmas we update
 the family on our tea harbors.
 That's a given. Nobody's talking
 to you anymore, stack of dimes. You need to
 hit the arches.
 I don't know.
 No kidding. No kidding.
 My box
 is all over the fucking
 map.
 That was more
 drifting than the Tokyo drift
 on that accent there.
 I do not have a Boston accent.
 I mean,
 it was like, we're going out to
 the barbershop. We're gonna
 go get a bar. We're gonna go to the
 barbershop. You think you're better than me?
 You think you're better than me?
 Eh? Eh?
 Boston. Tea

 Pack your car. That's
 it. There you go. Pack your car in the
 harbor. Bring your
 sister over here, pencil neck.

 Pack your car.
 That last sponsor ran so long, it's
 time for the next sponsor. Oh, jeez.
 Wow.
 Boston represent.
 Boston represent.
 I really brought it home.
 Okay, I have a serious...
 What you need is your Mayor Quimby. You need a
 Mayor Quimby to get through it.
 But they're not from Boston, are they?
 He's Kennedy. He's Massachusetts.
 Does that work? Yeah. Better than what you
 did, yeah. I'll accept it. Oh, my God.
 Well, if I'd have known that, I would have done
 that. All right. All right. Take two.
 Hey, there.

 One of the wonders of Boston. On the right
 side of the Mississippi. The Grand Canyon.
 One of the wonders of
 the world. Boston's Grand
 Canyon. Oh, look, it's the Mississippi.
 Here in Boston.
 Turns out, it's
 your mom. Your mom is the Grand Canyon
 of Boston, you stack of dimes.
 Yeah. Planes can

 window, and you might just see the most
 cavernous vajay
 that ever walked.
 You've actually got grad
 students still stuck in you.
 Vaginal
 cavity. I know you do.
 Don't

 I think I'm going to just keep using it.
 Production meeting.
 Good. Okay. No, I
 have a serious question for
 JD. Ah, okay.
 JD, come on back.
 This is good.
 Because we were supposed to put it in the last episode,
 so now we're putting him twice in this episode.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Unless he left. Did he leave?
 Oh, there he is. So, JD,
 I am a physical
 media snob.
 Is there a chance that there is a tier
 for production
 of a DVD or
 Blu-ray? There's no
 tiers on a GoFundMe.
 Huh? There are tiers on
 GoFundMes. Aren't there?
 Oh, no. I'm thinking Kickstarter.
 Kickstarter. Sorry, I got confused.
 Paul, I'm in the same boat with you.
 I love physical media. I like buying music
 on vinyl. So, I have
 two goals with this, and one of them
 definitely is to put it to Blu-ray.
 The other one is to get
 your album printed to vinyl.
 Well, that's
 good, because we owe
 like 25 people that.
 We owe people some vinyl copies. We really do.
 That could kill two birds with one stone.
 I still feel bad about that. That's like one of the
 only things we've ever kind of...
 Really fucked up. I think it's the only thing that we ever
 missed. Yeah. Yeah. Like, ever fully missed.
 And people have been very kind about it. The company that we were
 going to use to
 make the vinyl no longer is a
 company. Yeah, that's a
 strike against us. Yeah.
 It's actually pretty easy to do nowadays.
 There's lots of companies that'll do it
 for you. It really has changed, even
 since we recorded the album.
 It's a lot more prevalent, even in just
 a couple years here, yeah.
 We recorded the album
 18 years ago, so yeah.
 I did.
 Oh, that'd be awesome, J.D.
 Sidoni's doing the music for
 the documentary as well.
 So maybe there's...
 Tag that on, make it a soundtrack
 collaboration album, whole big thing.
 Yeah, we'll figure it out.
 Yeah, I would love to do that kind of stuff.
 I do love comic books and stuff like that.
 Yeah, and well, with you mentioning
 there's a four-hour rough cut already,
 are we going to be able to get
 behind-the-scenes deleted footage
 and all that, too? That's what I'd love.
 J.D., I think what Paul's asking for his final...
 Final cut. Can he have...
 Yeah, I do not.
 No, last question.
 Last question. What's the working title?
 Is there a working title?
 Working title right now is just Hey, Scoops the Movie.
 I haven't come up with anything better,
 but I like it, and it kind of...
 It is what it is.
 Yeah, it says everything,
 and it directs people to our website,
 so...
 J.D., here's Paul,
 always thinking about
 shuffling people to their own website.
 J.D., I don't know
 what the fuck to even...
 J.D., how far
 can Paul
 put this cart ahead of the horse
 before you can't see the cart anymore?
 Paul is talking about the trilogy now.
 How much is a booth at Comic-Con,
 and what are we giving out?
 Hey, that's a great idea, man.
 Yeah.
 I'm here for it all.
 If we did a booth at Comic-Con,
 you know what we could do, Matt?
 You know what we could do? Seriously?
 We could doctor it up like a stage,
 and we could put on 15-minute improv shows
 every hour, and it would be one of the most
 popular booths in all of Comic-Con-dom.
 There we go.
 A while back, remember, we really were trying to figure out a way to do
 improv shows, bucket shows,
 at Comic-Con. We did look into that.
 It would have been
 a good idea.
 There's a rumor that Comic-Con is moving to Vegas, too.
 Yeah, that's a rumor.
 That'll make it easier to do the show,
 for sure.
 It will make it easier.
 I think maybe we even need to look into
 PAX or some other
 smaller video game
 cons.
 Smaller cons would be the way to go,
 and it would be interesting that we're supplying entertainment
 at a con that doesn't have evening
 entertainment. That would be a smart move.
 That's the way to go.
 That's the way to go.
 One other person I wanted to shout out real quick
 is Wayne Geo,
 who is doing our animation.
 Joe Benazzi.
 That's my Boston accent.
 He's done how many movies?
 He's doing an intro to our movie.
 Oh, wow. So cool.
 Yeah, and it's
 fucking hilarious.
 He's great. I love his style.
 He's so good.
 That's so cool.
 That makes me kind of jump a little bit.
 That makes my heart really happy,
 because one of my all-time favorite films
 is Christmas Vacation,
 and that whole intro is animated.
 Yeah, and a lot
 of great films started with animated
 stuff, so that's
 awesome.
 One of the greatest artistic casualties
 in my life is that
 when I stopped wearing overalls
 and started wearing a performance tuxedo,
 I stopped.
 I stopped being a muse to Joe Benazzi.
 I stopped appearing in his cartoons.
 It's good to know that
 at least we can pay him to get back
 on the wagon, so that's good.
 Yeah, it's pretty epic.
 I can't wait to show people.
 It's spectacular.
 Great. Well, that alone
 makes me thrilled, too, that you're
 already pleased with the product
 and excited about how it's going to go
 with the final edit and everything.
 Yeah, that's really fun.
 I'm crowdsourcing this within the
 community.
 I'm making sure that they have
 input on this and
 are along for the whole ride.
 It's been an awesome experience.
 I can't wait to finish it and show everybody.
 Well, there you go, guys. We're almost across the finish line
 with the movie, so please help out if you
 can. Even a dollar will probably
 help us get to that goal quicker.
 But not that much. I mean, it won't help that much.
 Nah, yeah. I mean, it'll help.
 It'll help. It won't be nothing.
 It won't help that much.
 Kick it up to two dollars.
 But you're going to take all the time to fill out the form
 for a dollar?
 I will. I will fill it out
 for a dollar. Do ten bucks.
 Yeah. Ten bucks.
 It's on GoFundMe. Go check
 it out. It's HeyScoopsTheMovie.
 The campaign is called Help Finish
 HeyScoopsTheMovie.
 So if you're searching for it, do that.
 Also, the link for it is up on our social media.
 It's up on the episode
 description for this show. Go over there.
 Help it out. It's going to be a really
 interesting project, and I think everybody's
 going to be super interested
 and fascinated.
 in how it turns out. I know I'm going to be.
 It's like, however
 you acquire that dollar, just do that five
 more times before you fill out the form
 is what I'm saying. There you go.
 Just find a way
 to make that dollar five dollars, I think.
 Maybe like a couple of you go
 in, like a couple of you people who are doing
 the dollars, like go in together.
 Like find four friends,
 and all of you go in together on a fiver.
 This is starting to sound like a pyramid
 scheme, Jacob. No, no, no.
 This is a GoFundMe.
 It's a whole different thing. Jacob, if those five people
 just find five more people each, then that'll
 make it much easier. And they find five people, and
 they find five people. Oh, when it comes out of your
 mouth, Paul, I hear it.
 Yep, yep. Especially when he does
 that tone of voice. Boy, that's not the first time
 I've heard that.
 It was usually about the pet bird that we had
 as kids.
 What the hell are you talking about?
 When it comes out of your mouth, Paul, I hear it.
 That was the only thing. Otherwise,
 you couldn't hear the bird.
 Yeah.
 Yep.
 We had no bird
 for long.
 No, we had no bird.
 What? You were being Sylvester.
 Good God, gross.
 I would not, no. I mean,
 they told me it was a swallow, so.
 No, we had no bird.
 We had no bird.
 Why are you yelling at us?
 Because I don't want people thinking I put a bird
 in my mouth for prolonged periods of time.
 As a child. I didn't.
 He did, but he doesn't want you to think that.
 Look, it was for a joke.
 The more you say it, the more
 we think you actually probably had a bird in your mouth
 as a kid. I know.
 No one else brought this up.
 Which is now an even better bit.
 Now it's weird, which I love it.
 Because now it's like, did he put a bird
 in his mouth for a long time? Probably.
 I mean, who knows? Also, it was Kentucky.
 Right?
 Who can say?
 It'd be like, I'd be the Roger Whitaker.
 Sing, sing, sing
 Kentucky songbird.
 Wing, wing, wing your love to me.
 I spent too much
 time traveling on my own.
 Kentucky songbird, I'm
 coming home.
 I put it in my mouth.
 You can't hear it anymore.
 You know who else is very excited
 about that Kentucky songbird?
 As well as JD's second appearance on this
 episode. And that is the following.
 Sponsor. Paul Mattingly's
 Illustrated Guide to Feeding a Fed
 Horse. That's PETA approved
 idiom edition slash
 Boston edition.
 Anybody
 interested in feeding this horse?
 I'm about to crack it like the Liberty Bell.
 Go ahead and get yourself some birds
 and stick it in the horse's mouth.
 Two birds in the horse is worth one
 in the bush, which I just cracked
 like the Liberty Bell. Horse
 Bush Crackin'.
 Horse Bush Crackin'.
 How about them apples, horse?
 You can lead a horse to a bird's
 nest, but you can't make him put a bird in his mouth.
 Enter Hay Scoops at checkout.
 Nest. Yes, and that was the PETA approved
 version of that. Horse nest.
 Horse nest. This is a
 horse house.
 That was from Frozen Cusser, by the way.
 Thanks, Frozen Cusser. Good stuff.
 I did not ever put a
 bird in my mouth for prolonged periods of
 time. No one believes you.
 Great. This is what I'm saying. This is my new
 bit. This is my new thing about me
 maybe or maybe not putting a bird in my
 mouth. He definitely did.
 I'm not saying one way or the other
 now.
 We were
 backstage for the first
 Hillbill shows. Those baby chicks,
 they would come out kind of wet.
 Oh, yeah.
 I think Paul
 put them in his mouth.
 From my mouth juices.
 Um, I
 you know, what happens is, you
 know, I think we had an episode. I thought we already
 had the episode title, but Paul's
 mouth juices. The thing
 is, you know, the birds don't
 realize it because they're in there
 and it's warm and it's nice and dark.
 But the digestion
 process has begun.
 That's wave one of the
 digestion process, right?
 The mouth, the mouth juices.
 Yeah, our stone faces aren't because we don't
 understand what you're saying.
 Okay.
 Remember when that one bird
 came out and looked all
 like it was plucked?
 Listen, as someone who is the
 owner of Schmiki and Schmuki, all this bird
 talk is really kind of just just bring. Oh, my
 God. How many more birds has
 escape artist Schmiki
 gotten away with now? Because they
 they're getting out and killing birds at night now, right?
 Well,
 she was at it again last night. I had to
 literally put like a bunch of things in front of the door.
 Wait a minute.
 I just saw. Hold on.
 I want to hear this, but
 Nick Newman has just shared
 an astounding fact.
 He claims horse saliva
 does not have digestive properties.
 What?
 Again, that's why I had to breaking
 news this.
 So like, how do they
 wait? So they chew, chew, chew.
 So they're just totally chewing. No, no
 additional help from.
 I mean,
 there's stuff inside their inside their gut,
 but it unlike
 with humans, where with humans.
 The digestive
 process begins with the mouth juices.
 All right. Where is where is Newman? See here?
 It'd
 be weird if he wasn't
 because he's typed in the chat.
 Right, right.
 It'd be really weird if he's just typing
 rando stuff and just guessed
 on that. He wouldn't have guessed on that.
 Not in a million years. Could you guess about mouth
 juices? He might be at work and not able
 to talk, though. Where did he go?
 Hey, what's going on?
 There he is. Okay.
 Well, how the hell does the horse
 digestive work if they're if they're saliva
 doesn't have any digestive properties?
 Yeah, their saliva has had no enzymes.
 It is. It is just a
 lubricant and
 the digestion doesn't start until their guts.
 Yeah,
 it's just a lubricant.
 That's why they're so dismissive of a lubricant.
 There's just a lubricant.
 That's why they're big old mushy
 snout. It's more cushion for the pushing.
 So when we give medicine,
 we have to be aware of that, that the
 medicine will not
 start. You can't give sublingual
 medication to a horse. It has to get to their
 gut before it can.
 Podcast.
 Okay. Now, now that we
 have you here and with your horse facts, okay,
 we discussed that a wolf
 used someone else's crab trap, right?
 My cats have learned to escape from their
 own cat. Now, in
 Sweden, birds have figured out how to
 convert litter
 into food. Have you seen this?
 No, no. Litter?
 In Sweden. Like cat litter?
 No, like
 refuse. Just regular trash?
 Yes. So they have
 so they've set up machines
 where if you bring
 basically garbage to this machine,
 the machine will take it in
 and then give out bird seed as a
 thank you. And so
 birds have started cleaning up around
 parks in Sweden. Oh, my.
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
 So they're not actually converting.
 They're not like, it's not Mr. Fusion type
 science. They're not converting.
 I thought you were, I thought you were saying like
 they're learning how to eat cigarette
 butts. No, no, no. That's what I thought.
 And then I thought, man, I'm never
 going to put one of those nicotine
 addicted birds in my mouth again.
 No, but the birds collect
 trash, put it in a receptacle,
 the receptacle
 once having obtained the trash
 gives out some bird seed
 as a reward for the bird doing it.
 Crows are going to love this.
 It's a startup project in Sweden
 by a company called Corvid Cleaning
 and they're training wild
 crows to pick up litter.
 What did I just say?
 And I certainly have not put a crow in my mouth
 all the way.
 All the way? All the way.
 So some of the way you have?
 I didn't say that.
 Okay. Seems like the qualifier implies
 that you can't ever know.
 You'll never know. Seems like a weird
 thing to bring up. You'll never know.
 That's between me and author James
 O'Barr. Yeah.
 Newman, what is the smartest thing
 you've ever seen a horse do?
 I had a horse. He's a racehorse named
 King Sonic.
 And if we didn't fill his water
 bucket, like if his
 water bucket in the stall got too low,
 he would shit in it.
 Whoa.
 And I
 believe he would
 realize that I was irritated
 with the shit I had to clean out of this bucket.
 And he'd be like,
 if you don't fill your bucket,
 you're going to get cleaned.
 And he had a full bucket at all times.
 But he tried.
 Matt, did you ever have any patrons like that
 when you were a bartender?
 Yes. Holding their empty beer glass,
 if I took too long, they just
 shat in their beer glass and put it up on the thing
 and be like, oh, do you want to get me
 a beer?
 That's why Matt stopped allowing patrons
 with kilts into the restaurant.
 I was like, I really got to keep my
 keep up my laps around this Tierney's bar
 or else it'll be glasses of poop.
 I did not get me beer for like
 three minutes. So here you go,
 Sonny. You got a pint
 of Guinness crap.
 You got a pint of poop?
 A pint of poo. A pint
 of the old
 hot brown.
 Enjoy it.
 We did have a woman who would come into the bar
 typically on Sunday afternoons
 and she
 loved the taste of
 bass beer.
 Bass ale?
 Yeah, bass ale.
 But if she had
 too much beer,
 she would blow up the
 restroom, like just
 destroy it.
 Yeah.
 Like,
 hover and destroy.
 Oh, no.
 The hovering is the worst.
 And just turn the women's bathroom
 into a super
 fun site. Oh, somebody gave
 her her fifth bass ale
 and they didn't realize
 she's about to crack that bathroom
 like the Liberty Bell.
 And because she was
 a tiny... She cracked it!
 She cracked it like the Liberty Bell.
 How about them apples, eh?
 That is a spot on Boston accent,
 Paul.
 That's right.
 Look out for the Grand Canyon
 known as your mama's twat.
 What? That's right.
 That's a Grand Canyon...
 I'm sorry, are you Scottish?
 Are you Scottish?
 I didn't know.
 I didn't know.
 I don't know.
 Scooping over girls'
 piff here.
 So because
 she was a petite woman,
 it took us a very long time
 to put two and two together
 that this was happening.
 Because the Sunday Day crowd
 didn't attract a lot of women.
 So therefore, we weren't going to the women's bathroom
 very often in the shift
 to check things out, right?
 And it took us... It was Pat,
 my buddy Pat, who finally was figuring out
 that this woman, if she had a second beer,
 would like shit herself all over.
 The thing...
 So now here's my question to you.
 To you, Matt. Here's my question to you.
 So we all have feverish flashbacks, right?
 Because, you know, someone finishes a beer, you go,
 you want another one? Whatever.
 And I used to always make fun of the fact that she would giggle
 and be like, oh, really? Oh, uh...
 Oh, shoot.
 And she was like, uh, yes, I suppose.
 She got really excited about getting that second beer.
 Because she was playing
 Russian roulette with her asshole?
 Yes.
 And I was like, oh my god, that explains why she was so fucking weird
 every time I offered her a second beer.
 That's really funny.
 This is my question to you.
 Yeah.
 Fucking howitzer back there.
 In your theorizing. Well, this is what I'm wondering, Jacob.
 Is... What do you guys envision?
 Are we thinking like
 a whoopee cushion type
 flapping action?
 Or are we talking like
 a hole so tight it's like
 putting your thumb over the end of a garden hose
 thus causing all the crazy...
 Was she just really
 clenched back there
 and that was what caused everything going crazy?
 Or was it all flippity-flappity?
 No, I think she's too loose.
 I think your flippity-flappity is right on.
 She's flippity-flappity. All right.
 She's flippity-flappity.
 All right.
 There's no way she's going to make it home, right?
 Well, I tell you what.
 I'm going to start peeping on the girls
 drinking the bass ale at the bars
 because I got the flippity-flappity going on.
 Because you like that hot brown.
 I'm down for the flippity-flappity.
 Nobody tell Ann.
 What?
 She's like, yeah, Paul Mattingly will go to a bar.
 I'm going to go to a bar.
 Any minute now.
 That's really funny, man.
 Yeah.
 And that really explained her odd behavior.
 Yes.
 Did she ever cop
 to blowing up the bathroom?
 Was she subtle enough?
 Could you smell it on her when she got out?
 You say it went everywhere.
 She was still pretty clean?
 She did not come out looking like a dirty gal?
 I think she didn't come out like a...
 A poop scarecrow?
 Yeah.
 Can you imagine?
 She came out covered in shit and hay
 and she's just like,
 I don't know what happened.
 I don't know what happened.
 I got attacked by someone dressed up
 like the Wizard of Oz.
 I believe she would leave after she
 fucked the bathroom.
 Oh.
 So you couldn't get a real good look.
 Yeah, was it?
 Did anybody see any...
 Did she ever, like, trail anything out of the
 restaurant?
 Was there ever, like, a...
 It's not that I don't appreciate your questions, Paul.
 It's that...
 He signed an NDA.
 The answer to all these questions means
 we would have figured it out was her sooner
 than we did.
 It took us a while to decipher.
 It doesn't necessarily...
 You wouldn't necessarily have been able to follow the trail.
 Uh, I don't know.
 I mean, if you look at the floor of Tierney's...
 If you look at the floor of Tierney's Tavern,
 it's on the same floor.
 This is 1938.
 She might have walked backwards to throw you off.
 She might have done some weird, tricky...
 And, like, gestured to things on, like,
 the shelves and stuff, just pointing.
 Yeah.
 Oh, look at that.
 As she's leaving.
 And then suddenly you look down and there's just...
 She was doing card tricks on her way out
 just so you wouldn't look at her feet.
 There's this thin stream going on.
 She's going all the way from the bathroom.
 You're like, what the hell?
 No, and then...
 I've heard of a snail trail, but this is ridiculous.
 So we eventually kept the one-beer rule.
 She would come in, we'd have a beer,
 and then we would just ignore her until she left.
 I bet she was relieved in a lot of ways.
 And then not relieved in some other ways.
 She was more relieved after a second bath.
 Oh.
 Yeah.
 More like ass ale.
 Am I right?
 Exactly.
 Ass ale.
 Ass bale.
 Ass bale.
 Move the B over.
 While we've been talking, I've been doing some internet searches
 while we've been talking because my Google search history
 is not weird enough.
 And apparently a lot of people complain about bass
 making them shit themselves.
 Apparently it's not an uncommon critique of bass ale.
 What is the diuretic in bass ale?
 Well, all liquor is a bit of a diuretic.
 Oh, really, Professor Jacob?
 Do tell.
 I just did.
 That's where you're suspicious of Jacob's science and saying
 all liquor is a sense of dung.
 I just want to know more.
 Apparently someone...
 I mean, I didn't have to ask him anything.
 He's just like, right off the cuff, he's like,
 Oh, yes, well, it turns out that all liquor has certain medications
 or properties that...
 I did not use my Boston accent.
 They often cause the flappity-flappity to go very short and brown.
 Yeast and gas.
 Alcohol increases your gut moddily.
 Things move through you faster.
 I don't know.
 M-O-T-I-L-I-T-Y.
 Modality.
 M-O-T-I-L-I-T-Y?
 Motility?
 Motility.
 Yeah, motility.
 Yeah, motility, yeah.
 I guess, sure.
 Motility.
 Things move through you faster.
 Your body has less time to absorb water,
 and that makes looser, quicker bowel movements.
 All right.
 Well, if you're bound up like a cat in a cage, maybe have a bass.
 They should start branding it that way.
 Why don't they start branding it?
 We can do a whole new Big Mouth Billy Bass.
 Why is there not Bass Ale next to the...
 Prune juice in the old person's section at the store?
 Why isn't there?
 Yeah, why isn't there?
 Probably because of liquor laws, but it's stupid.
 Ah, okay.
 Maybe they could put prune juice next to the Bass Ale in the liquor cabinet
 so people would get the idea.
 I'm also curious.
 It was black and tans, right?
 Yeah.
 That's where people do half bass.
 That's no way to speak of her.
 Half Guinness, half Bass Ale is called a black and tan.
 Oh, is that right?
 Okay, okay.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 I thought for a second you were turning into an ice agent.
 Go ahead.
 Oh, my God.
 Have you heard that song?
 Yeah.
 Jesse Elms, is that his name?
 Yeah, it's fucking great.
 I've been following him on TikTok for a minute.
 Really well written.
 On a lot of different socials.
 He has some really cutting songs.
 I guess his first album just came out.
 He's blowing up.
 Jesse Wells.
 Oh, good for him.
 Jesse Wells.
 Jesse Wells.
 He's so good.
 Have you heard any of his stuff?
 Jacob?
 Yeah, I have.
 I know him from social media.
 Oh, yeah.
 Folk singer.
 Really, really strong.
 No, I didn't know he had an album.
 That's really cool.
 His Join Ice song is South Park level, scathing and well written.
 I did hear, I heard clips of this.
 This was, it was amazing.
 Yeah, that's interesting.
 That's an interesting thing to note, Matt.
 I would be surprised if he doesn't get tapped to put together some sort of musical.
 Yeah, I mean, yeah.
 If you say right for South Park, which is not the gift that you think,
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
 Put together his own musical.
 You talk to anyone who's ever.
 Yeah, yeah.
 I just think it's a fun fact for people to know is if you ever listen to anyone who's
 ever been tapped by South Park to be a writer, it is a brutal, crazy ass process to be.
 Unless you're, unless you're a hater, right?
 He had, he's the only one that had fun with it.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Yeah.
 But he'd already made his bones, so he didn't have to sweat it.
 He was already Bill Hader.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 But yeah, anyhow, sorry.
 I got distracted because I heard it this morning and I was just like,
 my jaw was on the floor.
 I was like, good Lord, this song.
 So a black and tan.
 Yes.
 Do you think that would be a proper diuretic remedy?
 Um, it would, it would slow things down.
 Right.
 Cause the, uh, I don't think stout has the same effect.
 Oh, oh, so it's like, Oh, no, I'm saying, no, I don't even know what mortality means.
 So maybe I shouldn't be saying what it's like.
 Going to Chili's.
 I down a fifth of Pepto-Bismol.
 Before I eat my triple dipper.
 So it all kind of works out in the wash.
 I got you.
 That's why he is a motherfucking professional.
 I mean, yeah, pre-pepto, I call it my Pepto talk.
 I'm giving my system, the Pepto talk, I guess.
 Oh, what I was going to get at is that like, I don't go to bars nearly as often, but I don't even think bad.
 I don't, I don't think bass is still on tap at tyrannies.
 I haven't, what was the last time I've seen bass on tap anywhere is what I was trying to think of.
 Is bass still like a bass?
 It's around very, very often.
 I think, I think it's, I think it's a, I think it's an old, old, I think it's gone the way of the.
 Does it have, does it have fish in it?
 Fish, fish oil.
 That's what really gets it going.
 It's the fish oil.
 What do they call that?
 What do they call it?
 Omega three and omega six fats and the, uh, and the bass ale.
 Omega three fatties.
 That was your nickname for that, that crazy shitter later.
 That's the name of this.
 Oh, here comes omega three fatty.
 If Jacob would put on a few LBs, we could be an omega three fatty.
 Sorry.
 God damn it.
 I'm trying.
 Omega three fatty.
 I had dinner.
 We're the alpha three fatty.
 Thank you very much.
 That's right.
 Who are we kidding?
 We're the beta three fatties.
 We're the beta three family.
 Speaking of betas, let's do a little jock versus nerd.
 Yeah, Josie and the beta three fatties.
 Ladies and gentlemen, it is time.
 Beta three fatties.
 Time for jock versus nerd.
 Explosion.
 A very slippery poop.
 We got a scooper to come in.
 to us today from keister sunday oh keister sunday thank you been a minute yeah this is a uh uh uh
 what's that what's the thing the the uh the second movie sequel that's the movie where i can't think

 paul i will take sci-fi for 800 let's go oh yeah it may be a case of being too ambitious for a
 single movie which is why the recent adaptation is multiple films but this 1984 sci-fi epic
 is the only movie david lynch regretted making for he is the quitsox it is dune

 so much better than the one and two disney daydlow classic starring the dude is way more boring than

 that is another good one it's a good but it's such a good movie it's so not i feel like it's
 not the praise you think it is the filmmakers don't want to hear that that's for sure i love
 tron i know i hear that i hear people say but i but it to me i don't know i don't know i don't know
 there's that's a high level of praise that i fall asleep to your movie because it means it's my
 it's a comfort movie for me and i've watched it a lot so anyway all right i'm telling you it doesn't

 you leave enough room for my fist because i'm going to ram it in your stomach and break your
 goddamn spine is it break your goddamn spine i remember being such an awkward frame break your
 goddamn spine yeah now the thing is i still don't know what movie this is but the contract makes me
 think it's running man scooper nova girl is saying twins i think that's a good guess
 no i think i think you're dead on uh running man is my guess jacob
 running man is i'm sorry matt it's the running man oh damn it running man i'm sorry they're
 remaking the running man it's already out and flopped dude it's already it already came out
 made no money no no paul i hear they're remaking it man you say so maybe the third time's a charm
 they're already making remaking the glenn powell version of running man
 uh i'll keep at the the sci-fi
 please for 400 all right daily double oh now now comes the big windfall daddy
 my name is jacob in this fun 80s romp cardinal blick from dogma guides neo and one of the lost
 boys to passing their history exam and creating world peace through the power of rock music
 bill and ted's excellent adventure oh i'm sorry it's bogus journey i'm sorry it's bogus journey
 no it's the first one bogus journey involves death adventure that's true yeah and he even
 raps um i'll do um 80s comedy 400 a year before killing those people in ireland abe froman sausage
 king of chicago is guilty of truancy but don't worry all around swell human being uh jeffrey
 jones is on the case oh my god
 oh my god that question that question i am so confused by that question oh i think i i think i
 even get the no i get the references i don't even know what it's talking about before killing those
 people in ireland abe froman sausage king of chicago is guilty of truancy but don't worry
 all around swell human being jeffrey jones is on the case so do you know who jeffrey jones is
 that's the that's the part that i'm missing i think i gotta pass
 matt oh uh so the it's this is all matthew broderick uh the movie is ferris bueller's
 day off and uh year before killing all those people in ireland is matthew broderick when he
 was an actor uh killed a bunch of people in ireland and they basically paid off and covered
 up the case uh he plays he said he lies and says he's abe froman sausage of chicago oh that's his
 alias in that that's right and jeffrey technically i think uh cameron is the one that provides the
 voice for abe froman oh i think you're right
 is the guy got kicked out of the he plays the principal he's the one that's kicked out of the
 beatles movie because he's a oh that guy bit of a diddler yes yeah yeah there you go there you go
 ferris bueller's day off that's correct matt and uh matt it's your turn uh 80s comedy 600 please
 the director of the smash hit dark shadows also made this little known film in the 80s starring
 batman thelma and stephen baldwin's less talented brother

 the thing like why should why why get into this at all um uh we love walking on the tightrope baby
 uh let's move on i'll say sci-fi for 200 that's where i'm going
 i mean we all hate him that's all i'm saying for lloyd how to pronounce gigawatt
 just that's the whole question is who the hell taught christopher lloyd how to pronounce gigawatt
 did he not pronounce it correctly in back to the future which is the answer to this question
 gigawatt did he say gigawatt or gigawatt he says gigawatts 1.21 gigawatts well there you go
 i guess that's how you mispronounce it yeah and matt closing out the category and the game 80s
 for 200
 1984 classic a festively dressed burned victim tickles johnny depp in his sleep
 until he's turned into a gravity defying blood typhoon it's true that is true all happened
 for real it wasn't a nightmare it's all happening for real for real on this road
 never meant to kill you in your dreams
 i'm sorry for your terrible screams
 uh matt that's your question oh it's me oh nightmare on elm street sorry there you go

 you want to send us in a scoop or your price of strike jock versus nerd or an obelisk jock versus
 nerd or some scoop mail you can do all those things right over there at hey scoops.com go
 over there it's on the home page make us uh jock versus nerd send us some scoop mail we love to
 hear from you we need to hear from you it's part of the whole show it is um i was basically lost
 in like trying to find how i was going to say the kevin spacey thing and not leave a curiosity and
 worse things happening going to a future episode so um uh uh
 on the one hand he was acquitted of everything he was never convicted uh he had one conviction
 in a foreign court that was overturned and on the other hand you're not entitled to be a movie star
 like uh like uh being a working actor is one thing being a star involves affection and you
 can lose affection right and there are many people who've had their career take a downturn
 for less controversial reasons who simply can't be actors anymore
 right so the idea that kevin smith kevin smith kevin spacey let's not mix those two up
 dr freud the idea that kevin spacey is homeless to me just simply says he's not willing to work
 at any other job like you can do other things besides act he's and make money like you're not
 like do something else yeah he's getting what he deserves what a show um yeah yeah
 yeah i'm just i i don't i don't believe that he is destitute or anything like that yeah so i so i'm
 just i just don't care about the the story at all it also means it also means like did you do
 nothing with your money while you were like making all that money like what are you including just
 putting it in a mattress or something yeah nothing like shack owns like 400 annie ann pretzels like
 right get yourself a franchise buddy he has a pizza named after him get some buffalo wild
 wings going yeah shakaroni we could be eating space or running pizza right now wondering what
 it's named for we don't remember uh why aren't we taking those streets yet there's a trillionaire
 oh all right i'm still waiting it is it is still raining that is that is a fine point
 a very slick investment opportunity he could have invested in storage units called it kevin spacey's
