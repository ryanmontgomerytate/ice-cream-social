 Also sitting in Las Vegas it's me Jacob.
 We're preaching fun.
 Hey everybody.
 I'll tell you what I am preaching fun but I accidentally just bummed myself out yesterday.
 Oh.
 Oh no.
 What did you do?
 So it's.
 Did you read the newspaper?
 Well this is the thing right so I don't listen to news podcasts anymore I'll listen to Justin
 Robert Young when I feel like I can take it.
 Right sure.
 When I feel like I'm okay.
 It's absolutely yep.
 Because he tells it like it is and the way he's telling it.
 I don't like the way it is and the rest of the time you normally just play myself with
 sports podcasts and right now there's not a lot of sports happening.
 And so.
 Right.
 I was going to the back catalog of Pablo Torre explains was it explains all that's Clarissa.
 I also always get Pablo Torre and Clarissa confused.
 Yeah.
 Easy to do.
 Yeah.
 Finds out.
 Pablo Torre.
 Finds out.
 Melissa Jonard.
 And they're talking about this like obscure statistician guy from the 80s doing like a
 deep dive and this guy who was kind of ahead of the Saber Metrics thing before that became
 a thing.
 If anyone doesn't know what we're talking about it's like the basically the nerds won
 breaking down baseball and the nerds won breaking down basketball and he was the first nerd
 to break down basketball and he was.
 Is he the is he the moneyball to basketball that the moneyball guy was the baseball correct
 the guy Bill James who started who started the moneyball craze he was in the moneyball
 GM but he was the guy who first started kind of breaking down baseball as a solid thing
 anointed this guy whose name I'm forgetting as the moneyball basketball.
 Yeah.
 But that guy did not go on to have different success and basically I guess I guess trigger
 warning suicide oh no we yeah.
 He didn't have depression he didn't feel like he should have done something he literally
 laid out an argument like he that have arguments for basketball players he was a very laid
 out argument oh wow that he basically wanted to end his life specifically on his 60th birthday
 and just be done with it and.
 When you say this bummed you out huh.
 This this super upbeat story somehow you're out you've got like three years what are you
 worried about man.
 And I'm thinking I'm reading you know I'm at the gym I'm walking my kids soccer practice
 I just was like reading about the subsurface statistician you know yeah and then that takes
 a turn and I'm sure there's a warning in the notes I never read the episode notes you know
 right.
 And so but it was like also fascinating you know like he wrote all these emails to his
 family and put them to be sent hours after his death.
 He made sure he like he really set it all up yeah he made sure to do it at the back
 parking lot of a police department so he could call nine one one so he could be an organ
 donor and no one who hadn't dealt with death would have to see him besides people who were
 in charge of doing that.
 Like it was this very crazy intricately thing yeah yeah yeah and it really I'm inspired
 I'm not depressed by this I'm inspired by this pump the brakes we got a scoop vest today
 Jacob slow down slow your roll oh you are not helping your case sir I know I know.
 And I was like oh man and then I was like well I'm going to get off you know I still
 had some walking to do at the soccer practice and so I was like I'll switch over and I decided
 to listen to two characters and a clown.
 Which one?
 The last one oh it's over right so I'm just gonna tell you this it is a fascinating one
 to listen to because when they start the episode they don't know they're doing their last episode
 really oh yes it's that much that much of a thing huh oh I did I had no idea right it's
 not a bad blood thing is it no it's fascinating again another really fascinating it's just
 a mutual agreement that they're done yes but everybody's still amicable the everybody's
 still friends still working with each other backstage and still loving each other what
 happens is you kind of listen to the episode and I knew that this was their last episode
 so it was fascinating to listen to it unfold it was fascinating to hear them realize it
 yeah but so I knew it was their last episode but I thought it was going to be them coming
 on air to talk about why they're going to do their last episode and instead I listened
 to 11 minutes of them talking about crab cakes and fish cakes and I'm like this is really
 weird and then it's like so clear that they have and those words have to forgive me for
 I mean I don't know I'm just going to talk about it but like it's so clear that there's
 a bunch of straws on the back of the Campbell's so to speak right now they're talking about
 how things are changing at work they're talking about that things that those are dealing with
 at home and then they talk about getting a complaint email from a listener and then they
 kind of get into like why why no I don't want to go I want to talk to you guys but I don't
 want to talk about stuff on there like I don't want to worry about what I'm saying oh hey
 to you guys right and like it is it is it is a fascinating listen because it's very
 clear Jimmy is the first one who's out right but realize yeah so yeah so for this you have
 to know that the podcast is two characters and it's three friends of ours they all work
 backstage at a Cirque du Soleil show they've been doing a podcast for three and a half
 years and well they all work on stage they're all three performers at a Cirque du Soleil
 show yeah they're literally two characters in the show and a clown yeah yeah and and
 and you still have if you're just skirmish now you have three and a half years of fine
 episodes yeah for instance I just subscribed to it I'm really looking forward to catching
 up when there's like a half hour left maybe a little more RJ makes a big like dark night
 of the soul speech to Jimmy like really tries to get Jimmy to like understand and feel his
 like value things like this and Jimmy is having none of it like none of it and that was really
 that's what really it was hurting me it was like hurt it was like yeah to listen you know
 it does that doesn't listen to that I was like so buddy you know he's he's telling Jimmy
 how valuable Jimmy is and Jimmy's like yeah okay yeah and Jimmy's not buying it right
 what come on Jimmy exactly and then it's really funny because then Johnny just comes in right
 and starts talking and I timed it RJ doesn't speak for 25 minutes after his big speech
 nothing so I was like oh Johnny's the only one who knows who thinks this is still a podcast
 right now I think RJ knew on the big speech and when it was just letting with nothing
 he was like no we're done we're done and then oh wow and then so you know I mean spoiler
 it's it's a fascinating listen so I'm not even I mean I'm it's all spoiler but it's
 all yeah it's all fessing listen oh listen anyway RJ just goes back and he goes so why
 don't we just stop doing like right like F is not speaking at all wants to do it Johnny
 is caught off guard I don't think people realize even even RJ's friends even me yeah I I fall
 into this trap too I forget what a thinker RJ is yes RJ will sit and think and ponder
 over something and then when he comes back into the conversation he's got it all straight
 and out total and you don't realize it for a minute or two yes big heart big brain that
 boy of course just yeah really loves his voice and he literally just he says let's stop doing
 the podcast on there you can't hear you know you're it's an audio podcast Johnny's struck
 and RJ goes look how big the smile on Jimmy's face is and Johnny does it goes oh you're
 right it's over and then and I was like walking around my neighborhood like I had to push
 pause to like make dinner for my kids and I was like god damn it I was like riveting
 I was just like kids ruined everything crawling with discomfort my friends and also like totally
 enthralled and then I had to like table it for an hour and then go finish it on a nightwalk
 and I was just like I was teary eyed walking I was like just it was the most crazy podcast
 episode ever like I couldn't believe it I think it's hilarious but I had honestly been
 saving it because I was saving it's the strong word but I've been saving it because I was
 like oh they've got their last episode up I've got a you know basic time to listen to it
 now I'm just fascinated yeah no I know cuz like you know I was trying we were lining
 them up for a trivia battle right and so that's when RJ let me know that he's like oh I don't
 I don't think that's a good idea I was like what and same thing I was like bad blood anything
 he's like no no no no no everybody's happy and so it just it was just so clear that the
 choice to be a podcaster just wasn't what they wanted to do you know well it was a secondary
 there's a secondary choice well that's it they bring us up at the very end they bring
 the big up this podcast at the very end and and saying they don't want to become what
 we are right they see our they see our world as a burden and well they also have real jobs
 that was like I could like scream across the my headphones what's I was like I was like
 you know I we this podcast is what we are like yeah right we we we weren't very successful
 guys doing something else I thought you know I know shed a little light this is this is
 our successful thing and then we use this to bounce into other possibilities and entrepreneurialism
 this is our Cirque du Soleil this is yeah this is what we're walking the tightrope right
 now baby this is the thing when we tell people about this thing people go oh exactly when
 they tell people about Cirque du Soleil people go oh right we tell people about our little
 podcast and people are like oh that's very nice for you guys no one goes up to them after
 their shows it was like should you guys podcast also because I really want more of you guys
 so scoop scoop Jesus is say Jacob was successful and that's true but I think Jacob will also
 make the point that as successful as he is and he is very good at his job and has a lot
 of success as a sound guy he still gets a lot of interactions with fellow performers
 who are like this is a different thing how do you make this podcast thing cook how do
 you write this is a very different thing than what I do and I tell you what to to to Matt's
 point and you're talking to the guys about you know doing there doing the Cirque shows
 and then doing the podcasting stuff I would be a very different podcaster if I didn't
 have a day job every time I talk about quitting running shows SJ lets me have it she's like
 what are you talking about you're just gonna podcast all the time if you don't run shows
 you're just gonna podcast all the time what are you gonna talk about on these podcasts
 right it's true it's true you gotta have you gotta have some external life you gotta
 have some external life before it comes in yeah yeah yeah this is this is a whole different
 thing from from what I do when I go to when I go in and run a show I mean I sit back there
 I'm executing somebody else's vision I'm doing all these types of things here you know it's
 us it's it's like we're this is our thing we get to do whatever we want on this because
 it's us yeah also we also all three don't work with each other right like so like one
 of the fun I was gonna say we don't share a dressing room we get yeah we get a break
 but but no but with that like the whole reason why I love why I wanted to do the podcast
 with Paul in the first place was I was I was a dad and I was and all I like to do for my
 entire teens and 20s was bits all I want was bits all I want to do is bust balls and make
 jokes with friends and I knew that being a dad would make that go away a lot not all
 the way but a lot compared to what I was sure and so I was like oh get let's get in a space
 where we can make fun of stuff and good calls and so it was definitely like a big time branch
 for me both personally professionally to like get this going so yeah but that but and that's
 things like so I said texting with RJ afterward like like yeah this is what podcasting is
 to me and you guys don't require any of it you know right you don't require any of it
 so it was really interesting I mean because they do all three of them share that dressing
 room right it was there yeah yeah and like I don't know how we would do that I would
 say I don't know if we had if we had a dressing if we saw each other off microphone and off
 camera all the time I don't know how we'd still do a show totally yeah and especially
 if it gets like uh touch and go whether we can talk about where we work together or not
 right right oh yeah that's huge um and I would say that I think I think that the maybe the
 toughest time for this actually the pandemic second toughest time for this podcast uh was
 when Paul and I worked together worked together oh sure I think I think 50 shades was probably
 the a harder spot yeah and it became the dominating uh talking point like we'd had to we had to
 purposely branch out from that yeah yeah yeah I mean we literally butted heads were like
 I didn't care about biting the hand that fed me and Paul was like this is a bad idea to
 bite the hand that feeds you well yeah and uh and and it was a long term right Matt didn't
 care about it and Paul did yeah and I and I shouldn't have I shouldn't have given a
 fuck shouldn't have given a roaring fuck but it's easy to say that when we're when we're
 out of it it's easy to say we shouldn't have cared about something that we're no longer
 inside of yeah yeah yeah it is it's like people it's hard to say you don't care about people
 while you're inside of them it is hard to say that I've I've done my best yeah uh and
 that's not the only time Paul did that when we did the scoop cruise I was making fun of
 the opening uh show in the elevator right and they and our passengers got off the elevator
 and Paul let me have it and by the way that was very helpful Paul was like do not talk
 shit about anything everyone reports everything to everyone on cruise ships everybody has
 ears you cannot yeah uh as an entertainer talk shit uh he was right then even though
 I my pride didn't want him to be and um and I don't think I was too mean about it you
 were you were not I was probably serious about it you were very serious and very direct about
 it you were not you were you were direct about it I wouldn't say you were mean about it but
 you were direct about it well because I I'd done nine months on a cruise ship yeah yeah
 you were just you were just real about it live that fucking life baby yeah well on some
 things like I'm not like that moment was would turn out to be very key to what I'm doing
 now like so like I'm not saying you're out of you're wrong in any way I'm saying like
 in hindsight like I was like right not only were you right then but I'm even more grateful
 now I go right I go on cruise ships like everything is bugged exactly and it is because it is
 it fucking is I mean seriously fucking Orkin man you go to enough ports where everyone's
 toting machine guns and you get a little sense in your mind like oh there could be some shit
 going down I bet people are really looking out for stuff yeah you know what I mean like
 you know yeah you go to enough places where you're like oh there's some serious military
 hardware like back in these ports they're not gonna they're not gonna let games get
 played yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah uh I'll tell you who doesn't let games get played in their
 ports and that is the following sponsor today's show no I don't believe it today sure the
 show that the show I don't think anything anytime soon it's brought to you no they didn't
 think it was either uh Matt and Mattingly's meet the wolf man act for scene three Matt
 escapes the wolf man by prepping him to perform unfool us from scoop John Fink we now take
 you to act for scene three of Matt Mattingly meet the wolf man yes great job wolf man love
 the pizzazz you have to get that giant dirty thick fingernail underneath two cards but then
 at the top of the deck with him hold it as one you're gonna lift it up oh man I'm trying
 these paws ain't cooperate very good it's just called a double lift you can still lift
 up both cards and show it to the artist like one what do you say we rearrange my appointment
 time for a full moon and I could just do my straight transformation routine the problem
 is that Lincoln that fools likes to bump people around depending on the schedule and your
 local so he knows he can bump you around so you're not gonna get the spot that we can't
 rely on that's fine I get it I get it but I mean I'm a rare reverse werewolf I'm wolf
 man all the time except during a full moon I understand I understand why don't we just
 rehearse some of the lines like so so Penn and Teller did I fool you want to try that
 one so Penn and Teller did I fool you okay I feel like the fool is a little long oh I've
 been going to speech therapy for a long time but it just don't take yeah yeah no I understand
 I think you got a rabbit I could eat can't you pull one out of your hat yeah come on
 stereotype my ass that's why I got in the biz oh did you win your team's high school
 basketball championship while we're doing while we're doing stereotypes back and forth
 did you come here riding on top of your friend's van just because my best friend happened to
 be Stiles very common team will preferences is there a young lady named Booth that has
 some of your attention but not as much as it should I can't believe her name was boof
 man what was her name remember proposing that we should just end the show at episode one
 thousand oh yeah yeah and that bothered Paul a lot what I even just well I I quickly fixed
 it and said no that's the beginning of season two we're off to the races oh I saved myself
 for another thousand episodes season two might be the last season it might be the season
 one might have been the penultimate season that's we're going to the third season here
 I think we don't know how long season two might be oh well I mean it's gonna be a thousand
 episodes at least at least I guess we know a season is at least a thousand episodes maybe
 for for for bit sake it's a thousand and one and then season season three starts on one
 thousand two oh that's are explained to a friend the other day that asked about a friend
 of mine was asking about podcast season remember that note for seven years but yes keep keep
 going I'll remember that easily we need at least seven seasons says bossy I will be dead
 by season seven so that's gonna be tough that's gonna be tough not to say someone couldn't
 pick this ball up my children and all and all of your dogs my dogs will be long dead
 before that you won't whatever incarnation of whatever whatever sled dog team you currently
 are adopting or fostering okay oh my god you're right it's never gonna stop yeah so speaking
 of my dogs talking to Matt's kids the reason I was a little bit behind today was we're
 working with a contractor who their mascot is a little corgi dog in a hard hat so it's
 really cute so that helped get all right all right let's say let's say percentage give
 me a percentage how much of a percentage of of you selecting this contractor had to do
 with that image oh eighty percent easily good okay because because that was part of it and
 and sent me that link and everything and we we saw that so we're like yeah like we're
 good to go so uh yeah it was really you know they know their market uh yeah these are exterior
 house uh painters and what do you call it and so uh ann had been looking to get some
 work done on the exterior of the house for a long time and she's already had you know
 ideas sent out to uh professional planescapers that can make it look like you know how they
 want and so she's got all the great the paint ideas set everything set and we got finally
 a consultation today they had to move their time back a little bit just because they were
 super busy but the we're supposed to be meeting at noon we ended up meeting closer to one
 so that's why i got pushed back a little bit time-wise but looks like everything's gonna
 move forward and hopefully by october we're gonna have new exterior uh colors and uh things
 done and also the big thing the brickwork the brickwork which i might add that allowed
 for the entrance of one squirrel into my basement so the uh so the lack of brickwork the lack
 of brickwork so we're gonna get that all touched up they can do that as well so we're gonna
 get that all patched up and they're gonna do this process uh called uh lime washing
 cutting the brakes in that truck they absolutely are they went in but we're gonna get it limed
 washed and uh it's gonna look really nice so the brick the brickwork's gonna get touched
 up masoned in fixed up and then what's the lime washing do uh it makes it look white
 essentially okay instead of you know different shades of of white instead of the regular
 brick color that we have got there right now oh so oh it's what it makes it lighten up
 okay exactly some of it is kind of like falling apart there is a piece of brick missing from
 the very front of our house where it's really close to a vent for the air conditioning system
 and i could look in that vent and i could see outside of my house and so i was like
 okay so currently well that's event the mattingly fix that's going on for that piece of brickwork
 right now is a big goopy chunk of great stuff i scored it into the wall so you've got all
 this brick and then this hunk of yellow nasty just hanging off the side but you can't get
 back i would have suggested a towel i would have suggested just shoving a towel in there
 no it wouldn't have a towel wouldn't have worked it wasn't that big of a gap but it
 was big enough okay the great stuff worked so there you go uh yeah yes i know ranch slunky
 we can't paint uh exactly so the lime washer allows this that's interesting look at that
 perfect ranch slunk coming through with the info ranch slunk in the chat says uh brick
 should not be painted as it needs to breathe lime wash allows for this so that it does
 not crumble due to weathering exactly uh gosh that's a big shame because all of the brick
 on the on my house is all painted we finally gave him his thank you and then he's coming
 off everywhere with these facts it's pretty great i doubt well i'll tell you i'll tell
 you jacob your brickwork is probably safe given the environment that it's in i don't
 have any there's no moisture getting exactly it's so bone dry it's not going to be a thing
 but he was just telling us about a painted brick situation that they're dealing with
 on another home they spent four days trying to get the paint working to get the paint
 off so the brick can get worked on again so it's just a nightmare if you actually do paint
 your bricks incorrectly jason we knew about that that's what i'm saying yeah i have painted
 bricks but maybe maybe the dryness will save me in my house i think that's it and it's
 also it's also probably depends on the mixture of the brick and what kind of like these are
 like straight up bricky bricks are yours more like uh non-bricky bricks you know no no i'm
 fascinated where this question is about to go i am so curious number one las vegas masonry
 podcast let's roll i don't i just kind of believe there are different kinds of compositions
 of the masonry i am i am so curious what paul what knowledge of bricks paul is about to
 reveal are they and what level of brick knowledge he thinks that i have great are they grade
 a bricks are they grade b so i'm looking for to get some work done on my bricks now these
 are bricky bricks you'll know brickety bricks yeah these are brickety brick brick bricks
 uh these ones have the same intelligence as a u.s senator oh my well brickety brick uh
 everything about our our house is 1980 it the house looks like the ford tempo that we
 used to own if we still had that ford tempo it would it would even mean you could park
 the ford tempo we used to have right next to our house and it would disappear like camouflage
 you know how uh the the enterprise d has that beige and and uh would sure and oh yeah yeah
 no matt and i were just talking about that earlier the enterprise d with the beigeness
 with the different browns and tans extra dick the different browns and tans so it was a
 uh a ford tempo from 80 82 maybe it was a brown ford tempo uh from 82 uh i think brown
 ford yeah around 82 or 84 uh 84 go 84 needs to be a little bit newer than that then i
 love okay so we're for those of you listening we're building up the uh the pictures here
 uh of a brown ford tempo from oh yeah that's that's good and brown yeah it was just like
 your house it was two-tone though like it had the top of it was was light beige and
 the bottom was dark beige and then the seats were beige it was just the beige-iest fucking
 thing and our house is just beige you got a beige house the crazy thing about it too
 they just replaced the windows she's a beige house she's mighty bland boring as all get
 out she's a beige house no curb appeal at all just making you forget it exists uh yeah
 it is i mean for me personally i could give a shit what the exterior of the house looks
 like because i've made the interior look like at least my basement a vomit of color and
 craziness you know i mean it's it's it's nuts down here uh yeah yeah it's it's it's it's
 special i love it i love it down here it's crazy uh it makes me happy um and and it is
 very a very nondescript home like if you were looking for like a place to just hide forever
 this would be it but uh it's going to be this beautiful cottage blue and whites but they
 when they put the new windows in on the house the windows that they got had a green interior
 trim that was just part of the the build like the it's metal green and it just looks whackadoo
 so anyway we're getting everything fixed up and it's going to be really lovely and the
 fact that this company can fix them windows the fact that this company can fix the brick
 as well makes me really happy because like i said some of it's being held together with
 great stuff so there you go yeah well squirrels are being held out with with great stuff i
 yes yes great stuff single-handedly keeping squirrels out of the mattingly household it's
 keeping something out it's keeping some stuff out yeah uh latter-day scoop says my basement
 is the suburb equivalent of stabbing a person in the attic just to see color i i or the
 arctic just to see color oh yes okay yes then that makes more sense uh yeah kind of yeah
 i drive along i pull up to my every time i go up into my attic i go completely colorblind
 it's terrible i do pull up to my very nondescript uh drive and then i open the basement door
 and then i just hit with a flood of color and also in the chat canna clumsy knows what's
 up because that dog ain't no dog that's three squirrels in a dog costume it's a heist oh
 yeah it's a heist it's a heist it could be could be if only we could get in but there's
 so much great stuff i'm i'm seeing some some faces in the chat here that they're going
 to get thank you videos uh from my son uh uh but uh it's that time of year for my son
 makes adorable thank you videos if you donate to him this year the theme is uh if he wins
 his donation contest he gets a big annoying beach ball that'll be in the house to annoy
 his mother so he's putting out videos that says help me annoy my mom and you can donate
 to it and scoops party stepped up but uh but but but do do step up and uh and if you want
 i'll the link is on my instagram if you go to my noodler and click on my links it says
 donate to my kid's school but you can see the uh it's weirdly not on your wife's social
 media at all it's almost like she doesn't want it to happen so uh public schools still
 need a little extra funding believe it or not yeah no i don't i can't i can't imagine
 you kid me he is he is like 150 bucks out of the top 10 so oh uh he's he's close to
 getting some real real recognition there but that's fantastic good for him does he get
 a prize if he if he finishes in the top 10 i think he has extra like some some doodad
 bullshit sticker he gets to graduate eighth grade yeah look they'll they'll make him stand
 up at the graduation or something yeah oh spirit of the funding drive let's go spirit
 of the candy bars spirit of the candy bars man that i am the spirit of the candy bars
 spirit of the funding drive uh jacob bring our buddy jobeth in here for a minute here
 that's that's fine jobeth here yeah well you go ahead and talk i'll bring you up jobeth
 is uh gonna take his show to spain and so he's trying to uh crowdfund that effort and
 uh he was he reached out to me to say if you could talk about the show i said yes but i
 also wanted to come up with something for the scoops to put on his kickstarter and so
 aha oh great um he he uh he's going to announce what that what that is um when you find him
 jacob jesus jobeth start talking i can't find oh you need me to start talking so you can
 find me i'm sorry i thought matt just picked up on it and started running with it there
 it is i wanted both of you oh there you are i found you awesome so yeah i um producing
 i was like i can't find him in the fucking zoom thing i don't know from times being in
 the churn and otherwise uh past handful of years i have kind of shifted lanes a little
 bit into doing hypnosis shows instead of the normal mentalism that i was doing before and
 it's it's kind of really blown up and it's taking me all over the place so yeah i got
 an invitation to go and participate in this year's 2025 barcelona fringe festival in
 barcelona spain which is oh barcelona exciting and we're uh i'm dragging my wife along we're
 making a big adventure out of it so we're gonna end up hitting a couple different european
 countries on the way there um but i'm looking to really build exposure with this thing so
 the the purpose of the kickstarter they all look like they're there to raise money which
 is which is great and there's some fun perks and we'll talk about some of those that per
 matt's suggestion which i think is fantastic and i would love to do um some specific add-ons
 for the scoops really i'm trying to get this thing to hit so it you know it triggers the
 algorithm and i get more of a a global exposure for this thing because it's if anybody's ever
 performed at a fringe festival and i know that some of the scoops have and i think i
 mean matt you did the one in uh fallout fringe recently it's one of the best investments
 an artist can make it's just it's just it's just a license to print money it really is
 uh wait you had a decidedly different experience than than i did um almost every fringe festival
 in the language is like hey we will not let you make a profit like it's almost guaranteed
 it's almost guaranteed so like you can you can ask to break even at best there's usually
 language in the application that says that so before i decided to launch this kickstarter
 i talked to my wife into coming with me and i said exactly that in some version of that
 said there's the best that you can hope to do is break even we're going to make a vacation
 out of this that i happen to be doing a run of shows that way nobody's mad about the money
 yeah that's all but i want the exposure i want full rooms my shows are far more fun
 with a lot more people in the room and it's a really different type of show because usually
 hypnotists they do their thing bring people up get whoever they can into trance and then
 they've got this script of routines that they go through of the silly shit that they make
 people do i am doing a show where as audience members enter the theater they are prompted
 to put down ideas for stuff that they want to see in the show and i'm going to write
 the show basically on the fly there there's going to be some cheating involved with respect
 to the kickstarter so if you are interested in the kickstarter and i thought you meant
 you were going to fuck other people's spouses um just right there on stage if they wrote
 on the paper it's on the paper fuck my wife the kickstarter will give people a chance
 to suggest routines that i'll bring with me and drop into the bucket nice as potential
 things so ultimately again i want these full rooms the full rooms one of my real call to
 action here is less about funding the kickstarter more about because right now it's in pre-launch
 okay everything is at carnivalofdreams.com so that's the name of the show and again the
 audience i'll throw that in the zoom chat for people who are there if people can jump
 on and follow this thing because the the follows that you get in pre-launch are also part of
 triggering the algorithm and getting it exposure i'm trying to put as much of the full court
 press on this thing as i can thank you jacob um and but there is some cool stuff so for
 as little as five bucks people can join a private whatsapp group where i'm going to
 be giving updates throughout and everything up to getting swag from it suggesting routines
 everything's got a price so if you want it to be guaranteed that i use your routine in
 the show there is a level where you and i will hop on the zoom call before this thing
 and actually plan out and write a routine so you know what you're getting i video all
 the shows so there's one of the levels that you can get video of all of the shows from
 it and for the scoops since i'm going to be in europe and in three european cities there
 will be an add-on there that will make sense to almost nobody other than you all where
 i will yell salt pork in front of some sort of famous monument somewhere in either berlin
 paris or barcelona and you know you don't even have to put hey scoops at checkout you'll
 know exactly what it is it actually even says that you don't have to put hey scoops at checkout
 i don't even know if there's promo codes on get started i've backed so many damn projects
 whether they are magic related or other weird tech stuff and like the number of decks of
 playing cards that i have that sean farquhar has designed i could probably build a house
 with them but um yeah i'm sure you see that with the foam that paul used to keep the mice
 out of the basement right a little great stuff goes a long way otherwise three squirrels
 at a trench coat will steal it yes so i i thought it was really funny to have jobeth
 yelling uh salt pork out loud to different at different different monuments and stuff
 around europe oh wait are you going to yell the are you going to yell salt pork in front
 of the monuments or are you going to yell salt pork at the monuments as the monuments
 have done something to deserve being yelled at dealer's choice and if for anybody who's
 back to kickstarter before you know that once it funds once you get the submission and everything
 there'll be some back and forth and and you know i've been a member of this community
 since i brought matt to elkton to really kick off us having the elkton magic shows and i
 kind of backdoor obelisk myself because of wanting to kind of do some research for a
 second i thought you were going to tell a fun story about you and matt in the early
 days hey oh um i mean there's plenty of plenty of fun stories it was very similar wolfman's
 appearance on fools very similar so um you know the the the scopes i i don't know that
 i feel like i quote owe a lot to them but i i certainly owe a lot of enjoyment to everything
 that is here so the amount of levity that's going to exist in you sending me a message
 saying can you do specifically this consider it done um again the following job that came
 with an idea for abracadabra and maybe other people on here might like that one too okay
 same thing only you hold up a rubik's cube and you go you know there's one and 43 quadrillion
 combinations of things on a rubik's cube did you know that and then i'll pan to my wife
 and she can do rj sigh so for those listening it's my biggest pet peeve with every magician
 has dumb pet peeves and mine is that anytime anyone does a rubik's cube trick they say
 there are over 43 quadrillion combinations you can do with rubik's cube and i just think
 like that's true i agree but do you want me the audience member to think that you the
 magician knows 43 quadrillion combinations because that's obnoxious that's obnoxious
 if you want me to think you're that much of a math whiz but also yeah you know are going
 to find my eight of hearts later like it just seems like a really weird thing to add to
 a show you are the smartest person i've ever seen and you're doing rubik's cube magic exactly
 exactly this is perfect jobith i've got a question for you absolutely the shows in spain
 are they going to be done in english or are you learning them in spanish uh they are going
 to be done in english so that area in barcelona apparently has a a thriving english comedy
 scene okay which is which was what became the birth of this fringe festival there this
 is the second year that they've done it so i'm sure that i'm going to have some spanish
 speaking or bilingual or or folks who speak catalan because it's in that region um i i
 took five years of spanish in high school and i'm surprised i'm sure that'll help as
 i'm 60 couple days into a duolingo streak how much i both remember and forget from that
 time gracias perfect oh you're ready then i'm going to order a cerveza all that i want
 i will have no problem finding the library yep yeah la biblioteca muy bien you're you're
 so fast on that day nada you're ready you're ready to be there jobith anything else people
 need to look for what's that anything else people need to look for carnival of dreams
 uh carnival of dreams dot com over time that is going to evolve to just go to the kickstarter
 site and then when kickstarter's done it's going to be ticket links so if anybody's actually
 i don't know if you guys have scoops that are specifically in barcelona if you happen
 to be there uh if you're a scoop reach out i'll i'll comp your tickets uh because obviously
 we've already written off any profit from this thing and i love to have we've accepted
 that we're not going to make money we might as well lean into it let's get the butts
 in the seat exactly oh awesome i like it i like cool hey thank you for uh for giving me
 a little time and thank you for putting enough time between the the the recap of uh two characters
 in the clown r i r i p while you were going through all of that i'm sitting there i don't
 want to follow this i hope he doesn't put me on right after so well luckily everybody
 had forgotten about it until you brought it back oh now we're all sat i'm here to self
 sabotage myself anyway i can thanks buddy i'm following you on the kickstarter looks

 oh yeah that's out in theaters right?
 they were playing it at the south point here in las vegas
 so i wouldn't saw tim curry and martin mall do clue
 so i wouldn't saw tim curry and martin mall do clue
 flames, flames at the side of my face
 flames, flames at the side of my face
 madeline kahn
 when she enters the movie for the first time
 i started laughing instantly
 holy shit
 i love madeline kahn so much
 she's so good in that movie
 and they did the thing
 they did the thing like the original one
 where they didn't show all the endings
 oh they just showed one
 they picked one ending and showed that
 because that's how they did it when the movie first came out
 that's right
 to show all the different theaters had just one ending
 and then i think comedy central started
 i think they're the ones who did
 all the endings together
 when comedy central started re-airing the movie
 i think they did it on the
 vhs, the vhs release had all the endings
 oh is that what it is? yeah
 the vhs went and maybe it went like this
 and maybe it went like this
 oh so comedy central showed that part
 yes and i think
 that kind of inspired
 waynes world
 oh yeah that makes sense
 first waynes world had multiple endings
 but yeah it was so good
 matt what were you going to ask?
 i forget now
 oh cool
 i love watching those
 i'm no longer a good podcaster i quit
 but i have fishcakes
 oh nevermind i'm back in
 urinal fishcakes
 they gotta hold one podcast together
 urinal fishcakes
 yuck
 gross
 there was a group behind me
 who was just saying out loud
 every single punchline
 before it happened
 oh that's so annoying
 it didn't bother me that much
 because i knew all of them too
 so i was also
 oh yeah these are coming
 do you think this is an effect of
 it being a tim curry movie
 kind of just vibing on that
 rocky vibe
 yeah i think so i think they were just
 having a good time i wasn't mad at them
 but they were doing a lot i was also sitting
 next to a uh
 i don't know you know me i can't tell how
 old kids are but it was a little girl
 she seemed to be like i don't know 12
 maybe 12 13 something like that
 and uh it is
 really great sitting next to
 someone at a movie that you
 love and as
 you're watching it you realize how
 formative it was to you especially
 to uh to your comedy
 oh yeah as you're as you're watching it
 and you're sitting next to
 a preteen little girl
 who is
 so unimpressed with everything
 the screen might
 as well be blank
 it was so
 great it was it made my
 night like this kid doesn't give
 a shit about this at all just hated
 it just hated it
 really it was like just sitting
 there you could tell every reference to it
 because there are it's a it's a more
 dated movie than you think it is there are
 a few sure references in there that
 you're like i if you don't if you don't
 know what it's like uh
 hoover
 is on the phone at one point jager
 hoover is on is on the phone at one point
 and somebody makes the the comment
 uh tim curry makes the comedies like he's
 on everybody else's phone why shouldn't he be on mine
 right right right right
 that's a funny jager hoover
 running the fbi joke right
 that is not applicable in twenty
 twenty-five and uh uh
 now how old is this individual
 oh the the kid was like twelve
 or thirteen oh okay so yeah no no
 no no no she was just i was like
 why did your parents bring you to this
 you clearly hate all of this
 well and it's also just a factor
 of movies were a little bit
 more slow paced
 back in the lower yeah so
 you know that's hard to
 it's hard to shift that brain especially at
 thirteen my god i get it yeah
 i get it
 you forget that the whole mr
 body's a real acting flex you
 totally forget there's a big build up before
 before the murder happens
 and mr body has
 to be like i'm the greatest actor in
 the world i'm the biggest
 he has to come in
 it's like the only actor in the movie you
 don't know who it is yeah
 exactly and he has to come in and just
 try his damnedest to take
 it over while tim curry is on the
 other side of the room just being
 tim curry exactly
 exactly so yeah you just feel
 terrible for this guy i watched it again
 that's it i was like i watched it again
 like uh like four years ago or something i was like oh
 i forgot this guy really tries to
 throw a flamethrower it just really
 isn't happening
 it really comes across as a big
 failure
 yeah it's just poor guy
 he's just trying
 uh yeah when i was younger
 i did not appreciate i did not
 comedically understand how subtle and awesome
 martin mull was being so we were watching it as an adult
 he's so funny
 it's like it's so subtle and he's such a
 groveler like it's so great
 his looks are great uh
 he keeps on like
 touching mrs scarlet
 in just vaguely inappropriate
 ways and she just keeps on
 being annoyed by it and shooting
 him looks or hitting him or something
 and nobody ever acknowledges it
 no i was just a little too young
 when they started doing the fernwood tonight
 reruns on uh yeah
 yeah just it went over my head
 i was still just wasn't there but i'm sure
 now i'd appreciate it a lot more yeah i missed
 fernwood as well yeah
 oh yeah oh yeah we did it
 guys all right we're just gonna sit around now
 and and think about nice things that we
 enjoyed from our childhood think about those
 movies we watched let's just think about old movies
 for a minute guys just quietly remember
 there were movies oh man
 what was your favorite movie when you were 14
 years old 14 years old 14 years old
 14 years old
 fern gullywood
 that's the one where they had to shoot the dog at the end
 oh my god
 well they didn't have to shoot the
 dog they got to shoot the dog
 they got to do it they got to shoot
 the dog spoilers
 sorry latter day scoop spoilers
 let's do some scoop mail
 message for you son
 we got a scoop mail today from house dad
 after watching reya and
 the last dragon what is reya
 or is that one thing
 reya and the last dragon
 one thing yeah okay
 so after watching reya and the last dragon i asked my
 daughter is what animal they would like to put a saddle
 on and ride around i told them that
 i would put a saddle on a hippo because
 they are spectacular plus the land
 and water speed and maneuverability
 really checks all the boxes if you
 ask me the three year old chose
 a cow which is incredibly on brand
 for her personality wise the two
 year old went giraffe
 which is very koala like of her
 and a solid choice please allow
 me to ask you that same multi million dollar
 question besides my mom
 what would you like to saddle and ride
 around lovingly that's
 the house dad so
 other than house dad's mom what would
 you like to throw a saddle on and give a little ride to
 let's make it exciting all the choices are only
 people in this chat
 okay okay
 so we have jobeth we have
 i
 would like to do a giant
 bumblebee giant
 bumblebee oh oh so we're not
 even in real animals and we're already out of real
 animals i'm already out of real animals
 i'm going to giant bumblebee because i don't
 want to hurt a real animal i
 want to go with a giant bumblebee
 because also i want to fly around it'd be like a
 sektar yeah
 a gazoon type yeah yeah
 oh you guys you guys all remember sektars
 right of course you do
 that short lived uh toy line
 sektars do you not remember sektars
 jacob no matt do you remember
 sektars i don't
 so sektars how many times can
 paul say the word sektars
 sektars is a toy line i know what it is
 before he decides that we don't it was
 a little expensive the figures were
 a little closer to seven inches they were
 pretty tall and they would ride on
 the backs of giant bugs
 and the bugs were the big feature
 of the toy line so the bugs
 had these big wings that you could manipulate but the
 cool thing was they were
 puppets you put your hand
 into the bug and
 your hand became the bugs
 legs
 oh yeah i do remember that
 of course you do because sektars were fucking
 cool and so you would fly
 you would fly them around and they'd be riding on your back
 and they had a huge playset
 their playset was
 ginormous the sektar
 it looked like just a
 chasm wall
 it was really cool but yeah
 sektars
 would fly around and they're redoing
 sektars now
 all right say sektar again
 sektar
 i think i want to ride a giant
 train like a mechanical ball
 like wheel the giant train
 what you heard me
 oh you want to wheel
 a giant train
 and catch a ride at
 choo-choo come on ride the train
 and ride at choo-choo
 that's what i want to do
 all right then
 i guess i won't stop you
 that was bad
 in the chat with the
 say sektar one more time over
 that was really fast
 say sektar again
 sektar don't sound like any toy line i ever heard of
 you know what they call a quarter pound of sektars
 in france
 what? nerdy
 they call them
 le bugs and warriors
 le bugs de fingerlegs
 le bugs de fingerlegs
 that's what sektar translates into
 i just found out in the chat you can ride inside a train
 that was really
 what a waste of time
 so silly
 shit man
 i don't know i think hippo
 hippo is a good idea hippo is a
 solid rideable animal
 it's tough to ride
 get your legs all spread way out
 well you can do some kind of saddle
 situations kind of seat situation
 maybe a nice side
 hippo saddle
 paul is holding his phone up to the camera now
 to show off
 what i assume is his amateur porn video
 i'm just letting people
 again this is the benefit
 of joining up on the patreon
 and coming into our feed
 you get to see extra content like this
 sektar see they're finger fighting
 as sad as
 this statement makes me paul's video
 has made me oh paul your package has arrived
 i like seeing paul's notifications
 my notifications coming up
 this is pretty great
 also paul's video has made me realize
 i do know what he's talking about
 of course you remember everybody remembers sektars
 i'm sad that paul's video did
 something useful they were expensive
 back in the day they weren't
 i never had any that's what i'm saying
 they weren't a cheap a cheap figure
 they were very expensive
 sektars
 i have no idea what i was saying
 before that oh animal
 winter scoop put a cool picture there in the
 in the chat as well
 oh wow in the in the chat here

 it's been a long have you guys ever
 been to horse i have it's been forever
 when i was a kid yeah
 yeah when i was a kid i wouldn't do it now
 do you think you could still ride a horse i have more
 respect for a horse than to put my 300 pound
 butt oh no no not that but like
 if you were on a horse though
 do you do you believe that you could still
 command a horse and ride a horse well
 enough yeah i think i could i think i could do
 okay it would depend on the horse
 of course of course of course
 you really legit
 of course
 he legit of course that
 legit of course it depends
 on the horse of course of course
 uh i don't know but yeah i think i
 could i think i could um
 i would love to ride
 a clidesdale
 oh those are uh
 i believe just impossible to
 ride i guess yeah they're probably so
 big you'd have to be so bow legged
 yeah they're just so massive
 oh my god winter scoop saying
 mr hands
 that is the horse that rides
 you winter scoop
 actually for my birthday this year we're gonna get
 we're gonna get a pony ride so i'm gonna ride a pony
 on my birthday oh good
 good nice do you
 do you guys know the horrible story behind
 mr hands
 what's mr hands mr hands
 is the horse that was involved in
 one of those early freaky
 online videos that
 apparently
 was uh a cult
 of horse fucking people
 and the
 mr hands was fucking
 guys right they were getting
 fucked by this horse you know the horse
 didn't want to do it or whatever but
 uh what i know
 but
 you were well
 aware of the whole bean situation and all
 that kind of thing and
 you know horse
 business is a bit bigger than human
 business and the story
 was the story was that mr
 hands got this guy
 but ruptured
 his intestines
 and he's died over time
 from being fucked by a horse
 um i have
 i have found it i found
 the wikipedia page on it
 this is
 upsetting it's dark it's a real
 dark thing and it's one of those it's one of those
 very early internet things i gotta
 tell you for really remember
 for a masonry podcast do not screen share
 i'm not screen sharing i'm not screen sharing
 no
 it has taken a turn well
 uh of course of course
 you gotta fuck the right horse
 of course
 or don't how about don't fuck horses how about
 that oh i've been watching
 uh i've been watching hard knocks on hbo
 the uh the the season
 the season camp for the buffalo bills yeah
 and one of the linebackers
 i think either a linebacker or a defensive
 lineman uh he's really into horses
 and he has horses he rides
 horses and so they take the cameras out
 watching a huge professional athlete
 on the back of an equally
 huge because he has like very
 large horses to accommodate
 his very large frame right
 and uh it is
 so funny because
 he's just an enormous man on the back
 of a horse and no matter how big that horse
 gets it still doesn't look right
 it looks like
 looks like you riding a kitten
 yeah yeah it looks like it's it looks
 weird that his feet aren't touching the ground
 because it looks like they just
 almost should give it a
 flintstone that shit just yeah
 side he just give it a little kick
 to help out the horse a little bit
 no big deal he can
 he hey flintstones the horse
 he's just running with the horse
 hunter
 his legs touch the ground

 england's shortest adult
 monarch was charles the first who was
 estimated to be five foot four at the start
 of his reign approximately
 how tall was he by the end of his reign
 i'd say approximately
 five foot four
 probably lost his head right
 is that what they're doing they're taking into
 consideration he's like six inches
 shorter because he got his head cut off or something
 oh yeah so yeah i'll say he's
 approximately one head shorter
 approximately four uh four eight because
 his head was chopped off any answer
 gets credit yeah great just like what happened
 with muggsy bogues
 just like what happened
 he would have been a much taller basketball player
 yeah if he had kept
 his head if he had kept his head
 paul uh before they wrestled
 for 400 please
 prior to becoming a wrestling star
 he played bass for the band ruckus
 presumably before
 sj joined
 oh
 i think this is
 hulk all right
 hulk hogan

 was in metallica it's like

 three ounces of dry gin
 one ounce vodka one half ounce of
 lily blanc
 stir with ice and strain into a chilled cocktail
 glass with a lemon zest for garnish
 i think this is a vesper
 a vesper
 you're absolutely right
 it's a vesper

 uh cocktails for 600
 two ounces of gin
 one half ounce of
 maraschino liqueur
 one quarter ounce of cream
 de violet
 three quarter ounce of lemon juice shake with ice and strain
 into a cocktail glass garnish with a brandy
 cherry or a flamed
 lemon peel
 hmm
 uh huh
 i don't
 really drink much with the violet
 in it is that the
 the old rosy tit flip is that what that one is
 that's what it is the rosy
 tit flip it's one of the few answers
 both in breast sling and in cocktails
 that's true that's true
 rosy tit flip is a move and
 a delicious drink
 i'm passing paul
 i'm not gonna guess rosy tit flip i don't know
 pass coward
 i don't know this one
 oh it was the rosy tit flip
 oh i'm so close
 the aviation

 been a howard hughes beverage
 yep
 uh paul

 shaw of iran

 matt
 uh cocktails 400
 daily double
 now it's the
 daily double of the day
 still for 400
 two ounces of bourbon
 three ounces of lemon juice
 one half ounce simple syrup
 one egg white shaken with ice
 and strained into a rocks glass or
 coupe
 interesting is this a proper
 this is
 i used to make this drink all the time
 it's in
 my old old cocktail book
 that i have on my bar and i don't remember
 the name of it
 it's not like the first recipe of an original like old fashioned
 i don't think so
 because the egg white in there
 throws that off
 uh
 what is a kentucky omelette
 show me kentucky
 omelette
 a whiskey sour
 whiskey sour
 that's not what i was thinking of at all
 i'm dumb
 but the egg white
 i don't get the egg white in there
 the original recipe is called for egg white
 because it gave like a froth on the top
 when you shook it in the cocktail shaker
 that's true
 i'll close out cocktails for 200
 oh shit it's the other daily double
 holy rosy nipple flips
 now it's for 1200
 one cube
 of sugar muddled with
 i never know how to say that word bitters
 angostura
 angostura i think you got it
 bitters and a tablespoon of water
 add two ounces of bourbon or rye
 stir with ice strain into a rocks glass
 garnish with an orange twist
 your mom
 it's called chimera bitters
 that's it
 but go on
 that's the old fashioned
 yeah there it is

 i will do second biggest facts
 for 600
 second largest country
 in the world by area
 causing all kinds of hysteria
 this is the worst
 beastie boys song ever
 land maps
 let's do it
 i don't know
 there's a move
 a group right now trying to advocate
 for more accurate maps
 because africa the way we show on maps
 is basically too small
 so they're trying to like
 create a different map so that we show how large africa is
 yes
 that's been a movement
 for a while
 i think it's worth dedicating your life to
 i don't know
 pass
 oh that passes to me
 yeah i mean it's gotta be
 second largest country
 by area
 oh i've got points i can play around a little bit
 so russia's real big
 china's real big
 this isn't gonna be one of those where like
 because the maps are drawn
 drawn wrong
 it's like greenland or something
 no i don't know
 so russia or china
 i would think so one of those
 it's gotta be
 i think russia is
 smaller than china's i'll say russia
 canada
 blame canada
 i will
 canada is number two
 russia is number one with 6.6 million
 oh miles
 square miles i guess
 yeah great canada
 that's me i'll try second biggest
 fact for 400

 think i think those are

 nile
