1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social?

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,640
 Yeah, I'd love to!

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,440
 Great! Let's go!

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,440
 Oh man, it is Scoopfest here in Las Vegas!

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,440
 Woooo!

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,440
 Let me hear you, Scoops!

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,440
 Of course we'd have a great night here with us.

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,440
 Ohhhh!

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,440
 It's time for Matt Madley's Ice Cream Social!

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,440
 Sitting to my left is Paul Mattingly!

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,440
 Left cross for me, that's Mr. Matt Donnelly!

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,440
 On the knobs and tiles is Jacob the Audio Guy!

13
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,440
 Oh I love that guy!

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,440
 We're preaching fun!

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,440
 Wooo!

16
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,440
 How we doing, Scoopfest?

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,440
 We've had a long Scoopfest.

18
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,440
 Yeah, it's been a good one.

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,440
 It's been a real good one.

20
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,440
 You guys having a good Scoopfest so far?

21
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,440
 Oh thank God, I'm glad it's not just me.

22
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,440
 Yeah, it's been a blast.

23
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,440
 It's been such a cool deal.

24
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:04,440
 Of course, we've just always got to cap it off as our last kind of live event before we do the big jock versus nerd ball.

25
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,440
 That's right!

26
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,440
 So, got to bring back our boys.

27
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,440
 Our brothers from another podcast.

28
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,440
 The OO boys!

29
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,440
 The OO boys, if you will.

30
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,440
 Gentlemen, thanks for being here.

31
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,440
 Oh man, it's the best.

32
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:24,440
 It does not get better than hanging out at the Orleans at Scoopfest.

33
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,440
 Is it just us?

34
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,440
 I mean, just Las Vegas is the Orleans to me?

35
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,440
 Everyone else is trying too hard, the Orleans?

36
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,440
 Oh, in terms of like, if you really try to boil down Las Vegas.

37
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:44,440
 I feel like every other building in this town is trying to be something they're not, except for the one that we're sitting in right now.

38
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,440
 It's the most honest building in Las Vegas.

39
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,440
 Yeah, right down to the three alligators playing jazz.

40
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,440
 The iconography of authenticity, anthropomorphized alligators.

41
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,440
 And also, just the sheer size.

42
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,440
 When you walk in the Orleans, they're like 20 foot alligators.

43
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,440
 Who turned in the drawings, they're like, "That's how much space you should take up when you walk into this place."

44
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,440
 Yeah.

45
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,440
 So, a long running joke that Brian and I have had whenever we've been at the Orleans is that nobody knows when the Bailey Wick is open.

46
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,440
 Yes, always true.

47
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,440
 And they've posted hours.

48
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:25,440
 I've never seen, as far as I knew, it opened when somebody phased into existence inside of it.

49
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,440
 There's no rhyme or reason.

50
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,440
 You have properly summoned Bailey Wick.

51
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,440
 Want a beer?

52
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,440
 And they're even more fucked up.

53
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,440
 It's only open from like 3 p.m. to 10.

54
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,440
 In Las Vegas, at 10.

55
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,440
 No, your premium bar.

56
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,440
 Fuck you, get out.

57
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,440
 It's like, "Oh, the place for live music and food and booze?"

58
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,440
 Nope, after 10 o'clock, you are not allowed in here.

59
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,440
 Just psychotic, just sociopathic behavior by the Bailey Wick.

60
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,440
 Somebody do a Netflix series on the Bailey Wick.

61
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,440
 Find out what skeletons are in that attic.

62
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,440
 Bailey Wick Doc Series, TM, that is ours.

63
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,440
 So, Brian, you have kept up your bit of asshole blackjack?

64
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,440
 Oh, Jesus.

65
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,440
 Now I know why he's homeless.

66
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,440
 Alright.

67
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,440
 Now I am homeless.

68
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:34,440
 Okay, first of all, I was gambling with somebody who didn't like the idea of asshole blackjack.

69
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,440
 Because he's somebody who feels like, "Hey man, gambling is supposed to be fun."

70
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,440
 And you're like actively...

71
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,440
 Does anybody not know? I don't know why I'm phrasing it this way.

72
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,440
 We don't know it. What's asshole blackjack?

73
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,440
 How do you explain asshole blackjack?

74
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,440
 So, blackjack, game where cards come out.

75
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,440
 People at tables get very mad if you are not playing correctly.

76
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,440
 Quote, unquote, "by the book."

77
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:05,440
 By the book, because they believe that the cards that you got by playing incorrectly or didn't get by playing incorrectly is affecting them.

78
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:12,440
 And they want everyone, no matter who's sitting at the table, they want the table to play as a team as a whole against the dealer, not against each other.

79
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,440
 That's how it's supposed to go, right?

80
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,440
 So, what Brian does is the opposite.

81
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:26,440
 Yes. Well, every so often, I'll play something a little bit off book or do something silly just because it's delightful when doing something wrong yields amazing results.

82
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,440
 And then I hear to my left, "That was my ace," or whatever.

83
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,440
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

84
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:39,440
 It's like, okay, well then now we're no longer playing blackjack, we're playing asshole blackjack, which usually lasts about five minutes, and then the game is over and all my money is gone.

85
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:50,440
 Right? Every so often, an epic run ends up happening, and Justin and I laugh and shout and make a lot of noise, chase everyone off, and then as we leave the table they say, "Excuse me, you dropped your Percocet."

86
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,440
 Yes.

87
00:04:52,440 --> 00:05:04,440
 A true thing that happened, one of the first times we played asshole blackjack is we just infuriated a family from Alabama that were just like spitting fucking mad, and we could not stop laughing.

88
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:10,440
 And then at the end, my Percocets fell out of my pocket.

89
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:20,440
 Now, just collapsing this fucking caricature of a human into startling relief, "Oh, this just got real."

90
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:29,440
 Now, as I was trying to explain the beauty of asshole blackjack is a piece of performance art, and I like to think of myself as a patron of the arts by spending all my money on asshole blackjack.

91
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,440
 Good, good.

92
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,440
 Jesse, our friend, had the mistaken impression that the point was to piss people off.

93
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,440
 No, that is a side effect.

94
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,440
 Ah, yes. That is righteous and good, but it is not the point.

95
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:51,440
 That's right. The point is to bend reality just a little bit, and maybe, just maybe, you'll get lucky, and doing the wrong thing will yield something magical, right?

96
00:05:51,440 --> 00:06:03,440
 So, Jesse and I were playing blackjack, and eventually got down to just the two of us. Jesse did not believe in asshole blackjack. He didn't believe it would work, and he didn't much care for the idea of it.

97
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:12,440
 And then I got dealt a five, and the dealer had a three face-up, and then I got dealt another five, and then a face-down card, right?

98
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,440
 So we all know what you're supposed to do in this situation, right?

99
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,440
 Split.

100
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:22,440
 Okay, so I take my chip, and I push it forward, and they say, "Double?" I said, "Uh-uh."

101
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,440
 The move is, the rules say you are supposed to double there.

102
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:33,440
 That's right. But in this case, I split my fingers, and I said, "No, split." And they're like, "Are you sure?"

103
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,440
 Do I look like a man who is sure?

104
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:45,440
 Pit Boss kind of glances over. First card, an ace, and then push that second chip forward.

105
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,440
 To double down.

106
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,440
 To double down on a soft 16.

107
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,440
 All right.

108
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,440
 Next one, five. Three goes down. It's an eight.

109
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,440
 Yeah.

110
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,440
 Chip goes forward.

111
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,440
 Let's go.

112
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,440
 Keep it going.

113
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,440
 Oh, wait. I'm sorry. I left out the most important part.

114
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,440
 When I split them fives, the first card that was dealt was a five, at which point that got split.

115
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,440
 So there are three fives. I forgot that part of the story.

116
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,440
 And it was upon the third five that another five was dealt.

117
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,440
 Chip goes forward.

118
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,440
 Four fives. Four fives on the table.

119
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,440
 Another card. It's like some bullshit in the teens.

120
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,440
 Finally, last one. I think it was another eight, and I doubled down on it again.

121
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:42,440
 At which point, it ended up they threw down a bunch of cards, and then they said the word's 21.

122
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,440
 I was like, "Well, dang it. That would have been a neat story."

123
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,440
 But then there was like a weird vibe, and then she smiled and was like, "Eh?"

124
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,440
 I'm like, "I don't get it. You took all the money."

125
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,440
 And they were like, "No, it's 21. It's 22. We busted. You won."

126
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,440
 And then they gave me a $500 chip.

127
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,440
 Hey!

128
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,440
 Believe in magic, people.

129
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,440
 Yeah.

130
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,440
 Assholes win.

131
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,440
 Exactly. Show your hole.

132
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,440
 On the tables.

133
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,440
 At the Orleans.

134
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,440
 The home of asshole blackjack.

135
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,440
 Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

136
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,440
 Spread 'em.

137
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
 Justin?

138
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
 Yeah.

139
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,440
 You're running the Politics, Politics, Politics podcast.

140
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:32,440
 Yes. Yes. Quiet, quiet, couple weeks.

141
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,440
 Nothing to see.

142
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,440
 Just real tumbleweeds, you know, bunch of action.

143
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,440
 As a podcast, you consider it like a great time to be a political podcaster?

144
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,440
 How does it feel when things are so divulgent?

145
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,440
 It feels great that I don't have to think about what I'm going to talk about.

146
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:59,440
 Because you have to do it at a certain point beyond all of the subject matter is obviously as emotionally charged as you can make it.

147
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,440
 But I have to kind of make the donuts every day.

148
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,440
 Right.

149
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,440
 It's a lot easier when it's like, "Okay, well, here's what we're talking about.

150
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,440
 Now we're going to have somebody on and we're going to talk about the very obvious thing that everybody wants to hear about."

151
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,440
 But yeah, no, it's fucking insane. It's crazy.

152
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,440
 Do you ever wake up and be like, "I just want to do a football podcast."

153
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,440
 I often fantasize about doing another podcast.

154
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,440
 And then I realize that that's what's gotten me into this mess.

155
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,440
 Doing too many fucking podcasts.

156
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,440
 But usually, yeah, it's usually like that.

157
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,440
 It's like, "Oh my God, I would love to just have shitty hot takes on sports."

158
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,440
 But then I'm like, "Yeah, but then I would have to actually think about them and I wouldn't want them to be embarrassing."

159
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,440
 Right.

160
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
 I don't know.

161
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
 Yeah.

162
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,440
 But also, yeah, I don't know.

163
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,440
 Most sports podcasts are bad.

164
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,440
 That's the sound of you ask too real a question.

165
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,440
 Yeah.

166
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,440
 You poked them right in the id.

167
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,440
 Sorry.

168
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
 Sorry.

169
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,440
 Apologize.

170
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,440
 Give me a sports hot take right now.

171
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,440
 No, no, no, no.

172
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,440
 I will be up at 630 in the morning.

173
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,440
 Hopefully, I'll go to McMillan's across the way.

174
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,440
 What is this thing?

175
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,440
 What is happening?

176
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,440
 Well, the Steelers are playing the Minnesota Vikings in Ireland.

177
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
 Right.

178
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
 In Ireland.

179
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,440
 In Ireland.

180
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,440
 Yeah.

181
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,440
 So I'll be over there.

182
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
 Several of you just asked why.

183
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
 Why?

184
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,440
 Who knows?

185
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,440
 No one knows.

186
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,440
 If you want to improve relationships with Ireland, you send Aaron Rodgers.

187
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,440
 Yes.

188
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
 That's right.

189
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
 You send...

190
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,440
 Our best and brightest, Carson Wentz and Aaron Rodgers.

191
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,440
 We send our cave-dwelling ayahuasca-drinking weirdo conspiracy theorist to Ireland.

192
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:47,440
 Look, if the red zone offense stays in the 80%, then I will also take ivermectin.

193
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,440
 Seems like a needless wager on your part, but okay.

194
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,440
 Yeah.

195
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
 That's fine.

196
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,440
 I mean, I don't know how it happens, but we're scoring a lot inside the twin.

197
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,440
 Mattingly.

198
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,440
 Yes.

199
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,440
 You woke up super...

200
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
 Not super.

201
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,440
 You woke up early.

202
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,440
 You took scoops on an outing.

203
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,440
 Some scoops on an outing.

204
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,440
 I did.

205
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,440
 We had a little nerd out.

206
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,440
 Went out to Alternate Reality Comics out here in Las Vegas.

207
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,440
 Yes.

208
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
 Big shout out to Alternate Reality.

209
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,440
 It's my boy Ralph.

210
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,440
 Ralph has been holding it down for damn near 30 years out here.

211
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,440
 It's the best little comic shop in Vegas.

212
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
 I just love it.

213
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
 Love it.

214
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,440
 And yeah, some scoops were kind enough to join me in the morning.

215
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,440
 It was Vegas early, but we went out there and had a great time.

216
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,440
 I really...

217
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,440
 It was awesome because I've just gotten really back into comics in the last year and a half

218
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,080
 or so, so I was able to give heartfelt, earnest recommendations on what is on the shelves

219
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,080
 right now.

220
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,320
 So that was kind of fun.

221
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,520
 And people bought books I recommended, which was great.

222
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,520
 That was really cool.

223
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,520
 And then we went...

224
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
 A lot of tits.

225
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
 A lot of boobies.

226
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,520
 A lot of circles.

227
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,520
 More circles.

228
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
 Circles.

229
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
 They're just circles and squirrels.

230
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,520
 You don't know.

231
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,520
 You mean like in the comic shop or in the comics?

232
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,520
 In the comics.

233
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
 So this is the thing.

234
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
 Paul handed my son a comic with tits in it.

235
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
 Nice.

236
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
 When he took...

237
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,520
 But your son is 28 years old, right?

238
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,520
 Yeah.

239
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

240
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,520
 It was a bargain bin.

241
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,520
 Wait.

242
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,520
 He said tits only to Paul.

243
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,520
 So that was...

244
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,520
 I found a...

245
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,520
 Give me that book with them titties.

246
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,760
 An old 50 Cent issue of Powers, and it's one of my favorite series ever, and I was like,

247
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,760
 "Here you go."

248
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,360
 And Michael Avon Owings' artwork is very stylistic.

249
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,360
 Sure.

250
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,840
 And it's really just circles and circles when you're looking at the boob, but whatever.

251
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,080
 Paul's staying at my house this time around, though.

252
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,680
 He actually says that in real life to his wife as well.

253
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,000
 It's just circles and circles, baby.

254
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Yeah.

255
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 They're just circles and circles up there, baby.

256
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Thank you.

257
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 My boobies don't look like that.

258
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Circles and circles is my favorite.

259
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Yeah.

260
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Yeah.

261
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Boobs is a flat circle.

262
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,360
 No, that was awesome.

263
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,640
 And then right next door to the comic shop is a new card shop, which is under new management.

264
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,640
 I had never been.

265
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,640
 Card?

266
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
 Card.

267
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,920
 Collectible cards, Pokemon, Magic, all that kind of shit.

268
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,200
 It was incredible.

269
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,840
 Well, really well kept, nice, run well.

270
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,800
 Are there sports cards in these types of shops, too?

271
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
 No, sir.

272
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
 No, no.

273
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,800
 So this is all just like Magic cards?

274
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,240
 This is all Magic the Gathering and Pokemon.

275
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,280
 And maybe a little dash of Lor-Kana.

276
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,280
 Don't know what that is.

277
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
 Disney trading card game.

278
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,280
 Good.

279
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
 Yeah.

280
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,280
 So yeah.

281
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,760
 And they really were holding it down.

282
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,280
 They run tournaments there, so clearly they had their stuff on.

283
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,280
 It was just clean.

284
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,280
 Shop was clean.

285
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,280
 Prices were right.

286
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,280
 Oh, nice.

287
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,280
 Which is a huge thing.

288
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,280
 I don't know.

289
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,280
 You guys keep up.

290
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,280
 I mean, some dirty Magic the Gathering shops, right?

291
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,280
 Oh, god.

292
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,280
 Filth Fest.

293
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,280
 No, seriously.

294
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,280
 No.

295
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,280
 Do we have any Magic fans out here?

296
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
 Any Magic players?

297
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,280
 You know what?

298
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,280
 That was a no.

299
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,400
 I gave up Magic the Gathering in 1993, and I gave away my Black Lotus.

300
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,400
 Damn.

301
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,600
 Before you did that, Mr. Brian Brushwood.

302
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
 Oh, shit.

303
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
 That's valuable.

304
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,600
 What does that mean?

305
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
 That is an extremely valuable card.

306
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,600
 Okay.

307
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,120
 Before you did that, Mr. Brian Brushwood, would you say that the average conglomerate

308
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:58,000
 of Magic the Gathering players have the highest standards of hygiene about them?

309
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,640
 There are signs on many Magic the Gathering convention doors that say, "Wash your ass

310
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,160
 before you come in here."

311
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,600
 Like, seriously, there are rules in tournaments that are like, "Stinkies go home."

312
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,680
 It's a problem.

313
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,040
 I'm almost certain that for a while there was a Twitter account that was nothing but

314
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
 asscracks at Magic.

315
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,040
 Oh, yeah.

316
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,040
 There was a Twitter account.

317
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:24,280
 No, there was a dude who would always take pictures with his hands in prayer emoji form

318
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,000
 like by just heinous asscracks at Magic.

319
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 If you can look it up.

320
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Yeah, that's right.

321
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 I forgot.

322
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 That's right.

323
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,560
 He did his little meme of praying to the asscracks, and many were strewn with stuff.

324
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,560
 Just bad.

325
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,560
 It was a fucking ...

326
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,560
 Look it up.

327
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,560
 Strewn with stuff?

328
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,560
 I'm telling you.

329
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,560
 I will not look it up.

330
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,080
 By the way, and here's how fucked that community is, they yelled at the guy.

331
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,660
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

332
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:56,440
 They banned the guy from coming to Magic tournaments when it's like he is a Pulitzer Prize winning

333
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:01,320
 journalist who has just broken loose a horrifying scandal.

334
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,920
 You should be thanking him.

335
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,120
 He should be the commissioner.

336
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,800
 You leave our dirty butts be.

337
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,480
 Exactly, but no, big ass told him to fucking pass out.

338
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,480
 That's right.

339
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,000
 All that to say, when you find a really clean Magic the Gathering shop, you're like, "Holy

340
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 shit.

341
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 I might be able to breathe in here."

342
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Yeah.

343
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,600
 So, it was really well kept and really nice.

344
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,360
 And then of course, just down the way from there ...

345
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,200
 Much easier to tap two mana than to wipe twice.

346
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,200
 Good Lord.

347
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,800
 It's a fucking fact, man.

348
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,760
 Their asses are their graveyards.

349
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,760
 It's just ...

350
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,760
 What is with ...

351
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,760
 What is that expression?

352
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,760
 Bones are their money.

353
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,000
 Yeah, because this is the thing with pro wrestling, too, where especially for big shows, you'll

354
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,680
 have these things on the reddits that are like, "Guys, just shower for the love of God.

355
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,320
 Why are you going to show up and just stink out everybody?"

356
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,120
 Now, like WrestleMania here in Vegas, the cheapest seat that you can get is $800.

357
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,200
 And imagine that you're standing next to somebody who's a fucking biohazard and just stinks

358
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,320
 to high heaven the entire time.

359
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
 That's going to be bad.

360
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,080
 Paul was just telling me about this the other day, about the WrestleMania thing here, just

361
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,720
 being so fucking expensive.

362
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,720
 Oh, yeah.

363
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,720
 Yeah.

364
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,160
 Luckily, I have just purchased a black Lotus card.

365
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,160
 Oh, really?

366
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,160
 What deal did you get?

367
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,880
 I got it for $400,000.

368
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,880
 There you go.

369
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
 Yeah.

370
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,880
 I'm just going to use that.

371
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,880
 Is it really worth $400,000?

372
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,880
 According to this, it is.

373
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
 Yeah.

374
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,880
 Look, when you need three mana ...

375
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,600
 It depends on the addition.

376
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,320
 It depends on the condition.

377
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,680
 In the early days, they didn't have the play balancing quite right.

378
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,040
 In tournaments where you're playing for keepsies, then all of a sudden, it became profitable

379
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,040
 and made sense.

380
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,000
 The value went up, and then the legend grew long and all that stuff.

381
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,980
 But I quit because I was finally making friends in college, and that was ruining my friendship.

382
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,400
 So away it went.

383
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,880
 That was exactly a conversation that was had at the Magic Place, because he was talking

384
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,720
 about he plays commander, and he's got a couple of different decks.

385
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,960
 He has to decide on the day, do I want to keep my friends, or do I want to play a fun

386
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,960
 game of Magic?

387
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,960
 Yeah.

388
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,280
 Well, because if you're playing mathematically, then some pretty unfun, brutal strategies

389
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,280
 start to make sense.

390
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,280
 Exactly.

391
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,920
 There are mechanics that you can lose forever friends from, just by taking all this shit.

392
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,480
 You could play a high-risk thing, and so it's not fun for the other player.

393
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:28,080
 There was a land killer deck that I played where it's just like, you need land for energy.

394
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:33,000
 So imagine if you never got to take a single step forward in the contest, and then meanwhile,

395
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,160
 the moment you put down one land, like, "Fuck you, fire, dead, you're not doing anything."

396
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,520
 How did you acquire the Black Lotus card?

397
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,680
 This is so early, nobody had even heard of the game.

398
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:52,740
 There were what they called black-bordered alphas, and so we would congregate.

399
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,680
 I heard they make the rockin' world go round.

400
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,000
 They did, yeah.

401
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 We would wait for them to show up with a Tuesday mail, and then we would just like, vultures

402
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 just have everything.

403
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Okay.

404
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 So it's like an unboxing.

405
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Yeah, yeah.

406
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 You just found one in a pack.

407
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Yeah.

408
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Yeah.

409
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,480
 That's the one, that's that black rim.

410
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
 Oh, there it goes.

411
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,080
 Did you ever play it?

412
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,080
 Oh, sure.

413
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,760
 It was just a card to me, and then I gave them all away.

414
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,960
 I think my brother gave me 70 bucks for all my cards, and he later, I think, sold it for

415
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
 500.

416
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
 Yeah.

417
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,960
 Did you even have them sleeved back then?

418
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,960
 No.

419
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,960
 Goodness, no.

420
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
 No.

421
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
 They were sleeves, though?

422
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,960
 They were sleeves, though.

423
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
 They were no sleeves, though.

424
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,960
 Yeah.

425
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,960
 They used to, in the very early on, they claimed-

426
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,040
 They were sleeves, though.

427
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,840
 They claimed that you had to ante every single game, so you would shuffle your deck, and

428
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,000
 then blind, you'd have to set out a card, and then you'd play, and then the other person

429
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 got it.

430
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 That didn't last.

431
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Well, that was the whole thing with Pokemon, too.

432
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 It was all six prizes.

433
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 They would go.

434
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Yeah.

435
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,880
 Now, what time period is this?

436
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,880
 Fall 1993.

437
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
 Two fistfuls of cookie dough.

438
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,880
 Yep.

439
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
 I remember those days.

440
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:04,800
 No, because I'm trying to say, what's weird now is that, as someone who, they're teens

441
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,960
 and 20s and the 90s, any niche culture was actually kind of shit on.

442
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,960
 You just kind of-

443
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,960
 Yes.

444
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,960
 Right.

445
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,960
 You always had to alth to alth.

446
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,640
 No matter what was going on, as soon as it became popular, it was like, "Go left."

447
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,880
 This is before the great flattening of the geek empires, thanks to the internet.

448
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,140
 This is at a time that I was excited about Magic the Gathering, because it was a more

449
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,240
 approachable bridge to Dungeons and Dragons at the time.

450
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,040
 I'm like, "Well, they're just playing the game."

451
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,040
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

452
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:35,120
 Because what I'm trying to say is you chose friends over this game, right?

453
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,120
 This time.

454
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,560
 This is before the dark times, before Mikey.

455
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,560
 Yes.

456
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,920
 But now, I feel like you don't, right?

457
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,520
 I feel like the internet makes these communities a thing, that people are losing friends.

458
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,900
 There's just no king media.

459
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,320
 There's no king thing.

460
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,160
 There's no mainstream anymore.

461
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,760
 Everything is just its own niche.

462
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,400
 And so, it's like, "All right, is there a one weird thing that people are all obsessed

463
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,400
 about?"

464
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,400
 Yeah.

465
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,400
 You want to know the problem with the internet?

466
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,400
 Nobody's lonely.

467
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,760
 When you're lonely, you have to do a little thing called compromise and meet other people

468
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,840
 at the square dance, dipshits.

469
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,720
 Instead, everyone's all making hierarchies.

470
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,800
 This fall on Fox News, Brian Brushwood shares the real truths.

471
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,560
 Why aren't the kids at square dances?

472
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,840
 I had to tell you, Brushwood, as someone who's just been dipping my toe, by dipping my toe,

473
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,040
 I mean paying two 20-year-olds to edit clips for me.

474
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:38,720
 Oh, is that what you're paying them for?

475
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,720
 It's part of it.

476
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,480
 We have different hobbies.

477
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,480
 Yeah.

478
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,920
 Believe me, take the reels.

479
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,600
 It's so much simpler.

480
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,320
 Trust me, you'll be happier with the reels.

481
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:58,440
 Okay, so which means I've experimented with putting things on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube.

482
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,440
 Everyone loves them.

483
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,440
 Super supportive.

484
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,080
 YouTube is a hellscape.

485
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,960
 Luckily, it's not one of our jobs to fucking stare at the raw feet of God's butthole the

486
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
 whole day long.

487
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,120
 Actually, it was really funny.

488
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,800
 Even one of the clips, I looked also, I was like, "What 40 comments?

489
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,040
 What the fuck's going on here?"

490
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,240
 Simply, it was a thing of doing a trick I bought from you.

491
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,240
 Oh, that's right.

492
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,240
 I think my wife saw this.

493
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,000
 She was like, "Hey, I think you take tricks pretty good."

494
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Yup.

495
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,640
 I'll let it stand.

496
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,920
 I'm doing your trick, and I simply say, "What's your favorite book?"

497
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,080
 She goes, "I don't have one," and I go, "Correct."

498
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:48,120
 That's the whole hoping to go viral moment.

499
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:55,120
 And then a debate breaks out about whether or not books are stupid.

500
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
 In the comments.

501
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,120
 Yeah.

502
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
 Nothing to do with me at all.

503
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,120
 Yup.

504
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,280
 Just people going at it, like, "Why don't you fucking read?"

505
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,640
 And defenders go like, "No, reading's dumb."

506
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,240
 And it just goes on and on and on.

507
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:12,080
 So yeah, I had this conversation in the car back from the fucking ...

508
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,240
 That reading's bad?

509
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,680
 This is why ... He's from Kentucky.

510
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:22,520
 This is why we need to support comic book stores and libraries and all this kind of

511
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
 shit.

512
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,520
 We need to read.

513
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,520
 Fucking read.

514
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:32,960
 I love the fact that comics went from being the scourge of literacy to, "Guys, at least

515
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,200
 there's words in them."

516
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
 Whoa.

517
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:43,600
 Honestly, if we put words next to the titties, they might read.

518
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
 They might notice them.

519
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
 That was my hope.

520
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,720
 I'm trying to get Matt's kids literate.

521
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,040
 What's this hidden word around this areola?

522
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,040
 Constitutional democracy.

523
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,720
 What the hell?

524
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:04,040
 No, but even at just a base level, I've always, in my head, thought, "What better way to

525
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:11,000
 get people of any type to learn how to read, but by having visual representation of what's

526
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,800
 happening accompanied with dialogue and explanation?"

527
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,640
 Eventually, they move on to chapter books.

528
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,640
 Right.

529
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,200
 What the fuck?

530
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,320
 Some people do.

531
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,560
 Paul hadn't moved on yet.

532
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,560
 No.

533
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,560
 Props to Chuck Windy.

534
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,680
 Who won in the comments, from your opinion?

535
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,680
 Books or no books?

536
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,680
 Books crushed it.

537
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,680
 Books did.

538
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,680
 Good for books.

539
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,680
 You know what?

540
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:39,720
 I would say I'd be okay with those random arguments if YouTube would bake into the system

541
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,520
 the ability for you to be the judge.

542
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,800
 Man, this is your room.

543
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
 There's no fight.

544
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,800
 You get to call the winner.

545
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,800
 That's it.

546
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
 Yeah, yeah.

547
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
 Yeah.

548
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,800
 All right.

549
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
 I'll write them.

550
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,800
 Dear YouTube.

551
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,800
 You should post that.

552
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
 It was John Waters.

553
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,800
 Right?

554
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
 I believe it was John Waters.

555
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
 John Waters' quote.

556
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,280
 He was like, "Please, if you go to someone's house and you see that they don't have any

557
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,200
 books, don't fuck them."

558
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
 Right?

559
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,960
 I think I'm attributing that properly.

560
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,960
 Yes.

561
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,960
 I think it was Houdini.

562
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,960
 Oh, you're right.

563
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,960
 It was Houdini.

564
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,960
 Shit.

565
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,960
 The Virgin Islands.

566
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,960
 That was not an option.

567
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,960
 No.

568
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,960
 Yeah.

569
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,960
 You walked in.

570
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,960
 You're like, "Here's a gift of a book."

571
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,960
 No reason.

572
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,960
 I had so ... Do you have a shelf?

573
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
 Put this on.

574
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:30,720
 Matt bought three girls the entire Encyclopedia Britannica before he left the Virgin Islands.

575
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,720
 I'm back with G.

576
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
 Yeah.

577
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
 That hit the spot.

578
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:51,520
 One, I was thinking it would be really funny if you just said, "Worked in a big way."

579
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,880
 If everyone was like, "He's right."

580
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,440
 Then we all rushed to comic book stores and created a wave of everybody to do it.

581
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,040
 I get lost in these conversations because we're getting older, right?

582
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,040
 Yes.

583
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,040
 Speak for yourself.

584
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,040
 Slow decay.

585
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,040
 Slow.

586
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:13,120
 As someone who started a magic career late, I went on tour as a guy, and now I'm touring

587
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,120
 as an old guy.

588
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:18,960
 I definitely noticed that, where people talk to me to start, and then they're like, "Okay,

589
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,960
 we're done talking to the old man.

590
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,440
 Now let's go back to talk to each other."

591
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,160
 I'm like, "Oh, okay."

592
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,800
 So when we get on our high horses ... On the slow road to total burdened-dom.

593
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,800
 Yes.

594
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

595
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:36,160
 You can see the light in people's eyes slowly start fading, as you drone on and on about

596
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,160
 the Gulf War, some shit.

597
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,760
 I used to be guile, now I'm dulcine.

598
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,680
 The slow road to total burdened-dom.

599
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,680
 Yeah.

600
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,600
 You're just like, "So Norman Schwarzkopf was popular."

601
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,600
 What?

602
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,600
 No.

603
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
 Nobody here saw Good Will Hunting?

604
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
 Yeah.

605
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:59,200
 They're like, "I don't know, fucking their brains are just rotted with a million TikTok

606
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
 trends."

607
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
 Well, that's it.

608
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,400
 The internet is everything, right?

609
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
 Right.

610
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
 No.

611
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,240
 What I mean to say is, we talked about this off air, but on the episode where we did something

612
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,240
 kind of serious.

613
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,240
 Yes.

614
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:19,320
 I basically said it's hard because there's so many forces that profit from the destruction

615
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,320
 of hope.

616
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,320
 Yes.

617
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:29,760
 Basically, by making it feel like a hellscape all the time, it makes money and it also tells

618
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,040
 me to go for self.

619
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,040
 I don't have to worry about the future, I don't have to worry about future generations

620
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,960
 because they're never going to change.

621
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,800
 They're going to fuck it all up and they is whoever, I'm talking about any issue, they,

622
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,960
 they're going to fuck it all up and then, so therefore, I don't have to worry about

623
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
 shit anymore.

624
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,160
 You know what I feel like the solution is?

625
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:53,440
 In-person events like what's happening right now at ScootFest.

626
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,120
 Agree.

627
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,200
 I agree.

628
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,880
 We talked about it years ago.

629
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,360
 We talked about the, you have to identify the they.

630
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,360
 You can't just-

631
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,360
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

632
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,360
 You can't just say they.

633
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,360
 Yeah, yeah.

634
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,360
 I think it's important.

635
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,360
 It's super important.

636
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,360
 Thank you very much.

637
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,360
 People are just bringing me booze.

638
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,360
 It's great.

639
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,360
 I love ScootFest.

640
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,360
 Name them, Jacob.

641
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,360
 Who's bringing you booze?

642
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,280
 By the way, I'll sign up for that as well.

643
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,440
 Dos Equis, please.

644
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,440
 Or whiskey.

645
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,440
 Cheers.

646
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,440
 Cheers, mate.

647
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,840
 That whiskey break is brought to you by our sponsor?

648
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,200
 Yes, that whiskey break is brought to you by our following sponsor.

649
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,280
 Today's show, Matt and Maddie's Ice Cream and Social, still haven't moved the commercial

650
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,200
 tab to the front page of my phone.

651
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,200
 Why do that?

652
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,200
 That's too much.

653
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,720
 Time swipes to the right before I get to that square in the middle.

654
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
 It's fine.

655
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
 It's fine.

656
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
 Who's getting older?

657
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,720
 Not us?

658
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,720
 Jesus, that font.

659
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,720
 So bright.

660
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
 Matt, just-

661
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,720
 Just hold your phone up so the background can read it.

662
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,720
 I think you can read that from space.

663
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,720
 What the fuck?

664
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,920
 I'll just have the bartender tell us who's sponsoring this today.

665
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:10,240
 Oh my God, did you hear the wave of horror?

666
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,760
 Matt just showed his phone to the room and there were legitimate woes.

667
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,060
 No bullshit.

668
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,600
 Hold that up and if you can read it, stand up.

669
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,680
 There we go.

670
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,100
 How far back can people read that?

671
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,600
 I think it is rivaled only by the Hollywood sign.

672
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,800
 I actually can't see the Hollywood sign right now, but I can see that.

673
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,800
 I legit was surprised by the reaction from the audience.

674
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,120
 This has been a startling mirror onto self.

675
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,040
 No, only because I know that I'm actually holding out at this font size.

676
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:47,680
 I've gone up one and if I go up two, I'm going to feel really old, so I'm trying to

677
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
 hold it down.

678
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,040
 I say bull the fucking ripples.

679
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,280
 Let it go, baby.

680
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,800
 All you're doing is fooling yourself.

681
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:59,080
 I'm going to tell you right now, my font size on my phone is the standard size.

682
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,360
 I can't read it, but I will not change it.

683
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,920
 Jacob has not read a text message in three years.

684
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,600
 That's right.

685
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,280
 He blindly responds, "Ha!" to everything.

686
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,680
 I give a lot of thumbs up.

687
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
 100%.

688
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,680
 100%.

689
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,680
 100% emoji.

690
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,680
 Oh, sure.

691
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,680
 Oh, sure.

692
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,680
 100%.

693
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,680
 Oh, sure.

694
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,680
 Very nice.

695
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,680
 Oh, sure.

696
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,680
 100%.

697
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,680
 Oh, great.

698
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,680
 Pass my whiskey back over then.

699
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:37,480
 It's keeping tabs over here, Jacob.

700
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:44,800
 Anyways, today's show is brought to you by Beef in a Box, now with Extra Box.

701
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:50,480
 That's from Belgian Tripple Scoop in 2023.

702
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,160
 Some people tell you no beef, bullshit.

703
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:00,320
 You want beef, and you want beef in a box, and you want extra box, so come on, get this

704
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,200
 beef in a box with the extra box.

705
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,200
 Boom.

706
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,200
 Uh.

707
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,200
 Box.

708
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,200
 Beef.

709
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,200
 Beef in a box.

710
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,200
 Boom.

711
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,200
 Boom that beef in a box.

712
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,200
 Yeah, you hear it mooing?

713
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
 That's your beef.

714
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,200
 Sorry.

715
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,200
 I'm distracted by this commercial.

716
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,560
 Someone threw up a package of Aldi hot dogs, and Brian is squeezing it like a stress toy.

717
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,000
 I will warn you of this, Brian.

718
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,440
 Should the contents of that in any way touch your skin, you will be unable to remove that

719
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,340
 scent for at least two nights.

720
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,340
 You will not be allowed into-

721
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:38,320
 That's great, because I have a Magic the Gathering tournament scheduled for tomorrow.

722
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,080
 And I'm not joking when I say, yeah, you're right.

723
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,080
 That's what, that's kind of the vibe.

724
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:49,920
 It gives off the scent of a gathering of Aldi hot dogs sweating, sweating too close together

725
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,760
 and letting their ass cracks out.

726
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,160
 That is unfair to disgusting people.

727
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,440
 No, it's not.

728
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,040
 Do you think that that shit happens because people can't smell?

729
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:04,360
 Or have they become immune to smelling themselves?

730
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:11,720
 When you are saving up money to buy $500 pieces of cardboard, other things slip through the

731
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,720
 cracks.

732
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,720
 Like lava.

733
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,160
 Like loose toilet paper.

734
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,160
 Yes.

735
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,160
 Yeah.

736
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,380
 I think really it is a combination of that kind, but I think it is just living really

737
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,760
 stretching stuff out and not even thinking about that.

738
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,760
 That's a cry for help.

739
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,760
 Right?

740
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,760
 Yeah.

741
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,760
 Being that smelly.

742
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,760
 I don't know.

743
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,760
 I think it's a sign of depression.

744
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,760
 Yeah.

745
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,680
 But also there's a bunch of creators that I see on TikTok and whatnot that are like,

746
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,520
 don't wash your hair.

747
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,520
 I know.

748
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,520
 Right?

749
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,520
 I'm like, ew.

750
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,520
 They're like, don't wash your hair.

751
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,520
 I'm like, what?

752
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,520
 I legit had an LA friend tell me to stop washing my hair.

753
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,520
 See?

754
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,520
 That's what I'm saying, man.

755
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:51,320
 And they probably don't miss, I don't know, I don't want to get into a hygiene debate,

756
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,320
 but I will.

757
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,480
 But nobody's saying don't wash your ass.

758
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,480
 Yes.

759
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,480
 I'm spoiling for a hygiene debate.

760
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:04,000
 I'm just waiting for the right YouTube short magic trick to bring it out.

761
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,840
 I will finish the trick and be like, whoa, pull that one out of my ass.

762
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,960
 And they'll be like, you shouldn't store stuff in your ass.

763
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,960
 Yes, you should.

764
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,840
 You should use pockets.

765
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,200
 We are evolved to store things in our ass.

766
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,200
 Asses are dumb.

767
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,560
 That's why we beat the monkeys.

768
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,800
 It's nature's pocket.

769
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
 Nature's pocket.

770
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,800
 Excuse my ass.

771
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,800
 Today's show is brought to you by nature's pocket.

772
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,800
 Oh, God.

773
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
 Interhase Group's a checkout.

774
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:32,960
 I just got done writing my 200-word comment about South American tariff rates on bandana

775
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,960
 banana.

776
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,960
 Oh, boy.

777
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,960
 Yeah.

778
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,960
 Oh, yeah.

779
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,960
 Interhase Group's a checkout.

780
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,960
 Nailed that one.

781
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,960
 Extra long commercial.

782
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:51,040
 If folks brought stuff, we're going to do like a physical Scoop Mail thing during the

783
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,040
 concert tonight.

784
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,040
 Yes.

785
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:58,720
 We want to do a physical Scoop Mail thing now just because narrating GIFs is...

786
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,720
 Not exciting.

787
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,720
 ...burdensome to the listener.

788
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,720
 Not the greatest of podcasts.

789
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
 But...

790
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,160
 We do have a microphone for people who want to do any kind of in-person...

791
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,040
 Narration of the gift that they brought.

792
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,040
 Scoop Mail.

793
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,040
 No.

794
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,040
 And...

795
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,040
 Who?

796
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,040
 In-person Scoop Mail.

797
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:19,440
 So we won't narrate it, but if you want to narrate it...

798
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,960
 Or argue about whether or not reading is dumb.

799
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,960
 Yeah.

800
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,960
 You can also do that.

801
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,560
 Those are the two things that are mostly what we want.

802
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,280
 But I guess you could also do anything else.

803
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:34,840
 So if anybody has an in-person Scoop Mail you'd like to do, come on up, get lined up

804
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,800
 at the microphone up here, and we will get to that in just a moment.

805
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,800
 That doesn't include an item.

806
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,800
 Is it just me, or is the energy weird?

807
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,740
 The energy's weird today.

808
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,740
 The energy is weird.

809
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,740
 No, the energy's weird.

810
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,440
 I don't think it's bad, but it is weird.

811
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,440
 No.

812
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,440
 I think we're at day three.

813
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,440
 Yeah, that's it.

814
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,000
 And I think also, I am pacing myself for tonight, right?

815
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 Yeah.

816
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 That's what's going on.

817
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,760
 These guys are just taking it to zero, and then at eight o'clock, it's ass cracks out.

818
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,760
 Yeah.

819
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:08,200
 I can answer your question about what happened to the mood in the room.

820
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,200
 Okay.

821
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,200
 Oh.

822
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,840
 You got all the international scoops arrested, so that's what happened to all the good scoops

823
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,840
 left.

824
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,840
 That's true.

825
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,840
 That is true.

826
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,840
 Okay.

827
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,840
 Now that you bring it up, I apologize.

828
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,000
 Okay, good.

829
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,120
 That joke is from Penn Sunday School, so good.

830
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,120
 This is good.

831
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,120
 It's like a comic book series.

832
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,120
 You have to listen to them all together to figure it out.

833
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,120
 That's right.

834
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,120
 Yeah.

835
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,120
 That's right.

836
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,120
 It's good.

837
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,120
 It's good.

838
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,120
 It's good.

839
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,120
 Very nice.

840
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,120
 Yeah.

841
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,120
 Well, a lot of these people have had two nights at McMullin's.

842
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,120
 It's a lot.

843
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,120
 Oh, yeah.

844
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
 No, we're running on empty here.

845
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,120
 Fucking redlining.

846
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
 Holy shit.

847
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,120
 Yeah.

848
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,960
 Oh, we have someone coming up here.

849
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,960
 Oh, hey.

850
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,360
 Even if I'm an international scoop, shame on you.

851
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,840
 It was so real.

852
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,720
 I don't know why it was so real.

853
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:03,520
 I've never had any kind of a police job, or I don't know why anybody would believe you

854
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,520
 had an earpiece.

855
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,520
 Yeah.

856
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,140
 I don't know why it thundered forth so big.

857
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:15,760
 I do have one question, because I asked Scoop if they know the answer for it, and I don't

858
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,080
 remember it ever coming up.

859
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,760
 Who is Annie?

860
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,440
 So the person we're getting our emails from, from Patreon.

861
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,440
 Oh, Annie.

862
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:29,760
 I never, ever heard anything about the person behind that.

863
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,760
 Is there an answer?

864
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,760
 Is she okay?

865
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,760
 I don't know.

866
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,760
 Why don't you ask her?

867
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,760
 Annie, are you okay?

868
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,280
 She honestly, and this is the timely, because she was recently hit by a smooth criminal.

869
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,280
 Damn.

870
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,000
 She was actually struck by a smooth criminal.

871
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,840
 She was hit by, and struck by, yeah.

872
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,160
 Oh, by the way, hilarious.

873
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:59,240
 Great question, because 1200 episodes in, Annie was an, or was a listener, was a listener?

874
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,240
 We don't know.

875
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,440
 And she definitely was a listener.

876
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,440
 Yeah.

877
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,440
 We think she still listens.

878
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,400
 And we first busted out the Patreon.

879
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,560
 We were overwhelmed.

880
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,560
 Yeah.

881
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,560
 As happens.

882
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,680
 And we offered a lot of stuff.

883
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,800
 And so we basically said, like, none of us have office skills, does any scoop out there

884
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,800
 have office skills?

885
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,920
 And Annie stepped up, and we created an email address for her.

886
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:31,920
 And also, we just thought it was a good idea to have a barrier, not, not, not from like

887
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,080
 a don't bother Jacob Paul and I with stuff, but we actually just thought our listeners

888
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:42,320
 will talk more honestly and frankly with someone whose job it was to talk to scoops.

889
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,320
 Like if there's an issue.

890
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,320
 Yeah.

891
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,560
 Like some scoops might not want to come to us with it with an issue might be easier to

892
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,560
 go to any with an issue.

893
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,560
 Yeah.

894
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,560
 Yeah.

895
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,320
 And so we have to interact with Annie all the time.

896
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,040
 She emails us before episodes, that kind of stuff.

897
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:59,960
 And so she does all of our kind of like Patreon relationship housekeeping and has done it

898
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:04,600
 now for fucking as long as we've had Patreon nine years.

899
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
 It's been crazy.

900
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
 She's great.

901
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,960
 No, he's amazing.

902
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,840
 I have met her.

903
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,280
 I believe the other two have not.

904
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,280
 Nope.

905
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,280
 I have not met any.

906
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,280
 I follow her on the socials.

907
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:18,560
 She, uh, she and her kids, uh, do Disney world occasionally and yeah.

908
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,560
 Uh, nice.

909
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,560
 Good.

910
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,840
 People were doubting Paul, but he came over the top of that Disney world thing.

911
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,160
 The guy wants to know and he's can't fabricate that detail.

912
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,400
 She's in the magic kingdom.

913
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,600
 I occasionally email.

914
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,960
 By the way, it's mostly like, I love this question.

915
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,160
 Like, do we have like weird, small ice cream, social minutiae questions?

916
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:45,160
 Like, oh, yeah, this is great.

917
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,160
 Line up.

918
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,160
 Come on.

919
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,160
 Come on.

920
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,160
 But I met her and her husband.

921
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,160
 Uh, they came and saw me open for the magic dragon in Connecticut.

922
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,720
 Uh, at Foxwoods and Annie is lovely and has been extremely, extremely helpful.

923
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,520
 How has she not been to a scoop fest?

924
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,520
 Oh, we don't let her.

925
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,520
 Oh, she doesn't like now.

926
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,040
 Uh, give us a scoop name, a scooper Nova girl, scooper Nova girl.

927
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,200
 There she is.

928
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,200
 Yeah.

929
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,560
 So scoops have a lot of call and responses and greetings.

930
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,920
 Do we have a toast?

931
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,920
 A toast.

932
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,680
 Well, the answer is we don't.

933
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,680
 I don't think so.

934
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:20,040
 Well, well, well, I mean, we have my toast, which is Kapla and good journey, which combines

935
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:26,120
 my love of Star Trek and you guys can pick up on one of our favorites, which is, uh,

936
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,120
 jizz.

937
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,120
 Yeah.

938
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:34,880
 You never noticed that, all right, if you do that, that's rude, crass, ugly.

939
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,080
 Oh, if you, if you add the word mate, they assume you're British.

940
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,080
 Just mate.

941
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,080
 Just mate.

942
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,080
 Just mate.

943
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,080
 Oh, I got you.

944
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,080
 Okay.

945
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,080
 So I like that.

946
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,760
 And actually we started doing that on a podcast where the head of the network was on it.

947
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:55,040
 It was a, uh, it was just a cheap way to just say jizz on a polite society live stream.

948
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,680
 And at some point we just keep, uh, cause it was a new year's Eve thing.

949
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,080
 So it happened a lot.

950
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,920
 And so we were cheersing a lot.

951
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,960
 And so we're just like, jizz, mate, jizz.

952
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:11,560
 And at one point he just looks at me and he's just like, yeah, that was it.

953
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,340
 How long did it take him to realize?

954
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:17,840
 We got seven, eight jizzes before he even, you got so much jizzes.

955
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,120
 Oh, we were firing ropes, dude.

956
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,200
 Like, it was, I mean, it was Peter North all the way down.

957
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,200
 Yeah.

958
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,480
 So we don't, we don't have an official, uh, thing, but I think we could all do like a

959
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
 salt pork.

960
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,480
 I need help.

961
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,480
 Do you have a, a suggestion?

962
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,480
 No, it's the top of your head.

963
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,480
 No.

964
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,480
 Fair.

965
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,480
 Fair.

966
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,480
 Fair.

967
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,480
 All right.

968
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,480
 Yeah.

969
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,480
 Right.

970
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,480
 What you got?

971
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,480
 Doc, Doc Scoop.

972
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,480
 Doc Scoop.

973
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,480
 There he is.

974
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,800
 We, we, uh, fall in love with characters over time and people that come and go, I haven't

975
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,880
 heard from Brit Mukai in a while and any updates on how he's doing, what's going on with him?

976
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:54,080
 I've, again, he's another one that I follow on the old, uh, socials.

977
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,800
 Takes his kids to Disney world every now and then.

978
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,800
 Kids going to Disney world.

979
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,800
 Kids now.

980
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,840
 Um, no, his VO career has continued to be successful.

981
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:06,240
 Uh, recently he's had some health and dietary struggles.

982
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,560
 Um, not trying to put you on blast, Brett, uh, but he's sharing all that.

983
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,560
 He's doing it publicly.

984
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,560
 Yeah.

985
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,560
 Yeah.

986
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,560
 He's sharing all that.

987
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,560
 And, um, but he's doing really well.

988
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,920
 I'd like you, if you follow Brit Mukai, he's not hard to find on socials.

989
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,920
 Yeah.

990
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:23,360
 He's doing lots of convention work and signing autographs, uh, because he is the voice of

991
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,360
 many anime characters.

992
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,360
 Oh, fantastic.

993
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,360
 That people know and love right now.

994
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,360
 He's working.

995
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,360
 He's doing well.

996
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,360
 Yeah.

997
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,360
 Brett is working.

998
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,360
 No, Brett, that's why he's not hanging out with us.

999
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,360
 He's in LA making that dollar.

1000
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,360
 That's right.

1001
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,360
 You think we can get him to do a phoner?

1002
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,360
 He?

1003
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,360
 Check in with us.

1004
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,360
 He bought property in California.

1005
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,360
 Whoa.

1006
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,360
 Yeah.

1007
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,360
 Right.

1008
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,360
 Like, yeah.

1009
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,360
 Damn.

1010
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,360
 But, but you bring up a good point.

1011
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,360
 Tell me about this home.

1012
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,360
 It is.

1013
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:50,360
 It has been a long time and we should probably reach out to Brett for a touch base, uh, maybe

1014
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,360
 a Zoom.

1015
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,440
 You should probably call him right now.

1016
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,440
 No.

1017
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,840
 I feel like I've got at least another year in me before I need to talk to Brett.

1018
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,840
 Are you going to try it?

1019
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,840
 Just give him a try.

1020
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,840
 Alright.

1021
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,840
 He's going to try it.

1022
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,840
 I mean, it's ScoopFest after all.

1023
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,840
 You're right.

1024
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,840
 You're right.

1025
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,840
 You're right.

1026
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,840
 He's going to try it.

1027
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,840
 When all miracles take place.

1028
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,840
 Alright.

1029
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,600
 They say that if you rub your two fingers together, then Brett McKay will send us the

1030
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,600
 voicemail.

1031
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,600
 It is a pretty miraculous time.

1032
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,040
 Well, I mean, it's, what is it?

1033
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,040
 It's a Saturday afternoon.

1034
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,040
 It's as good a time as any to reach him.

1035
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,040
 I guess so.

1036
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,040
 Yeah.

1037
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,040
 He might be at a con.

1038
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,040
 Uh, that's quite possible.

1039
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,640
 Oh my God.

1040
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,640
 God.

1041
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,640
 Signing him things.

1042
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,640
 It's my only Star Trek joke.

1043
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,640
 Brett's doing great, man.

1044
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,640
 Brett's doing great.

1045
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,640
 Uh, what do you got?

1046
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,640
 Scoop name?

1047
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,640
 Technical Scoop.

1048
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,640
 We're checking in again.

1049
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,640
 Oh, hold on.

1050
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,640
 Wait, wait.

1051
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,640
 Sorry.

1052
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,640
 Sorry.

1053
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,640
 Technical Scoop.

1054
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,640
 We got Brett McKay.

1055
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,640
 Brett McKay.

1056
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,640
 Do you hear me?

1057
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,640
 Yeah, I can hear you.

1058
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,640
 What's up, brother?

1059
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,640
 You are live at ScoopFest in front of hundreds of Scoops right now.

1060
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,640
 How's it going, Scoops?

1061
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,640
 Oh my God.

1062
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:51,640
 Brett, uh, literally, uh, someone came up and just said, how is Brent?

1063
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,640
 Why haven't we heard from a while?

1064
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,640
 Where is he?

1065
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,640
 So how are you, Brent?

1066
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,640
 What's going on?

1067
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,640
 Dude, I'm fucking rad, man.

1068
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,640
 And in fact, I was gonna hit, it's so crazy.

1069
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,640
 I was gonna hit you guys up.

1070
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,640
 I'm actually gonna be in Vegas, um, next weekend.

1071
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,640
 Oh, fuck yeah.

1072
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,640
 I'm one weekend too late.

1073
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,640
 Can he come on the Friday episode?

1074
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,640
 Uh, yeah.

1075
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,640
 I mean, we're on Zoom.

1076
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,640
 He can come on the Friday episode.

1077
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:19,800
 But, uh, yeah, come on, come on by, uh, I'll be in Canada, but don't, don't let that stop

1078
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,800
 you.

1079
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,240
 Uh, uh, uh, what, what are you, what are you up to?

1080
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,800
 Tell the, tell the Scoops something they can like dive their teeth into.

1081
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,800
 What's up, Scoops?

1082
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:39,040
 I'm, I'm at a convention in Florida, in Tampa Bay and, uh, yeah, I'm just eating dinner

1083
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,480
 with like, uh, Pokemon voice actors and people like that.

1084
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:48,800
 And, uh, yeah, I'm just chilling, having a good time and ate a great burger just now.

1085
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,800
 Oh, there you go.

1086
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,120
 Well, Brent, thank you so much for answering my call.

1087
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,520
 Uh, if you didn't, I was gonna be so furious.

1088
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,800
 Uh, so I appreciate you, you doing it.

1089
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,760
 That's the only reason I answered it, man.

1090
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:07,840
 I was like, if I don't answer this, I'm going to miss out on something awesome.

1091
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,840
 All right.

1092
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,840
 Give it up for Brent, everybody.

1093
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,840
 Take it easy.

1094
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,840
 We love you, Brent.

1095
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,840
 We'll talk soon.

1096
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,840
 Bye, pal.

1097
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,840
 Technical Scoop board.

1098
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,840
 You got a question.

1099
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,840
 I do.

1100
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:25,840
 Uh, it's been quite a while since I've heard the, the haiku from the Patreon requests.

1101
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,840
 Is that still a thing?

1102
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,520
 We are changing the Patreon right now.

1103
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,520
 Yeah.

1104
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,280
 So this has been really tricky because, uh, Patreon changeups happened right around the

1105
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,280
 time.

1106
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,100
 Scoop Fest preparations really kicked into high gear.

1107
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:43,480
 So we're hoping to have things remedied and squared by the middle of October.

1108
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,160
 You're the second person who's asked this.

1109
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,160
 Yep.

1110
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,440
 Um, so I propose, and this is just Paul, and I might just do it by myself if I have to,

1111
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:55,600
 I propose we try and do kind of a, uh, make good on what suggestions we still have in

1112
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:00,000
 the kitty and maybe a few that keep that come in now and do maybe a special hour long bonus

1113
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,360
 episode of just the, the haikus and the, and the, what do you call it?

1114
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,600
 And the triple threats and all that.

1115
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,160
 You guys would like that maybe?

1116
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,160
 Yeah.

1117
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:12,320
 And then, and then they are going to go away, um, until, except for, except for special

1118
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,320
 occasions.

1119
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,320
 Yeah.

1120
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,320
 Except for when we want them to come back.

1121
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,320
 Yeah.

1122
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,320
 And then we'll do them.

1123
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,200
 And by we, I mean, we, all of us, we.

1124
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,040
 But it's not going to be an essential part of the, uh, Patreon moving forward.

1125
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,040
 Right.

1126
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,680
 So I'm actually going to speak a little, a little, a little deeper to that question.

1127
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,680
 Oh, please.

1128
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,680
 Uh, get deep.

1129
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,680
 No, no.

1130
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,840
 Cause, uh, like in truth, like, uh, uh, comedy has changed a lot since we started doing this

1131
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,840
 podcast.

1132
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,840
 Yeah.

1133
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,640
 12 years and sensibilities have changed a lot and an awareness of being like three white

1134
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,420
 dudes doing a podcast has like been a thing on our minds.

1135
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:50,360
 And on some level, like in the room, like when we do the bucket show, we do other things

1136
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,360
 like that.

1137
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,360
 Like when we're in a room with people who like us, who trust us and just like any other

1138
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,500
 group of people where you're in a room where people trust each other, you can tow the line.

1139
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,900
 You can push the envelope.

1140
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:03,880
 You can, uh, basically get left for saying something a little, a little.

1141
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:04,880
 You have some latitude.

1142
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,000
 Uh, knowing that the person thinks you're a good guy.

1143
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 Right.

1144
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,660
 And as comedy changes, as we got older, like the idea of leaving constant physical evidence

1145
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:18,360
 of us doing haikus and saying your mom, a difference in your mom and blank and that

1146
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:23,320
 kind of stuff just started getting a little like, uh-oh, maybe this might be a bad idea

1147
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,360
 in the longterm.

1148
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:28,160
 And so we got a little, uh, gunshot about doing it.

1149
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,760
 You didn't want to turn on the printing press of liability receipts.

1150
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,760
 Yeah, exactly.

1151
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,920
 And, and it's a shame because like, I know that like, uh, we've always joked from the

1152
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,760
 beginning, like we are dumb jokes for smart people.

1153
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,680
 Like it's like always like kind of like what I like to think of us.

1154
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,920
 Uh, and, uh, and so like, I know we get the benefit of the doubt from the people that

1155
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:46,920
 do it.

1156
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,040
 And there is something like there's guilty pleasure about being childish in humor, sometimes

1157
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,040
 stuff like that.

1158
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,240
 So we do enjoy doing it like we would still do it at the bucket shows and things like

1159
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,240
 that.

1160
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,720
 Uh, but it just became something that got a little, uh, uh, it got a little dicey for

1161
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,400
 me, uh, for doing on air.

1162
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:07,760
 I think it's also something that is going to be better received as it's rarer.

1163
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:13,360
 Like if you, if you do a thing every once in a while, um, you know, that's a very involved

1164
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,360
 bit.

1165
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,360
 Yeah.

1166
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:20,960
 And it's like, it's, it's hard, it takes away some of the magic when you see it so often

1167
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:27,600
 that it becomes, I mean, our first patron was a nightmare and, uh, it was so funny and

1168
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,600
 that's what we loved.

1169
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,600
 Like we made a very funny.

1170
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,600
 Right.

1171
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,120
 You go, you guys had the most convoluted reward system.

1172
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,720
 It was one time we would eat weird things on camera was one reward.

1173
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,640
 Oh, I forgot about that.

1174
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,640
 Oh, no hands.

1175
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,640
 We would no hands.

1176
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,720
 No hands eating.

1177
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,720
 We did that.

1178
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,720
 Yeah.

1179
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,720
 We did that at a pepper mill.

1180
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:51,600
 We recorded people eating things without using our hands.

1181
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,120
 I forgot about that.

1182
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:57,960
 We, uh, we used to try to do individual made up credits for each person we thanked at the

1183
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:58,960
 end of episodes.

1184
00:46:58,960 --> 00:46:59,960
 Yep.

1185
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:00,960
 Every single person.

1186
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,960
 And then it mostly was just got to be too many people.

1187
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:02,960
 Yeah.

1188
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,600
 So we'd literally be like technical school board, technical school board.

1189
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:09,520
 He graduated from this university and he did all this and allegedly he did this.

1190
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,520
 Yeah.

1191
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,600
 We would do like five minutes was a blast.

1192
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,660
 And then it became like really unfunny.

1193
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:18,160
 And then we just finished the episode, like, I don't want to end episodes doing our most

1194
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,160
 unfunny shit.

1195
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:26,120
 Where we run this fucking momentum into the cliff face of mandatory fun.

1196
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,120
 Yeah.

1197
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,320
 So like, uh, and you know, it's like Paul and I are improv guys.

1198
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,640
 And so like so much about like being improv, like we can always make it up on the spot.

1199
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,880
 We can always generate gold.

1200
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:34,880
 We can do this.

1201
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,960
 Uh, and then putting it to the test, you know, for three hours a week for 12 years, it's

1202
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,280
 just, you know, maybe, maybe gold is a high standard.

1203
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,720
 Um, you know, and so I think we tried to kind of, we also, yeah, we would kind of pump breaks

1204
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,000
 on weird shit like that.

1205
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 Yeah.

1206
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,840
 But as I said, it's just not going to be part of the patron going forward in a large capacity,

1207
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,800
 but we will do a make good episode from some of the old stuff.

1208
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,600
 If you got one specifically, you really want to hear, uh, send it to Jacob.

1209
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,600
 And we're, and we're going to do them.

1210
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,320
 Like we're, we're still going to, we're still going to do all of our stuff, you know, as,

1211
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,320
 as time goes by.

1212
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,320
 Uh, but yeah, maybe just not quite as often.

1213
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,320
 Yeah.

1214
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,320
 Is that fair?

1215
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,320
 Very fair.

1216
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,320
 Thank you.

1217
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,320
 Thank you.

1218
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,320
 Yeah.

1219
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,320
 Come on up.

1220
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,320
 Come on up.

1221
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,320
 Scoop name.

1222
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,320
 It's, uh, Belgian Triple Scoop.

1223
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,320
 Belgian Triple Scoop.

1224
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,320
 Love it.

1225
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,680
 Actually, I'm very grateful technical scoop port, cause you kind of started the question

1226
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:28,000
 that I have, which is, you know, um, I bought tickets for Scoop Fest before I, I'm now in

1227
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 a serious relationship.

1228
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,600
 We're about to be a year, but she doesn't share the same kind of sense of humor though.

1229
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,600
 I think we, everybody in this room really loves.

1230
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,600
 Come on guys.

1231
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,600
 Yeah.

1232
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,600
 Jump jokes for smart people.

1233
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,600
 Woo.

1234
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,560
 So you're asking us if you should leave her?

1235
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:46,880
 This is so awkward and unexpected, but yes, you should leave her.

1236
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,120
 I feel bad that you said that because now four people just said, you know what?

1237
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,120
 I'm over it too.

1238
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,120
 And they just left.

1239
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:58,320
 But that's, but it's, it's, how do you marry that idea of, this is something that you love,

1240
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,320
 right?

1241
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,440
 Like it's, you know, you, you talked about, you know, obviously you're very thoughtful

1242
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,520
 response to how you do the different jokes and oh, this is great comedy gold.

1243
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:10,520
 It's comedy gold everybody, but explaining the Captain Morgan podcast and why that's

1244
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:14,080
 funny is sometimes difficult.

1245
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:20,320
 I don't think I can explain why, if the Captain Morgan podcast is funny, super cerebral, but

1246
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,080
 it's exactly, it's a high watermark.

1247
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,080
 But that's the idea.

1248
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,080
 How do you, Captain Morgan, did you want her in this?

1249
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:34,880
 I just wanted to let you know that the podcast is funny because my name is Captain Morgan.

1250
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,200
 What do you want to do?

1251
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,200
 What are you doing?

1252
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,480
 Captain Morgan, you seem like, you seem like you're on the precipice, you're, you're on

1253
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,480
 the precipice.

1254
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,480
 Well, okay.

1255
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,480
 Hold on.

1256
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,480
 Get out of my precipice.

1257
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,480
 What?

1258
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,480
 Don't know.

1259
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,480
 I'm perspiring on the precipice.

1260
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,480
 Don't sweat the small stuff.

1261
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,960
 I'm just here for you, Brian.

1262
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,760
 Well, I know you seem very upset though, Captain Morgan.

1263
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,400
 Why do you have hot dogs?

1264
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,520
 Well, it's, I invented hot dogs, by the way.

1265
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,360
 I didn't know this about you.

1266
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:07,120
 Well, funny, funny, you should ask.

1267
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,120
 I didn't.

1268
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,120
 But you have a hot dog that I invented.

1269
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,120
 Okay.

1270
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,120
 That one.

1271
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,120
 Yes.

1272
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,120
 Not the rest.

1273
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,120
 Well, tell me about it.

1274
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:20,520
 I put it together in a spindle that I carried in a bindle.

1275
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,840
 Oh, are you homeless as well?

1276
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:23,840
 Nope.

1277
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:24,840
 No, you're not.

1278
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:25,840
 No, I have a boat.

1279
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:33,840
 I take my boat around to the high seas and if I ever see a hot dog I don't like I kick

1280
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,840
 it off.

1281
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,600
 I say get the fuck out of here, hot dog.

1282
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,600
 Okay.

1283
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,600
 Well, why?

1284
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,600
 It's a real problem.

1285
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,600
 Now, wait a minute.

1286
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,600
 These days.

1287
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,600
 When would you encounter?

1288
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,600
 Hot dogs everywhere.

1289
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,600
 Running, hither and yon.

1290
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,600
 Can't trust them.

1291
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:54,120
 Can't look a hot dog in the eye anymore and say, "Hey, we're going to make a square deal.

1292
00:50:54,120 --> 00:51:00,120
 Now, these hot dogs be doing, hot dogs be trifling."

1293
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,520
 Did a hot dog disappoint you?

1294
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,520
 Fuck yeah.

1295
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,520
 Oh, tell me about it.

1296
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:14,160
 One hot dog crashed the stock market and high interest loans and next thing you know Obama

1297
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,160
 was president.

1298
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,160
 All right.

1299
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,160
 Ladies and gentlemen, Captain Morgan.

1300
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,480
 But that's exactly what I mean.

1301
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,600
 I'm doubled over laughing and you guys, I mean all five of you have-

1302
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:28,280
 75% of the audience wasn't.

1303
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,080
 But that's the point.

1304
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:34,560
 You guys all have partners, you have children, you have people in your life who may not share

1305
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,560
 that.

1306
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:39,280
 How do you find the kind of balance in you guys making your living off of jokes that

1307
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,620
 I find amazing, but I have a hard time sharing?

1308
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:43,620
 How do you find that balance?

1309
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:45,080
 Oh, none of our spouses think we're funny.

1310
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,080
 My wife does.

1311
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,360
 None of our spouses think we're funny.

1312
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,360
 No, my wife thinks I'm funny.

1313
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,200
 No, no, she calls me all the time and tells me.

1314
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,200
 Wow.

1315
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,200
 She thinks I'm funny.

1316
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,200
 She just thinks I push it too gross sometimes.

1317
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,360
 Should there be a statute of limitations on lore, like at some point they expire and you

1318
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,360
 have to let them go?

1319
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,360
 What?

1320
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:04,920
 Should there be a statute of limitations on lore, like at some point, because it's impenetrable

1321
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:05,920
 at some point.

1322
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:06,920
 It's like-

1323
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:13,280
 Dude, you haven't heard from Mothra's Secret Agent in a while for a reason.

1324
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,280
 So yes.

1325
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,080
 Because the last time I started to hear from them, Matt and I just yelled-

1326
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,080
 Yeah, no.

1327
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,080
 "Now!"

1328
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,080
 It doesn't happen.

1329
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,080
 Yeah, so I mean that's-

1330
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,080
 I mean, you look at The Simpsons, right?

1331
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,640
 They didn't think they were going to go 30 years and so all of a sudden they're being

1332
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,960
 held accountable for decisions they made 20 years ago, like that's fucking bananas.

1333
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:28,960
 Yeah.

1334
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,960
 Because it implies that you're looking back as like the powerhouse of that you knew what

1335
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:37,680
 you were the whole time, and not that you were desperately trying to get anyone to pay

1336
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:42,840
 attention to you doing anything that came into your brain and just hoping it flew in

1337
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:43,840
 the moment.

1338
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,280
 Yeah, I mean-

1339
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:50,200
 But no, I mean, I think any time you try to make any kind of living being creative at

1340
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:57,440
 all, something that really comes from your heart and your mind, it's fucking ballsy.

1341
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:04,000
 And any time you get any kind of audience of support, it's really something special.

1342
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,960
 Comedy is also very, very specific.

1343
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:12,640
 There's not a lot of objective elements to comedy that you can say like, "Well, clearly

1344
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,920
 this is funny," because it's all dependent on where people come from, their expectations.

1345
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,600
 I think I've quoted this one before, but this is my go-to right now.

1346
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:25,440
 Zach Anner, the comedian, multiple sclerosis guy, he's amazing.

1347
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,440
 He's fantastic.

1348
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,440
 He's on social media.

1349
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,640
 Zach Anner, this is his whole thing.

1350
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,680
 Comedy isn't meant to be timeless.

1351
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,880
 Great comedy is in service of its time.

1352
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:38,400
 It helps start the conversations that will eventually deem it irrelevant, outdated, or

1353
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,400
 offensive.

1354
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,280
 You laugh, you think, you grow, and you move on.

1355
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:45,080
 That said, farts are always hilarious.

1356
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,680
 But it's so true.

1357
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:53,400
 I went back and listened, like last week, two weeks ago, I listened to a Bill Cosby comedy

1358
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,400
 album.

1359
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,560
 Boy, I didn't know there'd be edgy humor on this show.

1360
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:04,880
 But I mean, it was the edgiest, not even edgiest, but it was hilarious.

1361
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,400
 It was a huge seller of its time.

1362
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,080
 I went back and listened to it.

1363
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,760
 Forget about all the Bill Cosby stuff, or try to, just go to sleep and forget about

1364
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,760
 it.

1365
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:15,760
 It's fine.

1366
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,760
 He'll make you forget.

1367
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:17,760
 Yeah.

1368
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,720
 I mean, all of that aside, it's just not poignant.

1369
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,600
 It's simply not relevant to this day and time anymore.

1370
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,880
 And it's so hard.

1371
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,600
 Jacob's like, "When you guys are done bitching about the other stuff about Bill Cosby, I'd

1372
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,680
 like to take the content of a special for Dad."

1373
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,680
 Can we get to the real issue here?

1374
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,760
 I'm going to really focus in on the minutia of Bill Cosby.

1375
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:37,760
 The drain-bamage bit.

1376
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,760
 The drain-bamage bit.

1377
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,760
 But it really is.

1378
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:47,320
 You go back and listen to it now, and it's just a, it's a relic of the past now, is all

1379
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,320
 it is.

1380
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:54,520
 And you're listening to that and you're listening to it for the nostalgia.

1381
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,220
 It's pure nostalgia at this point.

1382
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,640
 It's not comedy anymore.

1383
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,920
 It's a history.

1384
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,740
 It's a time capsule.

1385
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,800
 I don't think you guys are time capsules.

1386
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,800
 Eggs.

1387
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,000
 Eggs are in the cake.

1388
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
 No.

1389
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,240
 The kids won't pull up their pants.

1390
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:14,680
 So to be kind of, just to wrap everything up, it's figuring out that way to share that

1391
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:18,960
 part of your personality and your comedy, but not push the envelope too far, but like,

1392
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,840
 you know, understand that it's of time, but you know, I don't know, drawing the line.

1393
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:24,840
 Look, look, look.

1394
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:25,840
 I mean.

1395
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:26,840
 Sorry.

1396
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:27,840
 I didn't mean to make this more serious.

1397
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:31,600
 No, you always, you always want to say like, hey, you know, whatever I do is not for everyone.

1398
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:36,320
 But as soon as you find out it's not for everyone, it's devastating.

1399
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,320
 Really hurts your feelings.

1400
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,320
 You do.

1401
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:42,940
 You always say this is like, I, I, I, my comedy heroes never cared about mass popularity.

1402
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:46,000
 My comedy, yeah, just made the funniest thing possible.

1403
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,280
 And then it's like realizing like you hope you're wrong.

1404
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,280
 Yeah.

1405
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:55,640
 Hope it's like, like, no, I'll be as funny as my heroes that didn't get the recognition

1406
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:56,640
 that they deserved.

1407
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,400
 And then you're like, oh no, but I'm not getting the recognition that I deserve.

1408
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,360
 No, like when I like, you know, go do a cruise ship or the audience, just the energy, just

1409
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,360
 fucking zip.

1410
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,360
 Right.

1411
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:09,800
 I absolutely go to sleep hating myself going, I guess I'm not for everyone.

1412
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,800
 Right.

1413
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,600
 And then I have to walk around the ship with them the next day and then like go up and

1414
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:19,320
 hide on deck 19 and look out and hope I don't get harpooned.

1415
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,600
 But like, you know, it's, it's, you know, it's not for everybody.

1416
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:26,840
 But the bottom line is, is that like, I don't looking at us over time or any kind of stuff

1417
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:30,640
 like the body of work, all that feels cool, like to create something that like we want

1418
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,280
 to come to feels cool in the moment.

1419
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,360
 The smartest thing that we decided we were was that we are a service and that service

1420
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,920
 is a weekly service and we are there to help people in that moment.

1421
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:45,640
 And we hope that the podcast helps people in that day or that drive or that walking

1422
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:46,640
 of their dog.

1423
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,640
 Yeah.

1424
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:48,640
 Everything else after that.

1425
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,640
 Sure.

1426
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,760
 But that's the primary.

1427
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:51,760
 That's the primary deal.

1428
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,120
 That's why we keep doing it.

1429
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:56,240
 I'll tell you what, when, when scoops come up to me and this, and this happens, this

1430
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,080
 has happened multiple times this weekend, it happens all the time.

1431
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:04,280
 When scoops come up to me and say, Hey, I listened to the whole back catalog.

1432
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:11,040
 My blood runs cold every single time, but good God, what did we say a decade ago?

1433
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,040
 Yes.

1434
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,040
 I agreed.

1435
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,480
 Oh, I'm terrified all the time.

1436
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,080
 I start laughing.

1437
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,080
 Exactly.

1438
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,080
 Thank you.

1439
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,080
 Thank you so much.

1440
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,080
 Thank you.

1441
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,080
 Scoop name.

1442
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,080
 Give it to us.

1443
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,080
 Gelato problems.

1444
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,080
 Love it.

1445
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,080
 Gelato problems.

1446
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,080
 So my question's about commitment.

1447
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,080
 I don't know if it's.

1448
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,080
 What the fuck?

1449
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,080
 You wrote commitment?

1450
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,080
 Go ahead.

1451
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:35,200
 Explain it to him.

1452
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,200
 Commitment to a bit.

1453
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,200
 Oh, I don't know.

1454
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,200
 Commitment to a bit.

1455
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,200
 Oh, commitment to a bit.

1456
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,200
 To the point of.

1457
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,200
 To the point of endangerment.

1458
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:46,360
 You know, it just felt like this was like a love line segment from like 2001.

1459
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:51,520
 So I don't know if my husband's Max the ginger scoop and I don't know if he was always going

1460
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:56,540
 to be a commitment guy and you just named the thing that he does or if he's just following

1461
00:57:56,540 --> 00:58:01,760
 you to be a commitment guy, but he is that guy and he will kill something until it is

1462
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:02,760
 dead and buried.

1463
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,120
 And I'm like, please stop and he won't.

1464
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:10,160
 And so my question, this is a crowd that will show up at the party tonight in commitment

1465
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,160
 outfits.

1466
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,160
 Yes.

1467
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:17,120
 You guys love commitment, but is there any commitment that in your lives, maybe bad jokes

1468
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:20,600
 like there are some bad jokes that I'm like, kill it and it won't die.

1469
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:25,080
 And bad jokes, commitments, bits at home or bits in your lives that you're like, I'm going

1470
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:29,840
 to keep doing it no matter how upset it makes everyone at work or at home.

1471
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:37,760
 Anything like that, Paul?

1472
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,240
 Your moment has come, sir.

1473
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,920
 The audience said it first.

1474
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:49,640
 The people that I love the most get nicknames and those nicknames stay forever.

1475
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:52,200
 So Matt and I don't have nicknames.

1476
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,600
 That's true.

1477
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,560
 So far I see no complications.

1478
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,560
 Everything's good.

1479
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,040
 It's legit.

1480
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,360
 But you're the audio guy.

1481
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,360
 Move on.

1482
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,360
 Move on.

1483
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,360
 Don't.

1484
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,360
 It's fine.

1485
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,360
 It's fine.

1486
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,360
 Don't.

1487
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,360
 It's worse if you try to make it now.

1488
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,360
 It's worse.

1489
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,360
 Yeah.

1490
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,360
 Just go ahead.

1491
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,360
 But I will.

1492
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,360
 I will.

1493
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,360
 I keep at it.

1494
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,360
 I started calling Ann.

1495
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:18,200
 It's so great if you just shoehorned Madinator in like he had always done it.

1496
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:23,480
 I started calling Ann Snakey, you know, when we were dating early on and she was like, what

1497
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,480
 the fuck are you talking about?

1498
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,400
 And she didn't like it, but I kept it up.

1499
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,720
 And I have called her Snakey for damn near 20 years now.

1500
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:35,720
 And now it's cool that she knows that's I'm Snakey, you know, and it's all good.

1501
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,600
 The honk.

1502
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,160
 My beloved brother that came up.

1503
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,160
 We were what?

1504
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,160
 Twelve?

1505
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,160
 Ten?

1506
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,160
 Less?

1507
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,160
 Yeah.

1508
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:48,820
 Younger is the word you're looking for.

1509
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,280
 He's also from Kentucky.

1510
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,280
 Yeah.

1511
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,280
 Not with the math.

1512
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,120
 Stop fucking with the math on us.

1513
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,500
 We were lesser people.

1514
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,500
 But that's what it is.

1515
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,500
 It's yeah.

1516
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,500
 I mean, it started with that.

1517
00:59:58,500 --> 00:59:59,980
 It started with those kind of things.

1518
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:06,760
 And there will be moments when I am in a real goofball mood and some days Ann is like enough,

1519
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:07,760
 enough.

1520
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,880
 And she will say she was sometimes just to say, you got to stop here and make me cry.

1521
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:16,840
 And I'll be like, OK, because I don't mean to because I think it's and then but then

1522
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:22,600
 sometimes really hard because that's when I know, oh, God, this is really funny.

1523
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:23,980
 She hates this.

1524
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:24,980
 This is amazing.

1525
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:28,560
 And so that's when you know that the shields are down.

1526
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,760
 That's what it's a combination of things.

1527
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,360
 So I have to be very careful.

1528
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:36,880
 I understand that I wield a certain power and I need to respect it.

1529
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,440
 But for the most part, I will.

1530
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:46,000
 There are few things funnier than the true flash of rage in the eyes of somebody that

1531
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
 you love.

1532
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
 Oh, my God.

1533
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
 Oh, my God.

1534
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,640
 I will say that this is one I'm going to I'm going to give out a posthumous shout out.

1535
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:55,160
 Many of you guys listen to Geek Shock.

1536
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,160
 Yeah.

1537
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:02,000
 Shout out to the Geek Shock boys and big ups to 80s Jeff, who is no longer with us anymore.

1538
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,920
 We lost 80s Jeff last year.

1539
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,440
 Broke my heart.

1540
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,440
 That's real commitment.

1541
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:10,600
 80s Jeff was the butt of a lot of my shit.

1542
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:18,560
 If you listen to those, even just those episodes, one of the worst was he came over.

1543
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:25,640
 He came over to the we would gather up after Trek almost every I don't know, every three

1544
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,640
 nights or so.

1545
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:30,680
 And we'd all be playing video games and watching anime and just acting a fool.

1546
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,400
 And this is after you all watch Star Trek together.

1547
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,040
 All that kind of stuff.

1548
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:37,200
 Just doing very nerdy things in somebody's house.

1549
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:41,840
 And there's like, okay, cookie, eight or 10.

1550
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:42,840
 Very nerdy.

1551
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,820
 Eight or 10 people playing cookie cookie.

1552
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:46,480
 Oh, my God.

1553
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,480
 80s Jeff had a habit whenever.

1554
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:52,080
 That is a case of pink eye waiting to happen.

1555
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:56,840
 Whenever he walked into a room, whenever he walked into a room, it didn't matter what

1556
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:57,880
 was going on.

1557
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:01,680
 If something was playing on the TV, he'd be like, what the hell is this?

1558
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:02,840
 That was his go to thing.

1559
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,680
 He just, what the hell is this?

1560
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:05,680
 Just didn't matter.

1561
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,680
 He could have been something he kind of knew.

1562
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:07,680
 Could have been something he hadn't.

1563
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,160
 Just, what the hell is this?

1564
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:12,580
 And we all made it, he always says, what the hell is this?

1565
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:17,200
 And so, finally, there was this, I can't remember exactly what the anime was, but it was this

1566
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:24,320
 moment of these samurai looking guys and gals and very traditional kimono garb and all these

1567
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,320
 things.

1568
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,960
 And these sakura flower petals are falling all down the ground.

1569
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,760
 And he's like, what the hell is this?

1570
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,920
 And I go, it's your wedding.

1571
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:32,920
 And he goes, what?

1572
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:37,200
 And I go, this is footage from your wedding.

1573
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,400
 And he says, what the hell are you talking about?

1574
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:42,040
 And some of my friends start laughing.

1575
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,600
 And I go, yeah, man, this is your wedding.

1576
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:45,600
 This is your upcoming nuptials.

1577
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,520
 And he says, what do you mean?

1578
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,480
 And then people really start laughing.

1579
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:52,120
 And I go, yeah, this is Jeff's wedding.

1580
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,680
 We got this on tape already.

1581
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,680
 He's like, what are you talking about?

1582
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:55,680
 That's not funny.

1583
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,680
 What are you talking about?

1584
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:57,680
 I'm not married.

1585
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,680
 What are you, that's not, and then everybody's like--

1586
01:02:58,680 --> 01:02:59,680
 Because Jeff was not married.

1587
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:03,340
 And then everybody starts to really lose their shit because he gets that angry.

1588
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:04,340
 He gets angry.

1589
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:05,340
 He's like, what do you mean?

1590
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:06,340
 My wedding.

1591
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:07,840
 And we're like, no, it's your wedding, dude.

1592
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:08,840
 This is your wedding.

1593
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:09,840
 What are you, that's not funny.

1594
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,160
 And then everybody is just fucking losing their minds.

1595
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,840
 There's nothing better than when somebody starts shouting, it's not funny.

1596
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,200
 Yeah, what's funny about it?

1597
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:21,440
 And this goes for an hour of bullshit back and forth until he's just like, fuck you guys.

1598
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,440
 Fuck you guys.

1599
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:23,440
 I'm not getting married.

1600
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,440
 Fuck you guys.

1601
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,440
 Fuck you guys.

1602
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:26,440
 This is not my wedding.

1603
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:27,440
 Fuck you.

1604
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:33,160
 And then to this day, to this day, you go up to one of the geek shop crew.

1605
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,160
 You want to get them going.

1606
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,800
 You say, hey, Jeff's wedding.

1607
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:39,520
 And we all just fucking fall out, just Jeff's wedding.

1608
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,920
 We all fucking lose our shit.

1609
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:46,560
 But there came a time when we could not say it anymore.

1610
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,560
 That's great.

1611
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:48,560
 Around him.

1612
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:49,560
 Magic the Gathering.

1613
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,800
 I lost casual friends to a bit.

1614
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,080
 Oh, oh.

1615
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,080
 Yeah.

1616
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,640
 So I was in my comedy group, Possible Side Effects.

1617
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,800
 We loved doing bits.

1618
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:58,800
 I loved doing bits.

1619
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,320
 Part of why I wanted to do a podcast with Paul in the first place was that I was like,

1620
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:05,600
 I want to keep doing bits all the time.

1621
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,640
 And I loved, and I hated when improv theaters, when they police bits, like, oh, you guys

1622
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:09,640
 are doing a bunch of bits.

1623
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:10,640
 I'm like, shut up.

1624
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,640
 This is my love language.

1625
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:12,640
 And let me do bits.

1626
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,640
 Yeah.

1627
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:17,640
 And I was walking, we were visiting friends in Boston, and I was walking on the sidewalk.

1628
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:20,600
 It was like, it was definitely like a not, it was not a jovial mood.

1629
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:21,600
 Just calmly walking.

1630
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:22,600
 Yeah.

1631
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,080
 And I go, oh, man, this is getting hard.

1632
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:25,960
 And the guy was like, what?

1633
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,040
 I was like, I'm Dr. Sam Beckett.

1634
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,880
 And I leapt into Matt's body.

1635
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:35,800
 And I am trying left and right to figure out, like, what wrong to right to, like, leap out

1636
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:40,560
 of this fucking body.

1637
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:44,520
 And my comedy group was like, like, yes.

1638
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:48,960
 And they just would grill me about being Sam Beckett.

1639
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,080
 And I would have to start answering questions like, oh, shit, and I started answering questions

1640
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:56,960
 of Sam Beckett, who leapt into Matt Donnelly's body to right wrongs in his life.

1641
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:02,600
 And so whenever my comedy friends were bored at a party, and I'd said anything, one of

1642
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,960
 them would just go like, whatever, you're not even Matt, and I'd be like, all right,

1643
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:06,960
 let's not.

1644
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,720
 And I would commit to being Sam Beckett immediately.

1645
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:15,080
 And I'd answer questions of Sam Beckett, who leapt into Matt's body for years, for years.

1646
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:20,520
 If it came up, I would never not be Dr. Sam Beckett if they brought it up.

1647
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:24,720
 And it ruined people I was hitting on.

1648
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,000
 It ruined, like, just casual friendships.

1649
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,760
 Wait, you'd be hitting on somebody and one of your friends would go over there and ask

1650
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:30,760
 Sam Beckett a question.

1651
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,840
 I'd be like, we're going fucking Sam Beckett, I'm cockblocking Matt.

1652
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:36,960
 And I would just be like, oh, I'm sorry, I don't want to get the wrong foot with you,

1653
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:37,960
 but I am.

1654
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:38,960
 I should confess that I am Sam Beckett.

1655
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:43,960
 I am Sam Beckett and I love to act.

1656
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:47,000
 And I, I mean, we did the bit for like a decade.

1657
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
 I don't, I never stopped, like, I never, I don't know when we stopped doing it, but I

1658
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
 would never not do it.

1659
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:56,440
 What a checkmate move when somebody's just trying to, like, lay some game and then just

1660
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:02,640
 be like, oh, wow, I guess my only options are, do I explain quantum leap to them?

1661
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:08,840
 Like, I remember my buddy Steve Buck on Neutrino, he would do a thing called Bitbot, give me

1662
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,240
 a quarter and I'll do a bit.

1663
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:13,600
 And this drove improvisers crazy.

1664
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:18,440
 And then I would just get out an invisible quarter every time, like, no, I was like,

1665
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,320
 you guys are watching the best bit in the world.

1666
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:26,160
 He'll do a bit on anything, I would sell Bitbot and I just fucking loved it.

1667
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:31,240
 I would say as I got older, I guess I'm not as super major bit crazy, but when I get in

1668
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:32,780
 the groove, I love it.

1669
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:37,880
 And my wife and I met doing improv, so we do fucking really filthy, disgusting bits

1670
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:43,520
 all the time and, and like really say like really next level, like offensive things to

1671
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,280
 each other.

1672
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,320
 And it's so fun because it's like almost like a game of chicken with each other sometimes

1673
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,560
 and it is a love language and I do love it.

1674
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:52,560
 Yeah.

1675
01:06:52,560 --> 01:07:00,720
 I will, my wife might not like me personally, like, like because I will just run fucking

1676
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:04,680
 bits that aren't funny, like I could repeat them to you, like they're not even clever

1677
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:11,640
 or interesting, but they make her mad and that makes me happy.

1678
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:14,280
 Does your, does your wife think you are a funny person?

1679
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:25,400
 I suspect that she does, but she's very fucking loathe to give me any hint that like she will

1680
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,000
 suppress laughter.

1681
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
 She will turn her face away.

1682
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
 She will give it to you.

1683
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
 You won't give me that point.

1684
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
 Oh no, that's SJ.

1685
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,480
 SJ will not laugh at me at home.

1686
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,480
 Really?

1687
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:34,480
 Don't give me that point.

1688
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,480
 SJ is like, go fuck yourself.

1689
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:42,120
 No, cause she knows that if she laughs, she's going to hear that fucking joke for the rest

1690
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:48,360
 of her life, like she knows the ones that are sticky and she's like, like I can't tell

1691
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:49,360
 you that's clever.

1692
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:53,520
 I can't tell you that's interesting or else it will just be repeated right before we go

1693
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:59,040
 to sleep for the rest of her fucking natural days and, and she is right.

1694
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,040
 Yeah.

1695
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:01,040
 No, no, no.

1696
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,040
 Yeah.

1697
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,040
 She's absolutely correct.

1698
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:04,560
 She is dead right.

1699
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:05,560
 100%.

1700
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:13,120
 I mean, Brian, I know, I know Bonnie likes you because you're thin, but does she like

1701
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,120
 you?

1702
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,120
 Oh, Matt.

1703
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,120
 Good news.

1704
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:22,160
 Bonnie just texted me and she said, I don't know why, but I like Matt a little more right

1705
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,160
 now.

1706
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:24,160
 Yeah.

1707
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,160
 Yeah.

1708
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,160
 Trim it up a little bit.

1709
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,160
 All right.

1710
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:28,160
 No, I actually have good news from the future.

1711
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:30,160
 Cause your kids are how old?

1712
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,160
 10 and 12.

1713
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:32,160
 Yeah.

1714
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:36,240
 Cause there are families that do music and they'll just naturally the kids grow up and

1715
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:38,480
 they just learn to harmonize instantly.

1716
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:42,840
 It is a fucking blast when, when you have teenagers who have grown up where just naturally

1717
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:47,960
 bits are ongoing and you understand the importance of setting up a runner and all that stuff.

1718
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:54,280
 And it's those to be honest, I was really hoping that Josie didn't want to go to college

1719
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:58,540
 and instead would sneak out to be the surprise guest at scoop fest.

1720
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:02,720
 But it's like, she is objectively the coolest of all her friends and I am certain it's because

1721
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:05,240
 of all the ongoing bits and her natural understanding.

1722
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,240
 So yes.

1723
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,240
 I highly recommend.

1724
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:10,120
 Oh, you tell Josie anytime she wants to come to scoop fest, call me.

1725
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:11,120
 Yeah.

1726
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,120
 And she can just come to scoop fest.

1727
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:13,480
 Tell dad to stay home.

1728
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:14,480
 Yeah.

1729
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:15,480
 Yeah.

1730
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:16,480
 Yeah.

1731
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:17,480
 No.

1732
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:18,480
 Yeah.

1733
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,480
 Doing bits with kids.

1734
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:20,480
 My kids is awesome.

1735
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:21,480
 Yeah.

1736
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:22,480
 Thank you very much.

1737
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:24,340
 If you hear Max, this is the one that I want people to boo him.

1738
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:29,680
 If you hear Max say that he kicks children for a living because he's a martial arts instructor,

1739
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:30,680
 it's a stupid joke.

1740
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:31,680
 And I've heard it for eight years.

1741
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:32,680
 Boo him.

1742
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:33,680
 Boo him.

1743
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:39,280
 Max, you keep kicking those kids for a living.

1744
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:44,880
 I know we have a lot of bit people in our audience and I do.

1745
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:45,880
 I love it.

1746
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:46,880
 I love seeing.

1747
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,080
 I love seeing the bit game over our audience.

1748
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,080
 I love Max.

1749
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,520
 Max actually hopped in one of my shows in New York and like I literally was like, Hey,

1750
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,460
 I need a punch line for this magic trick.

1751
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:55,960
 Let's do this at this point of the show.

1752
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,960
 And it was so awkward and doesn't help.

1753
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:58,960
 It was so random.

1754
01:09:58,960 --> 01:09:59,960
 And he just did it.

1755
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:00,960
 And then he crushed.

1756
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:01,960
 It was awesome.

1757
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:02,960
 Thank you, Max for helping in my show.

1758
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:03,960
 Oh, we got two more here.

1759
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:04,960
 We've got to wrap it up.

1760
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:05,960
 We got Bobo Bobo the flound.

1761
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:06,960
 Talk about commitment.

1762
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:07,960
 Yeah.

1763
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:08,960
 I don't know what you're talking about.

1764
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:09,960
 All right.

1765
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:12,960
 Oh, wait, you guys not see this person dressed up in front of the microphone.

1766
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:13,960
 What is objective reality?

1767
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:14,960
 No, no.

1768
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:15,960
 Back to that one.

1769
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:16,960
 Is it just a microphone?

1770
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:17,960
 Just a microphone.

1771
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:18,960
 Jesus Christ.

1772
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:23,960
 I don't know why no one would take a microphone.

1773
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,800
 This is a microphone right there.

1774
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:29,120
 I actually have Gilbert Godfrey doing the voice for me in the background right now.

1775
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,960
 I'm actually just doing it silently.

1776
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:31,960
 All right.

1777
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:37,760
 So my question on to you is, where do you draw the line in the sand for a comedian to

1778
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:38,760
 clown?

1779
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:42,920
 Because you'll have like prop comic, you'll have physical comics, but they're not necessarily

1780
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:43,920
 a clown.

1781
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,960
 So where do you draw that line in the sand?

1782
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:46,960
 Oh, interesting.

1783
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:51,120
 Because I definitely have a line in my mind, but I don't know where it is.

1784
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:58,720
 So maybe I have a weird perspective on this, but if you have a physical skill, I put clowning

1785
01:10:58,720 --> 01:10:59,720
 above comedian.

1786
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:00,720
 Oh, I do too.

1787
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:01,720
 It's ancient.

1788
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:02,720
 Yeah.

1789
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:03,720
 Not that old.

1790
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:04,720
 Clowning is just ancient.

1791
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:05,720
 You are.

1792
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:06,720
 Okay.

1793
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:07,720
 The questioner is ancient.

1794
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:14,720
 Oh, I mean, the truth is off the bat, I don't have an answer.

1795
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:17,120
 This is not something I've contemplated before.

1796
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:20,120
 I definitely do, as you bring it up, I do see a difference in it.

1797
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:25,440
 It is a blend of intellectualism and physical comedy, but yeah, I don't know where that

1798
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,440
 line is.

1799
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:31,680
 And there is, it's weird because I definitely have a real line in my head between people

1800
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:36,840
 in my life that are comedians and people who are clowns and I don't know exactly what that

1801
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,400
 line is.

1802
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,600
 It might be self-identifying, I'm really not sure.

1803
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:45,560
 I will say, I don't know artistically, but just in the difference between clowns and

1804
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:51,360
 comedians that I have met in my life, they are very different people.

1805
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,360
 Yes.

1806
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,360
 Oh, always.

1807
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:54,360
 In general.

1808
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:59,760
 Like a comedian, once you've been around people who've done comedy, there's an archetype,

1809
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:07,160
 kind of brooding, there's little buttons and love languages that you can understand.

1810
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:12,600
 Clowns are far more like carnies and renaissance fair people where there's a fucking tough

1811
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:15,480
 as nails element to clowns.

1812
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,920
 There is a, you can't phase them.

1813
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:23,560
 Yeah, but also it's like, maybe there's a dark secret.

1814
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:24,560
 I don't know.

1815
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:28,320
 There's an element, usually comedians' dark secret is that they didn't get along with

1816
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,320
 their mom.

1817
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:30,320
 Right.

1818
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:37,120
 I'm shooting off a hip here, but I think comedians, you tend to like their perspective

1819
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,320
 on things.

1820
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:42,240
 You kind of like want to know a comedian's perspective before you kind of laugh at their

1821
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:48,200
 jokes and clowns seem to like want to make what's ever happening an event that's happening

1822
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,200
 like right now.

1823
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:57,200
 Well, even presentationally, like presentationally, clowns kind of remove your ability as an audience

1824
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,160
 to look into the performer, right?

1825
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:02,960
 Like the performance is its own thing.

1826
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:03,960
 It is very loud.

1827
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:04,960
 It is big.

1828
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:05,960
 It is in your face.

1829
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:10,760
 It's not like somebody telling a story about, you know, breaking up with somebody and people

1830
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:15,960
 in the audience are like, wow, that makes me think of that experience that I went through.

1831
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:21,640
 It's very performance focused, which almost makes it harder because now you don't have

1832
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:26,760
 a little bit of the emotional buy-in that can make art kind of like special and magical

1833
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,040
 if it hits.

1834
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:33,640
 But if it's, you know, a cloud act, then you are looking at physical reaction.

1835
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:39,080
 You're looking at, you know, athleticism, timing, like all the the basic building blocks.

1836
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:48,840
 This got fucking deep into comedy, but it's important for our it's important for our legacy.

1837
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:49,840
 That's true.

1838
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:50,840
 That's true.

1839
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:54,660
 I wanted to hit an eject button for me.

1840
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:55,660
 Thank you.

1841
01:13:55,660 --> 01:13:56,880
 That was actually very insightful.

1842
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:57,880
 Can I tell you a joke?

1843
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:58,880
 Yes.

1844
01:13:58,880 --> 01:13:59,880
 Go ahead.

1845
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:00,880
 All right.

1846
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:01,880
 Why do Catholic priests touch little boys?

1847
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:02,880
 Why?

1848
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:03,880
 Because they can't get none.

1849
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:04,880
 Ah, okay.

1850
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:05,880
 All right.

1851
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:06,880
 There it is.

1852
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:07,880
 Mystery solved.

1853
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:15,760
 I'm now regretting following that.

1854
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,760
 I don't know why.

1855
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:26,920
 You guys and the conversation I have, oh, sorry, Shula scoop, there is this fucking

1856
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:27,920
 liar.

1857
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,880
 This popped into my brain after something you said in the conversation I was having

1858
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,000
 back there.

1859
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:42,960
 When I was in college, one of my friends in theater, I was in theater at the time, whenever

1860
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:49,040
 he would go to his room to masturbate, he would tell everybody he was going to get ice

1861
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:50,040
 cream.

1862
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:59,160
 So, like I said, short, but that was all I had to say.

1863
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,160
 That's great.

1864
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:02,800
 That's a good bit.

1865
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:03,800
 I loved it.

1866
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:04,800
 10 out of 10.

1867
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:05,800
 No question.

1868
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:06,800
 Yeah.

1869
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:07,800
 It was great.

1870
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:08,800
 That's fantastic.

1871
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:09,800
 That's it.

1872
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:10,800
 On that note, I think it's time for me to go get some ice cream.

1873
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:11,800
 Yeah.

1874
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:12,800
 I'm going to go get some ice cream.

1875
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,920
 Hey, Justin, you want to go get some ice cream together?

1876
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:15,920
 I'd love it.

1877
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:16,920
 Let's go.

1878
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:17,920
 Two scoops.

1879
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:18,920
 Two.

1880
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:19,920
 Okay.

1881
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:20,920
 All right.

1882
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:21,920
 Give it up for Brian Breschwood.

1883
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:22,920
 Hey, guys.

1884
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:25,920
 Give it up for Justin Robert Young.

1885
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:29,200
 Give it up for all y'all for coming out to ScoopFest.

1886
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,200
 We appreciate it so much.

1887
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,200
 Yeah.

1888
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:32,200

1889
