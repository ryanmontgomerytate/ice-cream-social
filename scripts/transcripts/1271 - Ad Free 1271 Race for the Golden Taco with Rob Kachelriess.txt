It's me. Jake of the audio guy. We're preaching fun. Yeah, this is week Three for me where we've had snow and I can't go out It's fucking freezing cold and I can't go out and clean up the backyard from the dog poop and with four dogs Pooping all the time. It's a lot of dog poop And so when I go out to do anything in the yard like change up birdseed or anything that Anne needs me to do So I try to stay the hell out of the backyard when there's nothing but dog poop and it's freezing I have to come back in and spend another 10 minutes cleaning my shoes off from all the skank that gets on my shoes I'm trying super careful. I try to dodge it like landmines. I can't miss it You have there's an amount of dog poop in your backyard that it is impossible for you to walk around it It's close because they like that area that leads right up. Oh, it's one spot. It's kind of makes more kind of a zone Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. No, the entirety of my backyard is not filled with dog shit I was like, holy Jesus. How often are you cleaning? I'm cleaning every week, but this is two weeks in a row I haven't been able to so right. It's a lot. It's a backup, but it's also frozen So what are you gonna do? I got to invest in some new fucking boots But yeah, here I am start a business of frozen dog poop pickup for other people's houses Gross. Yeah. No, thanks. Did I tell you guys actually had a couple kids come by Back when we got our first like three inch hit and they just rang the doorbell. Hey, can we clean your driveway? I'll be a three inch hit right now He said can we clean your driveway off for a little bit of money? I said hey house 20 bucks They're like, let's get it. Let's do it and they did it and it saved my fucking hole It's like this is amazing. This is America I'm telling you this is what it's all about But here I am freezing my took us off and then I read Vegas is having record high temperatures Oh record highs. Yes. So while you're in the middle of a triple volt polar vortex, yes is Which is a very rare event, but it's caused all of the Arctic atmosphere to move to send upon your your town To send upon rural, Pennsylvania. We are slowly building an El Nino over here Which is creating warming temperatures and bringing them over here to create one of the most warm and dry Decembers in Vegas history. Yeah, it's the combo you want. Yeah So this this Saturday love it dry El Nino or El Nino. I forget which one creates it warm El Nino versus the polar vortex the battle for the century Ding ding ding ding ding. Let's go warm and dry was actually the original name of Matt Mattingly and it is the primary designation for the kind of sex robot you want That is, you know, the first and foremost. Is it warm and dry? Just torso and just torso warm and dry torso by Matt. I Just I just got back from my kids Christmas concert and I say concert because Basically say my air quotes. Yes, because there's a music program and a couple things one is that this year out of nowhere someone started a Cheerleading program at the school to teach kids how to cheer. I Thought you're gonna during the showcase. There was some kind of We're sitting there go music go music go I don't know. So that's it. So they never have had a cheerleading program for no No, no, no, but it's important to teach coeds first through fifth grade. I believe it was all girls in it I did not see a boy in it. They were gonna they were gonna make it coed But they decided that Matt's son would be too good Another thing as soon as they say they didn't wanna. Yeah. Well Keelers the kid cheer captain now, right? I mean Cool Kiela's going up on you Paul Kiela's grown up on you, buddy He's not in that school anymore. Kiela is gonna come back and be the coach. He's in a different school Yeah, oh no, baby's baby's getting old I got it wrong is that yeah La Nina not El Nino Nina yeah. Yeah, is that a Directional wind Declination, what's the difference? I'll give you a directional wind What is a Madonna title right? Yeah, it's like El Nino. Yeah and so before Before the concert was to begin we had to do 15 minutes of just watching them do cheers for cheering sake Do cheering was it at least Christmas theme cheers. Nope Children just go like you know be aggressive be aggressive. Yes Like just watch that for 15 minutes. I would categorize this as like a sneak attack, right? Like the parents are gathered Yeah, no one knows about this shooting program of audience This is a violation of the Geneva Convention and then I'm like, but I got you guys all hyped up, right? I mean Look at him he's high Look how high he is sweaty Sped walk 25 minutes home. I was so pumped. I Think this thing is working Yeah, you're right. You're right. Cuz basically once once that bumped the concert time. I was like well now I'm not gonna make ice cream social on time I was like basically I waited the one part that I knew my kid had watched it and was like snuck out the Back and then great was like I'm gonna walk home so that my wife can see the whole thing It took me a really long time to figure out that your text said that you were that you had to ditch your wife Yeah, yeah, it didn't say you had to ditch your wife. It said he had the I know I Know that's yeah That's why I'm so happy for your wife and that's why I put exclamation points because he said you had to dick Sarah Oh my goodness Sorry, I'm running late getting back the concert ran long I had dick Sarah We understand right there because we understood your context clues, but it's still very funny Yeah, I even put a capital D on there. Look at that Man you put a capital D on that all the marriage is anything like mine when that happens. It's capital D kind of day I mean we're getting close to the holidays so we're due but we'll see That's fucking great, yes, so Who am I kidding everyone goes over the holidays we can't but But So then they go to this this music program right where they they sing some songs But then they also do this thing. This is like some innovation. They had a few years ago and What happens is they do a great of writing storytelling time you Know Sounds terrible already. So then they select like three or four I guess I don't know ten it just it felt like it felt like a million, but I stayed for four These stories that the kids have written together There are Christmas themed stories and all the instruments on stage instead of creating songs for the Christmas concert creates sound effects for the Oh, that's the worst I'm watching some avant-garde Children's Foley exercise do they intentionally add lots of sound effects to the stories? See I did this as a little kid I think I've told you guys this before my dad wrote a program on our Atari 400 that was sound effects Okay, and you can play all kinds of different sound effects through the program And so I recorded myself a story about mr. T and Lee majors going to space yes, and I used all those sound effects As a young aspiring radio guy and Foley artist myself Well don't get me wrong. I loved doing Foley stuff, too And I liked doing it with friends as well. I don't think it should be done for 200 parents But i'm sure the comedy and timing of it was just spot on And I don't know if maybe seven demos is worth the idea of showing off this Foley expertise Oh boy Maybe pair it down to one or two of the best ones and then present those they did seven different stories Yeah, well they did more how long a story I did I did they're like five minutes six minutes What yes, that's too much No, you do a story than a cheer a story than a cheer a story than a cheer break it up figure it out Three christmas songs and seven stories. That's what you get here christmas songs. What were the christmas songs negotiation went worse than ukraine and russia This is a very terrible negotiation happening Well, it's okay israel's gonna pay for it. That's right Um, yeah, what were the christmas? Oh, uh, well first like oh christmas tree Uh, okay was it oh christmas tree was an old honing ball. I have issues with uh, oh hanukkah Oh hanukkah, let's light the menor that song Wait, what they do a version of a christmas tree. That's oh hanukkah There's another song called like oh hanukkah. Oh hanukkah. We light the menor Oh hanukkah, you guys don't even know the song i'm talking about. No, no Okay, I think this is a children's school song that has that has come up to Include everybody it's abominable I mean like the snowman it is like it seems like it was inspired by someone like Uh a fever fever chopping wood. It was like the melody they came up with for it. It was like No And and I guess it's like the first songs that was like first included But like when christian schools were like, I guess we have to sing hanukkah songs And they've included this about it. Uh, leon can stop and chat. Yes. This is about israel Um Listen you can't say that the jewish people run show business and then also put out that terrible song you can't have it both ways Either you're in charge of everyone's beautiful music career. You can come up with a better melody than uh Uh than that there there are there are other beautiful hanukkah They just don't want mariah carey running away with all the publishing rights. That's all Uh, but uh, yeah, so Um, it's it's it's it's a terrible song and they sing it or I guess yell it or shout it It doesn't there's no way to unshout it. It's just shouting That's just do they play instruments too or the kids just sing it. They play instruments, too Okay, that makes it worse. It does make it worse and um, yeah And and like it might as well like be done to like like the ramones like they might as well have like a punk drummer just driving the whole they don't do like klezmer and and Jews harp and all that kind of thing they have every instrument out there paul Uh, I don't know if they're all done in a way that makes it satisfying to the year Somewhat more authentically Authentically jewish in nature of these there's marimbas and chimes and wood instruments and all kinds of stuff out there It's a couple laptops chimes trying to get all beastie boys on it Laptops open a couple laptops going on They're running tape He got straight up djs djs on the wheels of steel the ones and twos. Yep but I was like what kind of avant-garde artsy shit am I watching? There is nothing that makes me want to have kids less than uh than children's musical events. Oh I oh it's the worst dance concerts concert concerts all of it. It's just terrible Oh, this is and this is just just and this is just for the parents People who don't have kids won't get this but uh going to see different productions kids productions is torture enough But uh, if you kind of don't plan it correctly and you don't realize it but you go in the last one Oh, it's a huge mistake What do you mean at the end of the last one?

So the guy who walked me into that trap We joked and we we ended up sat down with them We had a little wine him and his wife two doctors in town And uh, and I said if I win this raffle, I I obviously will will refuse to to take it I will I will I'll yield it back to the store. I didn't qualify properly for it. I just give I can't possibly everyone know like any cheapskate can win one of those What is that a coffee mug give me that give me that outrageous this is for people who won a good uh, uh Good cabernet. I'm sorry, sir. This is for customers not freeloaders But I did I met uh I also had another awkward interaction there. I was there and uh, I looked at this, uh woman Oh, that's awkward and I looked at her name tag and I was like I said you'd look familiar and she goes. Oh shit She got me like a weird look. She's like What like what and I was like I don't know. I was like basically like do you want to help me out here kind of like do I familiar to you? There's the regular dance of do I look familiar to it? And she goes you're probably gonna say I look like a singer. I go. Oh well Okay, I you know I work in town, you know Showbiz maybe maybe uh, maybe I think she's cross paths and she goes. Yeah. No, i'm not that singer I'm not even a singer I And then like went away like half annoyed And I What a weirdy and I said like she went away as half of a domino's advertisement from the 80s The person next to me I was like I didn't even bring up the singer part She did I only said yes to the singing part because I thought we were trying to figure out how we knew each other I thought you were helping me out He's like no, you just think every black woman's a singer. Go fuck yourself. You racist is basically what? Happened there. Ah, that's what it was. Yeah So we did not hit it off That was I I one strike on the socializing for the for the uh for the city cast vegas outing there Oh, that's and that is too bad because that is the person that we brought in today to uh interview for this Hello. Hello miss. Uh, you so you you met matt donnelly last night. Did you oh no? Yes And and you did not care for your interaction with matt donnelly Hey, are we actually recording on this? Oh, we're recording right now, buddy Okay, let's do this. I'm here. Am I sounding okay on this? That's rob we're doing it we're in the middle of a bit but rob rob is here um Rob, I was just talking about being at city cast les vegas social gathering last night and we're already rolling I know I could sense the excitement in your voice as you Recall the big event. That's what that was I will say i'm gonna burn you guys right now you guys handed out conversation starters last night To people as they walked in We sure did and I am laughing because I have inside information on your company That you guys are allowed to be a little political but you're not supposed to be like a politically leaning podcast organization, right? Uh, we we get feedback every now and then from upper management as well as the audience What I like to say is city cast is for everyone if you love las vegas or love to trash las vegas either way We have a home for you great officially welcome rob from city cast las vegas. Thank you And uh, hey las vegas newsletter editor and I appear occasionally on the podcast Yeah, just to clarify absolutely you do a great job on both your newsletter is outstanding I think you do an amazing newsletter I think some of my favorite things uh that you guys make the nevada independent and the las vegas review journal Look like you might as well just light dog poop on fire and ring their doorbells. You're embarrassing them You are embarrassing them. Well, we we link to them sometimes so we got we got a tip ahead to them You know, we just kind of like to collect what everyone's talking about add a little bit of our own stew to the mix And or mix to the stew either way, but um, it's we slide into your inbox at 6 a.m Every morning and give you a quick look at what's going on in vegas. So here is the uh, Everyone loves las vegas icebreaker. You guys hated me when I came with a party last night. Okay, great What's should we should we have the conversation based on this card now? This card says what's your ethical responsibility as a citizen when you believe your country is acting immorally. That's your casual Icebreaker for me to just talk to any citizen of las vegas That is a literal few people That's a literal icebreaker They have to switch out today Some did yes, I don't want to talk about those nature Rob this doesn't have to be a god-chosen journalism moment, but this has david figler written all over it. This is figler all over it I think it was more like um, we have what we call a membership team That helps us organize these events because it was for city cast neighbors. That's our our membership group. That's right And uh, you know, we were kind of worried because some of these people, you know They want to get out and about they want to meet new people. So we don't want it to be You know awkward so sometimes, you know We had a couple games out like uno and stuff But nobody even had to open them because everyone was naturally organically making conversation and mingling So it's true the icebreaker card was part of that and I think a few people used it But not everybody did but it's a good way just to welcome people and get them thinking about something straight off the bed it was uh It was a landmine and the people that I met but uh, we moved on anyway So you did get some intel and asked the question to it I did I did fitting off with uh with two doctors, uh last night, uh, daniel and christine, I think Uh, okay last night. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, they're doctors and uh I'll vouch for them. Yeah. Yeah, and they did it. There's always someone's about there. I just say yes, I mean Uh, if we're not for your newsletter rob, I wouldn't know things like the taco bell ultra run Which is coming up in a couple of weeks here Actually, it's coming up saturday saturday. Oh, it's the saturday. All right It's not too soon It's uh where people run from summerland to henderson and stop by seven taco bells And have to eat a taco bell menu item at each stop. Oh, no You know, I and then run some more One of the things we do at city cast vegas is we do events we compile events and it's kind of like a guide To the week and I was coming across this thing called the taco bell ultra marathon I'm like that looks boring some another marathon sponsored by some Corporate entity and then I looked at it and this isn't sponsored by anybody at all. This isn't official It's a grassroots thing that um A person came up with who was in an organization here locally called. I believe the las vegas slow runners so, you know, there are people who want to be out and about but it's kind of like all skills and Uh all skill levels welcome And the whole idea is you start at a taco bell In summerland you end up at a taco bell in henderson and you stop at five others along the way This is more than 30 miles. This is why I didn't feel this was a real event I'm like, yeah like this is a joke for people who don't know henderson and summerland are on opposite sides of the city Of las vegas they they are they are two just neighborhoods basically on the east and west sides of the city It's not even easy to run between the two takes a while. Yes Oh driving between the two is a nightmare running between the two full of taco bell seems like a hellscape Right. So there's there's some guide guidelines and even experienced runners. I did talk to someone involved So I knew this was legit and they're like, you know, i'm a runner myself This will probably take me like eight hours. Some people may be five some people may be longer But also I think some of the participants might just do like two or three taco bells I think the real serious ones are the ones who are like doing the whole thing I'm a taco bell 5k guy. I'm not a taco bell seven taco bell running guy I can I think run from one to the other and then call it a day But you have to eat something different at each taco bell. You can't repeat and then you have to eat the whole menu item Yes, and you can't run with it. You have to finish it and then go You can't just eat like a bite of a taco and then head out. You got to eat the whole taco Exactly, and um, also there's a 15 minute penalty added to your time if you throw up Wow This is a real rule That's fine. There is a 15 minute in this race There is a 15 minute penalty for that in life. There is a much bigger penalty for it if you don't throw up though No If it wants to come out let it come out Please do Hi And again just to let you guys know city cast is legit I reached out to the slow runners and the person's person's personal Instagram page trying to get them on today's podcast and could not reach them But you got you got the interview you got that you got the facts Uh there. Yeah, so I ended up talking to someone who's actually making the official t-shirts So if you go on their website, they have an official t-shirt for this unofficial taco bell event. Holy smokes Um, one of the taco bells is right on the corner from my house You should just go and hang. I know I was like maybe just go cheer them on one of those tables with like cups Of water maybe there was water. That'd be a bucket ready for anyone who's ready to uh, you wouldn't bring wire 15 minutes You have 15 minute penalty buckets waiting for them Little cups of baja blast. That's what you gotta have ready There's a baja blast bonus Um, you can there's two bonuses One is you can add diablo sauce to everything and do a diablo sauce shooter at the end I think it's just drinking a packet fine fine And the second one is you have to commit to drinking at least two liters of baja blast Along the way over the seven locations So what's that equate to like four larges or something like that? It's about two liters. It's about half a dozen Vomits six. I think is what this was invented by someone who loves taco bell and hates running. There's no there's no, you know what this actually Happened in a couple other cities. Um, apparently this is an annual tradition in denver I think they're the first ones to come up with it and just a few weeks ago There was one in the dc area and just by coincidence the ceo of city cast david plotz He saw my story sent me a note and said his son ran in the dc version And completed it was in october I believe it was late november Okay Okay, great Maybe denver was october maybe I don't know the website I found says uh 50 kilometers nine taco bell meals Across dc. Whoa. Yeah, it's insane even worse than the uh, this one Yeah, oh man Uh 31.07 miles while stopping at nine taco bells There's not a single part of that that makes me want to do that And the idea is you wear costumes and kind of have fun with it sure and it's all a truss system, right? Yeah And you win a golden taco at the end if you're first, oh Oh, come on burying the league being a golden taco winner is pretty great Yeah, great I don't know what it is that goes that goes right on the intro to everything I do after that, you know No matter what i'm doing That should be um front page in the rj golden taco winner is yeah Yeah All right, and I don't know what it is I asked my contact who is part of this Um who's making the shirts and I said what is a golden taco and she said I don't know So it's a little bit of a surprise for whoever gets it. All right Uh rob I gave you uh, I gave you 12 hours. I gave you 12 hours notice on the spot To do a year-end round-up hours of sleep Yeah, yeah, exactly And he does last night I challenged you to come on here and I wanted uh, the top three under-reported vega stories for 2025 Yes, now when I asked you that the idea is popping your head right away or did you was it hard to come up with? Uh, no, because you also gave me um the option for uh, the five overall news stories of the year And I said well three sounds easier than five. So let's talk about that And I think my first option will make you groan. You'll be like you didn't put much into this But I want us to think about I want I want us to think about the uh the year So far looking back. It's been a it's one of those years. It kind of feels like Two years. It doesn't really feel like all this was one year lots been going on But what do we remember as the first do you guys remember what the first big news story of the year is? From okay January of 2025 Yes No, no I don't remember what the first new story of december. I guess this election shit Are we talking just vegas? Uh, maybe somewhat indirectly Just vegas, right? Just vegas. Yes. Yeah, i'm thinking From now i'm on the outside in pa now getting still I still have lots of feeds coming up My first thought goes to the boring company increasing their uh presence They uh, elon musk tunnel company. Yeah Okay, any any other um guesses I guess there was a bunch of protests stage in january, right? And we we have a bad we have a bad record with how we handle protests. Are we are we there? There's always a protest about something every day this story i'm going to give you a hint. Okay was explosive Explosive explosive news story. Oh was this the uh, the the tesla truck that blew up at trump's tower That's right. It happened people forget this it happened on january 1st Oh my god, 2025 new year's day Yeah, yeah Yeah This was the tesla cyber truck that the guy blew up Like in the valet parking area of the of the trump tower here in vegas and he was in it, right? Yeah he um Blew up along with the tesla. Um, he drove to be clear. He wasn't he didn't blow it up by accident He meant to blow it up. Yes. Yeah, this was an act of terrorism. This was an attack. Yeah Yeah, it wasn't like, you know the accelerator like right, you know Had a mishap I don't think they have those in teslas. Anyway, but um, yeah, so this guy drove from colorado springs rented the tesla And you know, he came pulled up. I think i'm learning right now that it was a rental I think i'm learning that right now facts. This is what you get from city cast. That's right details Yeah, I mean you're not gonna blow up your own tesla And you know replacing the batteries So if you do survive You know you want to yeah, that explains why somebody else's car my my rates at budget and hurts went up last year That explains it. I think this had something to do with it. Yes, he used toro. Do you know what toro? Oh, yes, you are. Oh, it's sort of like um And I know it's kind of like almost we thought about getting into this when it was brand new It's the uber of rentals. I think yeah You can like sort of like air b and b in your car, right? Yeah, that's car sharing that actually does make it more fucked up because everyone running a toro usually owns like one or two cars For toro, you know, it's basically like how we all can run our own rental car company So that means that people used to do this with the condos. Yeah So this means that person really did blow up someone else's like really that was a really expensive hundred thousand dollar Tesla cyber truck. It's kind of it's kind of like an extra fu, you know I'm gonna ruin this guy's car But yeah pulled up to the portico chair the valet and you know What I think is kind of under reported about this story is yeah got a lot of attention at the time but you know when The person responsible dies, you know, you don't really get to follow up on motives You don't really get to follow up on you know, what was behind this, right? And you know, there was sort of I mean the guy had a history in the special forces with the u.s army And you know, there were sort of like questions over his political leanings And if that had something to do with it or if he's just having You know a bad time in life and is coping with this and maybe had some mental health issues Sure, but the fact that you know, this is happening at the trump tower which You know coming right after a very contentious election and um The trump presidency was there some drama around that. I I missed that Yeah, you may have heard. Um the host was president again So I have not been following the news closely yeah, so um You know But it also makes you think about how easily it is for kind of what could be considered an act of terrorism to take place At a las vegas landmark, right? I mean pull up into a valet So you kind of wonder about okay What's happening since then to account for this kind of stuff to catch people before they take this kind of action? And how do you increase security? Remember there was that crash that happened in front of planet hollywood a few years back Yep, and and now because of that because they ran into tourists walking on the sidewalk now you have the You know the pillars the ballasts, I believe Yeah They're concrete ballasts that are along the along the sidewalk blocking off the the sidewalks from the road now Because the crash you're referring to is open. Yeah. Oh, yeah, they're they're everywhere now and they and they came up quick They grew out of the sidewalks Right, we gave birth and planted the seed and That's the company I should have started the ballast company. I would have made a fortune Yeah, I think especially in this town. So I mean vegas is always looking at ways to improve security The chat is yelling at us bollards. Yeah bollards not ballast ballast is at the bottom of a boat bollards Are the things on the side of the road? Yeah, it's not like my business's words or anything We'll edit this in post these microphones are decorative. Yeah So I thought that's a somewhat under-reported story mainly because it's been forgotten Yeah, you're right. I totally haven't thought about that forever and it happened in my own backyard and I didn't connect it to all of the bollards that are around Here or ballasts Or ballads for the people standing in front of buildings singing to make sure you don't crash your car. They just sing beautiful slow songs Matt she's not that singer. I don't know who you think So I have a second story that the second story kind of uh follows a similar theme we're gonna kind of go and and flow between one story and another but um Have you noticed anything about metro police this year? I mean, they're super nice and polite and don't give out a bunch of fuck you tickets Oh wait, no, i'm wrong Uh, they've handled uh, I think they've handled the arrest of some of our friends very well Do you know people have you had to bail out people? No, we're good friends with jimmy. Uh, sonina who had that terrible, uh, Uh, there you have protest. Yeah, you got arrested for some nonsense Yeah, right. Um, so, you know the one thing i've noticed about metro this year Which has gotten some attention, but I think it needs to get a little more attention. Okay, the way this fleet is expanding Um, just the technology they're using, um I think you may have seen the hoopla over their big cyber truck speaking of which cyber truck patrol fleet Yeah, some guy gave them a bunch of cyber trucks Yeah, and how much do you think those fleet of cyber trucks cost? Oh Oh gosh, I i bet with the retrofitting and stuff that they're doing to the cyber trucks They've got to be two hundred thousand dollars a piece, right? They got to have bulletproof, uh stuff in them I kind of 200 000 Elon musk tried to Speaking of things that we forgot about remember when elon musk, uh Debuted the cyber trucks and threw a big steel ball bearing at the back windows to show off the bulletproof glass And it wasn't bulletproof glass. So he just broke them on stage at the unveiling. I do remember that they just went Oh, well, yeah They were like oops and then they did it again on a different window. That one also wasn't bulletproof So he just broke two different windows give us 10 of those yeah, that's the ones for us So some guy bought a bunch of tesla cyber trucks for for las vegas metro police Uh, like right so like 10 or 15 of them This was nearly three million dollar donation from a tech investor uh ben horowitz who is With a venture capital firm, uh andersen horowitz. Oh, so good guy. Okay, and Yeah, but this isn't the first time he's donated to uh metro Do you uh, do you remember the other? Forgotten story this year of remember the guy who set tesla cars on fire at the at the dealership Yes, yes, which was like a protest right and he was caught but metro said, you know We wouldn't have caught him without some of this new technology We have specifically license plate readers that are now throughout the city And there's a there's about 180 of them At least at the time that we did the story and those cost about six million and who do you think paid for those? This guy horowitz Yeah, oh wow So this guy not get a lot of speeding tickets. What's going on with this? Mr. Horowitz person. Well now correct me if i'm wrong rob But are not the very legality of those devices still in contention? Um You I mean you can definitely make from a privacy standpoint. This is a privacy violation I mean, do you want to be tracked? You know your whereabouts going because that's how they work answer. No Okay, that that's the question answer interesting. Yeah but the way they sort of get around this is I believe they make the donation to um, sort of like a third party like fraternal order of police type of thing And then it kind of goes through that way You know if this guy was really in some kind of legal trouble What would happen right when you're donating millions and millions to make um you know metro police, um In theory more successful more like a uh an army unit But um, you know what happens if you commit some major felony, you know commit I'm not saying this guy's a bad guy at all. Maybe he's a great guy But you know, it works in some protection. It is weird, you know makes you it makes you pause. Yeah is there any other Motive like in other words like just just just spitballing I mean like like why would a guy spend over 10 million dollars to quote-unquote make the city safer? But basically to give tesla trucks and surveillance equipment to one city Uh, like what what's it? I don't understand anytime there's a side collection for him anytime. There's a data collection element That can be monetized. So he's not doing this out of the goodness of his heart There is money to be made with that license plate data. That's what i'm asking right? I don't know exactly. I don't know exactly what or is it even probably you could probably Here's what you can probably figure out a way to measure like cars um mileage and all that kind of thing there their mph Or mpg, uh, you know ratings and things like that What does the acidity of your armpits have to do with anything paul? I don't know It always has something to do with it balance for a man, but made for a lady Uh No, it's all it's all crazy. I I saw a tiktok recently where someone was talking about this very thing and It's not about the billionaires accumulating all this wealth at the end of the day Yes, that's kind of a sickness and a weird symptom of it all But the accumulation of the wealth is secondary to their end goal, which is becoming above the rules of normal society Right and how better to become above the rules of normal society Than by purchasing the people who enforce the rules of normal society I mean this literally is like like batman comic villain level. It is Right frightening where you're like, oh, I I just did a google search on this guy Uh, apparently he's opening a new nightclub in las vegas. It's called horowitz island island Uh, and apparently the police are just not paying any attention to it at all Okay, good good good The big the big the big uh innovation of the nightclub is that you you don't get carted at the door That's right They've got technology that allows you to not be carted at the door. It's basically a teen club It sure is I don't know the teens seem awfully old to be hanging out there Allegedly I'm sure is a great guy But it's not just cyber trucks. It's not just uh the license plate readers There's also a fleet of drones now. Oh, no, that's uh, mr Horowitz says the drones kill me well the the the city owned one day maybe yeah. Yeah, it's true That that's such a weird thing Oh, and if you look at it, you know, if you just kind of Who's our governor right now joe lombardo? Yeah, the old sheriff and what did he used to be so I mean chief of police getting your influence Um where you can you know, it could be very valuable depending where people end up in public office. Yeah I but that you're right. This is next level bizarreness. I had no idea It was just one person footing the bill in a donation role to create this kind of militaristic approach to policing Is the are the cops at least flexing on safety? Are they flexing on any kind of statistics to back up any of this? Uh cause i'd be more afraid they're flexing on people he or if it's doesn't like Right well the sheriff right now is um Um, you know running for reelection. He's saying uh murders are down I believe but these are all stats You can count them how you like but you know, what happens if there's a greater for example ice presence in las vegas And we are experiencing right now Right and um, but it could get really bad in theory like some other cities And what happens when the governor gets involved or the sheriff gets involved and now you start mixing politics with uh influence and how Much to resist this kind of stuff or get involved in it. It just raises a lot of questions and hypotheticals It's not great. It's not it's not a good look. It's it's the um, what's what's the uh, The thing you wanted you you want to avoid the uh, the appearance of impropriety And this this certainly does not avoid that appearance. That's what i'm trying to whether there is that's what i'm whether there is any Propriety or not this looks shady as fuck. That's what i'm poking that jacob is like, of course hearing this you make you go Like yikes, right? but like our what is the counter and that's I mean that's what's actually i've been fascinated by A lot of these terrible things that are happening in the country is that that doesn't even seem to be A quote unquote company line that people are hiding under anymore people just say like, yep. It's terrible We love it. We love terrible shit happening. It's awesome Like I don't I don't if you're not doing anything wrong. You shouldn't be worried about it Um, so yeah, this guy is someone in chat saying that he invests in in in in in flock safety I guess that's the company that tracks license plates. That's the license plate. Gotcha so the racer slash reader slash So he is he's getting data to sell This that's it. Yeah, it seems like it we get we get to be his demo city Although in vegas, we're so many cars without a license plate. You're gonna lose a chunk of data We just stepped up a thing about to call people out on that But now we've got neighbors reporting on each other on that. So that's fine Tattletale line is what rob is the one who reported that let me know that was working there. The tattletale line is working Have you ever been working working? I don't know. It's generating more tax revenue for the state. It's scary Rob, that's what I want city cast to crack I want you to do either an article or a podcast with just tattletalers what they get out of it why they're doing it Like who have you have you encountered anyone who's called in anyone on that line like like a guide on how to narc Yeah, like no. No, I want to hear from the narcs. I want to hear from the well Well, my favorite narc is that you can report on people who have smog issues with their car There's an actual program matt what's your license plate up Leave my carola smog out of this Well, you can't tell me those guys working in the smog shacks aren't just as soon as somebody fails and heads off on their day They're not jumping on the horn and they oh, yeah, I got a tip I don't think they get like a cash reward for oh, well, then maybe they're not doing it like Making life hard for your neighbor. It was like aluminum cans like you get 10 cents. It's like a Golden taco Um So I guess we're just at the beginning of what this means rob, right? We don't know what this actually is going to entail. Uh, we we haven't seen police drones in action yet. Have we Um, I think they're more of like a glorified delivery service right now where they are at different stations And then they can kind of go and maybe scope out an area before the actual officers arrive Oh, well, I that's kind of a monitoring thing. All right That uh, I I just picture I believe three four of them coming up to me while i'm on my walk at night Just shooting lasers at me is what i'm picturing Well, that's coming next To be unveiled at ces and I mean truly if you're making uh drones for metro services The way you're going to sell more of those drones is to have the predator style three laser dots that you can project on people While they're on their late night walks Yes, the sign of you will sell a fuck ton of those drones to all of these police departments If you just put those three lasers on it. Yeah Um, was that all three was that was that two? Uh, that was two I know they kind of run together and probably feel like one big story But let's go with what we all want to talk about elon musk tesla tunnels boring company We've talked about it a lot at city cast in some way. It's kind of our lane But we've teamed up with pro publica twice now And i'll tell you pro public pro publica does not mess around they are very serious and diligent about what they do A big shout out to david figler our host And lawyer not our lawyer but a lawyer Who really is curious about this stuff really digs deep into it and finds the things that not a lot of other people Find out about so well, you are right. This is definitely under reported I don't think people are talking about this at all on a national level And this company is running amok like a bad Like action tv show where someone has no regard for the law and just keeps ignoring. Oh, it's fine It's really like yeah commit violations now deal with it later They've had warnings. They've had um But in the latest, I mean we reported I believe it was like over a thousand Since they started and then um, or excuse me over a hundred thousand dollars in fines From uh, nevada osha for some safety violations, right and that was last year um this year we were reporting that um Trying to think of what it well it did illegal dumping was one of them they were they were yes kind of by where um Historic commercial center is I was put historic in front of it That's a very kind way to um, you know branding I spent so many years in that spot In historic commercial center. Yes. Yes in the historic onyx theater. Yeah The historic, uh Hawks syringe syringe syringe is historic historic green door History is made at hawks gym But uh hawks gym you can have that to be your new slogan by the way You'd have that for free history is made at hawks gym I mean it is historic and how many clothing optional all-male 24-hour gyms are there in this country? Not enough But i'm sorry, let's stay focused here rob Let's stay let's stay underground with these tests So, um now we reported there was um Almost 800 environmental regulations over the last two years alone and these were sort of for like, um Um digging without approval and releasing untreated water Into like city streets which go back into our water system, right? And there was a case where but you mean like untreated, uh waste water from their machines and things like that Like right water water that they've been using not just water that they found underground somewhere and they're dumping it like It's not like they just found a pocket of water like they're they're Bringing all this this water in Diluting chemicals and yeah, they're doing all this stuff with and they're just dumping it in the street Right and you do go underground you come across water and that kind of thing But you know, there's also waste from just use right and um, you know, they just seem to be Drilling full speed ahead and worrying about um the repercussions later. Um, there's some questions about transparency We had a congresswoman dina titus on our podcast at city cast and she said she wants to see Governor lombardo just open up the transparency of the meetings that are taking place With state officials and the boring company because they're sort of allegations that they're kind of getting some preferential treatment as far as you know Covering this stuff up and not being so transparent about it and kind of giving them some more chances than another company might get But um, you know, there's been agreements there's been allegations of the agreements being broken and just fines left and right But this is a company that has a lot of money at their disposal elon musk is on pace If not already to become the world's first trillionaire. He has money to burn and definitely nicer guy right and This all is for something that um, I know your insider intel said we shouldn't be as Impinionated but I think the boring company the boring tunnel and the boring company and what they're doing under vegas is an incredibly stupid Public transportation. Yes. Yes. The end goal is not It doesn't justify the means at all Like who cares taking traffic above ground and putting it underground the same exact tunnels Could have been a subway or some kind of large scale people mover um why In the name of technology we're just putting taxis underground putting disneyland style conveyor belts underground Where people could just walk down there and then stand on the conveyor belt would have made more sense than this I would have taken that over this. Um, yes, you know just by the way I'll still take that over this if somebody has the conveyor belt technology that they want to put in those tunnels today I'm fine with them. Shoot. I just sold it. I just sold that company to make bollards now If somebody could read the dollar short what's there with the monorail system? If only they could expand on the monorail system But that looks like it's going to get completely demolished at a certain point monorail right because there's no, um You don't have the replacement parts for the monorail. So now it's outdated So once it does bite the dust, we're we're we're stuck with it ridiculous and can't fix it Yeah, so, uh, maybe we'll have like tesla's driving themselves over the monorail Tesla does have like a subway car train type of thing that operates in Europe somewhere. I believe germany. I saw this story. I'm like wait, they actually can do this too. Why aren't they doing that here in vegas? And now their latest idea is well, what if we take the tesla's Underground put them above ground and now they can go to the airport for five bucks And we're like, okay, that sounds great. That sounds like a taxi with a super discount price That's not new tech. Nope Yeah, tesla operates a battery-powered shuttle train the giga train in germany for its giga factory in berlin Yeah, providing free transportation train. Yeah, this just like this just makes a lot of sense Yeah That's it. That's exactly that was exactly what uber did bitch. Where's my giga train is where i'm putting it out. We are we are Uber came in with a problem with saying no Yeah, and sometimes we should say no and say hey, how about what you're doing in germany? Let's do that. Yeah for sure It was was there any uh understanding of what that big green goopy pile of gunk was There was that weird mystery lake that they had created speaking of discharged water. Yeah Yeah there I mean, uh, it's funny because I think so much of the attention was how security handled that story So at their new station that they're building at the old firefly side if you remember that place on paradise So their latest um arms top is heading out it's heading out towards um unlv so You know, it's kind of going to give some accessibility to like the sphere area and all that But there's construction happening and there's a little kind of pool of greenish water out there And when a local station, I believe that was the cbs, uh klas affiliate here try to take some video of it what you're allowed to do from the sidewalk they Security shooed them away tried to cover it up So, you know if there's nothing wrong with that you would think well why are you trying to do that? I'm not going to totally jump to conclusions and just go with the headline. Yes It's a little weird and suspect but you know, it's up to them to explain what this is and from what i've seen so far They really haven't Yeah I mean it's it's up to you to explain what this luminous green pool of of sludge in the middle of the city is I heard that on that video that they made them delete was uh, Four turtles eating pizza and fighting each other get out of here Right out of the they were using uh, taekwondo. I think taekwondo turtles But all this in the name of having 12 cars drive you from one hotel to another underground I would like metro to take their drones and fly above this pool of green water Exactly, let's go lombardo fire them a little visit. Yeah, the giga train in germany carries 500 people per trip Just saying it's a lot more than four. Jesus. Yeah, that sounds convenient. Doesn't it? Yeah, it really does If only somebody had come up with the idea to put a train car underground like a a sub Train way tell me they couldn't refit the monorail. They could refit the monorail make it work Yeah, that's my vote no glory in it no ego in it paul There's no ego in it put the giga train on the monorail tracks and expand it Yeah, just bring it done. Yeah, bring it to where it needs to go Rob, thank you so much for giving us an awesome, uh top 300 reported stories of 2025 We really appreciate it.
