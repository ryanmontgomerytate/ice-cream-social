5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Thunder, Cougar Falcon, Scoop, and Travis Jaggery.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 If you want to be an ice cream truck driver just like these fine folks and help deliver that fucking ice cream

 Hey, Johnny! Do you want to go to an ice cream social?

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Yeah, I'd love to!

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Great! Let's go!

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Happy New Year everybody!

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Let's start the New Year right!

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 A guy was just awarded custody of his brother here in Nevada.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 I'm taking that from this because he was sexually abused by his brother when he was a kid.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Turns out he was the father of his own brother.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Happy New Year!

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 It's time for Matt and Matty Lee's Ice Cream Social!

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Sitting in a pool in his own mess, that's Matt Donnelly!

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Sitting in a pool in his own mess, that's also Paul Matty Lee!

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 I'm Jacob, we're PreachingFun!

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 I was looking at the trending news in Nevada and...

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 I shouldn't laugh, that's terrible!

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 It is terrible. It is absolutely terrible.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 A man awarded custody.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 It's horrible, but it's also horrible.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 I'm only asking to empathize with me scrolling to be stopped with man awarded custody of his own brother.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 And then you go to click the link, it says like warning, sensitive material.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 And that just was like good lord, that's a hard guy to go on a first date with after this, you know?

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Oh man!

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 So tell me about your life recently!

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 How old is this boy now?

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 The child that was awarded custody is early teens.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Okay.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 The gentleman is in his 20s.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And the mother is in jail.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Good, good!

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 I'm fine with that.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Honestly, I'm not even fine with that.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 I don't want her to be in jail.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 I want her to be getting help or something.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 It's not a crazy sentence.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 It's like an eight year sentence with parole kind of thing.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Good, good, good.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 I mean, I say that as if I would last a week in prison.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Right.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 I'm just thinking, what are the odds of her being a repeat offender?

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 I could do a dime standing on my head.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 So yeah.

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 We're not all strong like you, Paul.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Also not all as strong as you.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Did we miss technicalscooport on the chat for the truck drivers?

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 I don't know.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Technicalscooport, shout out to technicalscooport for the truck driving.

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 If indeed we did not have your name on the list.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Might just be another list.

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 What are you talking about?

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Technicalscooport in the chat was asking about he didn't hear his name on the truck driver.

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Oh, I missed that.

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Technicalscooport, thank you very much.

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 If I missed you on the list, I apologize.

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 We appreciate each and every one of you guys just being a crybaby.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 No, not at all, technicalscooport.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 That's what you pay for and we appreciate you guys so, so much.

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 And we also, you paid for us to change the subject.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Perfect, perfect.

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Yeah, no, that was great.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 I actually have a topic I wanted to bring up.

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 There is a news article I read here.

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 I don't know if you guys have heard of it yet.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 A man in Nevada was awarded custody of his brother.

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And it turned out there was a twist that no one saw coming.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Oh boy, oh boy.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 You know what the real twist is?

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 What's that?

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Personal trainers hate him.

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 I did the, you know, you're singing a song to somebody else and they hear you do the wrong lyrics and they make fun of you for that?

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Yes.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 I did that to myself in the car the other day.

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 What'd you do?

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 You caught yourself singing the wrong lyrics.

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 I caught myself.

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 I was like, that can't be the right lyric.

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 I had, I had the 90s station on and it was playing, oh, what's that song?

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Everlast.

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Then you really might know what it's like.

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 You know what I'm talking about?

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 No, no, that's not Everlast.

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Yeah, that's Everlast.

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 That's Everlast, right?

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 That's Everlast, yeah, yeah.

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 I don't remember the name of the song.

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 I'd forbid you ever have to walk a mile in her shoes.

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 That one, yeah.

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Because then you really might know what it's like to have to choose.

97
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 So I had like the 90s station on and I was doing what Paul's doing.

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 I'm just singing along with it.

99
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 I'm like, yeah, this jam.

100
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 I remember this jam from like '96 or so.

101
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 This is awesome.

102
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Yeah.

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 And the hair on his face was dreadlocked for the mange.

104
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Dreadlocked for the mange.

105
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Dreadlocked, yeah, for the mange.

106
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 I was like, oh, this man had to dreadlock the hair on his face because he had such bad

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 mange, is apparently what I thought in the mid-90s.

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 No.

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 That's not how it goes.

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 That's close.

111
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Correct.

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 It's not how it goes.

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 How would you handle the mange, Paul?

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 You don't want to have to comb it out every day.

115
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 No, but I'm thinking topical ointment.

116
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 A salve?

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 A salve before dreadlocking it.

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Yuck, those things are going to come out in clumps.

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Yep.

120
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 That's going to just fall right off your face.

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Also, it occurred to me as I was thinking about this in the car as I was driving, dreadlocking

122
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 hair wouldn't help with mange at all.

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 That wouldn't even be a good solution for mange.

124
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 No.

125
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Well, we do plenty of things in our lives that don't help with the things that they're

126
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 supposed to.

127
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Well, that's true.

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 That's true.

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 All right.

130
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 I'm back to dreadlocked for the mange.

131
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 There's dreadlocks for the mange YouTube page, which swears by it.

132
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Oh, yeah.

133
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 People who said they've done their research and they have different doctors to testify

134
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 that dreadlocking for the mange is perfectly well suited.

135
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 What is the actual lyric?

136
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 I'm looking it up right now.

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 It's just like hair full of mange.

138
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 The hair on his face.

139
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Oh, I was much closer than I thought I was.

140
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 I was going to say you're very close.

141
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Dreadlocked and full of mange.

142
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Yeah.

143
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 I'm not as far off on this lyric as I assume.

144
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 No, you're being too hard on yourself in that car.

145
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 You got to go back there and say, I owe you an apology, Jacob.

146
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Yeah, I owe past Jacob an apology.

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 I was too harsh on him.

148
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Don't worry.

149
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 I'm sure there are other lyrics in this song.

150
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 If I go through all the lyrics in this song, I'm sure there are others that I'm just absolutely

151
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 wrong on.

152
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 If there's a chance you might get interrupted, I might have to leave to show a plumber my

153
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 toilet that's not working.

154
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Man has to go fuck a plumber.

155
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Oh, shit.

156
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Nonetheless, I have another story.

157
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 I've had so many lately.

158
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 The man of the hour intro.

159
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Oh, the man of the hour.

160
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 I haven't gotten over the man of the hour.

161
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 We'll get through this.

162
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 The guy complaining about me in front of me at the cruise ship thing.

163
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 My debacle as a soccer coach.

164
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 I saw your wife the other night at the show and I did something that I rarely do, which

165
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 I stood up to give her a hug.

166
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 I felt like she needed it after having heard the boy's soccer story.

167
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 I was like, you don't know why I'm giving you a hug, but I feel like you just need a

168
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 hug.

169
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

170
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 You're closing out the year strong.

171
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Isn't that what they say about the new year?

172
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 When it goes to shit, then the rest of your year is going to be your new year is going

173
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 to be good.

174
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 And that kind of thing.

175
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 I hope so.

176
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 That's an assumption, right?

177
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 I mean, as Matt Donnelly famous said in 2019, next year has got to be better.

178
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 I believe I did say that, right?

179
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 That's a legit, that's a legit quote.

180
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 I have a neighbor who's a douche.

181
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Okay.

182
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 And I don't think I've talked about too much on the, on the pod.

183
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 No, you don't want to put your neighborhood on blast.

184
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 How far down is he?

185
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 He's across the street and down two doors.

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 He's on the corner.

187
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 It's not Chad's old house or anything.

188
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 No, no, no.

189
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Across the street.

190
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Not a direct neighbor, which is good.

191
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Yeah.

192
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Yeah.

193
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Close enough.

194
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Close enough.

195
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 You can see his home from your windows.

196
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Yeah.

197
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Yeah.

198
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Yeah.

199
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 From my driveway, I can see his house, his house, you know, we're, we're, we're caddy,

200
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 whatever it is.

201
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 I can throw a cat in his house.

202
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Yeah.

203
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Well that ain't that far.

204
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 And so in the past, do he, in the past, he's yelled at children in the neighborhood for

205
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 things going on.

206
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 This is the no cones guy.

207
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Is it?

208
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 No.

209
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Right.

210
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 So the no cones guy, I think either moved or just, uh, except that maybe he was possibly

211
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 going to run over children and maybe chilled out.

212
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 I don't know.

213
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 One or the other.

214
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 Maybe he got therapy.

215
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 I don't think he got therapy and once again, my kids got older and more agile.

216
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 So it was like, right.

217
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 That's true.

218
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 That's true.

219
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 It was less of a deal.

220
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 They don't need the cones as much.

221
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 And, uh, um, no, this guy's yelled at children in the past, but not my children.

222
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Uh, and so I've heard tales of him yelling at children before, but I never came to it

223
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 face to face.

224
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Ah, I, uh, was at the grocery store and then my wife and I miss, uh, missed crossed hairs

225
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 in the both of the grocery store together, getting last minute things for party.

226
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 We're going to throw it tomorrow.

227
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 Uh, Jacob, I don't know if you're around tomorrow, but three to three to five for having

228
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 people over and, um, and, uh, Paul, you're not invited.

229
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 And, um, uh, I knew it, I knew it.

230
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,680
 And she's like, I guess the neighbor's just cursed at our kids.

231
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,240
 And I was like, Oh, Oh no.

232
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,120
 And so I was like, Oh, I got it.

233
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,200
 I was like, I go, well, that's not okay.

234
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
 Yeah.

235
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,280
 And I was like, I guess, I was like, I guess I should go talk to him.

236
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:29,120
 How much, how much of your inner monologue at this point is can I get away with not dealing

237
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
 with this at all?

238
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,560
 Well, this is, you know, I mean, there's of course, I mean, I'll say that's always my

239
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,560
 first instinct, right?

240
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,520
 My first instinct is like, Oh, hide and do nothing.

241
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,520
 Right.

242
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,960
 Cause I, I mean, like, this is not going to be a fun, this is not going to be a fun conversation.

243
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:50,480
 No, I don't anticipate it going well, because he has been across from us.

244
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,200
 Like, you know, I mean, this no surprise to you, we are, we are neighborly, especially

245
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200
 my wife.

246
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,600
 Like we know all of our neighbors and these guys have been here for the whole time and

247
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,880
 we do not talk at all.

248
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,700
 And they've, they've ignored us every time we tried to say hi to them in the past.

249
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,700
 Real grumpers.

250
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,000
 A just total, total grumpers, a lot of people go in and out of that house.

251
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,120
 We don't even know if there's one or two families in there.

252
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,120
 It's just one of those.

253
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,120
 It goes on.

254
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,120
 It's that kind of situation.

255
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,920
 There's something, there's fishiness and that's why they're all standoff.

256
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,920
 Yeah.

257
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,920
 Yeah.

258
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,320
 You think it's a bunch of mobsters, uh, go into the mattresses for a potential mob war.

259
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,920
 You think that's what's going on in there?

260
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,920
 I know.

261
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,320
 So there's a lot of district distribution of, of, of ammunition and different guns from

262
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
 the trunks.

263
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,240
 I've noticed a bunch of Tommy guns being passed out over here.

264
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,880
 You joke, but there's some shit like that.

265
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,440
 The for real goes down out of these Vegas, uh, residentials.

266
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,440
 It's no, it's no joke.

267
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
 There is.

268
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
 It's kind of a joke.

269
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,440
 Yeah.

270
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:48,560
 Well, yeah, this kind of seems to be like in his own business, his own, whatever, any

271
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,640
 man, something, some kind of business, but he has two big trucks.

272
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,240
 He's loading it in and out all the time.

273
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
 Okay.

274
00:11:53,240 --> 00:12:00,840
 Um, with different stuff, uh, but, uh, yeah, so, uh, neighborhood kid, uh, overthrew my

275
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:06,480
 son and the ball rolled off the street, up onto his driveway, underneath his truck.

276
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,400
 Oh, and he came out and screamed at my children to keep their shit away from my shit.

277
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,400
 Uh, keep your fucking shit away from my shit.

278
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,400
 They were so there was a ball on his property.

279
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,040
 Was it, was a kid trying to get the ball at this point, as a matter of fact, because of

280
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,000
 the past, my son was waiting for the ball to roll back down the driveway in which it

281
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 did.

282
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,760
 Oh, so he was even doing what he's supposed to do.

283
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,760
 Yes.

284
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,840
 Oh, come on.

285
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,320
 When we first moved into this house, uh, the house that we live in now, we, we have close

286
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,200
 neighbors and we're in a cul-de-sac and, uh, the neighbors that we had when we first moved

287
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,040
 in kind of kitty corner across from us, they had a bunch of kids and the kids were always

288
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,040
 out.

289
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,600
 We're like, we, our, our big cul-de-sac is not technically a street.

290
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,680
 It's technically a shared private drive between our four houses right here.

291
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,680
 And so, and obviously it's a cul-de-sac, so there's not a lot of traffic.

292
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,480
 So the kids would be out riding bikes and skateboarding and doing all that stuff all

293
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,280
 the time.

294
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,560
 And one of the younger ones, cause they, cause we have kind of a circular drive in front

295
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,480
 of our house as well.

296
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,600
 And so they would cut through the circular drive all the time.

297
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,960
 Uh, not a big deal.

298
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
 Who cares?

299
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,420
 But once or twice, uh, one of the younger ones would come up like all the way up to

300
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,880
 our front porch and, you know, just, just skating around doing, doing whatever.

301
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,360
 Cause there's concrete all the way up there.

302
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,560
 Uh, he, he wouldn't do anything, but he'd just come up, he'd come all the way up there.

303
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,400
 And so one day I had to go over and, and talk to his parents who were very nice people.

304
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,440
 Uh, just a, a giant Mormon family.

305
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,320
 So they just had kids everywhere.

306
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,680
 They were, they were just quiver full.

307
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,680
 Yeah.

308
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,520
 I think there were like 12 people living in the house at one point with this one, with

309
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,520
 this one family.

310
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,520
 That's outrageous.

311
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,880
 Uh, but they were lovely and they were, they were very, they were very nice family.

312
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,880
 I miss them.

313
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,880
 They're, they're great.

314
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,000
 They were, they were good neighbors, but like I had to go have the conversation with, uh,

315
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,680
 the dad who's just standing outside.

316
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,920
 It's like, Hey, maybe just ask your kiddos to not, like if they're in the driveway there,

317
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,440
 I don't care if they're in front of the house.

318
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,000
 I don't care if they're in front of the garages.

319
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,560
 I don't care.

320
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,080
 The front porch, like their windows straight into the house there.

321
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,720
 I don't really want them right up there to maybe, maybe talk to them.

322
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,000
 And that was an awkward as fuck conversation.

323
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Yes.

324
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,040
 And we were both being very civil and I didn't like it at all.

325
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:36,040
 Now this guy's just yelling because a ball was in his driveway for a minute and it removed

326
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:42,000
 itself seemingly of its own accord with, with the assistance of gravity.

327
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 It removed itself.

328
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,440
 So I was like, it's time to go talk.

329
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,640
 That's a lot of, that's a lot of anger.

330
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
 I know.

331
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,920
 And then this thing is like, and I'm, it's, it's my neighbor, right?

332
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,320
 So the whole point, tell him I had, I'm like, I have to one, he's going to yell at me.

333
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,320
 I have to prepare myself.

334
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,320
 He's going to yell.

335
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
 Yep.

336
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,320
 And I'm like, oh, he's not going to be a two-faced person, but you're like, oh no, me, I love

337
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,320
 those kiddos.

338
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,720
 Like his voice is going to be raised at the first thought would be maybe take him a gift.

339
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,960
 Um, well, that wasn't, that wasn't my thought.

340
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:21,120
 But uh, uh, uh, I, a baseball is a baseball because it's been a few incidents over the

341
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,160
 years, not a lot, but a few years, I don't know if adult ever got involved before.

342
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,520
 So I was like, I have to just go over there and have a conversation with him just to know

343
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:34,920
 that adults is, is, is also part of this conversation, right?

344
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,320
 He had been hanging on this car when it happened and he was hanging on his car.

345
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,880
 When I went over, he'd been hanging on his car all day doing business from his car.

346
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,440
 Oh, oh, this is not a happy person.

347
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,440
 No.

348
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,800
 So I, I thought I was going to go to the front door.

349
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,720
 He was already in his car and he rolls out his window.

350
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,640
 And I said, he doesn't get out, he just rolls down the window.

351
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,640
 Yeah.

352
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,640
 And I said, Hey man, you can't be cursing at children.

353
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,640
 Yeah.

354
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,320
 And he goes, I didn't, I didn't curse.

355
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,320
 First of all, I didn't cause it.

356
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:10,120
 He says, boom, he's out of his door, uh, in my face and tell me I didn't curse at any

357
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,120
 children.

358
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,440
 And he goes, I have, I record everything.

359
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,440
 He points, he gestures as if he has cameras all over his house and his car says, I recorded

360
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,440
 everything.

361
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,720
 And I said, great.

362
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,720
 Play it.

363
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,720
 I said, awesome.

364
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,720
 Play it for me.

365
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,720
 And I'll apologize.

366
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,720
 Yeah.

367
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,840
 And he goes, I have to fucking play fucking play anything for you.

368
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
 Fuck you.

369
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,840
 Like I am ready to be wrong.

370
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,840
 Show me that I'm wrong.

371
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,840
 I'm ready to be wrong.

372
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,840
 I will.

373
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,840
 I will yell at my kids.

374
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,840
 I will.

375
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:42,600
 I will beat them to within inches of their lives for lying about you saying shit to them.

376
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,760
 Show me the video and I will beat my children.

377
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
 No.

378
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,920
 And he immediately starts cursing a lot.

379
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,120
 So I'm like, I'm skeptical that he didn't, he didn't curse.

380
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,120
 I'm skeptical.

381
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,840
 If someone comes to me and says, Hey, you can't curse in front of X, I assume that I

382
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,440
 did indeed curse whether I remember cursing or not.

383
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,440
 That's where I start from.

384
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:10,160
 And he then he's like, you had never talked to me until this moment, blah, blah, blah,

385
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,800
 blah, blah, blah, which I was like, booed.

386
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,480
 I've tried to say hi to you like a million times and you've ignored me.

387
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,520
 So I was like, check the recordings, man.

388
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,520
 Exactly.

389
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,840
 I was like, so I let that pass.

390
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:26,440
 And then I was like, I was like, I was like, and I basically was like, you, you, you can

391
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,920
 have everything you want without screaming at kids.

392
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,920
 That's been my whole point.

393
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
 Yeah.

394
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,960
 You can keep the kids out of your property.

395
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,760
 You can do that without screaming and cursing at my kids, but he's getting, he's getting,

396
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,760
 he's getting me.

397
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,760
 He's like, you come over here, you're going to get in my face.

398
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,760
 You can just see this, you know, whatever.

399
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,480
 He goes, kiss my ass, kiss my fucking ass, kiss my ass.

400
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:52,080
 I say, I say, if I kiss your ass, will you be nicer to the kids?

401
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,080
 Nice.

402
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,320
 That really threw him.

403
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,320
 I'm sure.

404
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:02,840
 And he said, but, and I said, if I kiss your ass right now, will you be nicer to the children?

405
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,840
 What if I spin you around?

406
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,840
 What if I, what if I give you a blow job right now?

407
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,600
 I will, I will blow you in this driveway.

408
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,800
 He literally like got jarred by that, that he actually like instinctively turned his

409
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,360
 butt towards me.

410
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:21,240
 Like while he was still being angry, he was like, Oh yeah, he wanted it.

411
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,780
 So then I bent over, but I kissed my hand, I kissed my hand and I, yeah, boop.

412
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,780
 I touched his butt.

413
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,780
 Tapped him.

414
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,780
 Yep.

415
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,780
 Yeah.

416
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,800
 I gave a little, there you go.

417
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
 Good, good.

418
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,440
 Which triggered his gay stuff alarm.

419
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,120
 And then he got even more angry again and was like, don't you fucking touch me.

420
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,120
 You fucking touch me.

421
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,120
 You say the fuck away from me.

422
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:47,040
 He, yeah, that, uh, Mark in the chat, that was a Freudian turn on the neighbor's part.

423
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,040
 For sure.

424
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,040
 Oh, a hundred percent.

425
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,040
 For sure.

426
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,140
 This guy is filled with self-hatred.

427
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,200
 This is becoming more and more apparent.

428
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,800
 The, the more we look into all of this stuff and I can speak for personal, not personal,

429
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:07,800
 but interpersonal experience, a lot of this shit is coming from repressed gay people.

430
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,440
 Oh, sure.

431
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,280
 Don't have a way they, and it just, the self-hatred that gets festered in.

432
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,280
 Or repressed, repressed anything.

433
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,280
 Like there's, there's something.

434
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,280
 Anything.

435
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,280
 Yeah.

436
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,760
 There's something inside this guy that he's, that he's furious about.

437
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,760
 You know, the Kinsey scale is not exactly the most accurate thing in the world.

438
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,880
 The idea that we have different wavering amounts of bisexuality.

439
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,880
 Oh, absolute.

440
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,280
 We're all on the spectrum.

441
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,280
 Right.

442
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:38,080
 We're all, but, but, but you gotta be aware enough to be like, oh yeah, there's, I mean,

443
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,120
 there's a needle that moves when Trent Reznor comes into the conversation.

444
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
 Yes.

445
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,120
 You know what I mean?

446
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,080
 I've asked you over and over again, not to refer to your dick as a needle.

447
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,560
 Don't, I want you to be happier about yourself.

448
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,560
 No, no, no.

449
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,000
 It's, it's, there's more girth than that.

450
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,240
 I'm not, we're not, we're not playing records.

451
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,240
 Okay.

452
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
 Okay.

453
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,240
 Good.

454
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,720
 But Bruce Springsteen's early success was because he was a piece of ass and men likes

455
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,200
 going to see him in concert, but it was, he was an attractive guy.

456
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,640
 I mean, the, the, the, what the album cover with his dick on it.

457
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

458
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,640
 There's an album cover.

459
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,080
 It's just like zoomed in on his, on his crotch.

460
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,080
 No, you zoomed in.

461
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,080
 There's a regular shot.

462
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,320
 You zoomed in on his crotch.

463
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,120
 Oh, I wondered why a magnifying glass was taped onto that album cover.

464
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,360
 No, that's what I mean.

465
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,680
 It's like, yes, I do.

466
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:31,880
 I do believe Paul, I actually do, it's like, it just, it's just this gay hatred stuff just

467
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:39,400
 really, really comes from really straight, quote unquote straight men, hating gay men

468
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
 and gay activities.

469
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,400
 Right.

470
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,920
 And that's why transfers to trance, because if you were actually attracted to someone

471
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,640
 presenting female that was born male, then suddenly you think something's terrible with

472
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
 yourself.

473
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
 Yeah.

474
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,320
 It's like they just, it's jealousy too.

475
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,800
 It's like, how dare someone live their life open and free, embracing their identity that

476
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,060
 I don't get to do that.

477
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,060
 And that was the thing.

478
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,720
 I mentioned this before to Jacob the other day.

479
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,920
 Were we talking about, it's not a podcast or whatever it was, but how, when it gets

480
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,920
 to a certain point.

481
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,120
 No, no, that was just a FaceTime that you and I had late night, our, our, our no pants

482
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,120
 FaceTimes.

483
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,120
 We were talking about how-

484
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,880
 Wait, I got disinvited to no pants FaceTimes?

485
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,880
 When did I lose my invite?

486
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,280
 No, no, no, we're just, we're splitting them.

487
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,280
 We're just splitting them.

488
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,280
 The group thing wasn't working.

489
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
 Disinvited is a strong word.

490
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,760
 Disinvited is a strong word.

491
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,560
 We agreed, Jacob and I both agreed that we got a little turned off the last time.

492
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:35,200
 And so we wanted to keep it, we wanted to keep it a little more spicy, just me and Jacob.

493
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,640
 No, this is the thing.

494
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:49,040
 When a lot of hardcore religious types want to adamantly say that sexuality is a choice,

495
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:54,640
 that is coming from their reality in which they must choose to repress their natural

496
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,680
 instinct.

497
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,640
 And they think everyone has to undergo that same choice where we do not.

498
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,100
 It is, you know, and yeah, it's just, it's hard.

499
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:09,640
 No, I mean, I think there's like, like, uh, um, uh, my buddy, Mike Mills, who's producing

500
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,640
 the Joker's tour.

501
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,840
 He's also producing this documentary, um, anyhow, I can't, I don't think I can talk

502
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,200
 about what it is or what it's about, but one part of it that he was talking to me about

503
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:27,680
 was the studying was basically people did, uh, study, um, uh, basically hook up meters

504
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:33,280
 to people's, uh, penises to, and then show them pictures to like about twinges when they

505
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,280
 saw stuff.

506
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,280
 Yes.

507
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,280
 Oh, wait, that was, that was an official study.

508
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,280
 That was an official study.

509
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,360
 So if you've been doing it on your own, Jacob, you need to share that data.

510
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,360
 Okay.

511
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,360
 Oh, yeah.

512
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,360
 I had no idea.

513
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,000
 Does my tongue count as a meter?

514
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,560
 Yes, it does.

515
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,560
 Okay.

516
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,560
 It's a meat.

517
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,560
 All right.

518
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,480
 That and, and, and how you eat a Reese's peanut butter cup is intense, Paul.

519
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,480
 It's intense.

520
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,960
 We should talk about it.

521
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,960
 Brother.

522
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,200
 I put the work on them Reese's.

523
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:05,800
 They're never the same sideways like a typewriter, but, um, typewriter and two bites and that's

524
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,800
 it.

525
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,800
 So this is legit.

526
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,000
 Basically just say, does the legitimately study the kind of like self-hatred of feeling

527
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,240
 gay feelings is a real, is a real thing.

528
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,240
 Yeah.

529
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,000
 And I, and I guess much more prevalent than we ever think about.

530
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Right.

531
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,680
 And that's the thing is that it's more, that's what, that's what always blows my mind.

532
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:26,760
 It's like, they keep putting out these studies like, Oh, 10% of the population, bullshit.

533
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,760
 Yeah.

534
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,760
 That's low.

535
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,760
 That's right.

536
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,160
 That's way, that's gotta be so fucking low.

537
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,160
 That's low.

538
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,160
 Right.

539
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,160
 But that's not always been the statistic that we've always had our whole life.

540
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,800
 If you just count the people, if you just count the people that get on television and

541
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,680
 yell about how evil gay people are, if that's more than 10% of the population right there.

542
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,400
 I mean, if you involve yourself with theater for 10 minutes, you go, Oh yeah.

543
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
 Okay.

544
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,400
 Great.

545
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,400
 Yeah.

546
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,400
 Yeah.

547
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
 This is cool.

548
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,640
 But 10% no, I don't think so.

549
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,640
 Anyway.

550
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,640
 Yeah.

551
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,960
 Service industry, Sean in the comments saying service industry.

552
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,960
 Yeah.

553
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,960
 Yeah.

554
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,960
 Anywhere.

555
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,960
 Anywhere.

556
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,960
 That's the other thing.

557
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,960
 It's not even just, it doesn't have to be theater.

558
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,960
 It doesn't have to be services.

559
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,640
 Any, any job you go, Oh wait, there's more than 10% here.

560
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:21,920
 Oh yeah, do the math, but we can't do the math because education has been completely

561
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,240
 systematically defunded.

562
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,560
 We have to bring people in from other countries to do the math.

563
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,320
 We can't do that anymore either.

564
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,320
 Nope.

565
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,320
 God damn it.

566
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
 They don't like us.

567
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,600
 Oh, not only that, that is not allowing it.

568
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,600
 Nope.

569
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,600
 I guess our shouting was creating a commotion in the neighborhood as, as I was trying not

570
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,440
 to shout, but I raised my voice a few times, but of course, but, but the one time I was

571
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,300
 like, Hey, the most I yelled was when I was going, I am trying to deescalate.

572
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,640
 I'm trying to write this more chill.

573
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,600
 I am not trying to be in your face.

574
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:59,800
 I don't know how I would react if someone cursed at my children.

575
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,080
 So it was really, I mean, I was drove home steaming.

576
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,120
 I was, I wouldn't, I wouldn't react well if I, if somebody told me that somebody cursed

577
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,120
 at your children.

578
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,120
 Right.

579
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,120
 Exactly.

580
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,120
 Exactly.

581
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,120
 Like if somebody was like, Hey, that guy just yelled at Matt's kids.

582
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:18,640
 I'd be like, God damn it and you have to like, uh, like, you know, it's a neighbor.

583
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,640
 Right.

584
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,640
 And we've both been there for a long time.

585
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,200
 And yeah, that's not going to change.

586
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,960
 So you got to watch it because you don't want to just not, yeah, you don't want to be coming

587
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,960
 home to eggs.

588
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,080
 Do not call the registration car hotline.

589
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,080
 Oh my God.

590
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,080
 Right.

591
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,080
 Can you imagine?

592
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,080
 Yeah.

593
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,920
 Oh, Myra in the chat wants to know, did your discussion get reported in the, in the nosy

594
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,920
 neighbor board?

595
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:43,240
 Oh, I, you know, I honestly have to go check cause I, I, I always end up, I click on one

596
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,240
 thing and also they get like a thousand emails and after like a week, I'm like, wait, I want

597
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,200
 to stop all these emails and I unsubscribe.

598
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,200
 Yes.

599
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,440
 It is, it is the flow that we all go with exactly.

600
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,000
 So I have to go back, but I mean, multiple neighbors were texting about, I'm yelling in

601
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 the first place.

602
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,880
 And then I was screaming, but my wife came out and said, all right, basically in the

603
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,880
 net.

604
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,880
 No, no, just loudly goes, all right.

605
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,480
 She, she goes, all right, you tried, you tried to do the right thing and just said that nice

606
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,480
 to him.

607
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:17,040
 And we just walked away or whatever, but, uh, it was, it was just the best man.

608
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,040
 Yes.

609
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,960
 I was about to say there are so many things that I can think of that I would rather have

610
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,120
 happened to me than be the neighbor of Sarah Lowe and have her, have her mad at me.

611
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,240
 Well, you know, she'll win.

612
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,800
 Like she has the whole neighborhood wrapped around her finger.

613
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,800
 Right.

614
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
 Exactly.

615
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,800
 Exactly.

616
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:39,200
 So she could probably sell his house, Leon in the chat.

617
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,200
 You tried the right thing.

618
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,760
 Now kick his ass.

619
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,760
 Now loose.

620
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,760
 Now that was actually the only like comforting thing is he, he seems, he's always been very

621
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,480
 intimidating from his truck, but when he actually got out and got on my face, I was like, oh,

622
00:26:53,480 --> 00:27:00,760
 there's a reason why you stay, there's a reason why you stay in that truck buddy with big

623
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,760
 old truck.

624
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,760
 What do you know?

625
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,480
 You should have tried to give him a hug.

626
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,240
 Look, I hate when you hug him.

627
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,760
 I went further than I thought.

628
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,760
 Yeah.

629
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,320
 That was pretty far.

630
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,320
 That was kissing ass.

631
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,320
 That's pretty far.

632
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:18,080
 I'll tell you who else tried to give their neighbor a mouth hug on his butt and that's

633
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,080
 the following sponsor.

634
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:25,920
 Today's show, man, manliest ice cream socials brought to you by Karen's cakes and cookies.

635
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,920
 That's right.

636
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,480
 From New Hampshire caveman in 2023.

637
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,040
 It's Karen's cakes and cookies.

638
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:39,080
 Hey, I don't know who made this, but it's not right.

639
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,360
 It's just off something.

640
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:48,240
 There's sugar, too much sugar in the mix or something, but the icing is just a little

641
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,240
 bit runny or who knows the colors just a little bit off.

642
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,040
 Hi, I'm Karen for Karen's cakes and cookies.

643
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,440
 Every time you order, you're going to get something a little bit wrong.

644
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,860
 It's not going to be quite right.

645
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,760
 You're going to have to speak to the manager.

646
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,140
 That's the Karen's cookies and cakes guarantee.

647
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,960
 You will always have to speak directly to someone in charge to fix the shit you got

648
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,040
 from your order.

649
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,440
 It will never be right.

650
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,640
 It will always have a mistake.

651
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,840
 I promise you that or I'll talk about your fucking hair, bitch.

652
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,840
 Get out of my store.

653
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,120
 I can refuse you.

654
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,120
 That's right.

655
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,080
 I just wanted cupcakes for my kid's birthday.

656
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,600
 Well, you know what?

657
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,160
 People wanted to not stare at that fucking bird's nest of a bullshit beehive you got

658
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,160
 going on.

659
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,480
 Get the fuck out.

660
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,880
 I can stun the salon every week.

661
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,880
 Whoa.

662
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,880
 Oh, salon selectives.

663
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,880
 Where are you going?

664
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,880
 Salon.

665
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,880
 Is that Salon Dion?

666
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,880
 Salon Dion.

667
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,880
 Salon Dion.

668
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,880
 I go to Salon Dion.

669
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:49,760
 How is there not a Salon Dion in Las Vegas already?

670
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,760
 I don't know.

671
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,760
 Well, there is now.

672
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,760
 I'm sure I'll put it out there in the zeitgeist.

673
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,760
 It'll happen.

674
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,760
 Come on, people.

675
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,760
 Hey, Matt.

676
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,760
 I'll cross your hairline.

677
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,760
 Okay, go ahead.

678
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,760
 Oh my God.

679
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,760
 There should be a Salon Dion.

680
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,940
 Why is there not?

681
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,200
 Oh, that's so perfect.

682
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,080
 And it's all that goes between us.

683
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,080
 Yeah.

684
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,080
 Salon Dion.

685
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,080
 Your extensions will go on.

686
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,080
 Man.

687
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,080
 Forget it.

688
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,080
 Your extensions will go on.

689
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,080
 Come on.

690
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,080
 It's right there.

691
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,080
 That's all right there.

692
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,080
 This is give me shit.

693
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,080
 Right there.

694
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,080
 This is give me shit.

695
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,080
 Matt.

696
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,080
 Yes, sir.

697
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,080
 Speaking of your children.

698
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,080
 Yes.

699
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,240
 I have been watching Keeler in Pluribus.

700
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:36,120
 Is there a good reason to say that?

701
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:41,680
 I've been holding off because my wife watches like two episodes out of a year.

702
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,520
 Her New Year's resolution is to watch television again.

703
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,200
 Like she has stopped watching television.

704
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:54,000
 So when you guys watch Pluribus, there will be moments where you go, our son is starring

705
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,800
 as an angry, lonely lesbian fighting a world plague.

706
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,800
 It's pretty amazing.

707
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,800
 I didn't think about it.

708
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,360
 I didn't think about it until Paul said it.

709
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,000
 We're two episodes into Pluribus and Paul is just correct.

710
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 I'm right.

711
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,840
 I mean, I'm not out here to talk shit.

712
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,760
 I'm not talking shit.

713
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,800
 You got a handsome lad.

714
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,160
 He's got movie star looks, clearly.

715
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,160
 He is right now.

716
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,160
 TV series looks.

717
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,520
 He is currently Bowie-esque, so I understand what you were saying about him.

718
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,520
 Yes.

719
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,520
 Yes.

720
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,520
 He's got the longish hair.

721
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,520
 Yeah.

722
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,680
 He's got this kind of perfect androgynous thing going on.

723
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,160
 Something about the facial symmetry with this woman in this movie.

724
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:39,120
 When he was younger, he looked exactly like Charlie from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory

725
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,120
 in the movie.

726
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,120
 Right.

727
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,120
 Yes, he did.

728
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,120
 It was a really weird thing.

729
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,120
 From Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.

730
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,120
 From the old one.

731
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,120
 From the Gene Wilder one.

732
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,120
 Yeah.

733
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
 Your son is absolutely carol.

734
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,840
 If someone's watching Pluribus and you don't know what Keeler looks like, yes, you do.

735
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,840
 Yeah, that's it.

736
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,840
 Yes, you do.

737
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,840
 That's exactly what Keeler looks like.

738
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,560
 If my son can act half as good as Ray Seahorn, then we're in the money because Ray Seahorn's

739
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,920
 absolutely amazing as an actor.

740
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,920
 No problem there.

741
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,920
 No, no.

742
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,360
 I am, where am I?

743
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,480
 I finished up Mayors of Kingstown.

744
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,480
 Oh, good.

745
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,480
 Probably the best season.

746
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,480
 This is the first season.

747
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,480
 Season three.

748
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,800
 Season two and three were a little wonky, but season four was really good.

749
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:24,160
 But it's still hilarious on these shows, these Taylor Sheridan shows.

750
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,040
 When you can commit mass murder and then just go eat afterward and be like, "Oh, now that

751
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:32,840
 that's over with, let's chow and talk about it some other time," is always the funniest

752
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,840
 thing to me.

753
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,640
 Not like we should seek trauma counseling or whatever.

754
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,640
 But ...

755
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,640
 We should seek trauma counseling.

756
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:45,880
 I would love it if Taylor Sheridan shows just got really real, just really real.

757
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:50,400
 I'm only one episode into the lowdown, have you guys been watching that at all?

758
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
 No.

759
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,400
 No.

760
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,400
 What's his name?

761
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,400
 Ethan Hawke.

762
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,400
 It's on Hulu.

763
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,400
 Okay.

764
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,400
 Oh, my plumber's here.

765
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,400
 All right.

766
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,400
 Good.

767
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,560
 I was only talking about TV shows, so it should be hard to hand this off.

768
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,560
 Okay.

769
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,560
 All right.

770
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,560
 Paul.

771
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,560
 Yes.

772
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,560
 Rating the Rock Vault closed last night.

773
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,480
 Oh, you know, and it really broke my heart.

774
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,760
 I saw all these postings from SJ and other folks because I follow a lot of Rock Vault

775
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,680
 people and Rock Vault itself.

776
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:20,400
 I did promotional work for them for a couple years.

777
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,720
 Got to see the show many times, early, different iterations.

778
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,300
 Then got to just see it as a fan to go see SJ a couple times.

779
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,580
 This is heartbreaking.

780
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,680
 This is definitely a ...

781
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,760
 It's the end of an era.

782
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,760
 It's the end of an era.

783
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:39,600
 It's a victim of where Vegas is right now with the decline in tourism.

784
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,260
 And I think, you know, just shifting trends, like always.

785
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,260
 What's your take on it, Jacob?

786
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,260
 I mean, I think it's part of that.

787
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,260
 It's certainly part of that.

788
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,960
 I think that has to do with it.

789
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:54,760
 It's also, I mean, when we first moved here, all the shows at the big casinos here were

790
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,760
 Broadway shows.

791
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,760
 Right.

792
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,760
 Yeah.

793
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:04,280
 The first show I did out here was Spamalot and then the kind of new wave of shows came

794
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:09,920
 in and Absinthe was part of that new wave of shows coming in back then.

795
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,160
 And Rock Vault was as well.

796
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,680
 Rock Vault was part of that class.

797
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,680
 Yes.

798
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,200
 And they were just a year or so after Absinthe.

799
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,440
 I mean, they were real close.

800
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,400
 And there aren't many of that class of shows left in town.

801
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,400
 No.

802
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,400
 Part of it is just the time.

803
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:33,000
 I mean, it's so goddamn hard to run a show here, especially a show of any size.

804
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 Yes.

805
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,880
 Where you're trying to get hundreds of people in every night to come see it.

806
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,080
 There's so much competition.

807
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:44,800
 There's so much competition for people to spend entertainment money on here between

808
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:51,060
 other shows, clubs, gambling, celebrity chefs, all these things.

809
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:56,240
 But yeah, going and watching the end of Rock Vault in Las Vegas last night.

810
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,920
 And they're supposed to go on tour.

811
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,180
 They might do a little bit of touring here and there or I know they're going to do some

812
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,260
 touring coming up.

813
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:05,280
 I don't know just how long that's going to last.

814
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:10,320
 But yeah, I mean, it's definitely the end of a crazy long thing.

815
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,320
 Matt's back.

816
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,000
 We're talking about Rock Vault closed in Las Vegas last night, Matt.

817
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 Oh yes, yes, yes, yes.

818
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 End of an era.

819
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,880
 It's heartbreaking too because losing that stratum of show, losing more of those kind

820
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:28,560
 of shows, because for a long time in Las Vegas, shows and entertainment in general was considered

821
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,240
 something of a loss leader.

822
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,640
 It was a way to get people into your property.

823
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:37,760
 And you would just, you know, comp some people tickets, charge low fees to have folks come

824
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,600
 and watch the show for a little bit.

825
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,560
 And it just got foot traffic into your venue and then got people gambling.

826
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,560
 That was the thing.

827
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,560
 Now.

828
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,120
 And it was, you know, it was the building that you were in owned the show that you were

829
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,040
 seeing in that building, right?

830
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,960
 And it was all, it was all part of the same ownership group that was doing everything.

831
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:02,840
 Now everything's four walled, if that, and you're still being treated as a loss leader,

832
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,200
 but you've got to try and make profit for yourself.

833
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,780
 And it's just kind of the whole, the whole thing is backwards.

834
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:12,480
 How to, you know, because now instead of Sid Caesar sitting up in the, in the office at

835
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,560
 Caesar's Palace, I assume he owned Caesar's Palace.

836
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,560
 It was Sid Caesar.

837
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,560
 Yes.

838
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,560
 Yeah.

839
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,760
 Instead of Sid sitting up there saying like, this is going to be here and this is going

840
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,760
 to be here.

841
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,160
 You know, he's just up there renting out rooms and like, Oh, you can come rent out my show

842
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:32,360
 room and put on a show and you can pay me a lot of money per week to use my show room.

843
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:36,440
 And I, I sure hope you sell tickets and you're able to make money and keep on paying me my

844
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,440
 rent.

845
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,440
 Right.

846
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,440
 Because that's what I care about.

847
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,440
 Good luck and God bless.

848
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,440
 Yep.

849
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,440
 They don't give a shit.

850
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,480
 Uh, and, and that's, that's just more bullshit because it's just different.

851
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,720
 I don't even look at that as a bad thing.

852
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,080
 I just look at that as a different thing.

853
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,680
 I look at it as a different setup.

854
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,800
 I think basically like, um, the problem is all these casinos that are still operating

855
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,800
 are holding on by a threat right now.

856
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,800
 Yes.

857
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,800
 No, that's it.

858
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,760
 And so like, there's no place to innovate or invest.

859
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,880
 And so they're all just saving their own asses.

860
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,960
 And so like basically innovation part, I think we're, I think we're hurting from the lack

861
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,960
 of innovation.

862
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:18,080
 Now someone new needs to see an opportunity in this space, specifically in Las Vegas strip

863
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,440
 to come in and do something crazy.

864
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,440
 And the last person tried was resorts world, which their big innovation was three hotels

865
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,120
 or one hotel Voltron Voltron was their plan.

866
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,400
 Remember the original plans for their resorts world member.

867
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,960
 They had a Panda habitat.

868
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,960
 They are going to have a stadium.

869
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,960
 They were going to have all this stuff.

870
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,840
 And then all of a sudden when, when push came to shove, it was no, just three hotels.

871
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,840
 Yeah.

872
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:44,200
 And, and so like it's going to take like a big sweeping thing from an order of magnitude.

873
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,280
 But basically these companies have all found a way to not go away.

874
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,000
 Like normally some of these companies would have shuttered in the past, which would let

875
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,720
 someone else come in and dig over a big exception is what's happening at the hard rock, uh, which

876
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,160
 Jacob point out before the show came out of where they're building a giant electric guitar

877
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,920
 tower that's going to change the, the look of the strip, whatever that's, that's a different,

878
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,840
 that's totally different casino company than the ones that have come in in the past.

879
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,960
 That's the, um, seminal, right.

880
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,560
 The seminal, the seminal tribe, I believe.

881
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,560
 Yeah.

882
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,480
 They own the hard rock, but even they like they're doing something like what they're doing.

883
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,480
 It's the old mirage.

884
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,800
 It used to be the MGM mirage and they tore down the volcano and everything in the, in

885
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,880
 the front of it.

886
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,040
 And they're building a giant guitar shaped, uh, tower of a hotel suites there in the,

887
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,040
 in the front.

888
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,640
 And then they're going to revamp the mirage towers as well and make that part of the hard

889
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:40,440
 rock and, uh, for people who don't know, but the guitar, even that's not even exactly innovation.

890
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,460
 That's something new in Vegas, but they're just copying something that they've already

891
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,460
 done in Miami.

892
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,460
 Right.

893
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:48,360
 They also had a big ass guitar in Vegas a couple of years ago.

894
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:54,560
 It wasn't as big, but they had, that was a big one in front of the old hard rock, uh,

895
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,560
 casino.

896
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,560
 This is a, yeah.

897
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,560
 Yeah.

898
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,560
 This is a building.

899
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,560
 No, I know.

900
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,560
 It's a, it's a mega structure at this point.

901
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,560
 Yeah.

902
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,560
 This is like, that was a big guitar set up in front of a building.

903
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,560
 This is an actual building.

904
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,560
 Yeah.

905
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,560
 It's pretty crazy.

906
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,560
 It's shaped like a guitar.

907
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,560
 Yeah.

908
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,560
 Anyways.

909
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,560
 Yeah.

910
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,560
 But rock rock fault is closing up, which is such a shame.

911
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,560
 I just went on disco last night.

912
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,560
 Disco is closing this weekend.

913
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:17,440
 Um, and, uh, but these are shows that these are shows that would have worked in the past

914
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,400
 where people are coming here going like, what should I do and what's around, you know?

915
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,640
 And, uh, it's just not, it's just not the way Vegas operates anymore.

916
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,920
 So in the short term, what would help is, uh, right.

917
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,200
 Maybe if foreigners didn't hate coming here, that would help a lot.

918
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,200
 Yeah.

919
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,200
 That might be a plus.

920
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,200
 Yep.

921
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:44,760
 I think they said, uh, November was the, uh, the biggest decline in air travel to Las Vegas

922
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:49,240
 since they started, uh, keep checking those numbers.

923
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,240
 Yeah.

924
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,240
 No, that's rough.

925
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,240
 Yeah.

926
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,240
 But I don't know.

927
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,240
 And the big picture thing is just a matter of it.

928
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,960
 Like we have, uh, we, with the sphere of the Raiders JDM, we have F one ourselves all the

929
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,840
 time is basically like when, when, when the whole, uh, when the whole town is taken up

930
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:08,880
 by one event that really hurts these side endeavors, cause now it's whether the crowd

931
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,240
 that's going to that one event also likes this.

932
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,720
 So does everyone going to see the wizard of Oz also want to see rock vault?

933
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,720
 I don't know.

934
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,440
 So then it's not that weekend that weekends out for rock vault, right?

935
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,920
 Like it's just a, it's just a weird thing.

936
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,120
 Uh, and I guess we also just say that we also are speaking from entertainers perspectives.

937
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,920
 Like we're, we're, we're pro entertainment.

938
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,920
 Of course.

939
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,880
 Um, because like, uh, uh, Leon brings up Macau and Macau has never been an entertainment

940
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,880
 space.

941
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,080
 It's always just been a gambling space that shows the shows.

942
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,440
 The shows in McAlvin and Torsley done terribly.

943
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,680
 Um, even way back in the, like, Franco Dragone's company, they, they had a show over there

944
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,960
 for a long time.

945
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,960
 That was spectacular.

946
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,400
 I mean, they, they had a, uh, I forget what the name of the show was, but it was, it was

947
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,400
 such a great show.

948
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,540
 I knew a lot of people in it, uh, just, just hella talented people over there.

949
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:58,380
 And boy, they just could not, they couldn't pay people to come watch that show.

950
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:03,080
 Yeah, and it was like a, a job, it was basically a giant Cirque de Soleil show.

951
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,800
 Uh, it was super impressive and they just couldn't get butts in the seats.

952
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,800
 No.

953
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,800
 And it'd be more gambling beyond that.

954
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,800
 Yeah.

955
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,800
 Beyond that.

956
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,800
 It was, uh, even the restaurants were doing well.

957
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,800
 Uh, it was the food, right?

958
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
 The food, if you were, if you opened up a spot in the food court, you were making money

959
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,800
 hand over fist.

960
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,680
 Cause that's what the gamblers could go there quickly, get food and come back or have some

961
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,560
 of the food court, bring the tape, bring it over to their, uh, bring it over to the table

962
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,920
 and eat at the table, get the food runners going.

963
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,920
 Yeah.

964
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,920
 Yeah.

965
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,600
 And it's still, it's a little different than, than here, but we'll see.

966
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:35,720
 I mean, the truth is that like, um, uh, tourism is down all over the place, you know, and

967
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,080
 that's because people below a certain class are experiencing a recession.

968
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,560
 People above a certain class are, are not.

969
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,440
 And um, and so it's, it's a, it's a weird time.

970
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,480
 Uh, it's a great time for the rich to get richer, which is like, thank God, cause I'm

971
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:54,600
 really as a, as a low end podcaster, I'm ready to make a move, you know, but, um, I gotta

972
00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:01,520
 shift these $10 around, Oh, this is a good time to bring up our scientific study.

973
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,640
 Give each of us a billion dollars and we're going to see if we can do better.

974
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,880
 I knew better than the current billionaires.

975
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,000
 I think we really, really could.

976
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,440
 I really, I really believe in me.

977
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,720
 I think we could do it.

978
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,720
 I, I'm, I'm very optimistic about us.

979
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,680
 I've, I've, uh, uh, you know, it's funny, it's like, what comes to like something does

980
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:25,760
 come to mind for me when I, when I do hear that, uh, basically Tony shades vision for

981
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,080
 all the downtown motels, uh, you know, that's all going away, right?

982
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:34,360
 They're about to demolish all those motels, but I really think there's a way to revitalize

983
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:39,880
 like a small downtown motel areas to do like really cool, distinct things with each motel

984
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:44,360
 to make it much more of like a kitschy place to come visit bar crawl and like, and spend

985
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:50,760
 some time and be away from resort fees and things like that, um, but, um, so there you

986
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,760
 go.

987
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,320
 So that's plan a for my billion dollars is, uh, is, uh, pick up Tony shape.

988
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,720
 We're Tony left off with the downtown motel hotel year.

989
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,720
 Yeah.

990
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,720
 That'd be fun.

991
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,720
 I think so.

992
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,360
 Uh, you know, who else I think would be fun to, uh, have them die and then take over their

993
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,360
 dream.

994
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,360
 Yes.

995
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,360
 And that would be the following sponsor.

996
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,960
 Today's show is brought to you by a compilation narrated by Jeffrey Jones.

997
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,400
 If it's okay, if this is too dark to air, but it's a long shot, wait, Oh, sorry.

998
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,960
 Bob Crane's video nasties, DVD compilation narrated by Jeffrey Jones.

999
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,840
 I don't know if I understand this joke.

1000
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,840
 I don't get it.

1001
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,840
 I do.

1002
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,840
 I do.

1003
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,840
 Is this too dark to do?

1004
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:34,120
 Well, Bob Crane was the star of Hogan's heroes and infamously a porn fanatic and made his

1005
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:40,720
 own porn and, uh, Jeffrey Jones is the principal from Ferris Bueller and the dad from Beetlejuice

1006
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,800
 been outed as a nefarious, uh, and, uh, yeah, yeah.

1007
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,800
 And bad guy.

1008
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,200
 Uh, they move along.

1009
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,720
 So yeah, we'll, I mean, it's a funny idea.

1010
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,720
 Yeah.

1011
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,720
 I don't know that I can execute it eloquently enough to make it funny and not.

1012
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,720
 That's it.

1013
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,160
 It's a, it's, it's our hay scoops at checkout.

1014
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,160
 Fair.

1015
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:10,700
 Today's show is brought to you by PTSD's Barnum and Bailey's all veteran circus equally

1016
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,700
 dark.

1017
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:20,320
 I think it was that it's the circus.

1018
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,080
 It's here.

1019
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,880
 Stay very quiet.

1020
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,480
 Don't get out of the ring.

1021
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,200
 Never get out of the ring.

1022
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:40,160
 Barnum and Bailey's PTSD circus is here to entertain you quietly.

1023
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:51,600
 We guarantee no explosions, no animals, nothing exciting or scary will happen in the PTSD

1024
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,260
 circus.

1025
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:59,960
 It's just clowns with no face paint falling.

1026
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,920
 That's it.

1027
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,160
 They just fall.

1028
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:09,920
 They just walk out onto the stage, fall down and they get, they get back up and they say,

1029
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,920
 they speak.

1030
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,080
 They say, Hey, I'm okay.

1031
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:20,440
 So you remember when you lost that good friend in denying, he went down.

1032
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,400
 He never got back up.

1033
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,720
 These clowns, they're going to stand up again and they're going to look you in the face

1034
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,040
 and say, Hey, I'm all right.

1035
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,040
 It's okay.

1036
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,040
 We can go home together.

1037
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:37,320
 Oh, no, no, no, that's too much.

1038
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,320
 That's too much.

1039
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,520
 You're getting people off.

1040
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,360
 Calm it down.

1041
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,040
 Never leave the ring.

1042
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,600
 Never get out of the ring.

1043
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,480
 That's pretty dark, but not as dark.

1044
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,480
 I don't know.

1045
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,480
 Maybe not as dark.

1046
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,480
 I don't know.

1047
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,480
 I don't have PTSD from war.

1048
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,480
 Thank God.

1049
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,480
 It or hate scoops at checkout.

1050
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,480
 I guess.

1051
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,480
 Let's do a little scoop mail.

1052
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,480
 Physical scoop mail, physical scoop mail, zippity doo.

1053
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,480
 We got mail in a box.

1054
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,480
 I love it.

1055
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,480
 We love it.

1056
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:10,240
 We got all our holiday cards here.

1057
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,960
 Happy New Year, everybody.

1058
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:20,120
 Oh, while we're in scoop mail, shout out to Craig Ruth, who just went up to the low tier

1059
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,000
 to the $20 tier for the year.

1060
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 Oh, awesome.

1061
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 Hell yeah.

1062
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 Thank you so much, Craig.

1063
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 Thank you, brother.

1064
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
 Yeah.

1065
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 Thank you, Craig.

1066
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,880
 Oh, we got one here from the Mass Hole Scoop, happiest holidays.

1067
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,600
 We love getting the card from the Mass Hole Scoop there.

1068
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,600
 These are great.

1069
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,080
 I love getting these.

1070
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,360
 The Maynards.

1071
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,960
 We got a great-looking family here, Seasons Greetings.

1072
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:46,200
 We got a dog with possibly a Hawaiian lei or something like that around its neck.

1073
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,200
 I like it.

1074
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,200
 Whatever it is.

1075
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,200
 That's adorable.

1076
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,200
 I'm a fan of it.

1077
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,840
 That's from Frozen Cusser.

1078
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,840
 Let's see here.

1079
00:45:54,840 --> 00:46:01,320
 Merry Cris Bosh to you and the guys and the churn and to your families.

1080
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,320
 Thank you.

1081
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,320
 So nice.

1082
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,320
 This is from...

1083
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,400
 Oh, that's from the Maple Raisin Scoop.

1084
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,400
 Very nice.

1085
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,400
 Let me see if I can get it on the camera.

1086
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,400
 There we go.

1087
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,400
 Kind of.

1088
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,400
 There we go.

1089
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,400
 Good.

1090
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,400
 We did.

1091
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,400
 We got a lot of Cris Bosh cards this year.

1092
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,400
 We got...

1093
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,400
 Oh, I like this one.

1094
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,400
 Peas on Earth.

1095
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,400
 Peas on Earth.

1096
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,400
 It's caroling peas.

1097
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,400
 Cute.

1098
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,400
 Very nice.

1099
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,360
 Oh, that's from Tess, the Slightly Slutty Scoop.

1100
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,280
 Sitting with you and yours, the very best for the holiday season.

1101
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,200
 Thanks for all you do for this amazing community.

1102
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,400
 Wishing you a Merry Cris Bosh.

1103
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,400
 Thank you, Tess.

1104
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,400
 What were you saying, Matt?

1105
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:38,200
 Just a lot of Iron content in the Peas Chorus.

1106
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,200
 A lot of good Iron.

1107
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,200
 Oh, yes.

1108
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,480
 Peas Chorus Hot.

1109
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,040
 Peas Chorus Cold.

1110
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:50,760
 Peas standing on your doorstep singing songs of old.

1111
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,760
 We got one here from the Nielsen Family.

1112
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,760
 Love that.

1113
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:55,760
 Very cute.

1114
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,240
 Matt and Jacob Paul got his on his own.

1115
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:04,960
 We wish you a sweltering and sweaty Cris Bosh.

1116
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,960
 We do have that.

1117
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:11,720
 May the new year be lucrative and sexy like your wives fucking you in the face.

1118
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,720
 That's the Nielsen's.

1119
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,720
 Hell, yeah.

1120
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,720
 And their pets.

1121
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:20,480
 Oh, we got a great one from LAJ, from the big twisty road in...

1122
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,480
 Oh, that's a cool looking print.

1123
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,480
 San Francisco.

1124
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,480
 Thanks, LAJ.

1125
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,480
 That's a cool looking print.

1126
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,480
 All the best for 2026.

1127
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,680
 Hope you're doing good, LAJ.

1128
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,680
 Yes.

1129
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,480
 Ah, let's see.

1130
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,080
 We got one here.

1131
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,080
 There is a Snowbuck's Coffee.

1132
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,160
 And let's see.

1133
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:41,680
 We got a snowman has ordered a hot coffee and he is back at the counter wanting to exchange

1134
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:48,920
 it for an iced coffee because it has melted the front of his face completely off.

1135
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:54,160
 Wishing you the best holiday season, Merry Cris Bosh.

1136
00:47:54,160 --> 00:48:03,660
 Wait, maybe despite being T DeVore, have we not been saying your name?

1137
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:04,660
 I don't know.

1138
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,540
 You also didn't put your name in this card.

1139
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:11,000
 You said, I haven't been saying your name as a Patreon member, but then you didn't sign

1140
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,280
 your name in the card.

1141
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:17,520
 So I'm looking at the return address, T DeVore, if we haven't been saying your name, maybe

1142
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,240
 it's because you haven't given me your name.

1143
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,240
 That's Travis.

1144
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,240
 Oh, Travis.

1145
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,760
 Have we not been saying your name?

1146
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,200
 Well, let's make sure we get that.

1147
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,200
 We got it.

1148
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,440
 I got to look at the list here.

1149
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,440
 Travis, we're sorry.

1150
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,440
 How is that possible?

1151
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,440
 We have a list.

1152
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,440
 It downloads from the site.

1153
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,440
 I don't know.

1154
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,440
 It's annoying.

1155
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,400
 I'm going to tell all the listeners right now, all you Patreon supporters out there

1156
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,960
 and anybody that's ever been a Patreon supporter of us and anyone that ever might be a Patreon

1157
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:48,440
 supporter of us, when you tell us something is wrong with Patreon, 85% of the time, we

1158
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,000
 are as confused as you are.

1159
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,320
 15% of the time, we fucked it up, but 85% of the time, we are just confused.

1160
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,320
 Yeah.

1161
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:00,920
 I was doing the newsletter again and that newsletter format is bunk.

1162
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,960
 It's bunkaroo, but I have to use it to include enough images.

1163
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,200
 I don't know.

1164
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,200
 It's weird.

1165
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,200
 Right.

1166
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:17,880
 This stuff is not at all conducive to anything, but Travis, thank you for the card and we'll

1167
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,120
 try and make sure we get you on the list.

1168
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,120
 We got this one.

1169
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,320
 This is a great one here.

1170
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,280
 Much love to you and everything you do, Luke, Angie, Pierce and Frank.

1171
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:31,040
 It is a great, a great Chris Bosch card.

1172
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,040
 Their card.

1173
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,040
 There.

1174
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,040
 I got one of their cards too.

1175
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:37,160
 That was an amazing Christmas Chris Bosch card this year from them.

1176
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,160
 The Andersons.

1177
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,160
 I love the Andersons.

1178
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:43,400
 They sent us a great Chris Bosch card as well and the Drabilises.

1179
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:49,200
 We got, we got one from, uh, from the Drabilises to Amy and Carl and kids.

1180
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,400
 And they got them next to the Dippin' Dots on the back.

1181
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,400
 Right?

1182
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,400
 Oh yeah.

1183
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,200
 They're standing next to the Dippin' Dots, uh, standing.

1184
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:02,440
 Did you talk about how SJ is playing New Year's Eve tonight over at the, uh, verge?

1185
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,440
 I haven't yet.

1186
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,440
 Uh, yeah.

1187
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:10,480
 Over at the, uh, well she's at Jason Aldean's bar at the, uh, the city center, uh, first.

1188
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,480
 Okay.

1189
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,280
 And then, uh, the Spice wannabe show, the Spice Girls show, they are playing at the

1190
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,240
 hard rock on the strip tonight.

1191
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,240
 That's pretty impressive.

1192
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,240
 Oh yeah.

1193
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,240
 That's a big deal.

1194
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,240
 Yeah.

1195
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,240
 They're booked there.

1196
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,240
 I think I'm going to run over and see at least the, uh, the second half of the show.

1197
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,760
 Um, I think it's going to be great.

1198
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,760
 Let's see.

1199
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,760
 Let's make a good get.

1200
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:31,760
 Let's make a big, big get.

1201
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,760
 Yeah, I think so.

1202
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,160
 They've got a lot of, uh, a lot of tour dates and everything this year.

1203
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,540
 I think they're, they've got some, they've got some new dates coming up here.

1204
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:39,160
 Well, it's going to be good.

1205
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,160
 It's a great show.

1206
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,160
 It is.

1207
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,160
 It is.

1208
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,160
 It works super hard.

1209
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:48,160
 Let's do a little jock versus a nerd.

1210
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:55,760
 Ladies and gentlemen, it is jock.

1211
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:05,560
 Jamie and Carl's last name, Lori is fussing at me in the chat about saying your last name.

1212
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:16,400
 I always say, well, part of it is I hear it said, it's, it's one of these things.

1213
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,480
 I hear the name said and I can say it, but then when I see it written out, it fucks me

1214
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,000
 up again.

1215
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,960
 I can't see it written out and say it.

1216
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:25,960
 Yes.

1217
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:30,440
 Anyway, we've got a scooper coming to us today from lemur screamer creamer.

 Oh, this has become like a real gentleman's created a monster here.

00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,440
 I see it.

1228
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,440
 I found it.

1229
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,440
 Echidna.

1230
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,160
 It's just in one word.

1231
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,160
 Okay.

1232
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:23,480
 Doll doll jack, the infamous doll don't go near the doll enclosure.

 It'll bite your fucking face off.

1234
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:31,440
 Actually, I've worked in the doll enclosure, uh, at the haunted museum.

1235
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,440
 What can I say?

1236
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,080
 That's what happened to Paul's face.

1237
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,080
 That's what happened.

1238
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,080

00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:44,080
 And a million lion, lion, a million.

1244
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,080
 You lie.

1245
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:50,480
 You, uh, sounds the same for 400 a bucket lacking color.

00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,760
 Oh, I, I, uh, pale, a pale.

1247
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,760
 It sounds the same.

1248
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,760
 Yeah.

1249
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,760
 It sounds the same.

1250
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,760
 It sounds the same.

1251
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:09,920
 Paul, uh, I will go with, uh, sounds the same for eight, please.

1252
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,920
 All right.

1253
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:20,920
 A type of tree and by the seashore, a type of tree by the seashore.

1254
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:28,840
 Uh, Oh, uh, a beach, beach tree, beach nut, beach tree.

1255
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,840
 Yeah.

1256
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,840
 Yeah, absolutely.

1257
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:36,320
 I did not know that a beach tree and a ocean beach were not spelled the same.

1258
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:46,240
 The only way I know it is because of all the baby food that beach nut B E E C H. Oh, baby

1259
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,240
 food.

1260
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,240
 Yeah.

1261
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,920
 I mean, I just unload fuck tons of it every week.

1262
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:55,080
 That's all I see it going to put it right into a package for Jeffrey Jones and then

1263
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,080
 mail it off.

1264
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,080
 Oh, Rose.

1265
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,080
 Rose.

1266
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,080
 Matt, you're up.

1267
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:05,760
 Uh, it sounds the same for 1200, I would probably be doing a lot better if I was eating just

1268
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:16,080
 baby food, a corridor or to drag card cargo hallway all the way.

1269
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:19,960
 Oh, a hall hall hall and hall.

1270
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,960
 Yeah.

1271
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,560
 Hall and hall.

1272
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:30,360
 That's what Darrell Oates fears the most dueling holes and what is the status of their lawsuit?

1273
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:34,000
 They were in a nasty lawsuit for, they are still very acrimonious.

1274
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
 They still hate each other.

1275
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,140
 Yeah.

1276
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,400
 The one guy bit the other guy.

1277
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:47,480
 No, no, allegedly no, uh, Hall is just like, Hall is just like, I just want to be Darrell

1278
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:51,240
 Hall and Oates is but, but me, but you need the Oats.

1279
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:57,080
 Oh, the lawsuit ended in August of 2025, Darrell Hall voluntarily dismissed his legal action

1280
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:01,720
 against John Oates following private arbitration that resolved their disputes over Oats attempts

1281
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:07,000
 to shell to share or to sell his share business.

1282
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,440
 That's their greatest hits album.

1283
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,880
 It's called private arbitration.

1284
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:10,880
 Yeah.

1285
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:16,160
 So apparently hall dismissed the lawsuit against oats.

1286
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,360
 Private arbitration is how we settle our differences.

1287
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:23,060
 Me and Darrell Hall get along again.

1288
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,060
 Private arbitration.

1289
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,060
 Yep.

1290
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,060
 Clap.

1291
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:27,060
 Clap.

1292
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,060
 I'm still mad at them for writing man eaters, so I don't care.

1293
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:29,060
 Uh, I'll try.

1294
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:30,060
 It sounds the same for 200.

1295
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:33,480
 2000 writing man eater.

1296
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,360
 I'm still mad at them about man eater.

1297
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:43,920
 So, uh, fuck them permitted or in a whisper, in a whisper, in a whisper, don't you know

1298
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:51,840
 talking about our revolution, permitted whisper, uh, I'm not trying to give you a hint, Jacob.

1299
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,680
 I'm just doing a Tracy Chapman reference.

1300
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,680
 No, no, no.

1301
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,680
 I caught that.

1302
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,680
 I caught that.

1303
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:57,680
 You weren't helping.

1304
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:12,960
 Uh, permitted or in a whisper, is this allowed?

1305
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:13,960
 That's what I'm thinking.

1306
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:14,960
 Yeah.

1307
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,320
 But in a, in a whisper is confusing on.

1308
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,320
 Yeah.

1309
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:22,200
 But I mean, it's, it's, you know, instead of, yeah, instead of silently, I guess so.

1310
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,200
 I guess, yeah.

1311
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,200
 I'll try that.

1312
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,200
 Allowed and allowed.

1313
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,200
 Yeah, there we go.

1314
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,200
 There it is.

1315
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,200
 In a whisper.

1316
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,200
 Uh, Paul.

1317
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,200
 This is Waffarthian.

1318
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:35,100
 Uh, I'll do mommy for 400.

1319
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,100
 Daily double.

1320
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,440
 Mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy.

1321
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,440
 Mommy.

1322
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,320
 This Catholic nun won the Nobel peace prize in 1979.

1323
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,320
 Mother Teresa.

1324
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,320
 Mother Teresa.

1325
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,320
 That's right.

1326
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,320
 Ooh, mommy.

1327
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,320
 Matt, you're up.

1328
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:54,320
 Um, I'll do, uh, animals and camels.

1329
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:59,000
 800.

1330
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,160
 She's a total shit bird.

1331
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,680
 The prize bracelets were handed out at the carnival.

1332
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,520
 The prize bracelets were handed out at the carnival.

1333
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,520
 Zebra.

1334
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,520
 Zebra.

1335
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,520
 It is zebra.

1336
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,520
 Zebra.

1337
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,520
 It's me.

1338
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,520
 I'll try.

1339
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:21,040
 Man, you guys are so much better at that animal one than I am.

1340
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:28,320
 I'm going to try milk for 400, milk, milk, milk, pecorino Romano cheese comes from this

1341
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:33,060
 animal.

1342
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:35,760
 Is it not a cow?

1343
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,760
 It's a mouse.

1344
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,480
 It's probably not.

1345
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,480
 Is it a goat cheese?

1346
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,480
 Is it a goat cheese?

1347
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,480
 Pecorino.

1348
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,480
 Pecorino.

1349
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,480
 Maybe it's a sheep.

1350
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,480
 Pecorino.

1351
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,480
 Maybe it's a sheep.

1352
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:46,480
 Could be.

1353
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:55,400
 Uh, or is this one of those, uh, like you, you get a cheese from the, uh, from all the

1354
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,800
 lady bacterias that are down in the lady bits.

1355
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:02,320
 It's, it's Pecorino Romano from unda cheese.

1356
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,320
 Is it from unda cheese?

1357
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:10,920
 Is it lady bit cheese, from unda cheese?

1358
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,920
 That's why I don't eat that pecorino Romano.

1359
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,040
 Uh, I guess I'll pass.

1360
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,040
 Paul.

1361
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:20,640
 Uh, give me some of that from under, um, I'll have a smear of that on my bagel, please.

1362
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,640
 Oh, here you go.

1363
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:22,640
 Pecorino.

1364
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,640
 Oh, my brother is huge.

1365
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,000
 He wants to fuck my wife.

1366
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
 Um, fast.

1367
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
 Uh, Matt.

1368
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
 Pass.

1369
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
 It's sheep.

1370
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
 It's sheep.

1371
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
 That's a sheep cheese.

1372
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
 Sheep, sheep shenanigans.

1373
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000

1762
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,920
 Oh, I like you a lot.

 Thank you so much.

01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:39,960
 Thank you so much.

1765
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:44,520
 If you want to be thanked on air or get all kinds of different rewards that we offer,

1766
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:49,200
 head on over to preaching fun.com and look at the tier that fits your budget today.

1767
01:08:49,200 --> 01:09:09,000
 Or if you like me, we're a little upset that Howard lease wasn't wearing his enormous knife

1768
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,700
 on his hip for the last show of rock vault.

1769
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:23,040
 Head on over to fartsinabag.biz.

1770
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:27,120
 That's fartsinabag.biz that along with preaching fun.com, it takes you over to our Patreon page

1771
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:31,640
 where for as little as a $3 a month, you can help keep this show on the air.

1772
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:36,480
 We are dependent on our Patreon supporters, so you are really helping keep the show trucking.

1773
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:42,520
 If you like this show, if you think it's good, head over preaching fun.com fartsinabag.biz

1774
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:46,080
 like I say, for as little as $3 a month and you can do it yearly.

1775
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,780
 If you want to do that, you can, you can do your whole support for the year.

1776
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:49,780
 You don't have to do it monthly.

1777
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:52,720
 If you don't want to and you get a bit of a discount, if you want to do it for the year,

1778
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:56,060
 if you want to sign up for all of 26, you can do that.

1779
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:57,520
 You can do it month by month.

1780
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,300
 That is perfectly fine.

1781
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:00,300
 And you can give gifts.

1782
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:06,840
 You can give the gift of a Patreon subscription to someone that you either love or hate.

1783
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:10,400
 Depending on how you think they will like this show, you can give them the gift of us

1784
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,400
 for all of 2026.

1785
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:14,400
 That's right.

1786
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:15,400
 All right.

1787
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,400
 Well, thanks for this everybody.

1788
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:17,400
 Stay safe out there.

1789
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:18,400
 We love you and we'll see you soon.

1790
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,400
 Happy new year everybody.

1791
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:20,400
 Happy new year.

1792
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,400
 Happy new year.

1793
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:22,400
 We need to go over our big resolutions.

1794
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,400
 This is a big deal.

1795
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:31,400
 Oh yeah.

1796
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:43,920
 Any quick ones?

1797
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:47,920
 Resolution speed around.

1798
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:48,920
 Spanish.

1799
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:49,920
 Paul.

1800
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:50,920
 1080p.

1801
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:51,920
 Oh good.

1802
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:52,920
 Eat better after 10 p.m.

1803
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:53,920
 I think so.

1804
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:54,920
 1080p is pretty high.

1805
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:55,920
 It is pretty high.

1806
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:56,920
 It's pretty high.

1807
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:57,920
 None of us want to see us in 4K.

1808
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:58,920
 No, no.

1809
01:10:58,920 --> 01:10:59,920
 That's why I didn't go there.

1810
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:00,920
 Who is watching movies for nose hairs?

1811
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:01,920
 I mean, come on.

1812
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:02,920
 We are not made for high def.

1813
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:03,920
 What are we doing?

1814
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:04,920
 Pop the brakes.

1815
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:05,920
 Every time I see like, you know, they take the old footage and upgrade it and make it

1816
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:06,920
 all high def and everything.

1817
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:07,920
 I'm like, oh, you were, you were just hurting these performers who never thought they would

1818
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:08,920
 be seeing this clearly.

1819
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:09,920
 There is something.

1820
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:10,920
 I'm like, oh, you were, you were just hurting these performers who never thought they would

1821
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:11,920
 be seeing this clearly.

1822
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:12,920
 I'm like, oh, you were, you were just hurting these performers who never thought they would

1823
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:22,960
 be seeing this clearly.

1824
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:34,080
 There is something to that 30 FPS grain film quality that makes it so much more theatrical,

1825
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:37,080
 like fairy tale, dreamlike.

1826
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:38,880
 It removes it from reality a little more.

1827
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:39,880
 Right.

1828
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:40,880
 And it looks so real.

1829
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:41,880
 And it looks like a movie.

1830
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,440
 It's not what I was raised on, but it looks like a movie.

1831
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:48,120
 When I see that smoothing and all that shit, I'm just like, get that the fuck out.

1832
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:49,840
 I'm watching the Neutron.

1833
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:50,840
 I just get, I just get so hard.

1834
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:51,840
 The Neutron.

1835
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:52,840
 I see all that smoothed out skin.

1836
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:53,840
 It was so hard.

1837
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:56,920
 Half of it, no, but half of the Neutron looks like a goddamn soap opera set.

1838
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,560
 I'm like, what the fuck?

1839
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,840
 Why would you do this to your billion dollar show?

1840
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:02,840
 I don't get it.

1841
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:03,840
 Love you everybody.

1842
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,840
 See ya.

1843
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:11,920
 Life moves fast, it's fierce, persistent, determined.

1844
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:15,680
 At City of Hope Cancer Center, we are too.
