 suppose employee although that feels weird it feels we paid very little but

21
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,800
 yes but Annie is Annie is moving on from us our dear friend Annie is moving on

22
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,940
 with us from us she has been with us since the beginning of patreon at the

23
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,440
 very least we launched our patreon and then immediately expressed how

24
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,800
 overwhelmed we are by our own creation yep yep and she emailed us and said I

25
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,560
 will help organize this for you and then continue to do so for I guess I don't

26
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:38,920
 even know how long I mean I have I mean I mean we probably did patreon on our own

27
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,200
 for like a month before she swooped in and was like yeah here let me just let

28
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,880
 me just take care of you sweet sweet children lost in the woods it's very

29
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,280
 important to note you know and I think I really think is just Annie being

30
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,800
 respectful like I think she's just a first-class person started finish it's

31
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:02,000
 simply that like when we started we had like seven tears we had a bunch of bonus

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,120
 rewards for people who were on for more than three months right we had all kinds

33
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,800
 of different deliverables that we were thought you know that we could do if we

34
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,160
 had all the time in the world and then quickly realized that we don't have all

35
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:20,560
 the time in the world but Annie kept all of these things organized for us all the

36
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:28,320
 time and more importantly fielded emails from patreon yes I ordered what is

37
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:37,920
 happen I ordered all you can eat video whatever hands-free eating video and so

38
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,440
 long ago when we were first figuring out what our patreon was going to look like

39
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,800
 this is great we're just gonna go down memory lane now that we're talking about

40
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,040
 any when we first figured out what our patreon was gonna look like we just

41
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,480
 threw so many ideas at the wall and I think Paul I think Paul said the hands

42
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,960
 free eating yeah yes I'm sure I did and Matt and I just went both of us like Paul

43
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,040
 explained to us what he was thinking he said well we'll make a video where we go

44
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,840
 to a restaurant we will order food and then we'll eat that food without using

45
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,920
 our hands and and Matt and I just said like oh yeah yeah that is something we

46
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:23,000
 should do yeah no problem and no issue just right on there because our early

47
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,720
 patron was like hey let's pay for our gas and a meal once in a while that was

48
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:38,440
 our goal for the patreon and so yeah no I mean it was ridiculous and you know

49
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,240
 all the things we've learned we've talked to other people who start a

50
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:47,360
 patreon or sort of you know it's interesting and then now we've really

51
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,440
 simplified things here on a picture more than ever most because we kind of

52
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,640
 discovered that we're such a community that like watching us do stuff or

53
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,280
 making us do stuff it seems to be less interesting to our listeners than

54
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,200
 making sure that we all hang out or create social opportunities for each

55
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,480
 other like all you have to do to get us to do a hands-free eating video now is

56
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:16,520
 convince us that it's gonna be funny and we'll probably just do it if we can if

57
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:39,680
 you want a hands-free video for me I need a skateboard and a stick a ramp of

58
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,960
 food that can go down towards my mouth a new competitor entering the arena

59
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:53,920
 between team slide and team swing skateboarding skateboard with a skateboard

60
00:05:53,920 --> 00:06:01,720
 catapult yeah oh the whispers to your oh something else if we hit a goal we

61
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,280
 actually came close this month to hitting a bonus goal for the first time

62
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:10,040
 in a long time we felt everyone just short which would be no means a bonus

63
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,120
 episode and just before we got on there we even brainstorming new ways to do

64
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,360
 bonus episodes and what about some we're in good shape to work I think we had a

65
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,600
 good idea we're in good shape without any to deliver a brand new bonus

66
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,440
 episode should we get there so please don't let this reorganization hold you

67
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:33,200
 back for support we still need you and by need you I mean we are completely

68
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:40,280
 reliant on you but yeah I mean you know yes we gave her a stipend but it was a

69
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,640
 charitable stipend and so I mean it really was just her helping us out for a

70
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,920
 decade and so she will be I feel like she wrote off the time that she worked

71
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,840
 for us as a charity donation on her time yeah and that'd be fair we would back

72
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,520
 that up at the IRS yeah I was sure I don't think any court would convict her

73
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,720
 no we're basically when it comes to us running a company we're basically make a

74
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:12,840
 wish I just got a random link texted to me from a random phone number wanting me

75
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:19,800
 to reset my Instagram password I got that from Google today too yeah I think I

76
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:29,720
 don't know you know I think maybe yeah maybe the line the US infrastructure

77
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:37,320
 might be hanging by a thread I think we're probably fine thank you Annie you

78
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,920
 have been our champion for years we are going to miss you in ways that we don't

79
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:48,280
 understand yet so so thank you so much we're gonna run into issues over the

80
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,920
 next weeks and months and we're gonna be like fuck Annie was just taking care of

81
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,800
 this and we didn't realize it I know that's going to happen so thank you so

82
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,720
 much Annie we very much appreciate you and everything you have done for us and

83
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,560
 for this community over the years she was a huge part of making this the

84
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,880
 success that it is yeah and always will be Annie Annie will henceforth be always

85
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,800
 welcome at any ice cream social event yeah anything that we ever do for all

86
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,440
 time Annie is forever welcome yeah and it's just in yarn and sticks is saying I

87
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,080
 hope Annie gets free membership for life I think we can yes Annie has whatever

88
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,720
 she wants get her she might be sick of us guys so it's not it's easy up on the

89
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,680
 rewards but she wants to stay away from us I get that too well I don't think

90
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,360
 we're you know I think she has access to the patreon stuff to a degree I don't

91
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,680
 think we're taking that away so we're not we're not scouring to reset all the

92
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:52,000
 passwords I haven't been resetting the door codes this morning I'll need your

93
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,360
 keys in your badge Annie yeah and if you're badgered your gun give me your

94
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:07,360
 gun give me a gun I don't care hand me any gun any gun any badge any gun broken

95
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,120
 is right and he's probably the only one who remembers the passwords that's

96
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,000
 absolutely that is true she has not received the last email or phone call

97
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,840
 from us that's for sure my last email to her was expressing thank yous and all

98
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:29,280
 the stuff and like and maybe could you just put a list together

99
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:41,160
 thank you so much Eddie that was so wonderfully appreciated yeah so I had a

100
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,240
 weird week I went to um went downtown the other night went downtown on Monday

101
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,720
 night we're not starting there I tell you where we're starting okay you went

102
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,960
 to a football game with with pod therapy is where we're starting I did I went on

103
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,720
 Sunday I went to a football game with pod there this is where football why

104
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,960
 football rules like like when you look at American sports like football is just

105
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:11,440
 in its own fucking category in terms of success you I would say I three three

106
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,000
 other friends JD who directed is directing the hey scoops movie sure my

107
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,760
 friend Alice who has the offensive crayon purposely offensive crayons all

108
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:28,080
 went to this game and I went to bust balls with everyone I think so maybe JD

109
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,400
 after the fact during the game because you were at what I would think is the

110
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:40,680
 dumbest football game on earth so if you don't follow sports it's the last week

111
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:46,040
 of the season okay the Raiders were already the most terrible team number

112
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,720
 one draft yes locked up they're bringing but at the beginning of the day we

113
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,040
 didn't know that we thought the only thing that was going to matter on the

114
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,680
 day was that the Raiders needed to lose to lock up the number one draft pick and

115
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,840
 then right before the game started they come over the PA in the stadium they're

116
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,240
 like hey the Giants just upset the cow or just lost to the Cowboys or upset the

117
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,320
 Cowboys or beat the cow whichever one they did yeah Giants just beat the

118
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,040
 Cowboys which solidifies the Raiders getting that number one draft pick now

119
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,440
 that's not even on the table and that's like another table the Chiefs come to

120
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,200
 town there's no Mahomes he's injured Patrick Mahomes is injured he's out

121
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:29,160
 now he's a probably the last game did they come to the game there yeah yeah

122
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,560
 he was at the game I'm out there wasn't he I don't know I thought he was there I

123
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,400
 thought somebody told me he was there I don't fucking know I don't watch your

124
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,960
 breaks you asked us then Jacob and I were clarifying with each other can you

125
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:47,080
 just give us a second I thought he was there I thought somebody told me that he

126
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:52,560
 was there because it was probably Kelsey's last game yeah both teams

127
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,120
 started yes yeah Kelsey might retire he's probably retiring Travis Kelsey yeah

128
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:08,280
 he's my age he's old he's also married to the gajillionaire that Brady it's

129
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:13,000
 true that is true yeah but second most money and it but somebody made the

130
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,120
 second most amount of money in his marriage and that did not stop him I

131
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:22,840
 don't know because he hated his family he had to go back to my kids anybody

132
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:30,400
 hiring Giselle is a way I'll spend time in Tampa Giselle is a certified which

133
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,360
 careful she also knows a black belt buddy she'll kick your ass I ain't saying

134
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,680
 anything negative about it I was wondering how powerful which Taylor

135
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:45,400
 Swift is in comparison I wonder I guess pretty powerful wonder as well either way

136
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,240
 I feel like Travis Kelsey's gonna land on his feet somewhere I'm saying there's

137
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,640
 absolutely nothing on the line Raiders absolute worst team they're playing they

138
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,360
 are the worst both teams played multiple not one but multiple backup

139
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:06,240
 quarterbacks oh so many quarterbacks and no one could score a touchdown no and it

140
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,960
 was just a field goal festival for the first half and I'm texting you and I'm

141
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,680
 texting house and I'm busting balls like all right happy field goals yeah like

142
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,560
 basically like why are you at this game it's so dumb that sounds like an old

143
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:28,880
 that sounds like a Steelers game playing the whole game with nothing on the line

144
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:36,760
 it comes down to a field goal and the Raiders win drill it 14 to 12 they

145
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,320
 scored 14 points with no touchdowns which is a miracle they have scored a

146
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:48,240
 safety at some point scored a safety in there and people went fucking wild like

147
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,560
 it was great and all of my ball busting fell on deaf ears because it was like

148
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:59,960
 whatever that was fucking amazing and I was like this is why football wins like

149
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,820
 that is by far the dumbest game like right now it's a Brooklyn Nets beat the

150
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:13,080
 Wizards on a last second shot right like like when when the NBA has futility it

151
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:19,900
 is futility yes when you are watching the backup of backups play against each

152
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:29,920
 other to win by a field goal kick and everyone is like it's like what what

153
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:36,400
 this is what football has won this football has won I mean we went in large

154
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,400
 part because it was a meaningless game of course the tickets she bought tickets

155
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,940
 that morning yeah yeah we were on the 13th row on the on the 40 yard line so

156
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:51,200
 we had killer seats right and yeah we just had we went to we went knowing it

157
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,760
 was a meaningless game knowing that neither team was gonna really care the

158
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,200
 backups were gonna be the ones that care they are the guys they're playing for

159
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,920
 jobs they care and of course everybody's professional so I mean they're they're

160
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,000
 still going out there and doing the thing and yeah it was it was so much fun

161
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,520
 it was the most relaxed sporting event I've ever been to there were there were

162
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,400
 Kansas City Chiefs fans sitting directly in front of us we were just having nice

163
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,400
 conversations the whole game and would like razz each other with that when our

164
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,640
 team did well of their team didn't do well just everybody was just having a

165
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,360
 good time just a quick check in with our listeners here Jeff Loomis in the chat

166
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,360
 says I'm so disconnected from the NBA this is the first time I heard the Nets

167
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,200
 are now in Brooklyn and not New Jersey Jeff they moved there before I moved to

168
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:45,080
 Las Vegas I used to be a Nets fan you are behind on that I used to be a Nets

169
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,720
 fan and they and they moved to Brooklyn and I'm such a Jersey guy that I was

170
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,120
 pissed because there was a superior deal offered to them for them to play in New

171
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,920
ark yeah and they took this really shady real estate deal so this guy Bruce

172
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,280
 Ratner could basically own all the property around the stadium and Bruce

173
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,740
 Ratner moved the team to Brooklyn and immediately sold the team and kept the

174
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,520
 rights to the land and everything around it it was such a fucking it was such a

175
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,200
 fucking piece of shit deal I mean I know it moved them out of New Jersey but have

176
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:19,640
 you ever heard of a more New Jersey deal than that come on they finished in style

177
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:30,200
 as they say but yeah Jeff it's been at least before 2008 I don't know what year

178
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,840

 What's that?

217
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,480
 I don't

218
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,480
 I don't either

219
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,480
 Okay

220
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:37,880
 Monday night we uh we went downtown SJ and I we go downtown we had a rare night off together

221
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,520
 and so my wife and I said oh we're gonna go out and and hit the town we'll go

222
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,920
 find some dinner we called a couple of friends and said hey we're gonna go

223
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,480
 down to Fremont Street and walk around maybe find a little music find a little

224
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,360
 food see what see what the night brings us so we went down downtown we went

225
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,000
 downtown head down to Fremont Street what we say gentlemen would we say this

226
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:06,520
 is version 5 version 6 of Fremont at this point it's a resting version 5 it's

227
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,160
 a it's a slightly slightly adjusted improved like you know they do like the

228
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,840
 point the decimal points on different versions of stuff but it's okay I'd say

229
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:22,200
 I'd say we're like 5.5 of that makes sense okay I think so Jeff Loomis you

230
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,360
 are not completely wrong I am I am in a small minority of Las Vegas locals that

231
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,440
 goes and does stuff on the strip in downtown that's true mainly I mean the

232
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,800
 strip part is because my my work takes me there it's rare that we go to the

233
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,760
 strip without work taking us there but downtown is a different animal but yeah

234
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,640
 so we head down we we listen to a little bit of music there's a band that SJ

235
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,160
 might work with a little bit and we wouldn't listen to them a little bit

236
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,920
 which was nice and and then we see we did a very Las Vegas tourist thing we

237
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:58,320
 saw a billboard for a special at one of the steak houses at the I should give a

238
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,080
 shout out here the Fremont the Fremont Casino down on Fremont Street they had a

239
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:11,680
 special starting at 9 p.m. 1799 for a steak and lobster dinner hey that is

240
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:16,000
 that's a nice old-school Vegas touch right there can't beat that with a stick

241
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,800
 so we said you can't be that they're trying to be old Vegas and we talked

242
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,040
 that we've talked about like Vegas a lot on the obviously and there's a hearing

243
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:34,120
 this week local businesses are trying to stop Las Vegas the town from raising

244
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,480
 parking prices and expanding paid parking and they're basically their

245
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:56,040
 argument is their argument is like the fuck I follow of course our good buddy

246
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:00,360
 Troy heard who is one of the key motivators down there in the Arts

247
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:07,920
 District yeah with with the theater and majestic doing his thing and his you

248
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,640
 know his feed has just been so sad to keep up with they are just trying to

249
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,280
 fuck the Arts District yeah and they're just trying it's just nickel and diamond

250
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:24,280
 it's just the worst kind of nickel and diamond and it is being done with it

251
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,240
 seemed it sure seems like from an outside point of view it's being done

252
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:32,480
 with zero for thought not only zero for thought Jacob it seems with some level

253
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:40,480
 of malicious intent as there are now security guards parking security guards

254
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:47,880
 out there who are former police and they are carrying guns like what's one thing

255
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,680
 to have a meter made on duty it's another thing to have an armed guard

256
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:57,840
 patrolling your parking spaces just me getting pistol whipped as my as my chip

257
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,120
 won't scan on the parking meter right exactly it's like it's like I just came

258
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,700
 down here to watch my kid in a new version of Cinderella I hear what you're

259
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:13,240
 shut I hear what you're saying dance I hear what you're saying and I appreciate

260
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,600
 what you're saying I don't see that as a change

261
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:23,340
 lost Las Vegas security guards it is easy to have the to have the license here to

262
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:29,720
 be an armed security guard and also it's an open carry state so like having more

263
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:35,840
 having more guns around is what while I don't love it it's not a surprise but do

264
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,640
 you do either of you recall running into that on the regular in the arts district

265
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:48,800
 I arts district is so new relatively okay but I mean but like I I oh no no

266
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:54,600
 it's definitely changing I don't I'm saying I never saw armed guards parking

267
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:00,600
 lots down in the arts district ever you know that that's I mean the argument

268
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,720
 likely isn't like I guess I want to be able to fucking pull heat on some you

269
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,840
 know scoff laws it's that right if you're gonna send me downtown working

270
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,560
 late at night I would like to be armed is what they're doing because it yeah

271
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:22,520
 outside I'd like to be armed everywhere I go but that's not good

272
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:30,040
 are you with that well I mean I'm just taking a quick vote and nope nobody

273
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:34,200
 wants Paul to be armed I've got my adamantium claws that retract and you

274
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,160
 know so I can we're actually gonna take those away from you oh no I'm not I'm

275
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,640
 not comfortable with you having those grafted to my bones nope sorry we're

276
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:47,080
 taking them is on fire in the chat today Jeff insists you know what raising

277
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,240
 parking prices means that this might be a spot available and I'm willing to pay

278
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,840
 a premium for it Jeff if you lived here I'd tell you to move but you don't even

279
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,360
 live here oh shut up and get lost and Jeff I'll tell you the the downtown

280
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:06,200
 parking situation I don't think again just looking at from an outsider point

281
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:11,240
 of view it sure doesn't seem like it has been affected the business side of it

282
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,400
 has been affected by these parking rate changes yeah it's the look like this is

283
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,960
 that are saying let they want locals to come on down there breeze in grab right

284
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,080
 eat see you see a show go home no problem and that should be the way our

285
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,520
 arts district work it's us it's locals it's for us also we are like our taxes

286
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,720
 already paid for the fucking streets why I'm having to pay again to park on my

287
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:42,760
 street yes we're Jacob you're ready Jacob in this country it's insane yeah

288
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,040
 there is a meeting happening today we're not gonna be able to go to it but there

289
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:51,840
 is a community meeting happening in my neighborhood today about a new church

290
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,080
 that is wanting to be built nearby people are up in arms

291
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:05,480
 right argument it should be I hope they did fuck off get the fuck out how close

292
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:12,400
 to your house pretty close okay like other side of kind of the the block and

293
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,880
 everything from me but like as the crow flies should this should this go through

294
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:24,560
 and get squirrely in your neighborhood how much of a possibility is there for

295
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:32,480
 us as ICS to try and file for church status at that point trying to try and

296
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,720
 solve some things I mean it would it would automatically lessen our tax

297
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:41,300
 burden which I mean we would definitely get away with it at least through the

298
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:46,520
 current administration until the IRS gets beefed back up yeah you're right

299
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,160
 we'd have three good years of skating so I would have minimum three good years

300
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:55,120
 probably more like ten so yeah let's let's fucking go I mean this is fucking

301
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,600
 also like the way your neighborhood is set up right like you have the wall

302
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,440
 there and stuff you can put whatever st. Annick sculpture you want like right

303
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,800
 there yeah yeah just have like we could do anything I got I was genuinely I have

304
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,960
 trees and I have some palm trees in front of my house and I have been

305
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,080
 genuinely considering hiring somebody to come carve tiki figures into the living

306
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:22,440
 palm trees ooh can that is that safe for the palm tree I'm told that it is

307
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,320
 really I would I would look into that a little more before doing it for sure I'm

308
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,640
 not this is this is an idea that I'm playing with I'm just saying it to say

309
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,800
 that I just put ridiculous things out in front of my house you can carve six six

310
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:37,760
 six into the trunks of those no problem right in there it won't be too damaging

311
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:46,500
 all right not a cult ish correct so we head downtown we enjoy our $18 steak and

312
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:53,480
 lobster which by the way was delicious was it not was it like crawdad times or

313
00:28:53,480 --> 00:29:00,160
 was it lobster tail nice nice lobster tail a little cup of the drawn butter

314
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:05,080
 which I mean who doesn't love a nice cup of drawn butter that's right he yeah a

315
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,180
 little ghee for you I actually I poured water I poured butter into this can

316
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:15,120
 that's I'm drinking right now good slicks your slicks up your blood vessel

317
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,120
 walls make sure to make your blood move quicker keeps the vocal cords nice and

318
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:26,600
 lubed perhaps blue ribbon butter Jeff Loomis says in the in the chat cost more

319
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,480
 than 17 bucks to buy a decent quality steak at the grocery store that is true

320
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:37,040
 this steak costs less than $17 at the grocery store but I would put it I would

321
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:46,880
 put it on par with an outback not terrible at all like a street mugging

322
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:56,720
 kind of steak sounds thin nice thick steak nice thick steak is that a full

323
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,800
 measurement you put up with the screen is it also that big round as well it's

324
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:11,400
 and a half right yeah that's that's girth girth and with oh they said oh we

325
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,800
 asked the waiter said what does it come with he goes oh it's steak lobster and a

330
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,160
 cost didn't ask how much the loading cost but it came out you know food came

331
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:39,160

 so you were at the Fremont enjoying this meal so we went to the Fremont enjoyed

361
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,720
 this meal and then we go over to this to this new establishment called Pachi

362
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:50,240
 Pachi reference to Fremont it is a walk from Fremont but just a walk it's just a

363
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,200
 few minutes off of Fremont in the kind of on the edge of the Arts District

364
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,320
 between kind of the Fremont Street experience and the Las Vegas Arts

365
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:02,120
 District there's like where the Griffin is and all those spots on that end but

366
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,760
 just a little bit past that and one walk over there's always fancy little spots

367
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,240
 popping up over there yeah exactly over by like Carson kitchen area all that

368
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,640
 yeah it's offensive to charge for parking it's that's why we walked for us

369
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,920
 to clearly build for locals just pull in there have a good time and get out of

370
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:25,680
 there yeah yep that's true so we were in there we're hanging out with our with

371
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,120
 our friends there are four of us in there and we are at the end of the

372
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,560
 evening we are the only people left in there with the exception of one group of

373
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:38,360
 three guys that's over by the bar okay and so we we finish up and we're gonna

374
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,560
 we're gonna head out we're gonna go you'll probably find something else and

375
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,000
 maybe a maybe a nightcap before we call it a night and so we stand up we're

376
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,880
 gathered up our things and one of the guys from the group across the room

377
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:54,720
 breaks off and comes over to us and says you know you guys you guys enjoy your

381
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:13,180

383
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,680

384
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,140
 and check in and we go yes let's have another cocktail this will this will be

385
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:32,440
 nice and we all start to kind of shift towards the bar in the in the place and

386
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:38,760
 he goes great hold on just a second and he calls over to the bartender says hey

387
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,080
 I'm gonna take these folks over to forever I'll be back in a little while

388
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:53,120
 what whoa oh we're going somewhere else never go to a second location Jacob

389
00:35:53,120 --> 00:36:02,960
 never go to a second location never go to a second location we're gonna go to

390
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:12,600
 my apartment never go to a second location this is awful so we go oh we're

391
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,960
 going somewhere else he goes yeah yeah it's just a it's just a little walk it's

392
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:21,240
 a couple doors down go all right great we're in and so we we head down we walk

393
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,960
 down the block it's clothing optional so you can leave your clothes here or check

394
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,640
 out when you get into the place whatever you want to do they have lockers I think

395
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,440
 it's fine don't worry about it lockers here so if you want to leave your clothes

396
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:40,040
 here that's cheaper $2 over there I'm scared for you I'm really scared now oh

397
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:45,400
 no no it's not that kind of story so we go over it turns out the bar that we go

398
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,740
 to is a new bar in an old location the old location of this bar is a bar that

399
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:54,920
 SJ and I used to go into all the time when we first moved here so that was

400
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:00,560
 kind of exciting so we were we head into this new bar the the owner from the from

401
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,480
 the Pachi Pachi he comes in and he says yeah these are my new friends just met

402
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:10,560
 them down at down at my spot and we're all great in the world we all meet we

403
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,840
 all we all shake hands sweet Nova girls asking did he ever prove that he was the

404
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:26,240
 owner that is a fine question because what happened at that point after he

405
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:32,600
 introduced us to everyone what do you think he did after we walked in he said

406
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,680
 oh let's go let's go have a nightcap a couple doors down we walked down to the

407
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:41,960
 other bar we walk in he introduces us to the the staff and everybody who's there

408
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:48,980
 yeah what do you think he does at that point we haven't ordered anything we

409
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:54,560
 just walked in we've met everyone it's a finger wag in the air for everyone

410
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,960
 drinks for everyone finger wag that's what I think happens next Paul's on it

411
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,680
 he just goes well I gotta get back over to my bar thanks for coming in guys

412
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:12,860
 is this the game that they're playing they're just shifting customers to each

413
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:22,760
 other's spot and we all look to each other we're like I weren't well we have

414
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:27,040
 you know yeah right this is gonna you invited us here yeah these are my new

415
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,080
 friends you I don't want to talk to you time right we were leaving his

416
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:36,600
 establishment when this happened so that was trying to be slick and kick you out

417
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:41,040
 of his his place so we could close no that I was like maybe you wanted to

418
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,840
 close but that doesn't make sense because we were leaving we were like we

419
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:51,880
 were up and putting our coats on leaving that's bizarre didn't make a single bit

420
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:58,600
 of sense driver taking you to a specific strip club right I guess but I don't

421
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,460
 think anybody got anything out of that I mean the bar that we went to got us to

422
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:07,480
 buy another drink there I mean it was great we had a good time there we did

423
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,680
 have I mean he left and we did just order a couple of rounds drinks there and

424
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,400
 had a nice time there so the recommendation was awesome this is

425
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,160
 bizarre this is bizarre also because I don't have a single bad part of this

426
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:23,660
 story it was just the weirdest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life but the

427
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:29,760
 weirdness matters right because like how how quickly are you gonna go to Hotsie

428
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,760
 Totsie again I mean I don't think it's affected our opinion of that place at

429
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:44,760
 all here's the thing you went down for your bargain steak steak steak bisque

430
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:51,320
 the plate and lobster tail that's right and decided to dial it up by going to

431
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:57,720
 Hotsie Totsie uh-huh and what probably would have ended as just a really fun

432
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:03,220
 night out downtown and now next time you have like friends in town or whatever

433
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:07,360
 and they're still doing the the surf and turf special whatever you're not gonna

434
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,200
 do it again right you're not gonna just go like oh we should go do this and

435
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,200
 bingo bing bang boom it's a really fun night downtown right well the surf and

436
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,280
 turf special and the and the Hotsie Totsie aren't connected right they were

437
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,360
 just they were just a walk from each other right so the surf and turf was

438
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:26,080
 just earlier and then Hotsie Totsie like I know what you mean though it is a it

439
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:32,120
 is a weird nightcap on the end of your experience at Hotsie Totsie in other

440
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,320
 words like if you like a friend came down like is there any old Vegas left on

441
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:39,760
 this town and you would be like oh buckle up I'm taking you down to the

442
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,880
 Fremont we're gonna go yeah it don't don't get your don't get your potato

443
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:48,920
 loaded and other and follow my lead yeah then down there you might be like hey

444
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,880
 there's also like a little bar if you guys want to get off the strip we can go

445
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,080
 around the town like you know me like you're very lucky like replay that

446
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:57,320
 scenario but you're very much less likely to be like now to be like hey you

447
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,840
 want to go to this bar where the guy weirded me out like you're just not

448
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:05,840
 gonna do it you're just not gonna you might be right you might be right you

449
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,880
 know like you're just simply not gonna be inclined to treat someone else to

450
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,520
 that experience again because you're like this owner is weird there's just a

451
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:18,200
 weird story and it's a it is like I say not a single bad thing not a single bad

452
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,440
 thing at any part of the story including the recommendation the

453
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:26,320
 recommendation was great no and we had a before how flawed this person's logic is

454
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:31,620
 like we yes we can't find all of the spaces on the board game of decision

455
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:35,800
 making on this person's right and and I and I didn't even tell you about the

456
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:40,820
 full-length conversation that we had at his bar before leaving there we stood

457
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:45,920
 there and all chatted and laughed and had a good time for easily for ten

458
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,360
 minutes before he suggested that we go to the other bar we all stood around and

459
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,880
 laughed and had a good time for about ten minutes but he specifically said you

460
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,200
 guys want to stay for one more he saw you leaving and said let's do one more

461
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,440
 came over when we were leaving we stood up we're putting our coats on he came

462
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,160
 over and engaged us in conversation at that point we had a nice long

463
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:13,920
 conversation we all had a nice time and as that conversation seemed to be

464
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,720
 naturally getting to a point where we could either you know sit down and

465
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:22,320
 continue it or move on with our evenings he said I know you guys are leaving

466
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,840
 would you like to have one more cocktail right and that implies one the

467
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:31,520
 cocktail happens in that location and or at least that he's gonna have it with us

468
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:40,720
 and to that he's paying or that's a free round sure the paying part I was less I

469
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,200
 was less weirded out by the paying part it is weird to escort someone to a bar

470
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:51,720
 and not by the first round that's just weird agreed no matter who you are or

471
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:57,000
 not if I rally a group to move one location and go to be location especially

472
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,920
 if I'm gonna ditch them which he did that's really odd at least at least if

473
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,480
 he says get them whatever they want on me listen I owe you back to my bar but I

474
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,600
 wanted you guys to check out this place this rounds on me now you're doing some

475
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:15,720
 hospitality work and now you know whatever but he just like shoved you into

476
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:21,360
 somewhere else make buy things over here you're welcome is not it's a weird move

477
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:26,000
 it is and you know what I really wanted to do you know an hour later we were

478
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,600
 leaving the second bar yeah but I really want to do was go back to the first bar

479
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:35,160
 and see well see if it was still open if it is just if it is just vanished see if

480
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:40,800
 it was still there there's not even a building yeah right exactly oh there used

481
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,600
 to be a building here years ago exactly you familiar with the hot seat hot seat

482
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:52,440
 building and there's a painting of a guy and it's like 1958 fuck that was the guy

483
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:59,560
 that's the guy total ghost how long was the walk between the bars oh good

484
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:05,800
 question around 90 seconds it was right there yeah right now I'm not not out of

485
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:10,780
 the way at all really a couple of doors down and in the in the same area in an

486
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:15,520
 area we were familiar with there wasn't there was not a single moment in this

487
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,840
 story where any of us were uncomfortable at all because not to put too fine of a

488
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:24,440
 point on it but by making you go to another bar and get another drink in

489
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,560
 which you didn't pay for you also to pay for another hour of parking that you

490
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:32,540
 were about to save by leaving the bar in the first place that would have been

491
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:37,120
 true that would be true for for other people we had we had parked with our

492
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:41,240

495
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,320
 you can get in the hard part there is get again because it's small it fills up

496
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:01,240

503
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:41,200
 professional wrestling trainer hey it's it's getting the ring it's just go a

504
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:47,680
 couple see we can do here okay yeah all right now first thing you want to do is

505
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:54,440
 you want to put your arms together with the other person's arms and you know

506
00:45:54,440 --> 00:46:00,200
 hold hold on to them so specific type of holds like what do you mean by which

507
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:05,400
 holds start touching see what you see what you touch but like is there a

508
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:11,440
 technique to the hole that I should be using you've been you've been punching

509
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:17,140
 rice like I've asked you punching rice yeah I asked you to punch rice that was

510
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:22,240
 part of the training yeah yeah big old bucket of rice he just yeah punch in

511
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:26,800
 that rice yeah and it gets your grip strength growing right yeah okay yeah I

512
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,320
 used cooked rice though so it was much easier it was very nice okay I'm gonna

513
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:41,720
 call you Panda Express okay enter Hayes groups and check I don't think I think

514
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:47,960
 that would very much defeat the purpose well unless you cooked it and then

515
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,600
 refrigerated and let it reset in there then maybe I don't know maybe be sticky

516
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,560
 enough that's why I remember I worked with this guy who's the nicest guy in

517
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:59,960
 the Virgin Islands and he was a former army ranger and he said that they would

518
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,920
 jab their hands into buckets of sand to build up their callus and strength and

519
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:10,480
 then you added rocks after your house is built up after a while and then you

520
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,960
 added broken glass when the rocks didn't do anything to your hand you just kept

521
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,320
 jabbing them over and over again into hands the sands or whatever and he's

522
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,520
 like that way that if you only get two fingers on someone you can still and he

523
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:31,840
 literally put two fingers on my neck and I was like Jesus those are strong

524
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:36,160
 he's basically saying that you just that way you still needed two fingers free to

525
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:41,360
 kill someone who was trying to kill you and I was like thank you for your

526
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:54,480
 service my pants what was his army ranger there's an army ranger yeah yeah

527
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,920

 two days before really that part advance oh yeah okay that's polite or is it

546
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:59,720
 polite or has he done this before with lots of places and finally realized oh I

547
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:05,880
 gotta give the answer to both of those questions very well be very well be he

548
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,200
 asked permission for the doll to be armed and we said this is an open carry

549
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:15,980
 state go ahead you can strap heat under the under the torso of the real doll my

550
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:25,280
 doll is coming straight from her job as a parking meter and force so so we knew

551
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:30,980
 way ahead of time and and of course all of the records Chris Brown normally

552
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:36,620
 plays the manager and the and the others but I was like oh come on I I was

553
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:41,400
 getting ready to bump him in because I was also playing the manager and I was

554
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,320
 like all right I I need to go in there and just kind of be his his muscle right

555
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:52,160
 be the be as you know the guy standing behind him yeah and he was fine with it

556
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:57,080
 and the guy came in very nice guy apparently been spending you know about

557
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:07,560
 an hour or two beforehand out in the bar having conversations yeah with her and

558
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:12,720
 patrons that would patrons that would come up and say oh yeah phone so I

559
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:17,760
 really likes the decor here blah blah blah and the whole time he said he said

560
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:25,360
 now here's the thing I'm not as weird as you guys may think I know she's fake

561
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:34,920
 but I've had some really bad relationships is just makes me

562
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:41,000
 comfortable makes me not crazy hard to argue with that logic who can argue

563
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:49,080
 yeah and and again middle-aged guy would say it I would say probably 50 plus you

564
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:57,480
 know well he's got that top of the line Vag doll model money that oh my lordy

565
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:02,920
 that shit ain't cheap and he he didn't even want the whole thing he went with

566
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:12,040
 the you have the huge tracks of land model as well it was yeah you lose it

567
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:20,880
 over the side of a boat you wanted to be able to float guys I'm just so

568
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,520
 psychologically damaged from all of my relationships with humans decided to

569
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:32,760
 find my own holy shit now I didn't see them but everyone but some other people

570
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:38,000
 said it made me took them off when once they got out of the bar apparently she

571
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:45,920
 had elf ears as well okay okay yeah that is why she was rolling for

572
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:55,680
 that go before going to each room exactly nice Auburn haired young lady in a blue

573
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:03,680
 dress so he comes in so this thing is apparently they prefer sex workers yeah

574
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:10,440
 it's heavy right it's a horse yeah it's I would I would estimate it is closing in

575
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:19,360
 on 100 back somewhere between somewhere between 50 and 100 how is Jacob speaking

576
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:24,060
 point with real women think you can't how's he currently transporting the

577
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:30,720
 thing so he has a truck that has a lift on the back great she rides in the lift

578
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:41,800
 stop it he just carries her yeah I'm like is that Paul he was just carrying

579

580
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:59,240
 vehicle that normally transports aquatic animals if you know if you think you

 recognize this swing this is the one that SeaWorld used to use you've

582
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,040
 probably seen this thing before got a deal got a real deal it it was actually

583
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:15,140
 like like a some sort of a chair one okay all right yeah so so we're in there

584
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:20,200
 and we get the word all right he's coming through blah blah blah so he comes in

585
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:25,840
 and because this thing is so heavy he he's got it up under the armpits and

586
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:32,920
 he's kind of waddling in you know Oh Supernova girl is saying roller skates

587
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:36,240

589
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:44,200
 seconds he'd be doing like that's a real problem he'd be doing like those weird

590
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:49,520
 like Scott dances with her you know just like to the legs and up and around you

591

00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:13,200
 got wires or some kind of armature in the fingers and he tries to get her to

594
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:21,760
 grip the back of the chair is this the side the grip was apparently not good

00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,040
 enough and you guys have seen the security footage yeah Paul it's a ride

599
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:56,720
 thing he was he would start weeping and he actually did just kind of start

600
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:01,120
 laughing and he was like okay and this one guy went to kind of help him and he

605
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:35,040
 popped out and so he gets her he gets her back up she's there staring at the

606
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:44,280
 manager and she's got no oh and and of course I'm sitting there I'm you know

607
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:49,560
 it's not my show it's it's Chris's show and I'm just like all of my years of

608
00:56:49,560 --> 00:57:00,040
 improv just failed me I had no idea what to do in this surreal I believe I would

609
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:03,960
 have literally fallen to the ground I believe I wouldn't be on the ground just

610
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:11,200
 right next to her my eyeballs might pop out as well I don't know yeah this has to

611
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,160
 be a huge curveball because you've already volunteered to do something

612
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:19,640
 maybe above and beyond at work and you've you said to basically you decide

613
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:23,480
 to hop on the social grenade so to speak you will be the front and back

614
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:27,960
 depending on how you're operating the room muscle to basically keep awkward

615
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:31,880
 bad conversations from happening right that's that's kind of like your your

616
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:42,900
 your MO yeah yeah I'm just gonna drop must have thrown you for a loop I just

617
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:49,400
 wanted I just wanted to be in the room standing back in the corner looking

618
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:54,200
 stern you know all right are you people are you gonna you know get my boss here

619
00:57:54,200 --> 00:58:12,060
 you know it didn't go through a lot even weirder was it was in like a general

620
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:15,440
 admission everyone else knows that that looks like fun and they started

621
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,840
 throwing themselves on their backs hoping their eyes would pop out of their

622
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:27,600
 heads and we're just like seven people died that day it's like the 80s movie

623
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:57,320
 moment I'll make sure this person fits in I think I think Chris got

624
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:09,320
 a line of dialogue out before the thing and then he was just like cuz Chris do

625
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:13,880
 you guys know Chris Brown local Las Vegas actors work with oh I don't know

626
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:20,120
 if we know Chris I'm not sure thank you it works with Rihanna is that right no

627
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:37,080
 different Chris Brown ball okay okay so he was just I know you know waiting for

628
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:41,880
 things to get back to some semblance of normal and then he did probably the

629
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:48,520
 quickest version of that show right you have to this show resets like every 20

630
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:55,840
 minutes right like you can just run people through the show just resets you

631
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:00,520
 do the same show like many many many times and during the day it's got to be

632
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:05,480
 weird to do the show right after that show like you have to like yeah there

633
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:09,480
 must be like a weird thing where you're just watching yourself perform because

634
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,680
 you're like I shouldn't be just doing another show I should be talking to a

635
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:26,840
 counselor you have suffered a traumatic event I will I will contact the eyes

636
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:32,080
 exploding out of the robots and counselor for you and oh my god and so we

637
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:44,520
 sit the group accidents all the time here's my card and again it's the end of

638
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,840
 Chris's ship so I was in there just bump him out oh it's the end of his and he

639
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:53,280
 was just like he's just like oh my god the eyes they pop and we just we're both

640
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:59,920
 just like what were we supposed to did he find the eyes oh yeah yeah they were

641
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:04,840
 you know they're white carpet they were yeah I mean you can actually see him in

642
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:10,360
 that in that security video any and he just picked him up and pocketed him yeah

643
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,440
 he didn't worry about putting them back in her head at that point what do you

644
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:19,920
 know is this a video that we can reasonably post on our patreon do you

645
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:31,720
 think I don't think we can like reasonably share it I don't like that's

646
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:35,960
 for sure yeah I don't think we put on a butter goes the patreon yeah I probably

647
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:42,120
 know we've had the same conversation over I'm sure it's like you guys have

648
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,800

01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:20,000
 went through was there any worry about the other people who went in the

663
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:27,440
 experience with him uh they I don't know if they were friends or not but they

664
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:36,520
 they thought it was interesting featured on a bug for the ticket value I will say

665
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:40,760
 those people probably got a much different show than than than most

666
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:46,160

 got with that doll now I'm gonna take care of her I can give her a better life

674
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:09,280

675
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,840
 there's there's no other story coming down the pipe that's going to be like

676
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:17,880
 and then this other time like you're you're done now with stories from work

677
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:24,680
 yeah yeah that's that's that is that's true you have to go to the other ones

678
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:28,200
 first and just keep hanging that one back until someone really I just can't

679

 there those doors close those doors now I find the writing to be the Herculean

683
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:57,520
 effort here I don't sure you waddle around a hundred pound weight it is the

684
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:03,120
 constant fabricating of dialogue in your head that you were translating to

685
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:07,440
 everyone else in the room that to me feels exhausting doing some work man

686
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:14,540
 doing some work yeah and like I said the gentleman was not a young man so I'm

687
