1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
 Oh, hello there! I'm so glad you're here. It's time to thank the Ice Cream Truck Drivers.

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:51,760
 I'd love to. Great, let's go! It's a bank show. It's the day after the bucket show. Here we are,

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:01:03,760
 Paul Mattingly is still in town. In the churn, churn, churn, churn. It's time for Matt Mattingly's

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,400
 Ice Cream Social. Sitting over there is Paul Mattingly. Sitting over there is Matt Donnelly.

11
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:14,000
 Sitting over here is Shakeup the Audio Guy. Can I get to the 8.8? We're preaching fun. Maybe. No,

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,840
 this is a stopgap. Yeah, this is churn stopgap. Churn stopgap. Stopgap churn. You make me want to

13
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:29,280
 stop my truck and fuck you. Stopgap churn. Ooh, I knew it was roomy. I don't know what to talk

14
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,960
 about first, whether we had a good bucket show or not, or that Paul gave my children porn. I don't

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,240
 know which one we should dive into first. Pump the brakes. I would say let's start with the bucket

16
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:54,400
 show and let's billboard Paul giving your children porn. Fine. I'll take it. I'm no prude. I feel

17
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:03,120
 like that was shots fired at my direction. Oh yeah. There were. There were definitely shots fired. Now

18
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,360
 I'm going to talk about it. Now we're going to talk about it. Okay. Now it's out there. So,

19
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,640
 why did you give Matt's kids, Paul? So I got to go to visit Ralph's, which is, you know, my favorite

20
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,760
 comic book shop in the world and got to talk to my buddy. Um, he's doing good. Don't miss Ralph out

21
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,480
 at Alton alternate reality comics. Um, it is the, the hotspot for the comic bookage out there in

22
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,600
 Vegas. Um, and I got Keeler. Keeler is very into comic books right now. Yeah. I got him some books

23
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,800
 last time. Got some, some fantastic force and he's got a couple of, uh, old guardians of the galaxy.

24
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,320
 So we were looking for maybe get some more of those guardians of the galaxies, that kind of thing.

25
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:48,400
 Ralph did not have those. No, they're a little hard to come by. But he did have a copy of

26
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,120
 a infinity gauntlet trade. So I grabbed that. That's a, that's a key thing that, uh, Keeler

27
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,080
 needs to check out because like, and I, I, you know, it's been a minute since I reread that story,

28
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,760
 but Mephisto plays a role in that. And that's the new, no, this is not by the way, where the

29
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,800
 story's going. Paul's just doing a recap of all the comics that it's not, it's not fisting porn

30
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,600
 that he gave you. And then, and then I bought him, uh, well, he gave your son fisting porn.

31
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,760
 What was the other one? You haven't gotten the latest issue of the angry goose.

32
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:27,040
 I got him a pissed off goose. You're waiting for the trades to come out. I don't want to get it.

33
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:36,320
 Those spoilers, please. Angry goose game is hot shit. Um, no, I got him the, the all star Superman,

34
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,320
 uh, new mini trade. And that's the pornography. No. Oh, okay. Then I went to the, the, the 50 cent

35
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:48,160
 bin because I love to raid me some old comics as you can find some gold. And I did find some gold.

36
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:54,800
 I found a early 2000 Savage dragon, number one minty fresh bunch of stuff like that. I got him

37
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,400
 some Rob Batman record this bank episode twice. One where Paul tells his version first and one

38
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,640
 where I tell my version first. Right. Yeah. It's going to decide which one they want to listen to

39
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,240
 first. And then I see there's a copy of powers. Okay. One of my all time favorite book powers,

40
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:16,960
 Brian, Michael Bendis, Austin, Michael, a von Oming, who, whose artwork I love and follow

41
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:24,080
 through a bunch of different books. Um, so do they have any particular styles to their artwork? Uh,

42
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:32,640
 it's very angular. Okay. It's very angular. So I think, um, Batman, Batman, beyond right now,

43
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,840
 I'm thinking of the movie heavy metal. That's what I'm picturing right now. More Batman beyond.

44
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,240
 Okay. You know, Batman beyond you film familiar with that kind of have very, very angular, almost,

45
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:47,760
 almost, uh, Bruce Tim. Oh, Bruce Tim. Sure. Sure. Sure. It's a, it's very, it's very Bruce Timian.

46
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:55,520
 Great. Michael, Yvonne Owing stuff. Anyway, uh, I pick up that book and I'm like, oh great powers.

47
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,920
 And this is a, it's a, it's an, oh, uh, a newer issue, newer and that it probably came out 10

48
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,840
 years ago. You were like Matt's children need to be introduced to power. I was like powers is such

49
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,920
 a good book because the guy who made it made, uh, invented the miles Morales Spider-Man. Yes. My

50
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:15,440
 kids love. Yes. That's the, that's the spider verse, uh, Miles Brown. Okay. Brian, Michael Bendis

51
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,240
 did ultimate Spider-Man back in the day. He invigorated the character in whole huge ways.

52
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,760
 And he is a juggernaut of, I still haven't seen that second movie,

53
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,600
 comic stuff. The first one was so good. I just never got around to see it. And he's deep with

54
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,920
 that movie too. Like he was, he was big in, I think he had a, it's one of the only movies where

55
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,640
 like the multiverse really just is the plot and works like you're like, oh, this is just a really

56
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:44,640
 well-earned, uh, did you not see the, uh, the Dr. Strange? What was that? Which one was that?

57
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:51,920
 It was the Dr. Strange. Yeah, I saw all of them. First of all, Dr. Strange, Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Yeah,

58
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,280
 that was good. And then finally came back. Dr. Strange, like guys, seriously though,

59
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:06,880
 you won't believe it. Dr. Lots of places. That was Dr. Strange. So I get it. And then I've got a

60
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,160
 couple of other books and then we're, we're heading out and Paul's brothers, by the way,

61
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,000
 Paul's brothers in the house, by the way. Yes. Honks here. Yeah. And so I bought these books

62
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,320
 for Keeler and then I'm handing them over and then I'm like, Oh, wait a minute. Sometimes we

63
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:25,040
 got in the car, comic books in hand. Everything's purchased. Matt has had enough. Paul turns to me

64
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,240
 and goes, Oh, there might be like boobies in one of, uh, of those comics. I hope that's okay.

65
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,720
 Okay. Are the kids with you? What am I going to do? Okay. What am I going to do? Turn around,

66
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,600
 yank it out of his hands, go back into the comic book store. If I knew it was to the 50 cent bin,

67
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:49,200
 maybe I, maybe it would have been more of an option. But, uh, uh, I was like, well, there's no,

68
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:55,120
 there's no turning back now. We live here now. This is the multi-person that we currently live

69
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:02,320
 in. I'm not upset that he did it. I'm upset at the sequence of events. Well, I, but I sequenced it

70
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,640
 out of my head in the wrong way too. Cause I just didn't remember. I was like, Oh yeah, there's some,

71
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:12,480
 but it's very like circle with another circle on it. It's very like happy face eyeball.

72
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,640
 Paul, some of the great graphics of the boom. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My son has to understand that

73
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:23,760
 the main character in the very first page is at a strip club. So I have to let him take in that plot

74
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,960
 point and just figure out how he's living his life. Look, my kids are being raised in Las Vegas.

75
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,280
 They pass little darlings billboards all the time. I'm not, there was a moment at the bucket show

76
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,160
 last night where, uh, I think Jonathan stopped the show just to make sure that everyone knew that

77
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:46,960
 those two kids in the front row were your kids. It was like, everybody, I need you to know something.

78
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,200
 There are two children up here. They're Matt's children. They're fine. Jonathan made some real

79
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,080
 hay about them in the front row. It was like, uh, why would you bring these children to this R rated

80
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,440
 Joe? What he went to duct tape, uh, Hillier's eyes. Oh, good. Well, it was funny as the last

81
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,080
 bucket show, uh, and we'll get back to, there's no, there's, there's no way to go back to it.

82
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,840
 Basically, I was just, it was like, you, you, you, the sequence of events is before you hand my child

83
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,520
 the thing, think is there boobies in it? Uh, the second thing is then ask me before you purchase

84
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,720
 so that I can get cool dad points. Right. You're right. Instead, Paul just put me in a position to

85
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,320
 just be a, uh, an impotent fuddy duddy. Right. There's no way I was going to stop. And I won.

86
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,480
 I won completely because then we pull up to another, we pulled up to another comic shop.

87
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,520
 Paul, what did you win? I'll tell you what I want. We pull up, we pulled to another comic shop and

88
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,360
 we're getting ready to hop out of the car. And I was like, I, you know, I was, I was like, I was

89
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,760
 kind of, you know, half apologize. Like I am, I, I, I may have overstepped there. I didn't really

90
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,480
 recall that there are boobs, possibly boobs, but I think it's fine. And Danny, he's got to learn,

91
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,640
 he's got to learn some time. You know, it's, it's fine. That's what I want. I want, I want old uncle

92
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,120
 Paul to be in charge of my child's sexual awakening. If he ain't awake now, if he ain't

93
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,480
 awake yet, it ain't happening. Um, he's 12. I'm sure he has membership. He's awake. He's awake.

94
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:15,440
 Yeah. Filthiest. Oh yeah. That's awful. Yeah. He's got his own only fans. Um, no, uh, he's got a

95
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:24,320
 subscription to jugs magazine. Nudie magazine day. Do you mind if I get the mail? Uh, any, any

96
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,400
 discrete packages? Just go get the mail. I'm looking for a rather discrete package. Hey,

97
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,920
 but it's been a huge help having you at the mail. Oh, yeah. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. I love to do it.

98
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,800
 I camp out there now just to make sure I don't miss the man. We're good friends. He and I,

99
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:44,960
 can you imagine, he brings me comic books. Can you imagine like a wink, like here you go,

100
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:52,160
 some good editorials in the back. Here's another issue of powers for you boy. These

101
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:58,160
 circles really kind of look like tits. You won't believe it. He's, he's circles are so

102
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,120
 fun. Every time he goes to get any basketball or soccer ball in the garage. Yeah. We just,

103
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,720
 now we're just associated with just the very basic shape. It's a protractor. Oh, it's roundish.

104
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:19,520
 Yeah. Uh, no, it's 12. So he still yells boy every time I raise it. We have to communicate our

105
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:27,360
 household. When you're 12, it makes that sound. It is that strong. Um, uh, I miss it. I know,

106
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:35,680
 right? Like those were the days. Uh, now it goes, I thought something was wrong with Matt's car.

107
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,880
 Turns out there was a sexual awakening happening. I also was reading powers.

108
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:46,080
 I'd already fished out a few of my copies of 57 when they were in another section,

109
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,440
 but we're hopping into this new, uh, this, uh, to go browse around a little bit more.

110
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,120
 And, uh, I was like, yeah, you know, I'm sorry. I may have overstepped, but you know,

111
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,960
 it really was like, he's got learned sometime. It's fine. It's a, it's just a round little boob

112
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,760
 and both your, your, your ping pong between two incorrect things. But then Matt's, Matt's like,

113
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,920
 Matt's like, it's fine. He can have it. No problem. It, which is, which is great. What other choice

114
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:16,320
 did I have? And then now then Keeler goes, I'm trading for Paul's my dad. And I said, and I said,

115
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,720
 you are going to regret that decision so quickly. I said, but you are going to enjoy your meals more.

116
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,080
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're going to love the food. The food plan. Top notch.

117
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:34,000
 Bologna and cheese, hot dogs, mac and cheese. Forget about pizza every day. If we want it,

118
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:42,880
 who cares? Um, but, uh, but that soccer game, forget about it. What time does it start? No, no,

119
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,680
 no, no, no. How hot would it be? No, we're not doing that. Will I sit in the sun? You want me to

120
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:55,040
 coach what? Eat shit. A plastic folding chair. Here, here's two game boys. Leave me alone forever.

121
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,800
 And then we were in the second comic shop. And when, when I stayed away by the near shot,

122
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:07,520
 he turned to the guy who works there. He goes, do you have anything more adult? And he slid a

123
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:13,520
 $5 bill across. Do you have any of those Tijuana Bibles where Mickey's like really slipping it to

124
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:20,880
 all kinds of kids? You got any books? You got some Tijuana Bibles back there? Cause that's what I

125
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,320
 really, I'm hungry for that poor art. I didn't think we were going to get an episode title out

126
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:34,720
 of this story. Yeah. I'm not familiar with the term. So a Tijuana Bible is a bootleg comic,

127
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,240
 usually involving big brand name characters doing pornographic things. Yeah. And it's, uh,

128
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,080
 they're, they're usually published out of Mexico Mickey mouse, fucking Cinderella. Yes, exactly.

129
00:12:44,080 --> 00:13:03,360
 And so we're going to call me up to the chalkboard to solve some, I'll just be back here with my

130
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:10,640
 inconspicuously wrapped package. Nothing to see here. Mrs. Johnson. Oh, I got a divorce mini

131
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,400
 Paul cemented his love for, uh, with my children. Yeah. I'm sorry if I'm cutting off Paul's

132
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,280
 narrating of, of, I was telling you, I was telling a dumb joke. It's, it's, it's, it's, uh,

133
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:32,080
 Donald goes, Mickey goes up to Donald, I got a divorce mini and, and goes, why Mickey? Just

134
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,440
 because you said she's crazy. I didn't say she's crazy. I said she's fucking goofy.

135
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:48,880
 I want to hear you Donald duck voice more. What were you saying? So his kids love me

136
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,680
 more than him. Yeah. He also got a, a scratchy Funko pop for, for my other child. Yeah. Keeler's

137
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,960
 not so much pain there reading tip right now. I feel your pain of your children loving Paul more

138
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:08,240
 right. It's uncle Paul is fun, fun uncle. Yeah. Yeah. He's like, you know, he knows his job.

139
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:15,840
 He's no limits. Yes. No limits. Well, cause I am still there. Right. What? No. Yeah. What?

140
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:24,720
 Not at all. I don't know what they're talking about. Peter pan do, do, do fly me to neverland.

141
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,040
 This is what Peter pan really looks like. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. I am Paul has a, sorry, Wendy

142
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:40,400
 Paul has a green tights of giving gifts to people like of things that he likes and therefore things

143
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:46,080
 you want. Well, like, uh, yes. Most people who don't have children don't understand like how

144
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:53,520
 different they are from year to year. Sure. Yeah. But Paul got your, yeah. So I was explaining this

145
00:14:53,520 --> 00:15:01,040
 to you last night. So when Eve was two, uh, for Christmas, he always sent stuff for Christmas.

146
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:08,800
 Yeah. Sure. Which is great. Yeah. It's awesome. Um, and he sent the entire DVD full collection of

147
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:15,920
 loony tunes and he's like, now you can, you and Eve can like watch all the loony tunes. And I'm like,

148
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:22,880
 great. She's two. Like there was no, she, there was no understanding sign language for more loony

149
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:31,920
 tunes. Yeah. She's like, yeah, yeah. I want, I want more food. I need to be burped. Yeah. So

150
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,160
 can we watch all of loony tunes? Yeah. Right. But now almost 10 years later,

151
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:50,560
 what was that? That was manian devil. That was better than his Donald duck. Everything's better

152
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:59,840
 than my Donald duck. Let the listeners decide. You think anybody's still listening? No, but then,

153
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:07,680
 but like, but, but it comes around. So almost 10 years later, um, Shelley was, uh, out of town

154
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,360
 and I had the girls and I was like, all right, we're going to have movie night and let's go

155
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,480
 rummage through my old DVDs and see what we found. Cause I was like, we're going to watch the three

156
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,200
 amigos. And so I was like, I'm going to introduce you to the, the great singing Bush. It's, you know,

157
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:30,480
 all of it, just a plethora of wonders. Uh, and so we go through there and we find it, but on the way

158
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:37,200
 to finding the three amigos DVD, we also found the box edition set of loony tunes and they know

159
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,240
 loony tunes at this point. They've seen a few and they're like, and they flipped their shit.

160
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,920
 And we watched loony tunes and I introduced them to like the coyote road runners for the first time.

161
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,800
 And it was like one of the greatest nostalgic, like awesome moments with Mike, cause they're

162
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:58,960
 first, and like, it's the best. So it comes around, but I, but I hear your, you know,

163
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,800
 listeners are familiar with the amount of movies that Paul says I should watch with my kids that

164
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:10,400
 are just just not appropriate. To be fair to me, I made a big list of movies I thought could be

165
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,920
 appropriate for the last time. Honk brought the girls out and we've landed on back to the future.

166
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:21,920
 Oh, it crushed. It did right. She's still loving it. Right. It crushed. Eve, Eve was like, Eve's in

167
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:27,040
 that, uh, she's 11th, but so she's now starting in that, in that area of like being able to

168
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:32,960
 understand the uncomfortable humor. Yes. And so when, you know, Marty's mom is like hitting on

169
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:41,120
 Marty, she was, I mean, contorted in the chair, but it's a testament to how good that movie is.

170
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:47,920
 Like it makes you feel how much incest still affects people. And I guess how healthy your

171
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:53,600
 children's internet porn searches will be since the, since the, that, that seems in vogue on the

172
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:00,240
 internet. It's everywhere. It's so bizarre, but that's good. Yeah. So she's still like, did you,

173
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,360
 have you done the follow-ups yet? We haven't done any of the follow-ups yet. Yeah, but well,

174
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,040
 that's great for sure. Nora was still a little too freaked out when the Libyans came and shot

175
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,360
 up dark brown. She was out. She's like, Oh, that's too much for me. I'm not, she's gone. Yeah. She's

176
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,920
 like, Nope. But Eve stuck through and really the Libyans. Um, but yes, I would definitely at this

177
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,960
 point have shown, had I had children, they would have seen way more inappropriate material and

178
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,240
 being supposed to way more inappropriate stuff. Now, now John, how much are you looking forward

179
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:40,480
 to next year? Paul bring your, uh, then 12 year old, uh, pornography. Are you looking forward to

180
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,720
 this or you have a little trepidation here? As long as the quality is a little higher than, uh,

181
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,240
 eyeball boobs, maybe. Yeah. Yeah. All right. All right. Well, but I mean, he's sort of, you've,

182
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:56,560
 you've given some stuff like a couple of years ago, like you, you gave her the entire

183
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:03,200
 Elf quest series. Right. Now that's not super out there, but it's like a little more. It's

184
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,440
 mature. Violent. Yeah. And you don't like the bull feral movie, 10 year old, but my, but my

185
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,800
 girls, I guess the ball seems a little brutal, a voracious reader. That's why I got it for like,

186
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:20,160
 she does not, she does not stop now and she really loved it. She will read anything. And so she

187
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,440
 devoured it. She loved it. Yeah. It's a big volume to the point. Like she reads so much that like

188
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,520
 she will, um, oftentimes come and like, she'll just be talking to us and then she'll say a word

189
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:37,120
 weird. Like, you know what she's saying, but she like pronounces it weird because she's just,

190
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,480
 she's only seen it. She's only read it. And then she's, you know, read it as it's phonetically

191
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,760
 spelled or whatever, and then she'll come and she'll say it. And then we sort of laugh and then she

192
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,480
 gets mad and we're like, no, no, it's crazy that you know, these words and it just, it's pronounced

193
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,800
 like this. And she's like, Oh, okay. Well, it looks like this. I've had a hard time explaining

194
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,360
 to my younger, it's like, basically like, I don't know how to like busting chops. Like when we laugh

195
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,640
 at the thing that you're known for, we're not trying to hurt your feelings or ridicule you.

196
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,320
 Maybe that's the thing because like early on here with it, it's, it continues through your whole

197
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:17,200
 life. Yeah. But within funny people, it's, it's love language. Yeah. And that's the thing. Like

198
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:24,320
 as soon as we're on that group chat with Jonathan and Brad and Brad starts busting my balls, I'm

199
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:30,560
 like, I'm fine. Yeah. I'm like, we're good. Nope. We're going to have a great show. I got nothing to

200
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:35,600
 worry about here. He feels comfortable giving me shit. That's all I need out of a comedy partner.

201
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,040
 Right. That's it. And, but it, I guess it just takes a little while to know that, to learn that.

202
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,240
 Yeah. But maybe you can explain it to him like that, that it is love language.

203
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,680
 Yeah, I think we're trying to, you know, like in the moment, it's still like, it's like,

204
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:55,520
 well, when it's the first time, right? The first time you've ever been called out on something silly

205
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:03,600
 and you go, Oh yeah. I take it every time, but also, but also the bucket show in a minute,

206
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,440
 thank fuck. He can feel a little bit of shame because that's what's wrong with the world.

207
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,400
 Nobody feels shame anymore. That's funny. That's true. You know, I think it's also like a control

208
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,800
 thing. Like you're not in control, but you're not in control of people's narrative of you.

209
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,440
 And it can be a little jarring. I'm like, Oh shoot. This is how people say, talk about me. And I

210
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,520
 can't do anything about it. It also depends on their age. I don't know if you've noticed that

211
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,000
 because like when they're younger, they've, it's just, but like now my oldest is like reaching an

212
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,720
 age where like it, her, her appearance is becoming more important to her and the way she, you know

213
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,320
 what I mean? Yeah. And she started becoming aware of other people's, if you go further,

214
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,240
 it's just becomes a nightmare for me. Go keep going. Yeah. But you got boys. Yes. Yeah.

215
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,280
 Different. You got the easy, easier to buy porn for that. Yup. That's true.

216
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:01,920
 Way easier. This, the sapphic comic book is a rare beast. I, it's weird. Like I think it's backwards.

217
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:08,320
 I think boys are harder when they're younger. Well, traditionally they're harder when they're older.

218
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:15,760
 And then, and then there, and I think it, and then it like reverses because like little girls

219
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:27,200
 are, I didn't know that in their forties, they're really difficult. You know, who else got Matt's

220
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,160
 children's of pornography? That's the following sponsor. Today's show, Mad Man's Ice Cream Social

221
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:37,680
 is brought to you by Greasy Al's Parmesan scented deodorant. That's right. That's Greasy Al's

222
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,520
 Parmesan scented deodorant in 2022 from Dungeon Scoop and Dragon Scoop.

223
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:53,360
 Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da. Hey Paisan, why don't you get your face up in

224
00:22:53,360 --> 00:23:01,600
 this pit right here? You're going to smell a fricking pizzeria. What do you think? Oh, that's

225
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:10,240
 nice. Yeah. That's my Parmesan deode. Made with only the fresh grated cheese. It goes right on.

226
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:19,200
 Guaranteed to stick to your pit hair. Oh, I got that. I also got Gorgonzola flavor. And for the,

227
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,280
 for the ladies out there, I have tampons made of prosciutto.

228
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,280
 Enter Ace Group's checkout board.

229
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:38,480
 Paul's pronunciation of prosciutto really got to Matt. Matt did not like that pronunciation.

230
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,000
 Oh, Cap's version of boy, yo, yo, yo, yo.

231
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:53,280
 Whatever the early days of accessing celebrity porn on the internet, not porn,

232
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,440
 you know, whatever. Naked pictures. Yeah. Clips from movies that already exist. Right. Like

233
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,080
 Mr. Skin. Yeah. Yeah. But Mr. Skin before Mr. Skin. Yeah. Mr. Skin before Mr. Skin or whatever.

234
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,320
 What was that like? Cave drawings? That's right. What was it? Circles on Circles.

235
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:14,880
 Penelope, what was it? Who's a Penelope Cruz? Is it Penelope Cruz? Penelope Pitstop? That's it.

236
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,960
 Penelope Pitstop from Wacky Races. That's it. Latin actress who was briefly Tom Cruise's.

237
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,560
 Penelope Cruz. Penelope Cruz. Okay. Yeah. She spelled it with a Z though.

238
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,640
 That's right. It was Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. Did she put them on the glass at some point?

239
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:33,040
 So, you know, when early, I'm showing my age here by describing the porn I'm looking at.

240
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:44,160
 It was in a comic book. No, it was, you know, it was just screen grabs. Right. Of, and it was,

241
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,960
 so it had subtitles on the screen grabs of her taking her top off or whatever. And she referred

242
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:55,360
 to her nipples as slices of pepperoni. And I was like, oh, like, it's like. He took it right out.

243
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:02,640
 Yeah. I was like, oh, come on. I'm out. Whatever the opposite of boy. Chang-a-lang-a-lang. Whatever.

244
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:09,840
 That's it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're, we're, we're, we're waa-waa. Is that Pac-Man dying?

245
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:17,840
 Yep. Pac-Man dying. Yeah. The last thing I want to do is be sucking on a nipple and get a little

246
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:23,040
 garlicky aftertaste. That's going to throw it off. I don't want any aftertaste. I just want,

247
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:28,160
 I want regular garlic taste. You want full flavor? I want full, full garlic. Garlic nipple sauce?

248
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:35,120
 I'll take any nipple I can get at this point. I'll just, uh, John, let's go get it out, buddy.

249
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:45,200
 Pickled nipples. John, nipple in this Papa John sauce. Garlic buttered nipples. That's my

250
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:51,920
 favorite shot. So yeah. So, so we, we, last night we did the bucket show and, uh, it was, uh, super

251
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:56,640
 fun. Matt Mattingly, Jonathan and Brad. Yeah. Jonathan, Magnum and Brad came out. I just had

252
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,360
 someone mess with me now and do the thing I hate the most. He goes, I didn't realize it was Brad

253
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:05,520
 and Jonathan. I was like, dude, there was never a difference. Come see the show or don't. Also,

254
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,160
 like every post about it, every ad about it had all four of you on it. I wasn't, I wasn't keeping

255
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,840
 Jonathan off anything. He was on the poster that, uh, Eric made and he was, uh, and he was in the,

256
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,840
 we mentioned in the video. He didn't, he didn't get billing last time cause it was a last minute

257
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,960
 thing. Yes. Right. Well, we talked about it. He didn't get as much, as much billing. We talked

258
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,400
 about him after the show last night. Cause he was, yeah, he was the last minute addition to

259
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:34,240
 the last bucket show. I actually, uh, paid to, uh, boost the post, the video of Brad and I talking

260
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,960
 about the show. And it's not because I was concerned with turnout is that I hate the like,

261
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,760
 Oh, I didn't know you guys were doing that. I was like, shut up. Like Facebook makes me pay to talk

262
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,240
 to my friends. I'm paying the money to make sure that none of my friends failed to know that it

263
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,880
 happened. Uh, and so to get like, I didn't know Jonathan was in it. I was like, no, just stop it.

264
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,720
 Yeah, just stop it. But, uh, uh, super fun show. Great turnout. We were worried it was July. It's

265
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,560
 July. It was July 5th of the night, the night of July 4th, not the biggest theater going hot night.

266
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,960
 It's hot. It's hot Vegas. It was a Saturday night. We don't usually do stuff on a Saturday.

267
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,360
 Other things to do in Vegas on a Saturday night turns out. Uh, but it was packed. We had to get

268
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:20,080
 extra chairs. We got extra chairs out like four or five different times. Yeah. It was, it was so

269
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,040
 because we got there, you know, we had rows all set up and everything. And then like, as soon as

270
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:33,840
 we opened the doors, we're like, well, those chairs are full. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so fun. Great crowd. Uh,

271
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,560
 we were, we were destination tourism, multiple scoops. Yes. People actually, I mean, John came

272
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:44,800
 out for it. John came out for Lee popsicle. That's right. Sherman. Yep. Yep. It was wonderful. Um,

273
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:51,440
 it was a really fun, I mean, uh, Sarah boy and bat scoop, but they live here. But, uh, it counts

274
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:57,040
 though. They keep showing up, doing, doing thing. They're diehards. Yeah. I love it. I'm blanking on

275
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,920
 his name, but he flew out from Northern milk lake scoop. Yes. Milk lake scoop. Oh yeah. From, uh,

276
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,560
 Northern Cal. Yep. Oh, milk lake scoop. That's right. He's the guy. Yeah. Did you miss him?

277
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:11,120
 He was out there. He beat you in the costume contest. Close. I'm glad you didn't see him. It

278
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,680
 would have been so awkward. It would have been a fucking fight throwing down. It's on site with

279
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:25,680
 milk lake on site. Uh, and, uh, uh, my children were there as well. And, um, it was such a super

280
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:32,640
 fun show. It was a super fun. It was, we had, we had, Brad had some really great ideas in our,

281
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,480
 the way we generated our information for our scenes with hot seat, having it, having it mostly come

282
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,200
 from interviews on like three different games. That was the key way you see like a short form

283
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,560
 improv show. It's like, can we have a location? Can we have a relationship doing that? And so

284
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:51,120
 Brad's idea was like, let's really chat with people and then kind of take whatever we want

285
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,320
 out of the interview and do the scenes off of that. And one, that was successful. And two,

286
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,000
 our most ambitious swing on that ended up being great, which I was like, instead of doing a scenic

287
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,320
 game, let's use a interview to set up jeopardy and we'll get our occupations from the interview.

288
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,360
 We'll get our categories from the interview. Like you got those great categories was,

289
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:17,200
 she said she wanted to, uh, do the four horsemen of the apocalypse cartoon. I go great. What are

290
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,960
 those four again? And she named the force. Like that's our category. Well, her idea was really,

291
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,920
 really good. It was about the four horsemen of the apocalypse, having to deal with the ramifications

292
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:33,120
 of, of taking care of all the souls that came up during COVID. It was, they were, that's what she

293
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,120
 said. She said they had, she said the four horsemen are forced to deal with all the idiots that died

294
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,360
 during COVID because they didn't take proper precautions. So that's her whole idea. The pitch

295
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,000
 is like dealing with the dumbest ghost you've ever dealt with in the afterlife. I thought that was

296
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,560
 really a fun idea. That is a fun idea. That is, uh, I was, I was in and out of the room while she

297
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,960
 was, uh, while you guys were interviewing her and, uh, yeah, so I only heard little bits and pieces.

298
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,600
 I heard the four horsemen part and then I heard something about COVID and, but yeah, that makes

299
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,240
 a lot more sense. That's a good idea. It's a good idea. I like the gem was the gem was her talking

300
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:10,800
 about her sort of relationships. Oh my gosh. I stumbled into gold, gold and diamonds. I would

301
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:17,040
 say these two people were sitting right in front of where I was standing. Uh, to the degree that

302
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:22,320
 when Matt said, uh, at first, when he, when he, when he picked out this young lady, uh, he pointed

303
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:28,640
 back there and I was like, is, can Matt not see me? Is he, is Matt pointing at me? Am I a shadowy

304
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,080
 figure in the back of the room? What's happened? Like what? Okay. But, uh, but yeah, so she was

305
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:39,040
 there. Her boyfriend was not there with her. That's what we discovered. Her, her friend, her, her,

306
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:45,040
 her friend who is a long time friend was there with her. We all know what that is. Yeah. Yeah.

307
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,680
 No, we, we definitely stumbled on to, because in the order I said, you know, do you, do you have a

308
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,720
 roommate? No, I live at home with my mom. I said, oh, okay. Do you have a boyfriend or a girlfriend

309
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,960
 order? She goes, I have a boyfriend. I go, how long has been out? And he goes, five years. And then I just went,

310
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,280
 Oh, yeah. The audience did the math real quick. You ain't shacked up after five years. Yeah.

311
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:10,560
 Something's up. And then I said, is your boyfriend here? She goes, no. Right. I go, who are you here

312
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,520
 with? And she goes, a friend. And I, and I, and the whole, it's been like, Oh, I let it go in the

313
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,680
 audience. I go relax. I think I'm going to actually authentically extinguish this. I go like, and you

314
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:25,440
 have a girlfriend or a boyfriend. He goes, Nope. And then the whole, I just went, yeah.

315
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:32,720
 But you thought you were genuinely knocking that out. I mean, I was going to be still playful with

316
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,640
 it, but I thought I was going to, like, it was building fast. I thought you were egging it on.

317
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,640
 No, I thought you were actually trying to make her more comfortable because the audience was like

318
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,880
 flipping. I was like, okay, they were going really hard. And she was going hard. I was trying to just,

319
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,200
 I was just trying to like spread it out a little bit. I understand. I definitely thought you were,

320
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,080
 you were like playing the dumb a little bit to egg the audience on. Well, I was about when it,

321
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,640
 when, uh, I wasn't going to ask him the question I asked him no matter what. Right. Uh, which was

322
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,160
 if you were dating someone for five years, would you think you'd move in with them by now?

323
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:08,800
 And so I knew I was going to that question next, no matter what. Uh, and, uh, and, but she was a

324
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:15,120
 great sport. And he was great. I talked to him a little bit after the show and yeah, I was like,

325
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,800
 you guys were, you guys were fantastic. Thank you so much for being good sports. And they just had a

326
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:23,440
 great time. Yeah. And so for the occupation, what's great, what I loved about it was that in

327
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,520
 jeopardy, it takes a while to set up, right? So you decide whether you're going to get categories

328
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,200
 or not, but that's a, that's another round of suggestions. Then you get three occupations and

329
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,880
 then it has those occupations and you have to come up with it. And then you have to worry about their

330
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,480
 expectations with the occupations. You have to like, you have to be the funniest plumber, the

331
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:44,480
 funniest, you know, whatever bus driver. So, uh, with horsemen of the apocalypse. So all we do is

332
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,840
 interview her and I said, well, you're not going to believe this, but you've inspired this fever,

333
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:54,080
 dream jeopardy. And then boom, we start playing the game and, uh, Brad plays a guy who works in

334
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,400
 the back at Nordstrom because she, uh, she works at Nordstrom rack. Yeah. That was part of her

335
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,600
 interview. Jonathan played, uh, the guy in the back, the guy in the back, the friend in the back.

336
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,880
 That's right. The back rack. Yeah. And then, uh, Paul played the mother that she lives with. Yeah.

337
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,880
 And then the jeopardy categories were, uh, conquest, war,

338
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,720
 famine, uh, and the other one and the other one, uh, and so pestilence and pestilence and the

339
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,880
 other one and the other one. Yeah. I kept all five. Yeah. I thought it was war. She lists death,

340
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,280
 death is one famine and pestilence, but she named, she didn't name death as one.

341
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,720
 She said conquest and war specific. Cause I made a joke. I go, good. You got to keep those separate.

342
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:41,520
 Right. I'm like, what? No, it's, it's war, famine, pestilence, death. I did. I did think it was wrong,

343
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,120
 but that's fine. But who knows? This is why her cartoon is not going to get me. That's right.

344
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:51,040
 Can't even name the four horsemen you're making the cartoon about. No, the four horsemen are

345
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,720
 Rick Flair, Arne Anderson.

346
00:33:52,720 --> 00:34:02,960
 No, no, no. The four horsemen are Mickey Mantle, uh, Tully Blanchard.

347
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:14,800
 There's Greg Maddox. Schultz was in there. Uh, Steve Avery. It was Mike Singletary.

348
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,440
 Are there four horsemen in every sport? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, the, uh, what was it? The,

349
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,160
 the, the 90s Braves pitching staff, they, yeah, they were the four horsemen. It was what Greg

350
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:29,200
 Maddox, John Schultz, Steve Avery. And there was one other guy in that, in that line. That's when

351
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:36,080
 the Braves won the wonder division, like 20 years in a row. They said all the pitching, uh, uh,

352
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:41,600
 conquest, war, famine, and death. Oh, she did nail it. Yeah. No, she got them. Well,

353
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:46,720
 she didn't say death. She did. She said war and conquest. She said pestilence. Did she say,

354
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,480
 she said pestilence? She said pestilence. She might've said pestilence instead of famine.

355
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,960
 Okay. Well, but she didn't say death. She said death. Okay. Well, the white horse is interpreted

356
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,360
 sometimes to be conquest or pestilence. So I guess, okay, I thought that was death road.

357
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:04,240
 I'm going off of chat GPT, so she could be wrong. Don't ask tap GPT. If it made you feel better,

358
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:10,640
 I think Paul was going off of the movie tombstone. There was a pale horse coming and you tell them

359
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,880
 I'm coming. The pale horse is death. That's not the white horse. The pale horse is different.

360
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,320
 Pale is different than white. Trust me in my Irish household, pale is different than white.

361
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,520
 It's also known as the bucket horse. The black horse is famine. Right. The red horse is war.

362
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,120
 I'm going to go ahead and ask them to make a Penn and Teller jokes out of this,

363
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:36,320
 out of the four horsemen. That'll, that'll sing. Matt is typing into his phone.

364
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:44,080
 It was a faster joke to make than to type. So that went really well. All the, all the scenes

365
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:54,080
 went really well. We had a great time doing songs. Spadoni came through again. Oh yeah.

366
00:35:54,080 --> 00:36:01,280
 Dropped it like it's hot. Um, which was great. Uh, he's just, he's just on it. And I think that was

367
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,600
 lovely. And I, you know, Spadoni is such a gift, man. That's what I'm saying. Like he,

368
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:11,200
 he's no small part of why we shine a hundred percent. And I try to explain Spadoni to other,

369
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,520
 to other performers in town and other, uh, committee performers in town, especially.

370
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,200
 I really, and I mean, this is Spadoni will listen to this, I'm sure. And this is just

371
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:28,720
 blowing smoke up his ass now, but, uh, he is so fucking good at Spadoni. Tasmanian Spadoni.

372
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:34,800
 If you want to break it up, I can read a Penn and Teller joke about, uh, pen. This one comes

373
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,040
 riding out to conquer the world, just like Teller here when he discovered tick-tock.

374
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:47,600
 Oh boy, boy chat GPT. Well, you know what? Job security, writing jobs, officially safe.

375
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,400
 Horseman spreads plague. Teller spreads 15 second card tricks that cost us actual gigs.

376
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,240
 Teller is a burden you guys. Oh boy. And, uh,

377
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:04,640
 chat GPT's fake on the Penn and Teller relationship is that Penn is dragging Teller along.

378
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,640
 And, uh, uh, also this joke is really the future is I'm pretty sure Teller is still

379
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,840
 yet to discover tick-tock. So we'll just, uh, but when he does, it's going to be a mess.

380
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,600
 No, I mean, Spadoni did, uh, my, my shows for the French festival. And, you know, one of the

381
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,680
 things we did was, uh, you know, we, we tried a big swing and then we made an adjustment together,

382
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,800
 like on the fly over like one phone conversation. And then it was just flawless, uh, for the final

383
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,920
 two shows. And, uh, I was like, it's just great to have him up there. Right. And my wife was like,

384
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,360
 well, it's just like having him for the bucket show. Right. That's a special, unique thing,

385
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,800
 like to just have like someone who's just the fingers of the glove. Right. Like I just went

386
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,800
 through those shows effortlessly. He got his laughs for adding awesome musical references and

387
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,120
 stuff and absolutely building my tricks to a crescendo. And I did this without any,

388
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:55,760
 we did no major rehearsal, no major notes. She's just, he just does it.

389
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:02,560
 Yeah. It's a, he, he catches things that you do and adds, adds things like the flashback stuff.

390
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:09,600
 Yes. He is perfect at, at finding those moments and doing the, you know,

391
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:17,280
 and even though he did it last night. And, uh, what was interesting about it is that, uh,

392
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,400
 I think it was, it was Brad. It was Brad and Jonathan. No, no, no. I had to tag in.

393
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,600
 You tagged in because they didn't know it. Correct. But you were right there and hit it.

394
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,160
 And then as soon as you did, then it was perfect. He's like, of course. Then, and then, you know,

395
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,640
 yeah, Brad and Jonathan, who don't work as a building, he played flashback during their scene

396
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,840
 and they both froze. And I tagged out Jonathan and said to Brad, I go, Hey, it's me. You're dead.

397
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:48,160
 You're younger. Yeah. You're younger than you were. Yeah. And, uh, we kept going, but it was,

398
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,960
 it was a fun, that was a fun moment. But, uh, yeah, I mean, I was driving the car with Paul

399
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,280
 last night and I just said, like, honestly, it's like the first time we, we, we did it,

400
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:04,560
 we jammed together in 2008 at the, uh, you know, uh, what was that theater called? Onyx. Onyx.

401
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,680
 Use your microphone, please. Onyx. Judgement night. Paul is holding his microphone in his mouth,

402
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,200
 or in his lap and just having a conversation. The Onyx, uh. Through the sex shop into the back.

403
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:21,360
 If we, if we, if we took a photo of a packed theater with Brad and Jonathan performing with

404
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,920
 us and send it to us in 2008, we would be like, this is awesome. Right. This is, this is badass.

405
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,840
 And it was so fun. Who are those old motherfuckers? Yeah. Like, am I dying my beard? What color is

406
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:39,840
 that? Um, and, uh, and it was fun. I mean, all these guys, I mean, it's just, it's just so fun

407
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:45,760
 to play with those guys. Brad's so smart. It was a gift. So quick. And Jonathan is just so playful

408
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,040
 and so fast and just always is ready to push anything off the rails and make a bit out of

409
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,560
 anything. And it's great. Even backstage, Brad was being, I think Brad was nervous. We're, yeah,

410
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,000
 we're yeah. Yeah. But Brad was like, uh, uh, uh, expressing it through like, like little,

411
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,080
 little fastidious activities, right? So we had like four liquid death cans and he's like, well,

412
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:10,000
 how are we going to know which one's which or whatever? And so I wrote my name sloppily on mine.

413
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,120
 So he decided he was going to write his very, uh, precisely on his can. He put little bees,

414
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,800
 little bees all along the lip and it was like, make sure you don't put it too close

415
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,920
 to where your mouth's going to be. Very strong marker taste of water. You don't want that.

416
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:30,480
 Yeah. And he was totally bidding and it was very funny. And then Jonathan came in and did the same

417
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,600
 thing. It was water can just picked up his own water cans. Oh sure. No problem. And just started

418
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:38,480
 writing the same bees all over. Just like a half an inch, not even like a quarter of an inch lower.

419
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:45,600
 Minor, a little bit lower, but pay attention. It was so funny. It just, it just bits for days

420
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:50,800
 and just, oh, it just ready, ready, ready, ready, ready. It was good. It was good. And again,

421
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:58,480
 and huge thanks to Troy for giving us the majestic space. Uh, let's think it's like last time was

422
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,560
 just everyone doing art for art sake, right? Jonathan flies in his own dime just to do an

423
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:07,680
 improv show. This guy does tours with Wayne Brady, right? Brad and Colin play thousand,

424
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:14,160
 2000 seat theaters across the nation. Right. But they come out just to do improv because just to

425
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,720
 do something else, just to do another improv show. And you know, Paul flew out and I, I guess I had

426
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:24,400
 the easiest job. I'm here. I'm already doing it. Um, and then Troy, you know, gives us an amazing

427
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,800
 deal, uh, to be there. And that's the thing is like, we're all doing art for art sake. That's

428
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,400
 right. And that, that I felt like that, I feel like that doesn't happen when you're older as much.

429
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,240
 Right. And, and, and, and Paul, um, and Troy is doing the lion's share of art for art sake. Yes.

430
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:45,040
 He's not making a lot of money at that theater and that theater being open. Uh, but Troy just

431
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:49,920
 wants, this is what happens. Troy's gives us such a good deal. I simply go, what dates open,

432
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:56,560
 right? Like what, how can we not interrupt any flow of your actual money-making endeavors in

433
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:03,840
 that theater? Uh, and, uh, and he just gives me a date and, and that's a really cool agreement to

434
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:10,320
 have, uh, with him. And, uh, so when he said July 5th, I was like a Saturday night, what, what, what,

435
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:15,440
 what? Uh, and he said, yeah, it's July 4th weekend. I go, oh, right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm dumb.

436
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,480
 So I was really worried that we were not going to, people are not going to come out, but it was a

437
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:26,000
 great, great house, jam packed. Uh, there were at, uh, so it was an eight o'clock show at about, uh,

438
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,160
 seven, right about seven o'clock. I had to walk outside, uh, just to, just to go to the car for

439
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,080
 something, maybe put something in the car or whatever it was. And, uh, there was just a guy

440
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,400
 outside at seven PM. It was like, Hey, you guys open in the house? I said, no, no, no, the shows,

441
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,800
 the show's not too late. It was, oh, no, I know. I just wanted to make sure to get here and have a

442
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:51,520
 good seat. Oh, great. Yeah. The house will open about half an hour. Um, yeah, no problem. And then

443
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,000
 he goes, great. Yeah. Thank you so much. I was just going to finish cooking these eggs on the

444
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,120
 sidewalk. No problem. And so he walked off and the, but sure enough, like he was back

445
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:04,240
 15, 20 minutes later and he was first in line at the door and he was, he's ready to come in.

446
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,840
 I was like, man, as soon as I walked up there, getting ready to open the house,

447
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:12,000
 there was a line down the sidewalk. All right, this is, this is going to be good.

448
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 It's going to be a good night. Paul was up and down off of the ground. Paul was rolling around.

449
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:25,680
 Paul, Paul was so physically ambulatory once more in the show. It is revolutionary. Well, and I'm,

450
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:31,680
 you know, I credit, I credit myself. No, I credit my fantastic doctor for fixing my hip, but I also

451
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,640
 credit myself for continuing to press forward with a somewhat physically demanding day job.

452
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,240
 Even though it's part time, I am up and down, stocking shelves on the ground, back and forth,

453
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,360
 lifting heavy boxes, dah, dah, dah, dah. And it has really helped keep me cooking. I am, I, and,

454
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,960
 and that's why I'm going to send my kids to work in a factory. It's a good idea. Good. Yeah. But

455
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,240
 yeah, I'm, I'm soon as they turn 12 and a half, it's really just turning a corner for me now.

456
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,960
 Like honestly, I'm just getting back into teaching, just getting back into just being able to drive

457
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,160
 around and feel like, okay, I can get out here and walk. Like even just at the airport, I park in the

458
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:11,520
 far off space to try and save a couple of bucks for the company. Cause it's not that much further.

459
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,960
 But when I was walking with that fucking hip, it was like going through the desert. I was like,

460
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,200
 and just walking the other day, heading back in, I was like, man. That's why I like Paul as a business

461
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,240
 partner. When he has a bum hip, he's still parking at the back. I do saving that $6. I do it. I do

462
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,240
 it for the company. Company man, company man, company man through through, but it was to be

463
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,560
 clear. I'm not as good as a company man. That's all right. No, no, no. I only park in the very

464
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:42,240
 front spot. A valet. Yeah. How much is it? I don't care. But of the, of the three of us,

465
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:47,600
 I probably need the steps more anyway, so it's fine. S J does ask every now and she'll be like,

466
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:53,360
 is the, is your company paying for this? Yes. Or yeah, why don't you, why don't you just spend this?

467
00:44:54,080 --> 00:45:03,680
 It's my company. It's not someone else's company paying for it. It's not a different, it's,

468
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:10,960
 it's still our money. Yeah. We have 900 amazing bosses out there. They don't want us

469
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:16,320
 getting the valet service at the airport. No, no, no. Whose money do you think I'm spending?

470
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:24,960
 Exactly. And, uh, we went out, we, uh, the three of us went out to brunch yesterday and, uh, uh,

471
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,920
 we came back and makers and fixtures, makers and finders, makers and finders. Yeah. Yeah. I thought

472
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,320
 it was fixtures, but either way, the name makes no sense. Who cares? Yeah. But, uh, neither one

473
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:38,720
 of those, neither one of those words mean empanadas. And that's what that's known for. When I first saw

474
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:44,240
 makers, I'm like, that's a, like a poop analogy. That's what, that's what people say to their kids.

475
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:51,440
 Now, does, does, does baby need to make? Oh, no. I don't like that. You've never done it though.

476
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:57,280
 No, no, but it's gross, right? Yeah. That's when I heard makers and finders. I'm like, oh no,

477
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:04,000
 I find you got to find, oh, if it's a sinker, I find makers and sinkers. Cause if you make it,

478
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,960
 you can make, you can make a sinker. You don't want it to sink. Right. If you're, if you're

479
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,040
 healthy, it's floating makers and floaters is what you want. That's what you want. That's it.

480
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:20,400
 Our health expert, Paul Mattingly talks about the proper poops. This guy walks more than all of us

481
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,320
 from a sparkly space at the airport. It's true. And shit's more than all of you combined.

482
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:30,320
 I'm just up there dropping off the car at valet and here comes Mattingly. It's a sweaty mess.

483
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,640
 I know about the parking lot. I'm not a sweaty mess. That's the other thing too is like,

484
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:40,640
 I have some endurance again. I have some, some stamina. I wasn't winded during the show at all.

485
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:47,200
 Good. Good. Like this is great. I can do this show. I made a point of, um, during the week,

486
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:52,240
 the, the two or three weeks before the show, I made a point of doing a lot of singing in the car

487
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:58,960
 because I hadn't been using vocalizing singing a lot to get my voice up. Keep that mic in front

488
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:05,040
 of your face. I'm, I'm, I'm what they call a performer. Yes. Yes. That's right. Who called

489
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:15,680
 you that? And she says, what sort of performative is this? And I say, thank you. I thought I was

490
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:26,720
 eating pussy. Yeah. And she's like, well, why don't you tell your mouth sideways? Like a typewriter.

491
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:32,320
 God damn it. Damn it. Always with the sideways, just running a bit into the ground. I'll tell you

492
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:39,440
 who else was not impressed by Paul's Cuddlingus. And that is the following sponsor. Slappy tears.

493
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,840
 That's right. Drive through funeral services. Say that final goodbye to your loved one from the

494
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:51,600
 comfort of your car. One, uh, with one slow speed slap on their urn or casket before going on with

495
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:56,720
 the rest of your day. That's from little Sally scoop in 2024, slappy tears, a drive through

496
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:04,880
 funeral services. Here, but it's, uh, it's the Elvis, uh, it's Elvis from the, we know where

497
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,000
 you're from. It was, it's okay. Yeah. Well, that's right. Yeah. That's where I live depending on

498
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 which there's only one of you, right? Well, no, there were two of me. Did you know I was a twin?

499
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:22,720
 That's true. No, it's true. My babe, my baby brother died. My baby brother died before I was

500
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:30,080
 more before you were born. He died. He died. Born. He bored died anyway. So I've been prepping for

501
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:35,760
 this my whole life. Essentially. I was prepping for this before my life even started. Oftentimes

502
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:42,960
 we have to say goodbye to our loved ones, but we don't know how. So Elvis here has made it easy.

503
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,960
 I made it real easy for you. I got to do is get in your pink Cadillac and to drive,

504
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,920
 drive right on by and give that older and a slap. Just come on by and give that earn a slap. Say

505
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,720
 goodbye. Baby brother who died in the womb with me, who I hung out with dead in the womb. That was

506
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:03,520
 something, boy, not much of a conversation. It's my baby brother. He's dead. Yeah. He was stillborn.

507
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:09,680
 Yeah. She's not going to talk. Yeah. That was the funny thing of my mama. Mama said, mama said,

508
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,600
 mama said, your brother was stillborn. I said, well, yeah, he came out, right? And she says,

509
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,880
 yeah, but that means he's dead. I said, oh, I thought you meant he was dead, but then he

510
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:23,200
 was stillborn. She's no, he was stillborn means dead. That's a real clever turn of phrase of us.

511
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:28,240
 Good work. Good work talking to your mama. Thank you very much. I came over that one on a fly.

512
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:33,040
 Me and mama, me and mama were having a little conversation about it. You know, it's always fun

513
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:38,240
 to hang out with your mama and joke about your dead baby brother. That's what you do at home.

514
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:45,760
 Yeah. Yeah. Well, speaking of gallows humor, come on down to my funeral home. Elvis is slappy,

515
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:53,440
 slappy, goodbyes, slappy, goodbyes for your dead baby brother or whoever else might be dead.

516
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:58,960
 And you can slap them and just go, you don't have to stay and listen to some bullshit about

517
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:09,120
 the Lord or whatever. Just go home, go home, go home. Thank you very much. Interhase groups to

518
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:14,320
 check out. Boy, I'm glad Paul was doing that vocalizing in his car to warm up for that.

519
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:18,640
 Yeah. I'm, as they say, performative. Paul would have, I thought you're eating pussy.

520
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:26,400
 Boy, are you eating? Oh, look at that. Look at that circle in that circle. God damn. That's,

521
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:32,560
 that's the finest looking titty I ever saw. Hey, uh, hey Priscilla, you might get a little bit of

522
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:36,960
 work done. So you booze look more like circles and circles. Okay. Okay. Great. You don't like

523
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:43,040
 these pepperonis? Oh, well, yeah. You know what? I'm going to put a little fried manner sandwich on

524
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:50,080
 him. Okay. On him. Nipples. Fried man or nipples. I just don't want to see the translation in the

525
00:50:50,080 --> 00:51:02,880
 screen grab. Uh, speaking of SJ. Yeah. We've not talked about this. Okay. Piff the magic dragon.

526
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:11,280
 Oh yes, this. SJ and the ruckus. Winners. Winners of best comedian and best band. Yeah, that's right.

527
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:18,080
 From the Las Vegas weekly. Uh, and, uh, you know, uh, a lot of that was that we, we, we,

528
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:23,360
 we launched a campaign. We launched a campaign and our scoops, we talked about it on this very show

529
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:29,120
 and, and, and they got scoops friends. Yes. Put them over the top. That's what scoops do. That's

530
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:34,480
 right. They come through and change the subject for a moment. Congratulations to city cast of

531
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:43,680
 Las Vegas for winning best podcast. Congratulations to be fair. We have had David Jan Fiegler on the

532
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:49,680
 show. How is that fair? How does that help the argument of fairness? We know the winners. Yes,

533
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:55,440
 but we are, we are, we've been on their show. Right. We helped them win. We are winner adjacent,

534
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,400
 but I will also say in this, it doesn't feel like winner adjacent. Paul, they're in Las Vegas. It's

535
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:07,680
 Las Vegas awards. Of course we're adjacent to them. We're also in Las Vegas. In this situation,

536
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:14,080
 I feel okay because David Jan Fiegler that makes one of us is the one who helped Jimmy Sloanina out.

537
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:20,640
 Yes. His pinch David figures as a, as a, as an attorney legit fucking hero. Yes. He is representing

538
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,480
 all the people who've been wrongfully arrested during protests. Right. He's been helping people

539
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,920
 get out of jail. Uh, he, he's a, he's a better person than us, but is he better podcaster than us?

540
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,480
 We're not disagreeing that he's a better person than us. It's just, is he a better podcaster?

541
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,360
 Right. Maybe the answer is also yes, but still does he need this award more than us?

542
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:48,960
 Yes, but even still, I'm okay with it. Well, that's good. I'll get there. Okay. Paul's okay

543
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:56,800
 with it. Yeah. And you know what? I'm not planning on stopping this. So now that we have one best

544
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:02,800
 podcast, we did win back in 2016. Exactly. We peaked and I'm done. And that was, that was,

545
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,600
 that wasn't just best podcast Las Vegas. That was just best podcast. Yeah. Period. Yeah. That's the

546
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:15,840
 problem. The category is too narrow. That's what it is. That's the problem. Wait, wait, wait, wait,

547
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:22,000
 wait. You guys consider yourselves a Vegas podcast. I consider you universal. Yeah. That's why they

548
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,360
 found a Paul is in Pittsburgh disqualified us. That's what happened. I mean, David's podcast is

549
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:33,120
 about Las Vegas. It is a Las Vegas podcast award. Like his show is about Las Vegas. Our show is just

550
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:37,520
 happens to be in Las Vegas. Uh, so it's just another way that he's better than us. Yeah.

551
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:43,520
 Yeah. I mean, David has a law degree, you know, like a real sub this show, we don't have to keep

552
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:48,000
 listing ways that he's better than us. We just, I just don't have anything. He can hang his diplomas

553
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
 and degrees on the wall. I can't, I need awards. Right. I need awards to hang on the wall because

554
00:53:52,000 --> 00:54:00,400
 I don't have any other things I've ever accomplished. Matt, Matt, don't say that.

555
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:06,000
 We got some pictures from last night. Yeah, we have pictures. Put some pictures up from last

556
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,600
 night to be like, look, I performed with some great players. Actually, one of the guys we got

557
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,600
 up was a photographer. I will shout out his Instagram because he, he took a lot of great

558
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:18,080
 photos, but let me find him. Uh, I leaned up because I had to put a microphone stand down,

559
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:25,280
 but Paul thought I was trying to show him my phone. Ah, yes. Uh, third, third I viz, V I Z

560
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:31,280
 third. I viz took, yeah, it took a lot of great photos of us. Yeah. Uh, we'll put them up on our

561
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,840
 socials as well. And he does a lot of, uh, a lot of comedians in town. Yes. Yes. Pictures of comedy

562
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:39,760
 shows. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was really fun hanging out with me, me hung out for a bit last

563
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:45,600
 night. I got him a poker chip. I brought poker chips to hand out to people. Good. I know everyone

564
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:56,320
 I tried to give a chip to already had one. So weird. I was watching Matt would go around and

565
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:00,160
 be like, hi, can I give you a poker chip? They'd be like, Paul gave me one. Yeah. Sometimes that

566
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:06,800
 does happen, but that didn't happen last night. Okay. All right. All right. But plenty of times

567
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:10,400
 I've beaten you guys at a punch on a poker chip thing. Yeah. Because you haven't, we don't. That's

568
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:15,360
 right. There is that you are chipped for. Well, I'm trying to promote this goddamn podcast. Get

569
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:20,720
 some more ears on this shit. I want to be awarded to do that. We're out here spinning gold. I'm

570
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:26,800
 going to say it's been an Elvis gold. Uh, you got some more chips. Yeah. You still like in general

571
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:31,520
 or on me, you had a discovery of some, well here. Oh yeah. Yeah. They're chips. I need to grab some.

572
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,680
 You were doing some construction in a wall. You found some old chips from like the fifties and

573
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:42,800
 someone asked him a Monte auto chips. That's right. I thought I had, I thought I had buried

574
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:48,960
 these forever and they are rediscovered. Do you think we've got some red ones now? Yeah. There's

575
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:54,320
 some red ones out there. Sweet. I think we've got red and black. I love it. I think those are two

576
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:59,280
 general colors that we have. Yep. Speaking of SJ and the ruckus. Oh shit. There comes SJ.

577
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:08,480
 Winner of best of Las Vegas. Good morning. It's like back in the day when SJ would just pop in.

578
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:14,560
 That's right. Roll out of bed. Go see what the boys are doing. Pretty much. When we had,

579
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:20,320
 now she has my mic. I know. Yeah. As they just walked in, took Matt's microphone and then walked

580
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:23,520
 away from that. It's okay. Well, you did hand it to me. Yeah, but I didn't know where you were

581
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:29,360
 going. We can share. Yeah. There you go. There we go. John, give this to the mic. There you go.

582
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:34,080
 Yeah. We can share. There you go. What's going on y'all? Winner. We're looking at a winner right

583
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:38,560
 now. We were just talking about you. Are you winning the best of Las Vegas? No. And how we

584
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:52,800
 didn't. Yeah. How one of us is a winner. I got to tell you guys. SJ's pity tone just made Paul spit.

585
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:01,360
 I got to tell you, it really changed our relationship in the house. Our relationship

586
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:15,440
 in this house has not been the same. SJ just patted this podcast on the shoulder and said,

587
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:23,120
 we're really good friends. Exactly. You guys are so sweet. You're like a brother to me podcast.

588
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:29,120
 You're like a brother to me. Oh shit. Well, Jacob told me, he was like, hey,

589
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:37,840
 he told me, he's like, hey, Pip was here and he wants to win this thing. But on the same page is

590
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:44,640
 best band and best podcast. So we were like, oh, this would be cool. Let's just do all of it.

591
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:50,640
 Let's get a sweep. Yeah. Yeah. And we almost did. Two out of three aim bad. That's right.

592
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:57,200
 We won the Derby and the Preakness, but failed at the Belmont. There we go.

593
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:05,360
 We also didn't win a best patio. Yeah. That's okay. You might have though, because I don't think

594
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:11,040
 I got like, they found me through Facebook. You might have one, but Jacob's whiskey pit doesn't

595
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:19,120
 have a Facebook page or a phone number. It's fake as hell. Yeah. We didn't follow through on the bit.

596
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:22,560
 That's what we're saying. We should have made a Facebook page. We should have made an actual

597
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:26,800
 Jacob's whiskey. You might've won. You just didn't know. We don't know. We don't know. You'll never

598
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:34,640
 know. So what's it like? What's it like being a winner, SJ? What's it feel like to win in life?

599
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:40,480
 We want to know. You already know you've won stuff before. I think we've won. I think we have won the

600
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:48,160
 weekly. I think we've won the award we're talking about before too. Was that 2017? Yeah. The year

601
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:52,640
 after we won the first one. Cause that was, Corey helped us out with that one. That's right. Getting

602
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:57,120
 us. Yeah. Cause like we went to the event for that. SJ went to the event this year. Yeah. I was up at

603
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:02,800
 the Mandalay Bay at the time. Oh yeah. It was at Founders. What's that place called? Yeah. Founders

604
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:07,440
 room. Founders room. The post party. That's it. Yeah. The post party was cool. Founders room is the

605
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:12,000
 room at Brian Brushwood's place where all the founders hang out. That's where I went. That's

606
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,880
 where I went. Is that near the break studio? It is. Okay. You guys got it. You know what it's like.

607
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,680
 It was at the resorts world this year. So yeah, it was really cool. Honestly though, seriously,

608
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:28,320
 it was like super, I, I forgot about it. Jacob told me about it and I totally forgot.

609
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:32,160
 And then I got this call from this guy and he's like, from the weekly. Yeah. Yeah. From the weekly.

610
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:37,280
 And he's so excited. He's so excited to tell me. And I'm like, what are you talking about?

611
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:44,160
 Give me a lawyer. I know. Right. It was really great. Um, but yeah, we went to the,

612
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:50,960
 the band was like, what? We won? Yeah. They like, I was like, yeah guys, like this happened and

613
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,960
 everyone's just like freaking out. Right. So a couple of them went to the party with me,

614
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,600
 but it was just like, I don't know when the band it's, it's great because it all ties in so nicely

615
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:04,960
 because the band knows the scoops because the band plays in front of the scoops at scoop fest. Yeah.

616
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:09,520
 So like they were excited not only to win the award, but they were excited that the scoops had,

617
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:14,800
 had banded together to support them and everything. So they're the guys, especially, I think we're just

618
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:20,640
 genuinely touched by the whole thing. Yeah. So we're pretty pumped. Yeah. So thanks guys.

619
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:24,960
 The awkwardness of feeling is that you're not leaning in and I think you guys should walk around

620
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:31,360
 like we are the best. We are the best. Yeah. So we've been posting like obnoxiously about it and

621
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:35,120
 like you, you got, I don't know, you guys probably don't have it, but like in the Vegas, like

622
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:41,920
 entertainer world, like everyone's already throwing shade at us. Like they're like someone posted,

623
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:47,200
 Oh, isn't it cute when like Vegas people just give each other awards, like right after we were like

624
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:51,120
 going off about this and people were like, yeah, I know it's so stupid. I'm like, you're not getting

625
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:56,880
 hired again. You're not getting hired. These are people who like sub for us. These are musicians.

626
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:03,680
 Yes. What are you doing? That's really dumb. That's just really stupid. I know. I know you guys

627
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:09,280
 probably didn't run into that, but we only have, we only have nice. Sarah, Sarah Ross and Brenna

628
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:17,600
 Folger were like, fuck those guys. We, uh, we really, you know, the scoop community is the

629
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:21,920
 outlier community of the internet, which is wonderful. We are, we are insulated from all that,

630
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:28,960
 that crazy shit, but also personally, and I think you as well, I think all of us ascribe to this.

631
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:36,880
 I am okay with applauding, being happy for people and giving them their flowers when they are rising.

632
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:42,080
 Right. Even if I'm not doing so great, I mean, because it's, maybe it's just not my time right

633
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:47,520
 now. It comes around, but if you don't about not my time or whatever, don't be an asshole. Right.

634
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,520
 But, but if you can't celebrate other people's victories, what do you expect is going to happen

635
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:56,960
 when you win? Exactly. You know what I mean? Like you gotta be, well, they're not going to win because

636
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:01,360
 they just talked to themselves. Well, that's, but high tide raises all boats, man. Right. That's an

637
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:05,920
 improv thing too though. I mean, like we, we literally have each other's backs because if you,

638
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:10,240
 cause that's all you got out there on the stage. And if you're not just ready to be like that

639
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:15,920
 motherfucker just nailed it. No, I have some, I also have some hack bits I can go to any moment.

640
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:20,160
 Oh yeah. No, you do. I keep some stuff in the back pocket. Yeah. Yeah. You know, well rehearsed,

641
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:29,360
 clever bits. Oh, you have clever ones too. I didn't bust them out. So saving for a rainy day.

642
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:38,320
 But you got all those away. You gotta be happy for other people's successes. Yeah. It's also

643
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:44,720
 business. Unless it's a business, unless it's like, unless it's like a billionaire won something,

644
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:51,040
 then you're like, well, fuck you. Even then it's just people giving each other awards. Right. But

645
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:54,400
 it's always going to be like people in the same industry giving each other awards. That's what

646
01:02:54,400 --> 01:03:02,080
 awards are. Whereas the Oscars are very much more globally merit based. They're very external.

647
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:07,360
 Right. Well, even if you're not super happy for them, don't come out and talk shit. It's like,

648
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:11,920
 just let it be. That's so dumb. Like whatever. Like obviously, you know, just moving on,

649
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,600
 but I just thought it was funny. Like throw in shade like that, but wow, come on guys.

650
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:23,680
 Yeah. Well, basically like the, the, the, the whatever's darkest, uh, not darkest, the most like,

651
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:28,800
 um, detached or whatever. What's the emotion for like not wanting to give a shit about nonchalant.

652
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,920
 The most nonchalant you should be is go, Oh, well they're going to get more work. Like that

653
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:36,640
 should be the most like, Oh, good for you. Good for them. More work. I used to be the, like the

654
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:44,480
 most, the limit of whatever, like how dare they reward locals stuff for doing a working local band

655
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,960
 won an award. Fuck off. Yeah. I scroll through those awards and I go like, Oh great. These people

656
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:53,680
 won. And that's the end that I, that's, that's the last that I think about. Exactly. And by the way,

657
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:58,960
 like in terms of like for you guys, like it actually does, like if you, if you put a best of Vegas

658
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:04,320
 sign up, uh, uh, out before, on the, on the casino, before they go into the lounge and say going in,

659
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:07,200
 they're going to be a little more curious about like, who are these guys and maybe give you a

660
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:12,560
 little more credit. It's so interesting. Like we're yeah, exactly for that reason. So anyways, um,

661
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:17,840
 I know it was like funny for you guys, but thanks. Well, we're glad with no, it's, it's, you know,

662
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:22,720
 it gives us a good band at scoop fest guy. Damn it. That's best band in town. Hey, I know. So

663
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:27,040
 that's the other thing too is, um, we actually got, um, asked to go to lawful net weekend for like,

664
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:30,160
 it's a big concert weekend out there. And I was talking to the boys and I was like,

665
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:38,880
 guys, we got to play scoop fest now, figure out a way to handle it. She left it up to the guys. She,

666
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:44,080
 okay. The guys, the guys decide to do scoop fest. They were like, we got to do scoop.

667
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:48,480
 Also, it's a much more fun gig than, uh, than anything else. We actually didn't want you to

668
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:54,240
 lose out, uh, uh, uh, on scoop fest. So we, we went on the Loughlin message board and so I guess

669
01:04:54,240 --> 01:05:00,720
 I'll let anyone play Loughlin now. Uh, see if we can just get them to pull the offer.

670
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,960
 Oh look, Loughlin people giving each other awards.

671
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:10,000
 Loughlin all the way to the bank. Did you guys see speaking of Loughlin, uh, did you guys see

672
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,840
 the plane emergency landing out there? So Loughlin, Nevada is right on the border, uh,

673
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:19,120
 with, uh, Arizona. It's right, it's right there on the Colorado river. It's beautiful,

674
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:24,480
 beautiful town out there, uh, right there by the Arizona border, uh, right on the other side of the

675
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:29,040
 river. Jacob, all of our listeners watched Viva Loughlin with Hugh Jackman when it was on TV.

676
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:35,920
 That's right. They know. And so they don't need to explain Loughlin. And so they know all about bullhead city over

677
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:42,720
 there on the other side of the river. So bullhead city is like Loughlin, just a small Arizona city

678
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:48,400
 right there on the, on their side. It's the Nevada border, an American airlines flight. The other, uh,

679
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:54,960
 the other day earlier this week, it was all the crazy storms, crazy wind, an American airlines

680
01:05:54,960 --> 01:06:00,640
 flight, you know, like a seven 37 size plane, whatever type of plane it was, had to land at

681
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:07,600
 the bullhead city airport in Arizona, which is just a landing strip. There is no airport. There

682
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:14,400
 is no airport staff. There's nothing. So a plane full of passengers had to land in bullhead city,

683
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:21,920
 Arizona, uh, to divert there. There was, there are no other planes for them to get onto the crew on

684
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:28,880
 their plane timed out. So they weren't able legally to fly anymore. Yeah. And so a plane full of

685
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:34,720
 people, uh, come from away style. Basically it was, it was the come from away in Arizona.

686
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:40,320
 What's interesting is that Loughlin is actually, and this is a true, uh, thing. They're, they're,

687
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:47,280
 they're lobbying to get, uh, support from the state because basically we're going to be building a new

688
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:52,720
 terminal because our airport traffic is getting crazy and they want to be an overflow terminal.

689
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:58,560
 Okay. And so they want the resources to quickly shuttle people from there. Oh, it'd be great.

690
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:04,560
 Oh, that'd be amazing. I mean, if you do that, you can build out Loughlin. You can make it a

691
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:11,520
 suburb. Yeah. It just, all you gotta do is put a billion dollars into a, uh, uh, high-speed rail.

692
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:21,120
 Well, I guess, uh, maybe in 20 to 50, maybe, maybe, maybe. Um, but, uh, best in Loughlin now.

693
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:26,000
 But so, but I bet like, but basically like that helps them make their case. Right. See, see,

694
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,640
 we're right here. We're right here. We're the closest airport. Yeah. It is like an hour drive.

695
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:34,720
 I mean, it's not, it's not very far out of Vegas. No, but that's, but, but if it had high-speed

696
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:39,760
 train, you can get there in 20 minutes. Paul, no one has not, no one said high-speed rail. You're

697
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,600
 the only one who said high-speed rail. You're right. It is much more pleasurable to just drive

698
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:48,800
 to Loughlin. That's the only option on the table, Paul. Yeah. It's gorgeous drive though.

699
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:53,040
 You're the only one who said there's going to be a high-speed rail between the two.

700
01:07:53,040 --> 01:08:01,920
 No other, I didn't say it. I'm demanding it. I'm demanding it. And then you just shat on it.

701
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:08,560
 Drive that fucking thing. Drive. Eat shit. Cars. I don't want to do that. No, it's a beautiful drive

702
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:13,200
 where you see nothing. Fuck off with that. Yeah, it's garbage. And then once you get there,

703
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:19,600
 you're in Loughlin. So that's the upside. Oh yeah. This is where we're launching

704
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:26,400
 the SJ and the Ruckus party bus shuttle from Loughlin to Vegas. 45 minute concerts. See,

705
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:31,920
 once you get a few things, yeah, once you get a few things out there, then you can do it. Yeah.

706
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:39,280
 Lawless Loughlin. It is the Loughlin's for scofflaws. You can have them for free, Loughlin.

707
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:44,080
 Loughlin's for scofflaws. Give them time to get out of bed. Just like Virginia's for lovers.

708
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:48,800
 Loughlin's for scofflaws. And are there whores out there? Is that the thing?

709
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:57,360
 No. Is that the other direction? I'm pretty sure whores are in every direction.

710
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:04,320
 You know what I mean? You want me to bite your whore in Loughlin? Legal whores. You're thinking

711
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:08,240
 about Perot. I know. No, I'm not thinking about it. I'm thinking about Loughlin. Paul's always

712
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:13,040
 thinking about Perot. I'm trying to get Loughlin on the Perot bandwagon here. I don't know if

713
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:18,800
 Loughlin has legal prostitution or not. See, and there should be because just like everything,

714
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:25,680
 technology-based, porn goes first. Where porn goes, technology goes. You are fucking so out of

715
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:31,120
 pocket on everything you're talking about. I don't know what he's doing anymore. I'm just so glad

716
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:36,320
 that he warmed up his singing voice. We want a train. The only way you can get a good train

717
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:42,880
 is if you run high-speed rail on some whores. You know when they show the public access meetings

718
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:47,120
 and the one guy gets up and talks and everyone's like, "What is he talking about?" Paul's like the

719
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:52,640
 second guy at the Loughlin public access meeting. I'm just 10 years ahead. I'm just 10 years ahead.

720
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:58,400
 You're light years ahead, buddy. Okay. Honestly, that's where technology is always guided by

721
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:05,280
 pornography. That is the truth. From the printing press to the Tijuana Bible to the speed train

722
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:12,320
 between Loughlin and Vegas is an overflow airport. Porn leads the way. Absolutely. Absolutely.

723
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:20,800
 As always. In conclusion. In conclusion, split some rails on these whores and get this train built,

724
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:26,560
 Governor. Town meeting adjourned. Meeting adjourned. Meeting adjourned. Hey, Sharks,

725
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:36,240
 did you know the sex industry is a ... If you build a whore train, people will come.

726
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:47,600
 Get on the ho train. You can ride ho train. The ho train to Loughlin would be sold out every day.

727
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:52,800
 I can't believe. The ho train to Loughlin. And I'll fuck you at the station.

728
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:58,320
 I can't believe you're putting SJ's new band name on blast. Ho train to Loughlin. The ho train

729
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:05,440
 to Loughlin. Listen, I think that sounds fun. Right? Just a fucking party train full of loose,

730
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:10,560
 loose men and ladies. I'm actually not here to ... I'm just watching season two of Severance,

731
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:17,520
 but I just like the atmosphere. You're the one nerdy guy on his laptop the whole time while there's

732
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:21,040
 just balls swinging. If you built a bullet train to Loughlin, that's what it would be anyway. Just a

733
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:26,400
 bunch of loose people. Of course. The ho train to Loughlin would be. And the people who like

734
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:32,960
 the Colorado River. Colorado River enthusiasts. But the other thing is-

735
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:36,320
 Man, that count. It would make a bunch of these people feel so like,

736
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:41,200
 because it would end up being, if it's a good high-speed rail, 25 minutes tops.

737
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:46,800
 Oh yeah. Plenty of time to clean up. Done. Don't have to be overly performative with your lover.

738
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:52,000
 It's the rushing of cleaning. That's really what's been holding back the industry here in Vegas.

739
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,280
 Don't rush me. But you've only got 25 minutes,

740
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,320
 so you better just get to the biz. Do your business and clean up.

741
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:11,440
 Grab your copy of Powers. Get on that train and go. Well, I hope everyone who has governance over

742
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:16,080
 Loughlin is listening. I hope the Arizona and Nevada governor have taken notice.

743
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:23,280
 They know what. Isn't the founder of Loughlin, his name is like Ted Loughlin, right? Don Loughlin.

744
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:27,520
 Have you even been on the cruise that tells you all this stuff? I've been on it twice.

745
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:33,760
 Today. It does seem like a fun town. I've never split any horse there, but it's been fun. Loughlin

746
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:39,360
 is for scofflaws. I mean, I'm going to tell you right now, if next year we had scoop fest in

747
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:45,200
 Loughlin, it would be awesome. I'm on board. On board the whole train to Loughlin. I'll

748
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:48,880
 fuck you at the station. We already have another location in mind. We do. We do think,

749
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:54,160
 it's maybe premature, but I think we're pretty confident. I do, yeah. This is our last year at

750
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:58,960
 the Orleans, I think. I think so. Don't tell them that yet. Don't let the Orleans know yet.

751
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:04,400
 They don't listen. Oh, you think? Actually, they're probably really grateful. We are happy

752
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,280
 with the Orleans. We love the Orleans. Whoever's listening for the Orleans is working somewhere

753
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:11,520
 else in two months anyway. Ah, it's through. That's true. There is turnover there. Except

754
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:16,320
 the one tech guy. The one tech guy. We've had the same tech guy. Yeah, he's got it easy over there.

755
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:20,960
 Yeah, he's great. That's hard to replace. Yeah, probably not him. That's like being like,

756
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:25,520
 you know where the rats chew the wires. Oh, yeah. Right. Yeah, yeah. When the lights turn off,

757
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:30,080
 he's like, the rat got to the wire again. Hold on. Exactly. Well, we're coming to the end here,

758
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:34,400
 and I just want to just say that let's go around the room and let's all just say things that we

759
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:39,440
 could teach. We could teach the people of Loughlin. Loughlin lessons is what we'll end on. Loughlin

760
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:47,680
 lessons. All right. Take a fucking bath, you stinky cheese assholes. Learn to wash your ass,

761
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:55,520
 you Turkey track underwear motherfuckers looking like you fucking fast and furious in your drawers.

762
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:03,040
 Fix it up. Don't just be fucking Paul Walker and write down your ass crack all day long with your

763
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:09,520
 burnout. Peel, peel poo poos. Fucking wash that crack. You dirty Loughlin bitches. If you want a

764
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:21,840
 high speed fuck rail, wash your ass and balls. Paul took mine, so Jacob. Sorry, I didn't listen

765
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,560
 for all of it. Did he say the thing about wash your ass and balls? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, okay.

766
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:29,200
 Then in that case, I'm good too. I'm good too. Yeah. Got it. Okay. Well, thanks for listening,

 I don't wash my ass or balls. I've been fucking on the railroad.

 All these Loughlin whores with dirty seats and sweaty meats. We're heading out to Loughlin.

 All right. Can you smell that Loughlin train? It's coming down the track. You can smell that

783
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:09,840
 [Music]

784
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:13,520
 It's a business proposal. It's a business proposal.

785
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:19,920
 Ain't no sensitivity when it's business and it's business.

786
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:29,200
 I'm fucking whores in Loughlin. That's all I ever do.

787
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:36,320
 It's fun down there. Y'all don't even know. I bet Loughlin's great. I don't know if we're

788
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:41,200
 still on air. I don't want to pull my mic forward. We're still on the air. I was trying to see if I

789
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:45,040
 could do magic shows out there. I love it out there. I think it's so cool. Is your underwear

790
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:49,120
 stinky enough to get in? That's what they asked right away. They hand them over. And the answer
