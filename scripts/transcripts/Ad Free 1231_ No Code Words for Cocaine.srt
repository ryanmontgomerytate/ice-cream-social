1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,960
 I would love to thank you, the Ice Cream Truck Drivers, thank you so much Ice Cream Truck

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,960
 Drivers.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,040
 I'd like to thank right now, Richard Dunn, Sarah Boyle, Sax Guy, Jimmy D, Scoop, Scoop

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:22,960
 Brady, Scoop DeJure, Scoop Kata, Slurpee K.A., Motherfucker, Thunder Cougar Falcon, Scoop

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,880
 and Travis Jagare.

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,600
 If you want to be an Ice Cream Truck Driver just like these fine folks, head over to PreachingFund.com,

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:36,760
 where you can go sign up to be an Ice Cream Truck Driver and who knows, the life you save

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,880
 may be your own.

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:01:10,640
 And now, a show!

10
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:21,880
 We are!

11
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,560
 So you're in some alien jank right now?

12
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,720
 You know I'm always into aliens, you know I'm always interested in the alien stuff.

13
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:37,120
 So Ann, Ann brought this up to me yesterday and I don't know if you guys have heard about

14
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:44,880
 this.

15
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,880
 Any bets?

16
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,880
 I bet I haven't.

17
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,880
 Any bets on what you think this might be?

18
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,880
 Aliens!

19
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,120
 Well, who knows?

20
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,560
 The Senate is made up of lizard people?

21
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,680
 Nothing so, nothing so gauche.

22
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,680
 No.

23
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,480
 Oh, how great would that be?

24
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,160
 Do you have any idea how nice it would be to just find out that they were all lizard

25
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,160
 people the whole time?

26
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,200
 We'd all be like, "Oh, at least they were just lizard people."

27
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,400
 It would make more sense.

28
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,960
 Would you rather discover that the entirety of the Epstein List is just lizard people

29
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,760
 and not pedos?

30
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,920
 It would weirdly, I think, make me feel better.

31
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,920
 Technically, yes.

32
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,920
 About life in general.

33
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,920
 I guess, right?

34
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,880
 Less pedophiles on the earth.

35
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,880
 I don't know.

36
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,880
 Anyway.

37
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,280
 Pedophilia, lizards, I guess that's a new problem we have to deal with.

38
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,960
 Ann brought this up to me and I was like, "What?"

39
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,280
 And I haven't really looked into it too much, but I've just seen a couple of these headlines

40
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,720
 and it just popped up against in my feed and it says, "Breaking.

41
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:51,160
 A new study suggests that a potentially hostile seven-mile-long alien spacecraft may be headed

42
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,000
 towards earth, scientists say."

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Scientists say.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 And what I love is that-

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 All of them.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 All of the scientists say.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:09,080
 This was tagged by an account I follow and their headline over this is, "What did Trump

48
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,200
 do in those Epstein files?"

49
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:18,160
 It's like the kind of shit that people are coming up with for excuses.

50
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,000
 It's just ridiculous.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,840
 But yeah, Ann was telling me about that.

52
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,040
 Do you guys remember Moa Moa a couple years back?

53
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,520
 Yeah, the song, Moa Moa, Moa Moa.

54
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,520
 That's right.

55
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,520
 Moa Moa.

56
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,520
 That's right.

57
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,080
 And that song is all about the cigar-shaped turd-looking thing that came flying through

58
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,080
 our galaxy.

59
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,040
 I do remember the cigar-shaped asteroid or whatever.

60
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,040
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

61
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,040
 Do you remember it?

62
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,040
 Yeah.

63
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
 I do.

64
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

65
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,840
 And folks are still torn as to whether or not it had any kind of intelligence behind

66
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,600
 it or what it might be, if it was just a dead probe or what it was, but it was a very uniquely

67
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:05,440
 shaped space object and passed close enough to us to be an interesting thing.

68
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,080
 So we'll see.

69
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,080
 Yeah.

70
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,120
 Bazzi says, "Yeah, it makes a lot of sense that a species capable of traveling over light

71
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,720
 speed has no stealth capabilities."

72
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
 Right?

73
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,000
 I mean, things fall apart when you look at it too quick.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,760
 Don't start looking at stuff.

75
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,120
 You're a part of the problem, Bazzi.

76
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
 You're asking questions.

77
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
 No, I honestly...

78
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:31,280
 I don't know, Wayne in the chat just says sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.

79
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,280
 You'll get no argument from me, Dr. Freed.

80
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,440
 I'm afraid not.

81
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,000
 But that makes me laugh.

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,760
 And who knows, maybe the spacemans are a-coming.

83
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,760
 Maybe.

84
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,760
 That's the big take.

85
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,320
 Maybe the spacemans are coming.

86
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,320
 That's the first one.

87
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,320
 See you, everybody.

88
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,320
 That's the first one.

89
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,320
 Maybe spacemans.

90
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,320
 Maybe they're coming.

91
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,320
 Maybe they're coming.

92
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,160
 I just got back from Saratoga Springs, New York.

93
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,200
 Oh, I'm sorry, Matt, you don't want to talk about the spacemans anymore?

94
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,400
 I was looking for an inn, and just that it's seven miles long and it's a-coming just didn't

95
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
 give me too much.

96
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
 I mean, right.

97
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,080
 I need to go find the article.

98
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,800
 There's really not a whole lot more, I don't think.

99
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
 Why start now?

100
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
 It's too late.

101
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,640
 You should have found the article before we went on air.

102
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,360
 No, it just popped up in my feed again, and the fact that it hit again reminded me that

103
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,680
 Ann brought it to my attention.

104
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,040
 When Ann brings something to my attention, I find it newsworthy.

105
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
 It's go time.

106
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,040
 That's basically it.

107
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,040
 I'll look it up.

108
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
 I'll look it up.

109
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
 Oh, good, good.

110
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
 Yeah.

111
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,280
 But you were in Saratoga Springs for the horsies?

112
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:48,640
 Yeah, when I saw the ponies, and Nicholas Newman once again cemented himself as an honorary

113
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:55,580
 Donnelly child by writing up very hilarious pink sheets for betting sheets for it.

114
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:01,540
 I do have to break the news to Nick via this podcast that as my older brothers were losing

115
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:10,880
 more and more bets, they became less and less interested in the comedic bits of Nick Newman.

116
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,560
 They weren't interested in laughing and losing money at the same time.

117
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,520
 Was Nick giving them tips?

118
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,880
 Nick has a hilarious breakdown.

119
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,880
 He breaks down every race in Saratoga and does things like highlights which horses are

120
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,560
 from Ireland since we're Irish.

121
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,200
 He'll give me gossip by the horse's owners.

122
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,400
 He'll make fun of the whole race as a whole.

123
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
 We were there Friday and Saturday.

124
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,000
 The Friday slate was the oddest slate of races because the Saturday, of course, was the Jim

125
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Dandy.

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 The Jim Dandy.

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 What's the Jim Dandy?

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,520
 It's a big horse race, but it's called the Jim Dandy, and I was like, "What a finer

129
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,520
 race is this?"

130
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,960
 It's like the Jim, but it's dandier.

131
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,460
 I've never understood that fucking song.

132
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,840
 Have you guys ever understood that fucking song?

133
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,160
 Break it down for us, Paul.

134
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,280
 Go, Jim Dandy.

135
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
 Go.

136
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,200
 Jim Dandy to the rescue.

137
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,760
 Jim Dandy to the rescue.

138
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,760
 Do you know that song?

139
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,760
 Yeah.

140
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,160
 It's about a fella named Jim Dandy who is going to come to the rescue.

141
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
 What the fuck is it from?

142
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,160
 What is unclear about this song?

143
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,480
 I'll tell you what's unclear about it.

144
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,280
 What's with Johnny B. Goode?

145
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,560
 What are we asking him to do there?

146
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,560
 Yeah.

147
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,560
 I understand everything about Johnny B. Goode.

148
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,800
 Way down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans.

149
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
 That's where he lived.

150
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
 In a cabin.

151
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
 A shaggy.

152
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,520
 In a cabin made of earth and wood.

153
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,520
 Yeah.

154
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,880
 He played his guitar there.

155
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,660
 He could play it very well, almost like he was just ringing a bell.

156
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,760
 He had that much skill with the guitar.

157
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,440
 I know about Johnny B. Goode, but the Jim Dandy song explains fucking nothing.

158
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:50,160
 It's just like, hey, Jim Dandy, go, go Jim Dandy.

159
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,620
 Jim Dandy to the rescue.

160
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,620
 To rescue who?

161
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,620
 He's being helpful.

162
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,620
 From what?

163
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,620
 Why?

164
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,620
 Anything.

165
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,620
 Bullshit.

166
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,620
 Jim Dandy.

167
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,360
 Jim Dandy is a traveling do-gooder.

168
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,600
 Jim Dandy is a crisis actor.

169
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,400
 How dare you?

170
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,240
 Jim Dandy is seven miles long and one light year away from earth.

171
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,240
 Hey, look.

172
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,240
 It's shaped like a cigar.

173
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:19,400
 I typed in seven miles and it went right to seven mile spaceship, so shit is real, y'all.

174
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,200
 But right to it.

175
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:30,680
 The word is, the interstellar object that I was referring to, it is known as 31/Atlas.

176
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,860
 It has been observed.

177
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,860
 It's quite large.

178
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,860
 Oh, 31 Atlas.

179
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,860
 Oh yeah, yeah.

180
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,860
 It's been observed and it's quite large.

181
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,040
 It's confirmed not to be a comet.

182
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:44,160
 It is confirmed to be a comet, not a spaceship, and significantly further away from earth

183
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,000
 than a spaceship would be.

184
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,040
 The idea of constructing such a massive structure in space is a topic of ongoing research and

185
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,240
 discussion in the field of aerospace.

186
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,360
 Well, they fucking just poo-pooed it all.

187
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,940
 Okay, so it's just an interstellar object.

188
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,940
 It's not a threat.

189
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,940
 It's just a big old thing.

190
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,940
 Here's the thing.

191
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,160
 I have never been happier about an article that Paul looked up.

192
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,520
 The person poo-pooing it, are they a scientist?

193
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,720
 Because the scientists said it was an alien ship seven miles long on its way to Earth.

194
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
 They are and they're...

195
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,080
 The scientists have clearly weighed it.

196
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,560
 It starts off with the concept of a seven mile long spaceship is currently hypothetical.

197
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,840
 Though there is an interstellar object called 31 Atlas.

198
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,080
 It is a comet.

199
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,480
 So I guess people are just buying at this.

200
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,300
 31 Atlas, what do you get?

201
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:33,440
 Another galaxy older and deeper in debt.

202
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,160
 People get that debt.

203
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,800
 Every summer, my brothers and I get together with my dad and we go to Saratoga and spend

204
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:50,600
 a couple of days betting on the ponies and usually it's right after Fool Us.

205
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:58,160
 Me affording my own one person vacation on top of a family getaway, no problem thanks

206
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,520
 to the generous coffers of CW.

207
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:10,280
 It's not this year and so I've been a traveling magician man and so I used points to try to

208
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:16,080
 get there cheap and I used points to try to get me a rental car because basically my points

209
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,640
 wouldn't fly me into Albany, the closest airport to Saratoga.

210
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
 Was there a restriction?

211
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,640
 It just wasn't.

212
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,840
 Yeah, I tried to use my points and there was no flights to Albany from Las Vegas.

213
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:34,320
 But it would fly me to Connecticut, just a hair and a two hours away.

214
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,440
 How's that bad?

215
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,440
 So I was like, "Oh, I'll do that.

216
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,840
 I'll run a car and I'll drive.

217
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:44,240
 I don't care about driving two hours, no, it'll be the wiser, no problem."

218
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,680
 And I'm a fancy traveler guys, right?

219
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:56,560
 I got the clear, I'm a global entry member, pre-check, nailed it.

220
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,640
 I walk into the airport and I'm not checking any bags, I'm not doing magic.

221
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,440
 And so I walk up.

222
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,440
 How does that feel?

223
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:11,240
 Do you get a whole body vibe when you're like, "Oh man, I don't have to worry about like

224
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,080
 shit tons of trunks and stuff."

225
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,640
 Yes, love, yes.

226
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:20,040
 Very happy to travel without checking two giant bags that I know to the pound how much

227
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,040
 each weighs.

228
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,400
 I'm very happy.

229
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:35,600
 So I zip right through, scan my eyeballs in the thing, fly, land myself in Connecticut,

230
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,000
 walk right up to the rental car counter, which is right across the street from the thing.

231
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,560
 And they say, "Give me your license."

232
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:51,280
 And I go through my wallet and I cannot find my license.

233
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:57,680
 I am having a panic attack because I don't, I'm not the kind of person that misplaces

234
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,680
 those things.

235
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,400
 You don't take your license out of your wallet too often.

236
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,040
 No, no, no, no, no.

237
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,240
 And I am going like, "Oh, I don't have it."

238
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,640
 I do have a picture of it.

239
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,920
 I always keep a backup picture of my license and my phone.

240
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,760
 And they took that and let you ride onto the plane, right?

241
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,360
 He's not on the plane, he's going for a car.

242
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,600
 I'm already landing in Connecticut.

243
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,640
 I'm already through Las Vegas, landed, no problem.

244
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,640
 I didn't have to get my ID out once.

245
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,440
 Oh, right, right, right.

246
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
 Okay, okay.

247
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,120
 I didn't have to get my ID out once to get through the airport.

248
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,640
 And so I'm in Connecticut, two hours away from my family.

249
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:45,720
 And I say, and they go, "We can't rent you the car without the physical license."

250
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,080
 Oh, man.

251
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,240
 And I was like, "I have a global entry card.

252
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,240
 This is my ID.

253
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,240
 I have a passport.

254
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,360
 I have a photo of my ID."

255
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,160
 It's definitely you.

256
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,080
 They definitely run it up the pipe, get on the phone and they pretended to talk to someone

257
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,720
 like a car dealer does.

258
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:12,560
 They really pled my case and they're like, "We can't rent it to you."

259
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,520
 And I was like, "I'm not going here.

260
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,200
 I'm going to Albany and my whole family is like, 'What do I do?'"

261
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,720
 I had a total meltdown of like, "What?"

262
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,240
 I'm in Connecticut.

263
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,360
 I don't plan on being in Connecticut.

264
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
 Are you familiar with a show called Fool Us?

265
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,360
 Good, good.

266
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,760
 You tried to hide a little bit.

267
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,760
 All right, you're dropping that.

268
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,800
 Have you ever laughed at a toss to commercial or welcome back to commercial on the show

269
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
 Fool Us?

270
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,800
 No?

271
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
 You fast forward those parts?

272
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
 Interesting.

273
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
 Outrageous.

274
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,400
 That's too bad for me.

275
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,800
 Outrageous.

276
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,840
 Those are arguably the best parts.

277
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,440
 Now, that's not a winning argument, but it's arguable.

278
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,820
 Arguable.

279
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,640
 Did you watch VH1 20 years ago?

280
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,400
 Do you know who I am?

281
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:11,560
 No, I just literally look at them like I basically is like, and now I'm just like, I can't rent

282
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,560
 another car.

283
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,560
 I can't.

284
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,560
 Right.

285
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,200
 I can't do this, and I am like, I guess I can look at the flights.

286
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,960
 Did you explain to them that if they didn't rent you a car, that you were just going to

287
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,320
 stay there with them?

288
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,040
 I was kind of doing that by like sweating and mumbling and going like, "What am I going

289
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,040
 to do?"

290
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,280
 You're like, "Wouldn't you like me to leave?"

291
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,760
 They definitely, it was like a team of three of them by the end, and they were like, "Yeah,

292
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,760
 we're so sorry."

293
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,760
 You know what I mean?

294
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,760
 "We got to get this guy out of here."

295
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,840
 I was like, "I'm going to sit in that chair over there and look sad all day."

296
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:51,600
 So I call my brother, hoping I catch him on the way to Albany where it's not too far out

297
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,320
 of his way to come pick me up.

298
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,400
 Got it.

299
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,400
 I'm wrong.

300
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,600
 It's way out of his way.

301
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:08,120
 Wayne Geo said I dropped ... Have you ever heard of the Donnelly Herald?

302
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,120
 He's already there.

303
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,120
 He's in Albany.

304
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,320
 Oh shoot.

305
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,360
 And he goes, "Well, I don't know what else I'm going to do tonight."

306
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:25,560
 So he just gets in the car and he drives two hours to come get me.

307
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,480
 And then my other brothers jokingly said, "Boy, did you call the right brother because

308
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:39,280
 we would not have copped right in the car."

309
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,280
 Shout out.

310
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,280
 Which brother was willing to come get you?

311
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,280
 Brian.

312
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,480
 Shout out to Brian, my hero.

313
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,480
 Thank you, Brian.

314
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,160
 Well done, Brian.

315
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,120
 And then I fronted the money for the tickets to Saratoga and I was like, "Well, now I can't

316
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,200
 ask him for that money.

317
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,960
 I can't ask him to pay me back for that."

318
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,960
 No way.

319
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,960
 He's paid you back already.

320
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,960
 I'm done on that.

321
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
 I'm not going to pre-call that.

322
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,960
 Paid in full.

323
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,040
 So it ended up costing me a little bit of money, but still, nonetheless.

324
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,240
 Hey, but you got to ... Now, you didn't have to pay for the rental car, right?

325
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,240
 I didn't, right?

326
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
 So it's all in points.

327
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,240
 Basically, I was going to use the points.

328
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,240
 There's a savings.

329
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,880
 Oh, you were going to do it in points anyway.

330
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,880
 Oh, dude.

331
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,800
 I was doing it all in points anyway.

332
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,980
 And so I said to my brother when he drove here, I said, "Okay, either we can put the

333
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:30,480
 rental in your name so we can get it out of here, or you have to drive me back here on

334
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,480
 Sunday."

335
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,480
 Oh, right.

336
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,480
 Right.

337
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:39,520
 And so they let me, even with points, they'd let me switch him as the driver.

338
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,520
 Okay.

339
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,360
 Oh, that's nice of them.

340
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,760
 And then we had to pretend like he was going to drive the car the whole time, even though

341
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,760
 everyone knew the circumstances.

342
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,760
 The jigs was up.

343
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

344
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,760
 He drove here.

345
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,760
 Of course.

346
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,440
 And so we had to do the theater of him driving out of the lot.

347
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:01,240
 Oh, I've decided to leave my car that I just drove here and take this rental car.

348
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:08,320
 I can pay for my car to be parked here while I drive my new rental.

349
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:18,080
 Now for some reason, the cheapest rental from Enterprise was a Toyota Tacoma.

350
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:23,140
 It was not a tiny little- That's a pretty big coupe car, right?

351
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,220
 Right.

352
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,960
 That's happened to us in Texas.

353
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,480
 That has not happened to us outside of the state of Texas.

354
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,200
 In Connecticut, I was not expecting the Toyota Tacoma to be the least one.

355
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:39,560
 And so we get out into the lot and the person helping us with cars says, "I don't have

356
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,560
 any Tacomas.

357
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,760
 You can take one of the Ford F-150s."

358
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,320
 You can get bigger.

359
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,920
 And I was like, "I drive a Corolla."

360
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,920
 Right?

361
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,920
 Right.

362
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,920
 Happily.

363
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,600
 You happily drive a Corolla.

364
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
 Yeah.

365
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
 Yeah, yeah.

366
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,720
 Since my first car was a little Volkswagen Golf, I've always enjoyed just being a guy

367
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,180
 who darts around town, not big on big space.

368
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,180
 We share that.

369
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,880
 I do not like a vehicle that takes up much room.

370
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,840
 So I go, "Well, I don't have to take a big Ford F-150.

371
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,320
 If you're going to give me, I'll take one of the SUV trucks or whatever."

372
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,160
 He goes, "No, those are an upgrade."

373
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,160
 Oh my God.

374
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,160
 But the truck isn't.

375
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,680
 By the way, I'm talking for my brother, he's to be driving.

376
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,760
 I'm just the one talking.

377
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,760
 Hilarious.

378
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,160
 I am the mouthpiece, he is the driver.

379
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,920
 It's my opinion that counts, but he's ultimately the one behind the wheel.

380
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,640
 I'm the negotiator.

381
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,640
 He's the muscle.

382
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,800
 He's the silent muscle.

383
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,800
 So they're like, "Nope.

384
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,800
 That's the only car you can get."

385
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,080
 They won't even give me a tiny car.

386
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,800
 They're like, "No, the only car you can leave this lot in is either a black or a white Ford

387
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
 F-150."

388
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
 What did you go with?

389
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
 A white-

390
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:06,580
 You'll be leaving this lot in an F-150 or in a box.

391
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,080
 Or you don't leave at all.

392
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,680
 Now did you go with the white one-

393
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:15,720
 The options are, drive an F-150 off this lot or we will murder you.

394
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:21,400
 Did you pick the white one as just a kind of a knee-jerk, instinctual move because of Vegas

395
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,400
 training?

396
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
 Correct.

397
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,760
 I was just thinking, I was like, "It's summer, it's hot, I'm going to take the white car."

398
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,760
 Yeah.

399
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,600
 Also, I was like, "Modern political sensibilities, we're limiting DEI, I should take the white

400
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,600
 car."

401
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
 Geez.

402
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,600
 Smart.

403
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,600
 Smart.

404
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,160
 Was this rental place at a target?

405
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,840
 Otherwise, I'm going to get collected by ICE for being a traitor, and they're going to

406
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,200
 go through my phone and find all my names.

407
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
 Damn it all.

408
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
 Damn it.

409
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
 Damn everything.

410
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,840
 Already, when leaving Connecticut, you're going to have to go through the border checkpoint

411
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,840
 anyway.

412
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,840
 I was like, "I'm in Connecticut, right?"

413
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,840
 They're like, "Yeah."

414
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,840
 I was like, "White.

415
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,840
 Yeah.

416
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,840
 Yeah.

417
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,840
 This is a white town."

418
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,840
 Oh, God.

419
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,600
 So, Jacob, you live this life.

420
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,520
 I live the truck life regularly.

421
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,760
 I drove around in a Ford F-150, it is different living.

422
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:21,120
 All I kept thinking the whole time was like, "This is what Jacob does all the time?"

423
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,120
 Yep.

424
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,120
 Yep.

425
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,800
 Really, honestly, we were just having this conversation last night, SJ has become a very

426
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,560
 happy truck girl lately.

427
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
 Yeah.

428
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,560
 Yeah.

429
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:36,300
 Because SJ has been driving the truck around a lot over the summer with gigs, so I've been

430
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,480
 in the electric sports car most of the summer, and she's been the truck gal all summer.

431
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,680
 So, yeah, driving a truck around is a different experience than driving a little car around

432
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,680
 town.

433
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,680
 Oh, my sons are with me.

434
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,240
 They would have flipped out because they love going in your truck.

435
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,980
 They would have loved going around in a truck for the weekend or whatever.

436
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:59,040
 So every time you pull into a parking lot, you have to go like, "Oh, shit."

437
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
 Every time.

438
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
 You go like, "All right.

439
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,040
 Where do I fit?

440
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,040
 Oh, there's a spot."

441
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,960
 I was just pulling out of the parking lot this morning.

442
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,920
 This morning, leaving work, I was pulling out of the parking lot, driving normally in

443
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,840
 my lane, headed to a stop sign, a truck is coming in.

444
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:18,760
 The truck had to stop and wait for me to go around so it could physically get into the

445
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:25,020
 parking lot because there just wasn't enough room in the two lanes made for the parking

446
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,020
 lot.

447
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,020
 It was outrageous.

448
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,020
 That happens from time to time.

449
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,020
 Yeah.

450
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,020
 So let me ask...

451
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,020
 That is something that just occasionally happens.

452
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,880
 So, yeah, we were going out to dinner, and I just go like, "All right."

453
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:39,120
 I let it go, I drop everyone out, I'm like, "Everyone go in.

454
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,120
 I'm going to need a minute to figure out what I'm going to do."

455
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,680
 Me and the truck need a minute.

456
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,680
 I'm going to just order for me.

457
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:50,120
 Can you just flip the thing, just smash three cars and park there?

458
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,120
 That's it.

459
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,120
 So this is it because we went to two days of races.

460
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:02,560
 The first day we took my brother's car, he drives a hybrid Accord, like the woke hippie

461
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,760
 jerk that he is.

462
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,840
 You know, they just signed the hybrid Accords over in Scotland.

463
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,840
 Yeah.

464
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,840
 Yeah.

465
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,840
 Finally.

466
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,840
 Boo.

467
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,520
 I don't think the hybrid Accords will stand.

468
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:25,360
 But my dad, you know, we're celebrating his birthday, '87, he certainly enjoyed getting

469
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,760
 into the truck more than hunching down into the old Accord.

470
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,760
 Oh, interesting.

471
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,760
 Interesting.

472
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:36,120
 'Cause my mother-in-law, whenever she comes out to visit, her knees are bad enough that

473
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,080
 she doesn't enjoy climbing up into the truck.

474
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,920
 So I was going to ask my dad getting up in there.

475
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,920
 Oh, he was liking it.

476
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,920
 He's got those new knees though.

477
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,920
 Nice.

478
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,920
 Yeah, he's got those new knees.

479
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,920
 He's got those robo knees.

480
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,920
 He don't give a shit.

481
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,920
 He's '87.

482
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,920
 Those knees are like two or three.

483
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
 Right.

484
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,920
 Those are baby knees.

485
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,920
 Yeah.

486
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,920
 Don't fuck those knees.

487
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,920
 They are not of age.

488
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,920
 Trash baby knees.

489
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,960
 Those knees are in the Epstein files.

490
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:06,400
 You could fuck every other part of Dave Donnelly, but not his knees.

491
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,400
 Don't do it.

492
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,940
 Oh my God.

493
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,100
 So we were taking the truck everywhere.

494
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,760
 So the second day we go to the races, you know, it's the Jim Dandy.

495
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,800
 Go ahead, Paul.

496
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,800
 Go Jim Dandy, go Jim Dandy to the rescue.

497
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,960
 What the fuck is he rescuing?

498
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,960
 From whom and why?

499
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:32,800
 No one tells you, no one tells you.

500
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,160
 And so, you know, Saratoga is a tiny little town.

501
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,600
 So when the races come up, it's like all these small businesses just open up and let you

502
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,880
 park in their little parking lots and sometimes their lawns and that kind of stuff or whatever.

503
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,880
 Right.

504
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,000
 So we're driving around and all the lots are a little full because some people got there

505
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 earlier.

506
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 They got there for a lovely brunch where I literally was like saw something that said

507
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,680
 valet and I was like, should we go there for brunch?

508
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,720
 I was like, get this out of my hands.

509
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:07,760
 Somebody else can park this.

510
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:13,280
 I can only shop and eat at places with valet.

511
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:21,960
 And so we go and we pull up to this lot and all the lots a lot full, the guy is wearing

512
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,240
 a tie-dye shirt and he just stand there and he goes and he kind of looks and he and he

513
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:32,480
 points at me and I nod like, yeah, I'm looking to park even though it's full and he and he

514
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,720
 and he kind of hustles up to my car and he goes, you're looking to park?

515
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,720
 Yeah.

516
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,720
 I go, yeah.

517
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,720
 I go, is your lot full?

518
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,440
 He goes, I'm going to give you some VIP parking.

519
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:48,880
 Whoa, I said, okay, and he goes, I'm right next to like the front of this little tiny

520
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,600
 storefront business next to the larger lot that's full.

521
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,440
 He goes, you're going to park right there in the lawn in front of that in front of that

522
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,600
 business right there.

523
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:06,840
 I said, what?

524
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,680
 He goes, yeah, yeah, VIP parking, man.

525
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:14,280
 And they go, okay, he goes, uh, $20 because that's how much it was to park in the lot.

526
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,280
 It's $20.

527
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,280
 Yeah.

528
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:21,120
 In the chat says best case scenario and I can't agree more and and I'm living my dad

529
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,120
 whips out the 20s.

530
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,120
 I got you.

531
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
 And I was like, yeah, dad, sure.

532
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,940
 But I don't know if this guy works here.

533
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,940
 Yeah.

534
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,920
 He's like, you're going to park on that lawn.

535
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:33,880
 I don't know if he hates that business, right?

536
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,440
 And wants to just fuck with them by putting a big truck in front of it.

537
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,080
 He's just out there causing havoc.

538
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,500
 You are overthinking this.

539
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,120
 I already would have been gone.

540
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,320
 I'm going to give you some VIP parking.

541
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,320
 Yeah.

542
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,400
 So we give him 20 bucks.

543
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,960
 He helps us guide us in and then he's looking at me because at first I go about it like

544
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,960
 the wrong angle.

545
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
 And he's going to be like, what a mess all.

546
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
 And I'm like, this isn't my truck.

547
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,080
 I don't know how to park trucks on lawns.

548
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,160
 Of course.

549
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,440
 This is your first truck on lawn experience.

550
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:06,640
 And so, uh, uh, we finally get it in and as soon as I'm parked right, yeah.

551
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,160
 He literally takes off.

552
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,160
 He just runs.

553
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,800
 He just runs away.

554
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,920
 And that, that made you feel better.

555
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,080
 I was like, what am I?

556
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:22,960
 Does anyone know that I'm supposed to be, am I committing a crime?

557
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,960
 Yeah.

558
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,720
 So let me, I'm looking for the, for right now just to show you guys that I can, I can,

559
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,760
 I can, uh, put it on social media when the, when the episode comes out.

560
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,400
 Um, God damn it.

561
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
 Where is it?

562
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,600
 It's only gone for a few days.

563
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,200
 Was there anything else on this guy's tie-dyed t-shirt?

564
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,620
 Was it just tie-dyed?

565
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,620
 Just tie-dyed.

566
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,280
 So no, was he had to have a hat?

567
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,280
 Grateful dead shirt.

568
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,280
 It was just a hat.

569
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,840
 Did he have any, like, uh, what are those things that the, uh, airline guys use?

570
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,560
 Oh, that is just like a front lawn.

571
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,000
 You just parked on somebody's lawn, filling up the front lawn.

572
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Yeah.

573
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,160
 And that's a, and that's a business in front of there.

574
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,160
 What do they call those things?

575
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,160
 I don't know.

576
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,160
 Semaphore flags?

577
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,160
 I don't know.

578
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,720
 And, and there's a business there and that business was not like the guy didn't go inside

579
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,720
 that business.

580
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,340
 He just ran away.

581
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,840
 So I was like, wonder if a guy was going to come out the door and be like, God damn it.

582
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,840
 Yeah.

583
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,840
 Park it on my lawn.

584
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,840
 No, nothing.

585
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,520
 Matt made somebody park on my lawn again.

586
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,200
 It's probably his business and he's just going to go get a drink.

587
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,560
 It's probably fine.

588
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,760
 The kid was like 20.

589
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,960
 I don't think it was his business, but oh shit.

590
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,960
 Okay.

591
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,320
 I was thinking it was an old guy.

592
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,320
 And you know what?

593
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,640
 I will say maybe because you know what we owe people bitch about other generations lately

594
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:49,880
 as old man, uh, on the, you know, on the front lawn, um, the amount of young people that

595
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:55,360
 I've run into working lately are crushing it, are doing great jobs working like the

596
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,800
 super young people in the early twenties.

597
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,920
 And the thought that popped in my head, I could be totally, I'm totally out of pocket

598
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,160
 on this and I'll happily be corrected.

599
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,800
 But I was wondering, I was like, Oh, the young people working now weren't working during

600
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
 the pandemic.

601
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,800
 That's true.

602
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:15,880
 They didn't, they didn't have that weird bowling ball wrecking ball come and smash the way

603
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,960
 they were getting by or anything like that.

604
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,960
 Yeah, that's probably true.

605
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,200
 And I feel like the people who were covering the pandemic and working and working in like

606
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,040
 these, you know, food industry and like in hotels and low service industry, you know,

607
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,840
 that kind of things really had a hard time coming back and like getting back to the grind.

608
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,480
 And so we were like bitching about it as people who were using these services, right?

609
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,480
 Right.

610
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,000
 The young people are lately, I've just run into young people who are just crushing it,

611
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,400
 just doing awesome.

612
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
 And so they're just doing it.

613
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,400
 Yeah.

614
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,280
 And so I was like, I was wondering if it was just like, it's still like, I think it's still

615
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:51,700
 like a, a pandemic versus non-pandemic thing, but maybe that's just my theory.

616
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,240
 That's my theory or just some generations are better than others.

617
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,240
 I don't know.

618
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,240
 Yeah.

619
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,240
 Those are the only two.

620
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,240
 You know, it could be both.

621
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,240
 It could be both.

622
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,800
 Maybe you're just running into good young people.

623
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,200
 There are a few out there.

624
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,360
 Maybe everyone knows like the singularities around the corner.

625
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,360
 So they're like, let's just work now.

626
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,360
 It doesn't matter.

627
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,640
 We're going to be just goo in five years.

628
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,640
 It's fine.

629
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,920
 I have heard from several sources, I'll tell you who else like Matt Donnelly really

630
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:29,360
 admires a lot of very, very, very young people and that's the breaks, the breaks.

631
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,600
 Like my dad's knees.

632
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:39,680
 Today's show is brought to you by country Gators, Gator country, country tours.

633
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,000
 That's right.

634
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,600
 Country Gators, Gator country, country tours.

635
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:53,800
 Hey y'all, I'm an alligator and I'm going to take you on tour if you're ready to go.

636
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:58,600
 What I do is I take you through my swamp, what I like.

637
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
 It's out in the country.

638
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,760
 It's a country swamp.

639
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:08,700
 And what you're going to find is a lot of these here trees, they got knot holes in them.

640
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,140
 What looks like vaginas.

641
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,560
 So I call them countries.

642
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,840
 So you can fuck me if you want to.

643
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:22,480
 I ain't saying don't, but I mean, you know, splinters and whatnot.

644
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,500
 But you know, and some of them knot holes got critters in them.

645
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,700
 You might find your wiener up against the squirrely squirrel.

646
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,400
 So just be careful when you're doing it.

647
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:38,960
 But most of the trees I have in my swamp got big old vagina looking knot holes on them.

648
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,160
 The trees as I was saying, and yeah, that's what I do.

649
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:53,400
 And also I'll eat the smallest member of your tour because that's part of my Gatoring ways.

650
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,400
 I am still an alligator.

651
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
 Gator country Gator.

652
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,400
 What?

653
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
 What?

654
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,360
 I'm supposed to not be a Gator?

655
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,360
 Huh?

656
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,360
 Yeah.

657
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,360
 What?

658
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,360
 I'm supposed to be nice?

659
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,360
 Not eat you?

660
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,360
 Yeah.

661
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,120
 Man, I got you, I'll come up in here and fuck my trees and I ain't get allowed to eat one

662
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,920
 of you at least.

663
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:18,160
 Leaving a bunch of nut leavens in my trees, vaginas, and I can't have a little snackity

664
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,160
 snack.

665
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,160
 Please now.

666
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,160
 Come on.

667
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:25,520
 And her hate scoops to check out.

668
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,960
 Nut leavens.

669
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,320
 I just went back, I just got back from Portugal.

670
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,580
 Did you see Bazzy?

671
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,440
 Did you actually have an encounter?

672
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,040
 No, we didn't have an encounter.

673
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,040
 Bazzy, you missed out.

674
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:45,240
 My trip to Portugal made me like New Jersey less.

675
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,360
 Oh shit.

676
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,520
 I can be offended except that I know what happened.

677
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,600
 You know part of what happened.

678
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,680
 No, like I literally have to fly back to, my sister's coming in from Paris.

679
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:03,000
 She's staying at like a shore house and I am thinking of, not to get too far ahead of

680
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,960
 the story here, but I'm thinking of flying into Maryland and driving up my brother to

681
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:13,440
 fly out of Maryland because flying into Newark has been a disaster all summer.

682
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:19,600
 Yeah, we lost an entire day from our vacation because of Newark.

683
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,320
 I'll tell you, my wife would not recover from that if we were on a family vacation and lost

684
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:30,600
 a day and got stuck in Northern New Jersey for a day instead of Portugal.

685
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,920
 That would not be.

686
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,120
 Did you have to stay overnight somewhere in New Jersey?

687
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,300
 No, we stayed an extra night in Las Vegas so we were able to come back home.

688
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:47,240
 We had a flight to Newark and then from Newark to Faro, Portugal, on the southern end of

689
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:53,400
 Portugal there, and our flight to Newark got delayed, delayed, delayed, delayed, delayed

690
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,360
 and then finally got delayed enough that we were going to miss our connecting flight on

691
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:05,640
 the only flight to, to Faro and so we ended up just coming back home on Sunday morning

692
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,440
 and we try to get on Monday morning, Monday morning at work.

693
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,820
 It was, it was going to overshoot your destination?

694
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:16,400
 No, we were going to get there too late for the connection.

695
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,480
 Oh, I thought you said to Faro.

696
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,280
 I was confused.

697
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:30,660
 Trees with vaginas in them and shit.

698
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,660
 I eat the smallest number.

699
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,660
 To Faro.

700
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:43,120
 And of course the reason we couldn't fly into Newark was because they did not have adequate

701
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:50,000
 air traffic controllers in the tower there because fuck our government.

702
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,560
 They fire everybody and then don't hire the, whatever.

703
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:57,920
 No, I only read one article about it, but apparently it's crazy, but they are actually

704
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:03,760
 are actively trying to recruit people to work in the air traffic control industry and it

705
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:11,960
 is so, it has gotten so basically fratty, like people are so kind of like hard on the

706
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,360
 new people and like, and like really break it down that people quit left and right and

707
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,360
 don't stick with it.

708
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,600
 Oh, it's super clicky to be a air traffic driver.

709
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:25,040
 I mean, it's A, it's super difficult and then it's like all of this other shit on top of

710
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,040
 it.

711
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,040
 Yeah.

712
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,160
 I mean, it is a strange thing and this is like one of those weird things you keep hearing

713
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,120
 about like all these jobs are going away, but then you hear about things where like

714
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,680
 we can't get enough people to do this job that we definitely want to hire people for

715
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,440
 and those things, it's always so strange to kind of figure that all out, but I guess it's

716
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,760
 super hard hours and then there are so many-

717
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,280
 And of course, super stressful.

718
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,280
 Super stressful.

719
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,280
 Right?

720
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,280
 Gigantic planes filled with people coming.

721
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,280
 Yeah.

722
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:59,640
 I was going to say, Carolyn Albert has scooped, she has talked to us a couple of times about

723
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,920
 her air traffic controller stuff a little bit and yeah, air traffic controller stuff

724
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,920
 is nuts.

725
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,920
 Right?

726
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,960
 That's nuts too, but we don't have to worry about that here in Vegas because no one's

727
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,960
 coming.

728
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,960
 No one's coming here.

729
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,960
 That's right.

730
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,960
 We got that.

731
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,960
 Yes.

732
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,960
 No problem with that.

733
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,280
 We're building a new $20 billion airport here.

734
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:27,160
 Now I keep seeing conflicting reports here because I keep seeing posts from Vital Vegas

735
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:32,400
 and he just put one up yesterday or maybe even today it was like, the locals are like

736
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,400
 you guys, nobody's coming, ring the deaf now.

737
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,400
 And then-

738
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,400
 I'm not there, but okay.

739
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,840
 Right, but then other-

740
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:48,760
 Jacob started doing weird pillow art on Etsy as a backup brand for-

741
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,760
 Right?

742
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,760
 Yeah.

743
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,320
 I mean weird, okay, you say weird.

744
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,080
 It's hurtful, but okay.

745
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:59,640
 Restaurants or whatever are like, okay, yeah, we're not going to make as much this time.

746
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:06,480
 But then he's like, but then also like Bally's just posted like, yeah, our room rates, our

747
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:13,680
 room occupancy went from 99 to 97, we're still going to have a banner year, who cares?

748
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,680
 Yeah, yeah.

749
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,680
 Yeah, so it's weird.

750
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,680
 Like there's conflicting stuff, I guess.

751
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,680
 I don't know.

752
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,040
 There's, Vegas is just changing as it has done a couple of times in the times-

753
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,560
 Vegas change?

754
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,200
 I can't believe it.

755
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,000
 It's just doing its change thing and people are going crazy about it the same way they

756
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 do every time.

757
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 Yeah.

758
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,360
 I think like I actually see in our Zoom, we have Canadian Scoop Crystal labeled Canadian.

759
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,080
 So Crystal, if you feel like unmuting to talk for a moment, we can actually check in with

760
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,080
 the Canadian.

761
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,080
 Self-identifies as Canadian.

762
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:48,320
 Because one of the storylines is Canadians don't feel like coming to America.

763
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,320
 No, we're not getting this.

764
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,920
 You're not getting the snowbirds.

765
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,920
 But-

766
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,760
 Yeah, our Canadian tourism is way down.

767
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,320
 Our international tourism in general is down.

768
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,860
 So Canadian Scoop Crystal, is that the sentiment?

769
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,400
 Is that true from where you're neck of the woods?

770
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,800
 A lot of people don't want to go down to the States and they're kind of avoiding it.

771
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,240
 I'm still coming to Scoop Fest, but it took some thinking up my arm to get my partner

772
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,240
 to come with me.

773
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,080
 Well, and I don't blame them.

774
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,000
 And we appreciate you guys going for it.

775
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 Yeah.

776
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 It's a little scary.

777
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,200
 You think we're going to be taken at the border, like that they could like hold us and-

778
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,880
 We've already spoken to ICE and everybody to show them your Scoop Fest ticket and you'll

779
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,880
 be fine.

780
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,880
 Just be like, "Here.

781
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,880
 I'm going to Scoop Fest."

782
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,880
 They'll be, "Oh, right this way."

783
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,520
 I wish I could completely allay your fears, but I cannot.

784
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,520
 I don't know.

785
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:41,080
 Well, you need to pack a fake tip sheet of where aliens are hiding out, illegal aliens

786
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,080
 are hiding out.

787
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,640
 And then be like, "Here you go.

788
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,640
 I'm doing my part."

789
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,640
 No.

790
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,640
 It's-

791
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,960
 No, I've had multiple Scoops write saying they don't want to be stopped in airports.

792
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,160
 They don't want people going through their text messages or checking their social media

793
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,160
 and that kind of stuff.

794
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:06,560
 And I, in my gut, say that's very unlikely to happen, but I also can't go, "No."

795
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,560
 Yeah.

796
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:14,000
 I mean, I just came in through customs the other day in Philadelphia and it sure seemed

797
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,400
 like everybody was having a very easy time, but that's one time and I don't know.

798
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
 Yeah.

799
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,880
 And Chris Gasman checking in the chat saying, "Of course, he doesn't want anyone going

800
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,600
 through his pics," and that's for multiple reasons.

801
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,360
 Mr. October, Mr. November, Chris the plumber, just-

802
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,240
 It's because he keeps assigning himself as Mr. That Month.

803
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,240
 Yeah.

804
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,760
 It's the Gasman calendar.

805
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,840
 They don't call him Nice Pipe because of his job as a plumber.

806
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,880
 Do you know what I mean?

807
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,440
 No, no, no.

808
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,760
 They don't want to do those pics.

809
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,640
 Crystal's got a kitty on the video there.

810
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,640
 What's the kitty's name?

811
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,640
 She's already muted.

812
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,640
 She's done with us.

813
00:38:51,640 --> 00:39:00,680
 Well, we couldn't agree on names, and I have a boy too.

814
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,680
 It's got two names?

815
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,680
 No.

816
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,240
 So, this is girl, and then I have another cat named boy.

817
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,380
 Oh, how funny.

818
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,720
 That's great.

819
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,640
 You know what?

820
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,400
 That's how couples stay together.

821
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,400
 You compromise.

822
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,600
 That's not unlike how we named our cats growing up.

823
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:22,880
 We would name them Black Kitty and White Kitty and Mama Kitty, et cetera.

824
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,920
 I like to be original, but I haven't been so much lately.

825
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,920
 Yeah.

826
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,920
 Kyra, that's original enough.

827
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,920
 I also have a pet dog named Sonic.

828
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,920
 That's lovely.

829
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,920
 That's also not original.

830
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,920
 I don't know how to tell you this.

831
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,200
 What neck of the woods are you in Canada?

832
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,200
 I live in Toronto.

833
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,200
 Toronto.

834
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,200
 Okay.

835
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,360
 Do you hear a general sentiment that people don't want to come to America right now?

836
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:51,360
 I feel like it's mostly from my partner being like, "Oh, no.

837
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,960
 People don't want to go."

838
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,440
 People aren't walking around saying, "Oh, we're not going to the U.S."

839
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,440
 Right.

840
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,440
 It'd be really weird if they were.

841
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,440
 The first stop, I'd go whatever.

842
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,900
 Well, thank you.

843
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,900
 Thank you for chiming in.

844
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,900
 I appreciate it.

845
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,900
 Yes, Crystal.

846
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,900
 Thank you.

847
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,900
 We appreciate boots on the ground reporting like that.

848
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,900
 We do.

849
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,900
 No.

850
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,400
 I think right now, it's specifically in the summertime.

851
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,520
 In the summertime, we used to get a lot of European travelers that would come here to

852
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,600
 Beijing, and they're not coming.

853
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
 Also LA.

854
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:25,640
 LA is right now currently on Tsunami Watch, still recovering from the fires, and obviously

855
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:33,320
 had honestly been fighting political stuff in their own front yards.

856
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,520
 Those people are not blowing off steam to make sure they come out to spend some money

857
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,640
 at Vegas and hit the pools and the day clubs and all that stuff.

858
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,360
 I think that's what it really is.

859
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:48,080
 More than people not wanting to travel and everything, nobody's in that mood to blow

860
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,080
 off steam.

861
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,080
 That's it.

862
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,200
 Everybody's got shit going on wherever they are.

863
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,080
 Nobody's trying to come here and put a 20 in a slot machine.

864
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,080
 No.

865
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,080
 Sure.

866
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,080
 Can I get it?

867
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,160
 Maybe occupancy is only slightly down, but I can tell you if people who are in shows

868
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,240
 that the show attendance is way down.

869
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:09,880
 Now, show attendance goes down in these months anyway, but they're going away.

870
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:15,840
 I also, anecdotally, traveling around, talking to people who would come to Vegas.

871
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,960
 My brother said it best, "Vegas has become spirit airlines."

872
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:28,520
 Mark, not Brian, not my hero, but my asshole brother who would not come and get me.

873
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,520
 He said-

874
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,720
 Well, you knew better than to call it.

875
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,240
 I'm interested in this analogy here.

876
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,960
 Why is Vegas now spirit airlines?

877
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,160
 I think I know right where this is going.

878
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,840
 It seems like it's cheap to come, but as soon as you come you get charged for everything

879
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,840
 left and right.

880
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,440
 As soon as you turn anywhere, suddenly you're just nickel and dimed and charged for every

881
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,640
 single fucking thing you do.

882
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,280
 You leave feeling like, "Holy shit.

883
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:52,800
 I thought I was going to spend a lot of money and I did, and I didn't even gamble, and I

884
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:59,880
 only saw one thing, and I'm leaving broke."

885
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,760
 It's becoming a real buzzkill for the town.

886
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,820
 It seems like some places are starting to combat that.

887
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:12,140
 It seems like people here seem to be realizing that, and some people seem to be going the

888
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:16,320
 other direction on that, but it hasn't caught on in the big time yet.

889
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,320
 No.

890
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,640
 Like I said, these are small temporary measures that people are taking just for the summer.

891
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,720
 Some people are waiving resort fees, some people are waiving parking fees, and that's

892
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,080
 exactly what this whole town needs to get back to doing as a whole.

893
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,080
 Yeah.

894
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,080
 Free parking.

895
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:38,000
 I think also it's a comment on the fact that gambling has just become so ubiquitous.

896
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,720
 You can just gamble on your phone.

897
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,720
 I'm sure.

898
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,640
 It's funny because it's these companies that spearheaded it.

899
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,640
 That's the weird thing.

900
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,640
 Yeah.

901
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,480
 You think Vegas would be protectionist, but these companies aren't protectionist of Vegas.

902
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,560
 They're simply saying, "If anyone's going to gamble anywhere, it should be through our

903
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,560
 company."

904
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,560
 Right.

905
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,560
 Right.

906
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,520
 There still is a Vegas element connected to it all.

907
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:01,360
 That bet in MGM is like, that's their whole tagline, it's like, "The casino created in

908
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,360
 Vegas."

909
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,360
 Da, da, da, da.

910
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:07,720
 But it's simply not as exciting to sit in front of a slot machine at Mammoth Racetrack

911
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:12,920
 in Ocean, New Jersey and spend a day pulling levers there.

912
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,680
 That's just not going to create the same deal.

913
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,680
 No.

914
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,680
 Right.

915
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,600
 Well, I can tell you out here, we got these fucking skill games.

916
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,360
 You ever heard of these fucking things?

917
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,360
 Oh, yeah.

918
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,040
 What are skill games?

919
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,960
 Skill games.

920
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,160
 I put a fiver and was like, "You got to go try the skill game."

921
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,160
 I'm like, "All right.

922
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,160
 Whatever."

923
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,160
 I put a fiver in.

924
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,880
 I didn't know what the fuck I was doing.

925
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,280
 It is confusing and weird.

926
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,680
 I didn't understand it.

927
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,200
 It had a bunch of symbols.

928
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,680
 You press stuff, you lose your $5.

929
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,680
 It takes a little longer.

930
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,760
 It doesn't make any damn sense.

931
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,080
 Didn't make any damn sense to me whatsoever.

932
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,600
 I was like, "What am I doing with this thing?

933
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,520
 I need a lesson on the skill games."

934
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,600
 But I don't know.

935
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,960
 It just seemed really, really dumb.

936
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,960
 I don't have the skill.

937
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,280
 That's true, Wayne.

938
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,280
 Yeah.

939
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,280
 I don't know.

940
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,280
 I think that's it.

941
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,360
 You went into a skill game unskilled.

942
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,000
 What did you expect, buddy?

943
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 No.

944
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 I don't know.

945
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,880
 I didn't understand what I was even doing.

946
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,360
 The good news is that we're protected from the aliens that are coming because they can't

947
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:16,160
 afford all the resort fees and the cocktails.

948
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,360
 Well, apparently, it's not even aliens.

949
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:22,880
 It's just a theoretical thing, about a seven-mile wide comet.

950
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,160
 It passed the comet test.

951
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,160
 It did.

952
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,160
 It took a test.

953
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:31,280
 There's a little box at the bottom that said, "Check if you are a comet," and it checked

954
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,280
 it.

955
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,280
 I checked it.

956
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,280
 I am a comet.

957
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,280
 Comet.

958
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,360
 And Ranch Slunk is asking, "What is the part that is skill?"

959
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,360
 I don't know.

960
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:43,720
 I played it for 15 minutes, and I'm like, "I don't understand what's going on here."

961
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,240
 All has never known what part of it was skill.

962
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,240
 I take it back.

963
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,240
 I take it back.

964
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,240
 I take it back.

965
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,640
 My memory's getting jogged.

966
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,720
 I do remember.

967
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:59,520
 Once you get to the bonus round, I basically was playing Simon.

968
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:05,600
 The bonus round was Simon, and I made it through five things, and then I fucking messed up

969
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,960
 the pattern.

970
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,400
 That's the skill, but it still made no fucking sense.

971
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,400
 So yeah.

972
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,400
 All right.

973
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,200
 Nathan's letting us know that this is all a big buildup.

974
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,040
 By next year, it will be fuck Mary skill.

975
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,040
 That's right.

976
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,040
 Fuck Mary skill.

977
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,040
 Yeah.

978
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:29,240
 I tell you who else is going to fuck Mary and skill, and that's the following sponsor.

979
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:34,480
 A new service that helps Paul buy back all his toys when he feels seller's remorse.

980
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,040
 That's from the Red Baron in 2021.

981
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,560
 The last one, by the way, is from Country Scoop.

982
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:44,880
 This is a service that helps Paul buy back all of his toys when he feels seller's remorse.

983
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,600
 Hey, what's going on?

984
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,440
 It's me, Country Gator.

985
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:55,960
 I actually also run an Etsy shop, and I deal in secondhand toys and collectibles.

986
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:03,720
 But I tell you what, if you in the market for an original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle,

987
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:08,000
 or maybe an old school transformer, I got you covered.

988
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,360
 But really, it's a front, and I sell logs.

989
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:18,920
 I sell logs that have the vagina part, knot holes in them, and I can get them across country

990
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,920
 lines.

991
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,560
 So you can look up, you can say, I'm buying me a toy.

992
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,600
 It's a toy, all right, but it's a special toy.

993
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,600
 Yeah.

994
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:32,880
 It's a knot hole tree that you can put your willy in, and I can't guarantee there ain't

995
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,000
 going to be no squirrely's in there still.

996
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,920
 I can't say for sure.

997
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:41,800
 But also, if you do just want to go to trip down Nostalgia Lane, buy yourself an old toy

998
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,040
 that you used to have, you can get it.

999
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,920
 Just come on over to my Etsy shop.

1000
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,640
 It's Country Gator's Conti Toys.

1001
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,640
 Yeah.

1002
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,640
 Wow.

1003
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:57,920
 So it's Conti Toys, huh?

1004
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,920
 Yeah.

1005
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:05,600
 It's one of those things where you do your advertisements, and you make them real controversial,

1006
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,720
 and then people are like, oh.

1007
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,320
 Did you say countryversal?

1008
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,320
 Countryversal.

1009
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,320
 Yeah.

1010
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,640
 It's like, it's like Schmuckers.

1011
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,640
 Yeah.

1012
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,640
 Yeah.

1013
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:20,360
 You know, Conti Toys, they must have something on the ball, calling themselves that shit.

1014
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,360
 Sure enough.

1015
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:24,840
 Enter Hayscrumbs to check out.

1016
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,240
 Now are the toys Conti, or are they for Conti children?

1017
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,600
 They can be.

1018
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:32,960
 Anything's a dildo if you're brave enough, friend.

1019
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,080
 Guys, I just got a text.

1020
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,080
 I'm so glad.

1021
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,320
 It's Amazon looking out for me.

1022
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:43,840
 They texted me and 19 other people who happen to have a North Jersey area code, their phone

1023
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:44,840
 number.

1024
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:45,840
 Oh boy.

1025
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,840
 That's just more convenient.

1026
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,820
 They're looking out for safety and quality issues, a product that I bought.

1027
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,680
 They won't say which one until I click on the link.

1028
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,360
 No, of course not.

1029
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,360
 Safety is their top priority.

1030
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,360
 Yeah.

1031
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,360
 So there we go.

1032
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,600
 I don't want to, I don't know.

1033
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:02,640
 That shit was on the rise for a while, but it seems a little more prevalent in the last

1034
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,640
 couple of months.

1035
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,240
 Am I crazy?

1036
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,240
 I don't know.

1037
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,440
 I get, I get, I get, I get every day, every day, but I'm getting a lot of these fucking

1038
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,440
 spammy things.

1039
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,440
 Yeah.

1040
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,440
 In my day.

1041
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,440
 Yeah.

1042
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:19,480
 All I know is that Democrats are feeling more confident because in the recent days I've

1043
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:24,520
 gotten a ton of different people asking me for money.

1044
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,320
 And I think that's hilarious.

1045
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:33,840
 And I always hate when it's like, Oh, did you see Pete Buddha judge just top roped Trump

1046
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:40,840
 into submission with this, I swear to God every time I am so done.

1047
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:46,120
 I don't know who thinks that messaging is working anymore, but it is fucking not.

1048
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:50,360
 It is not working for anyone because nothing's changing.

1049
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,360
 Nothing's changing.

1050
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,360
 Nothing's happening.

1051
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:58,920
 Now, if someone sends me a things like this motherfucker ran off the Senate floor with

1052
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:05,400
 a can of barbersaw and a razor blade and shave that motherfucker's eyebrows off, I'd be like,

1053
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,760
 here's $20.

1054
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,760
 Click.

1055
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,760
 Thank you.

1056
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,760
 Here's $20.

1057
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,760
 Clicking on that.

1058
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:14,680
 I appreciate your fucking service, but nobody's doing anything of any meaning or merit.

1059
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,480
 So it's just preposterous.

1060
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,480
 Yeah.

1061
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,780
 I did see, they made me laugh.

1062
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:21,600
 It showed, it was an AI image.

1063
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:28,200
 It showed Trump using a comb over and his hair is covering the Epstein files on top

1064
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,200
 of his head.

1065
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:34,160
 It really, it really made me laugh.

1066
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,800
 It is the strangest.

1067
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,800
 Oh, that's great.

1068
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,800
 Oh, that's really funny.

1069
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,120
 It is the strangest fucking thing at this point, right?

1070
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,120
 Yes.

1071
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:45,440
 It is just, I mean, we are, we are through the looking glass here, people.

1072
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,840
 I mean, it's, it's bizarre, right?

1073
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,760
 There's no defense for any of this.

1074
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:57,100
 And I think that's the other crazy thing is there's a lot of folks like us who, you know,

1075
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:02,080
 we hear these talking points of like, Oh, Bill Clinton might be on that list.

1076
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,080
 Fuck that asshole.

1077
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,080
 Get them all.

1078
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,940
 Bury him under the jail.

1079
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:09,040
 I don't give a rat's dick.

1080
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,320
 Put them all in the cemetery.

1081
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,320
 Yes.

1082
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,320
 Everything should be, collapse the whole government at this point.

1083
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:20,160
 I don't give a good goddamn.

1084
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,160
 And I think-

1085
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,800
 I'm going to steer off from that, from the, from the government conversation in a very

1086
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,800
 easy way.

1087
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,320
 I could tell you about my trip to Portugal this last week.

1088
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,000
 Yeah, it's just, yeah, it's just, yeah, there you go, Scoli.

1089
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
 Thank you very much.

1090
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,280
 Scoli's on, Scoli's on point.

1091
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,280
 That's all you need.

1092
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,080
 That meme is what we're living right now.

1093
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,080
 Absolutely.

1094
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,080
 The hot dog guy.

1095
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:46,480
 We're all looking for the guy who did this.

1096
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,280
 So we get down to Portugal.

1097
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,560
 We fly into Faro in the south end of Portugal.

1098
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,560
 Yeah.

1099
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,560
 It's fantastic.

1100
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:58,680
 And Guia or Gaia, depending on, on how you say it, different people said it different

1101
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,680
 ways.

1102
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,680
 Derived from mother earth.

1103
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:01,680
 Yes.

1104
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,720
 Well, I mean, it sounds like that.

1105
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,720
 Yeah.

1106
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:06,720
 I didn't name it.

1107
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,440
 Did you find out what Portugal means?

1108
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,040
 In America, we pronounce it grapes, Jacob.

1109
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,040
 Grapes.

1110
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,040
 Yeah.

1111
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,040
 Yeah.

1112
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,840
 Like bossy, the Portuguese scoop in the chat here says Gaia.

1113
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:17,840
 Okay.

1114
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:21,560
 And then another friend of mine says Gaia and then people there, some people there said

1115
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,560
 Guia.

1116
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,560
 Some people there said Gaia.

1117
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:28,920
 I stopped saying the name entirely just to be safe.

1118
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,560
 I bet you it's a bit to just correct Taurus no matter what they say.

1119
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:33,560
 Fine.

1120
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:40,720
 If it was good bit Jacob, it's pronounced Chimera, but go on.

1121
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,440
 So we hung around up there.

1122
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,440
 It was just wonderful.

1123
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:48,720
 Our friends, Scott and Paula, we hung out with them and boy, we had great food.

1124
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:53,280
 We had all kinds of just wonderful experiences there, a couple of different beaches.

1125
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,400
 What was your favorite meal, Jacob?

1126
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,440
 Oh boy.

1127
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:02,440
 We had a meal at a winery that was just fantastic.

1128
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:12,600
 We also had this spicy chicken at one place that was, it's a main dish of the region and

1129
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,200
 it was so fucking good.

1130
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,640
 It's like a hot oil that gets poured over the chicken.

1131
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,640
 It gets cooked at a really high temperature for a short amount of time.

1132
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,600
 It's just quick fried?

1133
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,600
 It's not fried.

1134
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,600
 It's not fried at all.

1135
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,600
 It's like roasted.

1136
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:34,160
 I assume that there is some kind of preparation to it as well.

1137
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,880
 I don't know if they soak it in the spicy oil or whatever first.

1138
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:37,880
 Marinade?

1139
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:38,880
 Yeah.

1140
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:44,800
 I don't know if they do any kind of like the marinade or whatever, but it is so fucking

1141
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,800
 good.

1142
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:46,800
 Slap it.

1143
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,800
 The slap cook it, remember?

1144
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:49,800
 That's right.

1145
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,800
 They give it a good old slap cook it.

1146
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,800
 Period, period.

1147
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:52,800
 That's it.

1148
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,800
 Winter scoop.

1149
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,800
 Thank you.

1150
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,800
 Period, period.

1151
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:56,800
 Chicken.

1152
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,800
 That slap cooking chicken is the wildest fucking thing.

1153
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,800
 Slap cook that chicken.

1154
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,480
 Those videos are awesome.

1155
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,800
 Those will forever stay in my brain, slap cooking the chicken.

1156
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,800
 Well that's cool.

1157
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:14,000
 So we did that for a few days and then we took the train north to Lisbon and I'll tell

1158
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,240
 you about the part in Lisbon because everything in the south was very relaxed.

1159
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,400
 We had just a wonderful time.

1160
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,680
 So much beautiful scenery.

1161
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,680
 It was a wonderful week.

1162
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,920
 It doesn't make for the best stories on the comedy podcast.

1163
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:34,560
 So I'm going to tell you about Lisbon instead.

1164
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,000
 We got on the train to Lisbon.

1165
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,120
 First of all, we got off the train earlier than we were planning to.

1166
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:45,600
 We had booked a passage to this one station and we decided to get off a couple of stations

1167
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:49,080
 earlier once we got to Lisbon because we were like, oh, it's a little closer to our hotel.

1168
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,440
 It's in the area that we want to be in.

1169
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,400
 We're just going to get off here.

1170
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,760
 So we get off the train.

1171
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,760
 It's pronounced Lebanon.

1172
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:55,760
 Sorry.

1173
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:59,520
 We get off the train in Lebanon, Kentucky.

1174
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:04,680
 It was a very long train ride, very wet.

1175
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:05,680
 So we got off the train.

1176
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,080
 The fact that my hometown was called Lebanon.

1177
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,080
 I know.

1178
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,100
 Look, Lebanon is fucking crazy.

1179
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,100
 Life is crazy.

1180
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,100
 Don't forget.

1181
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:20,200
 SJ went to high school in Palestine.

1182
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,200
 Don't forget.

1183
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,200
 It's not just Kentucky.

1184
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,200
 No, it's not.

1185
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,200
 They're all.

1186
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:33,120
 So we get into an Uber and the Uber driver that we got in in Lisbon spoke the least amount

1187
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:36,720
 of English of any one that we had interacted with the entire time.

1188
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,720
 Perfect.

1189
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:41,320
 So everybody spoke English at least to a passable degree.

1190
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,000
 No problem at all.

1191
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,840
 We get in the car and the first thing I say to this guy is that do you speak any English?

1192
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:53,720
 And he goes, he holds up his fingers very close together and goes, very little.

1193
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,720
 All right.

1194
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,420
 No big deal.

1195
00:54:56,420 --> 00:55:01,560
 Now did you think I can use Google Translate or one of these automatic?

1196
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:06,120
 Oh, we had been doing, we had been doing that to some degree, but he, he spoke enough English

1197
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,480
 and you know, it's an Uber.

1198
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,480
 So he's already got the destination.

1199
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,680
 We don't have to have a conversation.

1200
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:15,160
 Did you think about just yelling English slowly at him?

1201
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:18,160
 That does seem to work, right?

1202
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,800
 I started really over pronouncing English words loudly.

1203
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:27,400
 The winery please.

1204
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,280
 Turn left here.

1205
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,280
 Oh boy.

1206
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,280
 But it's no big deal.

1207
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,480
 He doesn't speak a lot of English.

1208
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,480
 No big deal.

1209
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,840
 He's got, he knows where we're going.

1210
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:37,840
 He's going to drive it.

1211
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:40,120
 It's a 20 minute drive.

1212
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:44,280
 So he says in broken English, he says, get comfortable.

1213
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,000
 It's going to be a little bit of a drive.

1214
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
 No big deal.

1215
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
 We go great.

1216
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,040
 And so we sit back.

1217
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,840
 We're having a little conversation between ourselves.

1218
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,680
 We're kind of figuring out what we're going to do that evening.

1219
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,680
 How many are in the car?

1220
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:01,080
 And then a small, a small pane of glass comes up separating him from the group and then

1221
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,680
 gas just fuels into the back of us.

1222
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:13,360
 You all wake up in bathtubs with a phone next to you.

1223
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,520
 Your kidneys have been taken.

1224
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:19,160
 We ride in silence for about 10 minutes.

1225
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:26,480
 And then he started talking and his lack of English did not stop him for long.

1226
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,760
 How strange.

1227
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,760
 Yeah.

1228
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,680
 So he initiates a new conversation and he just starts talking to us.

1229
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:38,040
 In English, in as much English as he, as he could.

1230
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:45,800
 And so we're, we're having a bit of a conversation with him and then he starts talking about

1231
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,800
 the blacks.

1232
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,800
 Oh no.

1233
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,800
 Quote unquote.

1234
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,800
 Oh no.

1235
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:50,800
 No, no, no, no, no.

1236
00:56:50,800 --> 00:57:00,720
 And he starts telling us how the blacks are taking his, are taking his jobs.

1237
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,920
 Oh my God.

1238
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,740
 And we are sitting there going like, what the actual fuck?

1239
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:09,640
 Why is this guy telling us about the blacks?

1240
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:13,040
 And he talked about the blacks for about five minutes.

1241
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,440
 Yeah.

1242
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,520
 And then he said something about Uber.

1243
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,520
 Right.

1244
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,920
 He went, Oh, Oh motherfucker.

1245
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,200
 He's talking about Uber black language barrier.

1246
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,360
 He's talking about cause he drove an Uber comfort.

1247
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,360
 Okay.

1248
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:33,720
 And so he was saying there's more and more Uber blacks now, and they're taking business

1249
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,320
 away from the Uber comforts.

1250
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:39,680
 Don't let, don't let these people know about the Uber blacks.

1251
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,920
 That's, that's the last thing they need.

1252
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:42,920
 That's the last talking point.

1253
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,760
 I am sitting in this guy's back seat.

1254
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:52,380
 It is, it is very nice Tesla that he's driving us around and I am just laughing to myself

1255
00:57:52,380 --> 00:58:02,080
 relieved right, he was talking about the Uber blacks and not the black and then he pointed

1256
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:06,920
 at a black person on the side of the street and said, Oh, I don't pick them up.

1257
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,440
 No, no, he did not.

1258
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,440
 He did.

1259
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:11,440
 Oh, for God's sake.

1260
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,440
 It was a, I was like, Oh God damn it.

1261
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,440
 So he was actually talking about it.

1262
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,440
 No, he wasn't.

1263
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,440
 He wasn't.

1264
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:21,320
 He was talking about Uber blacks.

1265
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:25,160
 You wrote the full roller coaster of racism, right?

1266
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,840
 But this guy's clearly an idiot.

1267
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:30,240
 So maybe he thinks Uber blacks is just for black people.

1268
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,120
 Maybe, maybe what a dim wit.

1269
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:37,080
 And so he, he then tells us, he says, he's, he's taking us to an area.

1270
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,920
 Our hotel in Lisbon is in an area, kind of at a downtown area.

1271
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:45,080
 And right, right nearby there, there's an area called pink street and pink street used

1272
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:48,680
 to be, I guess the, the red light district, it was the brothels and all that kind of stuff.

1273
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:49,680
 Yeah.

1274
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:53,320
 There's restaurants and bars and there's a lot of live music there, which is why SJ and

1275
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:56,240
 I were, you know, heading in that direction.

1276
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,580
 We're going to, we're going to go hang out in the, in the, in the pink street area that

1277
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:01,320
 evening and listen to some live music.

1278
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,320
 It's going to be great.

1279
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,880
 We're really looking forward to it.

1280
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:09,000
 And then he starts telling us that this is after the conversation about the blacks.

1281
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:15,000
 And then he starts telling us that, oh, by the way, don't go to pink street tonight.

1282
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,080
 And we had not said that we were going to pink street, but the hotel was just nearby.

1283
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,440
 And so he goes, don't go to pink street.

1284
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:25,400
 Under no circumstances, go to pink street.

1285
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,400
 That's all we say.

1286
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,400
 Why?

1287
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:36,000
 And he goes, and then he goes on his second racist tirade of the ride, but this time it's

1288
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
 about the Roma.

1289
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:43,280
 Oh, and so, and so then he said selling telling us how the Roma are in town and they are shooting

1290
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,080
 each other on, on pink street.

1291
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:50,720
 But that's a festival tradition, the shooting of each other.

1292
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:51,720
 Right?

1293
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,120
 You ever been to a San Gennaro?

1294
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,120
 Come on.

1295
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:56,120
 What are we talking about?

1296
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,120
 Roma the Bulls in Pamplona?

1297
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:01,800
 Everyone knows the Roma just shoot each other on pink street.

1298
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:02,800
 That's just.

1299
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:06,360
 And at this point, I really am just sitting there going like, I'm ready for this ride

1300
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,360
 to be over.

1301
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:11,340
 It is a celebration of the patron saint of ammunition.

1302
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:15,360
 You celebrate him.

1303
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:19,360
 Bossy in the chat is, is hurrying the story log and tell it saying that of course that's

1304
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,360
 not true.

1305
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,760
 And of course, bossy is 100% correct.

1306
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,760
 Right.

1307
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:24,760
 Spoiler alert.

1308
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:25,760
 There was no shooting of anyone.

1309
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:26,760
 And yes, we hung out everywhere.

1310
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:27,760
 We wanted to hang out.

1311
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,240
 This guy is just a racist asshole.

1312
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,240
 That's it.

1313
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:36,080
 And honestly, the entire ride and still right now, I think he was being racist, but I'm

1314
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:40,600
 not entirely sure because it really may have just been a language barrier.

1315
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:46,680
 No, no, I'm telling you, I'm still, I'm, I'm pretty sure he was being at least racist

1316
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:57,400
 some of the time, but yeah, oh, about the Roma, he was definitely being racist.

1317
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,400
 He was deaf.

1318
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,400
 Sorry.

1319
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,400
 Let me be very clear.

1320
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,800
 He was definitely being racist about the Roma.

1321
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:07,480
 I'm not sure if he was being racist towards people who were dark in skin color as well.

1322
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:10,680
 Jason has a great question for you in the chat, Jacob.

1323
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:11,680
 Oh, what is it?

1324
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:16,880
 Did you give him five stars or did you get out of the group?

1325
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:22,160
 I honestly don't think that I ever got back around to reviewing and doing all the stuff.

1326
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,160
 Yeah.

1327
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:25,760
 You're too stupefied.

1328
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,040
 So he tells us like, Oh yeah, don't, don't go down there.

1329
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,040
 It's dangerous.

1330
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,040
 Whatever.

1331
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:36,400
 We finally get out of the car and we're like, our hotel was literally above pink street.

1332
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:41,280
 Like you had to walk out of our hotel and walk down like a ramped alley and you were

1333
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,280
 on pink street.

1334
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,500
 So I mean, we were directly above it.

1335
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:50,880
 We were in such a party area of this, of this place here that our very nice hotel gave us

1336
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,720
 earplugs to sleep in.

1337
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,600
 Oh my gosh.

1338
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,360
 And rightly so.

1339
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,360
 Really?

1340
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:58,600
 Absolutely correct.

1341
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:03,640
 How long, how, how late into the night did the party go?

1342
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:07,040
 I mean, by the time I fell asleep, it was still going.

1343
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:11,640
 What was, in Portuguese, how do you say to the bric-a-bric-a-dawn it's on?

1344
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:12,640
 That's a bric-a-dawn.

1345
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:13,640
 Oh, okay.

1346
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:14,800
 That's actually, that's actually Portuguese.

1347
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,800
 Universal.

1348
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:16,800
 Yeah.

1349
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:17,800
 That sounds right.

1350
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,400
 Did you understand that you were going to be staying in that type of an area when you

1351
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,640
 shopped for your vacation?

1352
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,640
 Yes.

1353
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:24,640
 Okay.

1354
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,200
 Well, we were only staying there overnight because we were flying out the next morning.

1355
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,760
 So we were only in that hotel one night.

1356
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:34,960
 And, and you, coming from New Orleans, you've done your share of Mardi Gras and Fat Tuesdays.

1357
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,680
 We understood what we were getting into.

1358
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:37,680
 You know what it's about.

1359
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:38,680
 Right, right, right.

1360
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,400
 We, we were not, we were not upset by this.

1361
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,360
 We were just, we understood what we were getting into when we, when we stayed in that area.

1362
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:50,720
 It's actually funny because I was on my flight back from Connecticut to Vegas, there was,

1363
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:54,640
 there was some Roma on my flight and they just shot each other right there, right there

1364
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:55,640
 on the aisles.

1365
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:56,640
 Just right there?

1366
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,640
 Just dead.

1367
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,640
 Just two, two shot dead.

1368
01:02:58,640 --> 01:02:59,640
 Oh yeah.

1369
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,640
 And he went into all this stuff.

1370
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:06,000
 He was like, uh, he went into all this stuff about how you can identify aroma if we, if

1371
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
 we see them.

1372
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,960
 Oh, we're not identifying aroma.

1373
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,120
 This is getting weird.

1374
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:16,200
 He was telling us how they all wear white t-shirts, which I thought was very vague.

1375
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:19,280
 I was like, okay, that's weird.

1376
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:23,560
 And then he started telling us about how they all had, um, he didn't say the words meth

1377
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:28,000
 teeth, but he was saying meth teeth.

1378
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
 Summer teeth.

1379
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
 Yeah.

1380
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
 Yeah.

1381
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
 That's it.

1382
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
 He was saying their teeth are a little meth-y.

1383
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,760
 Uh, so we went to pink street though, and we had a wonderful time.

1384
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,120
 Uh, we, we went and saw some musicians.

1385
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,120
 It was great.

1386
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,120
 We had some, we had some cocktails.

1387
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,120
 It was really wonderful.

1388
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:49,080
 Uh, we walked, well, we, we went and had a nice dinner in Lisbon first and, uh, walked

1389
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:53,320
 all over and looked at some, uh, some different statues and walked down by the pier.

1390
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:54,380
 It was all great.

1391
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:59,640
 We got to pink street and literally, I don't want to overstate this.

1392
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:05,600
 I don't want to make it clear that this is not me exaggerating for the show.

1393
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:11,880
 Within the first five minutes of us just walking around on pink street, I was offered cocaine

1394
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:19,880
 three times, not drugs, not party favors, specifically cocaine.

1395
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:24,760
 I was offered that, uh, just walking out of Cozumel at like noon, so I don't think that's

1396
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:31,720
 a, I just like, I turn and walk onto the street and the first person I see literally makes

1397
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:38,760
 eye contact with me, puts his finger to the side of his nose to gesture for cocaine and

1398
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,600
 then says, want some cocaine?

1399
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,920
 Are you sure that wasn't Santa Claus?

1400
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,760
 Cause that's his move.

1401
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:50,280
 There must've been some magic in that old white powder he found.

1402
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:57,960
 I was like, why did you gesture for the cocaine if you're going to explicitly offer me the

1403
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:58,960
 cocaine?

1404
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,880
 Well, there are other ways to take it.

1405
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:02,880
 Sure.

1406
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:08,040
 As Paul takes it, you can take it intravenously.

1407
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:12,800
 Or he could, you know, he might've, you don't want to go up to the drug dealer who's like

1408
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,560
 pointing to his asshole.

1409
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,560
 Cocaine?

1410
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:18,600
 Do you want some Bolivian gunpowder?

1411
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:22,280
 Bolivian marching powder in your shorts?

1412
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:25,080
 Do you want Bolivian marching powder, which is slang for cocaine?

1413
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,240
 Would you like some of that?

1414
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,240
 Do you ski?

1415
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:29,560
 Would she of course insert penally?

1416
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:36,800
 And by ski, I mean, do you, do you do mountains of cocaine?

1417
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:40,960
 So we've got three, three offers of cocaine in the first five minutes, uh, two offers,

1418
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:41,960
 two more offers.

1419
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:47,320
 It was candy with a candy is cocaine for your nose.

1420
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:53,360
 So it's not made of cocaine, but cocaine, not even a whole lot of cocaine.

1421
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:54,840
 It was great.

1422
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:59,040
 Uh, there were traffic circles in the area that we were in, especially there were traffic

1423
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,040
 circles everywhere.

1424
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:03,200
 Uh, not a lot of streetlights, which I kind of enjoyed.

1425
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,200
 Yep.

1426
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,200
 Yeah.

1427
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,200
 Roundabout traffic circles.

1428
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:11,800
 Uh, we saw one fella, uh, at a, at a large traffic circle, you know, in the city, uh,

1429
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:16,880
 big, big roundabout, uh, you know, huge statue in the middle of the whole deal.

1430
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:21,600
 And uh, anyhow, you get on a roundabout and you get on a roundabout, it might have a four

1431
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:25,440
 entry exit points and it'll say like, oh, you get off on the second exit or you get

1432
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:29,300
 off on the third exit in the roundabout and that's how you, that's how you do the roundabouts.

1433
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:35,920
 We saw one guy in the middle of Lisbon, uh, turned the wrong way onto the roundabout and

1434
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:42,960
 uh, he was yelling and it looked like crying all at the same time while, while they were

1435
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,400
 trying to figure it out.

1436
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,400
 I just wanted a can of Coke, an actual can.

1437
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,400
 That's it.

1438
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:52,480
 He just, he was just trying to get somewhere and he, he didn't know how to drive in Lisbon

1439
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,480
 and he was very strong.

1440
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,480
 Oh my God.

1441
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,200
 Bossey says there's a city with 32 roundabouts there.

1442
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,280
 Oh yeah.

1443
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,280
 I would lose my fucking mind.

1444
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:04,160
 In the South especially, we, we saw like two traffic lights the whole, the whole time we

1445
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,600
 were in the South of Portugal.

1446
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:13,400
 They're building more and more of those out here in Pennsylvania and nobody knows how

1447
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:19,480
 to use them and I am also in that club and I do not like them and I do not like them

1448
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,300
 building all these roundabouts.

1449
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:22,300
 They are more efficient.

1450
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:23,300
 You're, you're right.

1451
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:26,360
 Pete, people in, in, uh, people in the chat are talking about how they are much more efficient

1452
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:29,600
 than a treat street lights and they are just correct.

1453
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:32,840
 If you have people who can use them, right.

1454
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,120
 There is a bit of a learning curve.

1455
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,800
 There's also a regular curve.

1456
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:39,480
 There's, there's a 360 degrees of learning curve on those motherfuckers.

1457
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:42,480
 Oh, cause there's a circle.

1458
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,480
 Yeah.

1459
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:44,720
 What else is around your nostril?

1460
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:45,720
 Do you want some cocaine?

1461
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:46,720
 Oh my God.

1462
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:47,720
 Oh my God.

1463
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:48,720
 I walked right into it.

1464
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:49,880
 Oh my God.

1465
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:53,440
 This man won't stop offering me cocaine.

1466
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,760
 So we get on the flight the next morning.

1467
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,240
 We head to the airport the next morning.

1468
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:01,080
 Uh, we get through the Lisbon airport, which the Lisbon airport is confusing by the way,

1469
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:04,080
 if anybody ever flies through the Lisbon airport, give yourself an extra few minutes.

1470
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,080
 Yeah.

1471
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:07,160
 To, uh, navigate the Lisbon airport.

1472
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:13,440
 Uh, but we got there, all the air traffic controllers run cocaine.

1473
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:14,440
 You know what?

1474
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:19,760
 Whatever they were doing and they're very clicky, but they show up, but they show up.

1475
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:20,760
 They show up.

1476
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:23,880
 So we get there, we get on the flight.

1477
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,480
 We're going to Philadelphia this time.

1478
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:26,760
 We're not doing new work anymore.

1479
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,340
 We're going to Philadelphia.

1480
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:33,360
 So we get on the flight to Philadelphia, by the way, I really appreciated my seat mate,

1481
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,000
 the stranger sitting next to me.

1482
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,280
 Uh, it was a seven hour flight.

1483
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:43,160
 She did not speak to me until there was about half an hour left in that flight.

1484
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:46,760
 And then we had just a very pleasant conversation for the last half hour before we left.

1485
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:47,760
 A pro.

1486
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:48,760
 What a pro.

1487
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:49,760
 Look at you go.

1488
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,400
 I appreciated that so much.

1489
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:54,440
 Was this an American that you were seated next to?

1490
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,760
 Uh, this was an American.

1491
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:57,760
 Yes.

1492
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:58,920
 Was it your wife?

1493
01:08:58,920 --> 01:08:59,920
 It was not my wife.

1494
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,480
 She was seated on a different row.

1495
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:04,200
 Oh, you guys don't fly together?

1496
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:07,440
 Uh, we, we ended up not flying together on that leg.

1497
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:08,440
 I forget why.

1498
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:10,840
 I think it was just too full or something.

1499
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:16,200
 My wife likes to do like, you know, like there's a, there's a tier of cheap seat where you

1500
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:22,440
 don't choose your, your, your, your seat and so you can lose that gamble.

1501
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,800
 And it sounds like maybe that's, that's what happened there.

1502
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:28,280
 That may have happened here because SJ did set up these flights, so I'm not entirely

1503
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:30,840
 sure, but yeah, something happened on this one and we weren't sitting together.

1504
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:35,600
 Did I tell you guys about my return flight from Vegas last time that I was...

1505
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,600
 No.

1506
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,200
 Were there, were there any dirty filthy Roma's on there?

1507
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:42,080
 Not that I could tell, but I did fuck up.

1508
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,080
 Were there anyone in white t-shirts?

1509
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,080
 Cause those were the Roma's.

1510
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,080
 Are Roma's from Italy?

1511
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:47,360
 Where are Roma's supposed to, supposedly from?

1512
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,360
 What's the culture of Roma?

1513
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:49,360
 I don't even know.

1514
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:50,360
 The...

1515
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:51,360
 It's, it's what we used to call gypsies.

1516
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:52,360
 Okay.

1517
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:53,360
 Got it.

1518
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,360
 Romanians.

1519
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,360
 That's it.

1520
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,360
 Okay.

1521
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,360
 Yeah.

1522
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,360
 Uh.

1523
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,360
 Thank you.

1524
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,360
 Everybody chiming in.

1525
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:01,360
 Yeah.

1526
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:05,840
 Cause Roma to me is always like a lot of like Italian places have like Roma as a, as a Italian

1527
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:06,840
 pronunciation of Rome.

1528
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:07,840
 They're a small tomato.

1529
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:08,840
 Yeah.

1530
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:09,840
 Yeah.

1531
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:10,840
 They are a small tomato.

1532
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:17,480
 Well, I, I messed up and didn't get my pre-book Southwest early registry thing, so I was pretty

1533
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:18,480
 late on getting on the plane.

1534
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,480
 You were at the end of the line.

1535
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,480
 Yeah.

1536
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,480
 On the plane.

1537
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:23,400
 So I sat in the middle of two people.

1538
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,920
 The lady to my right was at the window.

1539
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,280
 She was fine.

1540
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:30,920
 The guy in the aisle next to me was having issues.

1541
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:31,920
 Oh no.

1542
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,000
 Cause we were coming out of Vegas.

1543
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:42,120
 So the air conditioning was up and coming into Pittsburgh, he was shaking and rocking

1544
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,880
 like he was freezing to death.

1545
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,600
 I don't know why he didn't ask for a blanket or something.

1546
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,600
 I don't know.

1547
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:55,400
 He was having issues and he brought an entire sandwich on the flight with him.

1548
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:56,400
 Rookie.

1549
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,400
 Rookie.

1550
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,400
 Yeah.

1551
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,400
 Oh, rookie for sure.

1552
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,400
 For sure.

1553
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:06,000
 Not an experienced traveler, smelly enough that I was like, I, I, I know what you're

1554
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
 eating.

1555
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
 Yeah.

1556
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
 Yeah.

1557
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,200
 He should have, he should have just dumped all the innards of the sandwich and hide inside

1558
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:16,120
 the bread like, like Skywalker.

1559
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:20,000
 That would have been the move is like turn that into a tauntaun for your arm, buddy.

1560
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:26,120
 Oh, you know, but no, he, uh, he didn't, but he was, he was shaking, shaking like a leaf

1561
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,120
 leaf.

1562
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,120
 It was strange.

1563
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,120
 It was strange.

1564
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:32,400
 Did you feel like he was going to lose it or do you think it was just done out of, uh,

1565
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,400
 coldness?

1566
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,400
 Once or twice.

1567
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,400
 I was cut.

1568
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:40,920
 I got a little like, what is happening, bud, but he didn't an eye on him once or twice.

1569
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:44,600
 I was keeping an eye on him once or twice, but he didn't, he didn't go completely off

1570
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,600
 the rails.

1571
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,600
 Uh, but I didn't, I didn't sleep that flight at all.

1572
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,840
 Uh, I was just listening to podcasts.

1573
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:53,920
 Did you think to offer him a coat like a gentleman?

1574
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:58,720
 Did you think to, uh, had I been wearing any extra garments?

1575
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:02,400
 I might, I may have, but I was, you know, here, take my pants.

1576
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:06,000
 I was just in Vegas, you know, pajama mode.

1577
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
 Basically.

1578
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,480
 I'm wearing my sweats and a t-shirt.

1579
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:11,360
 I was just ready to go.

1580
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,320
 So, uh, yeah, it was easy peasy.

1581
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:21,080
 I don't even think I had a jacket on, um, yeah, I was just rolling and it's different

1582
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,360
 for men of size.

1583
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:25,960
 Did you think if he was maybe rocking, did you think to maybe cradle him?

1584
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:29,040
 Maybe just like support him, lift him up a little bit.

1585
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,120
 I did it.

1586
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,280
 I did it.

1587
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,080
 Ranch Lunk says possibly autism.

1588
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:35,240
 No, I don't think this was the case.

1589
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:37,600
 Uh, he was truly just cold.

1590
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,160
 Oh man.

1591
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:44,400
 Speaking of autism on my flight home, I watched the accountant too.

1592
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:48,480
 Oh, I watched the accountant too on my flight home.

1593
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:54,160
 Ben Affleck playing an autistic person made me very uncomfortable.

1594
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:59,080
 I'm so happy.

1595
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:02,920
 I was watching it going like, this can't be okay.

1596
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:07,240
 And uh, the great actor, is it John Berenthal, is that his name?

1597
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:08,240
 I think so.

1598
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:09,240
 Yeah.

1599
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:10,240
 The Punisher.

1600
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:11,240
 Yeah.

1601
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,240
 He's so good in it.

1602
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:13,240
 Yes.

1603
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,240
 And he's his brother.

1604
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:15,240
 He's Ben Affleck's brother in this.

1605
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:19,240
 I was like, thank God he is in this movie.

1606
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:23,520
 And this movie was in the middle of seven rewrites and they pressed go.

1607
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:29,120
 I mean, some of it's like a, like a romp, like buddy comedy, like, like, like, uh, like,

1608
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:32,480
 uh, uh, was it Will Smith and, uh, bad boys.

1609
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,480
 Oh, bad boys.

1610
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:34,480
 Yeah.

1611
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:35,480
 Some of it has, yeah.

1612
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:38,080
 A lot of us like got like bad boy humor moments.

1613
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,520
 Some of it's like, some of it's like Taylor's share, like right out of a Taylor Sheridan

1614
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:46,840
 show, uh, uh, where they're like, they go into like a honky tonk bar and that's like,

1615
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:52,240
 they get like an old fashioned honky tonk bar is the weirdest scene in cinema.

1616
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:54,160
 It doesn't need to be at all.

1617
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,160
 It doesn't make a damn bit of sense.

1618
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:59,920
 And then they don't show the fight sequence, which I'm like, they go for like a gag.

1619
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:00,920
 We're like, Oh shoot.

1620
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:03,320
 And then just shows guys like coming out of a window and they get in a car and right off

1621
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:05,480
 like a Taylor Sheridan show, like a Taylor shirt.

1622
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:09,480
 And I was like, and I literally was like, I was like, what, why am I watching an action

1623
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,720
 movie where you skip the fight sequences?

1624
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:18,400
 This movie is filled with hyper violence the entire time and we skip over the bar fight

1625
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:19,400
 scene.

1626
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:22,880
 This was like, what is it happening?

1627
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:27,520
 And Ben Affleck, I guess he like studied a particular kid and has a good relationship

1628
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:28,520
 with him.

1629
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:31,080
 And he already did this in the accountant one, which I didn't watch because I heard he was

1630
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:34,320
 playing an autistic person in the first one.

1631
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,380
 Um, but I love John Baranthal.

1632
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:38,160
 So I was like, wait, wait, you didn't see accountant one?

1633
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:39,160
 No.

1634
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:40,160
 How did you keep up?

1635
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:45,760
 How did you keep up in accountant two plot wise, man?

1636
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:55,440
 And it is just the strangest, like it is both like, it is scored like a nineties thriller.

1637
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:59,600
 There are parts of it that are like John Wick-like, like where it's like this network of people

1638
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:03,400
 that just keep reporting to other people and like an underbelly and both sides have too

1639
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:06,720
 much access to like crazy amounts of information.

1640
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:10,400
 One woman's trying to like just be like a good voice in it.

1641
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:11,720
 Like it's all over the place.

1642
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:13,280
 It is really, really is.

1643
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:17,720
 There is so much going on at all times in this movie.

1644
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:18,720
 It's ridiculous.

1645
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:27,400
 It is a chaotic C plus of a movie and I, I not only watched the accountant too.

1646
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:30,440
 I also watched the Jason Statham vehicle.

1647
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,440
 The beekeeper.

1648
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,840
 Oh, I was, I saw a beekeeper when it came out.

1649
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,840
 I love Jason Statham.

1650
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,840
 I was like, these are both very much Matt Donnelly movies.

1651
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:41,840
 But Beekeeper doesn't waver.

1652
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:47,780
 No, Beekeeper is a good old, it's Jason Statham just doing Jason Statham stuff.

1653
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:48,780
 By the numbers, right?

1654
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:49,780
 Just what you want.

1655
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:50,780
 Hyperviolence.

1656
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:53,600
 No, they don't, they don't take a break for me to feel good.

1657
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,800
 They don't try to make me laugh.

1658
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:59,280
 It is just, you shouldn't have messed with them.

1659
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,600
 He was trying to retire too bad.

1660
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,600
 He's killing all y'all.

1661
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:08,320
 I'm looking forward to Nobody 2, which apparently is the exact same movie.

1662
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,320
 Oh yeah.

1663
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:10,320
 Yeah.

1664
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:11,320
 I love Nobody 1.

1665
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:12,320
 So yeah, I'll take Nobody 2.

1666
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:13,320
 It was great.

1667
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,320
 No, no.

1668
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,320
 I mean, here's the thing.

1669
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:19,480
 I like the idea of portraying autistic people in mainstream movies.

1670
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,040
 Of course.

1671
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:24,440
 We have this thing where we like, we don't like when actors now try to portray different

1672
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:29,640
 things like you, you know, unless you are blind, you shouldn't play blind or whatever,

1673
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:30,640
 all that stuff.

1674
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,000
 Do you agree with any of that?

1675
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,060
 Ben Affleck is not a transformative actor.

1676
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:37,720
 He never has been.

1677
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:42,600
 Ben Affleck always plays versions of Ben Affleck that we like him doing, charming guy, trying

1678
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,400
 to do good things.

1679
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:45,400
 Yeah.

1680
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:48,000
 You know, he's not Gary Oldman.

1681
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,480
 He's not like, I don't know.

1682
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,480
 You know what I mean?

1683
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:51,480
 What?

1684
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:52,480
 He's not?

1685
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:53,480
 That's what I mean.

1686
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:55,440
 There are actors we would give credit to like really go and play.

1687
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:56,440
 You know what though?

1688
01:16:56,440 --> 01:17:04,160
 I mean, the Gary Oldman, have you seen the one where he plays the little person on his

1689
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:05,160
 knees?

1690
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,160
 No, no, no, no.

1691
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:07,160
 Oh, no.

1692
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:08,160
 My point.

1693
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:11,120
 I didn't want my point to boomerang so quickly.

1694
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,600
 No, no, no, no.

1695
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:14,600
 I'm just wrong.

1696
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:15,600
 I'm just wrong.

1697
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:16,600
 Never mind.

1698
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:19,600
 Gary Oldman does a whole movie on his knees.

1699
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:20,600
 All right.

1700
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:21,600
 Forget everything Ben just said.

1701
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,600
 We're going to edit that part out.

1702
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:23,600
 No big deal.

1703
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:24,600
 Cut out shoes.

1704
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:29,840
 We're editing that whole part out.

1705
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:30,840
 That's fine.

1706
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:31,840
 Take, take two.

1707
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:32,840
 Boop.

1708
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:36,760
 We don't give Ben Affleck the credit of being a transformative actor.

1709
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,040
 Like I don't even know who.

1710
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:39,640
 I can't think of anyone right now.

1711
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:40,640
 Like other actors.

1712
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:46,240
 Like other actors, but we sometimes allow other actors to kind of be transformative different

1713
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:47,240
 characters.

1714
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,240
 Yeah.

1715
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:51,080
 Is it just because we used to do it?

1716
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:55,480
 No, this, I know what Matt means.

1717
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:58,000
 I couldn't get it out of my head the entire film.

1718
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
 Yeah.

1719
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
 The whole time.

1720
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,120
 Every time he does it, you just go, oh my God, that's Ben Affleck trying to be autistic.

1721
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,120
 That's all.

1722
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:10,000
 Like you're just watching him act and going like, oh, how do you feel great about this?

1723
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
 Yeah.

1724
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,920
 Oh, the Gary Oldman movie on his knees is called Tiptoes, apparently, according to Winners

1725
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:16,920
 School.

1726
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:17,920
 Oh, geez.

1727
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:18,920
 He's, he's, he's brothers.

1728
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:23,600
 He's brothers with McConaughey.

1729
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:26,760
 Oh boy.

1730
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:28,760
 Oh boy.

1731
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:42,360
 And McConaughey is a full-sized man, whereas Gary Oldman plays a smaller man and it's outrageous.

1732
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:48,280
 And McConaughey doesn't like him.

1733
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:51,640
 Like he has beef with his brother.

1734
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:54,720
 It's very strange.

1735
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,180
 What kind of beef?

1736
01:18:56,180 --> 01:18:57,180
 Short rib?

1737
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:58,180
 Short rib beef.

1738
01:18:58,180 --> 01:18:59,180
 Short rib beef?

1739
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:06,880
 Oh my God, Paul's playing a clip and it just showed a split second of Gary Oldman being

1740
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:07,880
 tiny.

1741
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:08,880
 Doing the thing.

1742
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:09,880
 Oh, that's, that's not great.

1743
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:10,880
 It's the preview.

1744
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:11,880
 Oh my gosh.

1745
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:17,940
 So that Paul stops showing this video, I'm going to bookend my Portugal story.

1746
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:24,600
 His mom and dad are regular, see, and they, and the mom and dad of the other people, it's

1747
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,920
 just like, it's outrageous.

1748
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:35,000
 Anyway, uh, yeah, no, that's horrible.

1749
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:42,080
 It's just crazy because, but Gary Oldman's, I mean, have you seen True Romance?

1750
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,800
 That's a wild swing from Gary Oldman too.

1751
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,480
 But I like a lot of his stuff.

1752
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:50,000
 I think he does, you know.

1753
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
 He takes wild swings.

1754
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
 Okay.

1755
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
 Here's an example.

1756
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
 When he played a crazy vampire, right?

1757
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
 And, uh, what was it?

1758
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,520
 A Nosferatu or whatever, or what was it?

1759
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,520
 Dracula.

1760
01:19:58,520 --> 01:19:59,520
 Dracula.

1761
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:00,520
 Bram Stoker's Dracula.

1762
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:01,720
 Bram Stoker's Dracula, right?

1763
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:07,760
 I would want to see Ben Affleck in the same amount of makeup doing like a crazy old vampire.

1764
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:08,760
 You're absolutely right.

1765
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,920
 He couldn't pull off full makeup Affleck.

1766
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:12,920
 Yeah.

1767
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:17,280
 He's just, he's meant to be just like likable, relatable guy in whatever role he's playing.

1768
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,960
 He's that Boston guy over there.

1769
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:24,480
 That's why Batman didn't work for him because he's got 80% of it.

1770
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:25,480
 That's why.

1771
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:33,920
 Well, I mean, Snyder didn't do him any favors, but he's got 80% of it, but the Snyder take

1772
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:38,300
 on Batman was so morose and unhappy.

1773
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:43,280
 And when you introduce him in basically a 9/11 scenario, it's like, where do we go from

1774
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:44,280
 here?

1775
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:45,280
 9/12.

1776
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:49,520
 Well, I mean, it was, it was 9/12.

1777
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:52,320
 It was, it was Superman causing 9/12 basically.

1778
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:55,300
 Oh, I went and saw the new Superman movie the other day.

1779
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:56,300
 Yeah.

1780
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:57,300
 I was so bored.

1781
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:58,300
 Was it?

1782
01:20:58,300 --> 01:20:59,300
 It was boring to you?

1783
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:03,680
 I was just so fucking bored the entire time.

1784
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:08,680
 I saw it, I was like, I just don't give a shit.

1785
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:12,120
 Animal adaptions went up like 500% after that movie came out.

1786
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:13,600
 Oh, that makes sense.

1787
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,600
 Is that true?

1788
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:15,600
 Yeah.

1789
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,200
 Cause it's all about the, the super dog is all over the place.

1790
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,200
 Yeah.

1791
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:19,200
 Apparently Crypto's the star.

1792
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:20,200
 Yes.

1793
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,200
 Yeah.

1794
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,680
 Which that credit to James Gunn knowing what he's doing, right?

1795
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:24,680
 I agree.

1796
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:28,360
 They took two really big swings because you have to try to reinvent the wheel a little

1797
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:29,360
 bit.

1798
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:30,360
 Yeah.

1799
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:31,360
 Yeah.

1800
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:32,360
 And yet you still have to deliver a blockbuster.

1801
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:35,360
 And they started the movie where it would be the start of the third act in any other

1802
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,360
 superhero movie.

1803
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:41,760
 They start the movie in the middle and it's not, there's no, there's no origin story or

1804
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:42,760
 whatever.

1805
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:45,520
 Again, I think we pointed out another episode, but none of us had seen it yet.

1806
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:52,760
 At one point he ends up back at his home that he was raised in Kansas and it pans around.

1807
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:55,920
 Lois looks around and sees, oh, this is the room that he grew up in.

1808
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:02,000
 He's been so secretive about his life and yet here is his home and it pans to a shelf

1809
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:07,320
 that has a bunch of trophies on it.

1810
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:10,400
 And I'm just like, what was Superman doing in high school?

1811
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,400
 He just was going ham.

1812
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,760
 Just fucking wrecking people in wrestling.

1813
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:15,760
 What?

1814
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:16,760
 Football?

1815
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:17,760
 Basketball?

1816
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:18,760
 Speech and debate.

1817
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:19,760
 It's speech and debate.

1818
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:20,760
 What was he doing?

1819
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:27,280
 It's like, it's like that moment in the Incredibles where they, where Dash is doing the, yeah,

1820
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,280
 track and field.

1821
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:29,280
 The race.

1822
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:30,280
 Oh yeah.

1823
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:31,280
 Track and field.

1824
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,280
 What?

1825
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:33,280
 He's like, whoa.

1826
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,280
 Pull it back.

1827
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:38,760
 I was like, what are those trophies for?

1828
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:41,040
 What the fuck were you doing, Clark?

1829
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,040
 Debate club.

1830
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,040
 Ranch slugs.

1831
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,040
 That's debate club.

1832
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:45,040
 And maybe you're right.

1833
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,040
 It could have been forensics.

1834
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,040
 Who knows?

1835
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:49,960
 It could have been all trophies for spirit of the Latin club.

1836
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:53,520
 Oh, you only get little medallions for that.

1837
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:54,520
 No.

1838
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:55,520
 Yeah.

1839
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:56,520
 They didn't look like.

1840
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:00,720
 The woman in front of me on the flight was watching, she was also watching a fine film.

1841
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:03,680
 She was watching speed two cruise control.

1842
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:10,120
 I appreciate, I appreciate this person watching speed two cruise control on this plane.

1843
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:13,680
 The same danger as speed one, but now in knots.

1844
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:14,840
 Now on the boat.

1845
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:17,400
 Who was that Keanu replacement?

1846
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,400
 What did he end up doing?

1847
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,400
 Oh, I forget his name.

1848
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:20,400
 He had a little run.

1849
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,400
 I forget his name.

1850
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:22,400
 He did.

1851
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:23,400
 He did.

1852
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:24,400
 Jason Patrick.

1853
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,400
 Jason Patrick.

1854
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,400
 Yes.

1855
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,400
 Jason Patrick.

1856
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:28,400
 Yes.

1857
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,400
 Yeah.

1858
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:30,400
 Yeah.

1859
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,400
 Yeah.

1860
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:32,400
 Anyway, Jacob, please.

1861
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:33,400
 Oh, I was going to tell you this too.

1862
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:34,400
 Your Portugal story.

1863
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,400
 Yeah.

1864
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:40,640
 So the woman on the flight back watching this woman watch speed two cruise control, they

1865
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:46,200
 serve a meal on the flight back and I saw the meal and it was some kind of chicken something

1866
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,200
 or something like that.

1867
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,120
 And they had a couple of other options.

1868
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,320
 I wasn't especially hungry.

1869
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:56,480
 So when the flight attendant comes by with the meals, I just said, Hey, I don't want

1870
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:57,480
 the meal.

1871
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:01,160
 Do you have like a little snacky something though, like a bag of chips or some pretzels

1872
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:02,160
 or something like that?

1873
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:05,080
 And she goes, I do, but it'll take me a few minutes.

1874
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:06,880
 I said, Oh, no, I'm not in a hurry.

1875
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:07,880
 No problem at all.

1876
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:08,880
 I make my own pretzels.

1877
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:12,680
 I make my own nacho sauce.

1878
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:15,880
 Whatever you get through doing whatever you're doing, no problem.

1879
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:18,280
 I'll, I'll be right here.

1880
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:20,120
 And she got a smile and was like, great.

1881
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:24,920
 And so she walks away, she finishes up and then like 10 minutes later, she comes back

1882
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:32,720
 and has two bags of salt and pepper potato chips and two little bags of pretzels and

1883
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:35,840
 hands me those four items.

1884
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,320
 And I go, Oh, this is, this is great.

1885
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:38,320
 Thank you so much.

1886
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,320
 This will last me.

1887
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:42,600
 Uh, you know, for the, for the rest of the time, uh, great.

1888
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,040
 Thank you.

1889
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:46,600
 And I have my drink and I'm, I'm happy as a clam.

1890
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:47,600
 I'm sitting there.

1891
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,440
 I'm watching a little movie.

1892
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:52,960
 Wayne says that'll be $73.

1893
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:57,360
 All gratis, all gratis.

1894
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:58,360
 Nice.

1895
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:02,080
 So, so, uh, I'm sitting there, I'm enjoying that.

1896
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:08,400
 And then I hear behind me in the, in the road directly behind me, um, woman says, Hey, I

1897
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:13,780
 never got my chicken because they had, I guess they had run out of, of chicken for the meals

1898
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:14,780
 at some point.

1899
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:17,120
 Ma'am, we're still, we're still slapping it, ma'am.

1900
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:18,120
 We're still slapping.

1901
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:21,640
 We're slapping it as fast as we can.

1902
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:23,460
 It's harder to slap at this altitude.

1903
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:24,460
 You understand?

1904
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:28,040
 And so they had brought over all the plates and everything, all the meals.

1905
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:32,520
 And then for like two or three people right in that area, they had run out of the chicken.

1906
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:36,040
 And so they had gone to get more chicken from the, from the galley or whatever.

1907
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:38,360
 And they come back and they serve those people chicken.

1908
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:43,280
 And I guess this one woman had missed the, uh, the chicken on the, on the second round.

1909
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:44,280
 Okay.

1910
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:49,440
 And so she ate her, uh, her plate of food and then she, uh, was mad that she had not

1911
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,640
 had any chicken.

1912
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:52,560
 So here comes the guy cleaning up.

1913
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:55,560
 He's not even the, uh, the guy serving food.

1914
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:56,560
 He's just the cleanup guy.

1915
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:57,560
 Yeah.

1916
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:58,560
 And so he's coming along.

1917
01:25:58,560 --> 01:25:59,560
 He's cleaning up.

1918
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:04,040
 He's collecting the garbage and she says to him very loudly and I'm sitting at the window.

1919
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,420
 She is sitting in the window directly behind me.

1920
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:07,760
 And so all I can do, I can't see her.

1921
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:12,680
 I can just hear her and she says, look, I never got my chicken in my meal.

1922
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:17,160
 And at this point I thought she was kidding because I was like, this is such a ridiculous

1923
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:18,160
 thing.

1924
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:19,160
 I think this woman is fooling around.

1925
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:23,200
 She's laughing and clapping good bit, ma'am, a little bit, a little bit good bit.

1926
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:27,420
 And I w I was like genuinely smiling and like, Oh, this woman's going to do a bit about where

1927
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:29,200
 she yells about not getting chicken now.

1928
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,200
 Nope.

1929
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:31,200
 Wasn't doing a bit.

1930
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,880
 And by the way, chicken is code for cocaine.

1931
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:36,040
 I would like cocaine, please.

1932
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:41,800
 I can tell you one thing about Portugal is they don't use code words for cocaine.

1933
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:46,520
 Under no circumstance will they use code words for cocaine.

1934
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:48,160
 Oh, you thought you were getting cocaine?

1935
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:49,160
 No, sir.

1936
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:50,160
 I said chicken.

1937
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:51,160
 I explicitly said chicken.

1938
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:55,180
 I said chicken that I didn't, I didn't say cocaine.

1939
01:26:55,180 --> 01:27:00,560
 So she says to this young man flight attendant who is collecting the garbage, she goes, I

1940
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,360
 never got my chicken.

1941
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:06,720
 And in exchange for that, you can make it right to me by bringing me a bag of potato

1942
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:07,720
 chips.

1943
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:12,120
 Oh, she wants the same salt content.

1944
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:13,120
 That's right.

1945
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:19,080
 So he says, uh, miss, I'm just, I'm just picking up the trash right now, but the flight

1946
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:23,360
 attendant will be right back by in a few minutes and you can get, you can get the potato chips

1947
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:24,840
 from her.

1948
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:25,960
 That is not good enough.

1949
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:26,960
 Of course not.

1950
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:31,160
 She starts raising her voice indignation over the ocean.

1951
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:33,360
 People get crazy on airplanes.

1952
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:39,640
 She is raising her voice about how she wants some potato chips.

1953
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:44,920
 And he says, uh, actually miss, and again, not the flight attendant, the guy picking

1954
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:45,920
 up trash.

1955
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:49,200
 He's holding a trash bag, picking up people's garbage here.

1956
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:55,480
 And he says, actually miss, I'm not sure if we have potato chips on this flight.

1957
01:27:55,480 --> 01:28:01,000
 Uh, they actually forgot to load the potato chips on this flight.

1958
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,520
 And now, but right ahead of her, there's a man eating chips.

1959
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:10,520
 She says, Oh no, no, no, this guy right here, I assume she's pointing at the back of my

1960
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:11,520
 head.

1961
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,520
 Yeah.

1962
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:16,160
 This guy right here got a bag of potato chips.

1963
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:17,160
 Who is this?

1964
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:22,640
 Uh, royal Prince that you pamper in front of me while negating my chicken.

1965
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:26,720
 Everyone knows chips equals chicken.

1966
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:31,620
 Now at this point I had eaten my bag of potato chips.

1967
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:32,880
 Just one bag.

1968
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,560
 I had eaten, well, I had eaten the potato chips cause they, yeah, they brought out like

1969
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:38,160
 the two little, like you ate both the bag.

1970
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:40,280
 They were both bags of potato chips.

1971
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:45,560
 So when you heard him say that, were you like, go, like, did you know before she even pointed

1972
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:46,560
 you out?

1973
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:50,120
 I was trying as hard as I could to sink into my seat.

1974
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:51,120
 Right.

1975
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:57,280
 Cause I was like, this nice flight attendant did me a, did me a solid, brought me some,

1976
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,880
 uh, some nice salty snacks to enjoy on here.

1977
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:04,360
 So I wouldn't be eating the airplane chicken contraband snacks.

1978
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:09,000
 Maybe well, well I found out later they had a few bags left over, but they had in fact

1979
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
 not been resupplied.

1980
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,020
 So they didn't have enough bags of chips for the entire plane, but they had like a few

1981
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:16,560
 bags of chips around, ma'am.

1982
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:20,560
 I will baby bird those chips into your mouth.

1983
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:23,560
 Yeah.

1984
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:28,960
 So he looks at my tray table there and he sees a bag of pretzels on there and he goes,

1985
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:31,160
 Oh miss, he doesn't have chips.

1986
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:32,160
 He just has pretzels.

1987
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,160
 Oh no.

1988
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:34,160
 Oh shoot.

1989
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:35,440
 This guy's digging it even further.

1990
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:37,160
 He's only trying to help.

1991
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:42,000
 He was trying to help so hard and I just wanted to be like, shut the fuck up.

1992
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,280
 Move along.

1993
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,280
 Stop talking.

1994
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:46,280
 Just stop it.

1995
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:48,960
 You are literally a garbage person.

1996
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:49,960
 Get out of here.

1997
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:50,960
 Go.

1998
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:53,640
 Get out of here, trash man.

1999
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:54,840
 Do your thing.

2000
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:57,040
 But this woman, you're not helping.

2001
01:29:57,040 --> 01:30:00,340
 You're trying to help and I appreciate that you're trying to help, but you're not.

2002
01:30:00,340 --> 01:30:02,200
 Please, please continue on with your day.

2003
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:03,200
 This guy also has headphones.

2004
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:04,200
 Do you want his headphones?

2005
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:06,400
 He also has a, what else?

2006
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:07,400
 He's got a hat.

2007
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:11,360
 You want to wear his hat?

2008
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:15,520
 So he says, well miss, there's a button there right in front of you.

2009
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:19,640
 If you hit that button, that's the flight attendant call button and she can come get

2010
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:20,640
 you whatever you need.

2011
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:21,640
 No, no, no.

2012
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:24,200
 And she goes, that's not good enough.

2013
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:25,840
 That is not good enough for her.

2014
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:30,400
 She goes, no, no, no, I just need a bag of chips and I would like them right now.

2015
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:36,240
 And so finally this poor guy flags down one of the flight attendants.

2016
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:41,540
 So strange to be demanding like this alternate, like I need you specifically to change the

2017
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:43,280
 way you do things.

2018
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:44,280
 That's it.

2019
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:51,040
 And so finally the flight attendant who had helped me out comes back over and this woman

2020
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:55,960
 is now, she's not quite yelling, but she's yelling.

2021
01:30:55,960 --> 01:31:02,400
 She is what we in Cooth society would refer to as yelling.

2022
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:06,040
 This guy got about, you brought this guy a bag of chips.

2023
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:07,640
 Do you know this guy?

2024
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:09,080
 She's now questioning the flight attendant.

2025
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:10,080
 Do you know this guy?

2026
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:11,220
 Do you know him?

2027
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:14,040
 Is he someone that I should know because he got chips?

2028
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:15,040
 Oh my God.

2029
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,120
 No problem.

2030
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:17,120
 This bitch.

2031
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,120
 What a bitch.

2032
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:22,560
 She keeps on and keeps on and finally a flight attendant comes back over and goes, Hey, I

2033
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:27,880
 found a bag of potato chips, uh, lucky that yo comes back and tries to like defuse the

2034
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:28,880
 whole situation.

2035
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:29,880
 Right.

2036
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:32,320
 And goes like, Hey, good news everybody.

2037
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,520
 I found a bag of potato chips.

2038
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:36,480
 This bag is just for you, ma'am.

2039
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,080
 Enjoy your bag of potato chips.

2040
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:42,000
 Enjoy the rest of your flight.

2041
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,560
 I would have loved for it to be over at that minute.

2042
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:48,560
 So it's like, she is amped, right, like she will not.

2043
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:49,560
 She's on.

2044
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:50,560
 Right.

2045
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:51,560
 So it's like going.

2046
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:52,960
 So now the flight attendants drop everything off.

2047
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,240
 They picked up the garbage.

2048
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:56,560
 I've now broken open one of my bag of pretzels.

2049
01:31:56,560 --> 01:32:02,480
 I'm making eye contact with the flight attendant while she was there and just mouthy, I'm sorry.

2050
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:04,600
 I am sorry.

2051
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,400
 I didn't mean to start all this.

2052
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:07,680
 I don't write these people.

2053
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:12,440
 I'm just trying to do anything to distance myself from these people in the eyes of this

2054
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:15,640
 flight attendant who again did a nice thing for me.

2055
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:16,640
 Yeah.

2056
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:19,840
 Unlike, unlike enterprise where we were joking, you should have honestly turned around and

2057
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,440
 be like, do you know who I am?

2058
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:26,680
 Do you know how lucky you are to be in my airspace?

2059
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:34,760
 And then this woman gave me the perfect bookend for my entire Portugal vacation without even

2060
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:36,560
 knowing it.

2061
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:37,880
 The flight attendant walked away.

2062
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:42,360
 The flight attendants have now walked away and now she is just talking to her seat mates.

2063
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:47,480
 She's talking to two other people who she did not know before this flight started and

2064
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:54,440
 she's now loudly talking to them and laughing and she goes, ow, they didn't know who they

2065
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:56,200
 were messing with.

2066
01:32:56,200 --> 01:33:02,160
 I as soon as I saw this guy get chips, I knew that I was going to get chips and you don't

2067
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:03,160
 even know.

2068
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:10,200
 You see, I'm from Jersey and in Jersey, I get what I want.

2069
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:14,440
 No, in Jersey, you cry and call your brother for help.

2070
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:15,440
 No.

2071
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:16,440
 No.

2072
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:24,720
 Of course this woman's from Jersey and is now going to loudly proclaim it.

2073
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:25,720
 I wish I was on a flight.

2074
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:28,440
 I'd be like, please stop speaking for all of us.

2075
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:29,440
 Please stop doing that.

2076
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:32,120
 Stop speaking for any of us.

2077
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:33,120
 It was terrible.

2078
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:34,120
 Oh boy.

2079
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:40,840
 It was so bad and I just looked at my seat mate at one point when she started talking

2080
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:44,840
 to me and I just said, do you remember when air travel used to be pleasant?

2081
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:47,080
 It was just nice.

2082
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:49,260
 I believe she deserved a slow clap.

2083
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:53,920
 I think the hands from your seat going right up and just slow clapping.

2084
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:57,040
 Just above my head so she could just see my hands.

2085
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,040
 Exactly.

2086
01:33:58,040 --> 01:33:59,040
 Good job.

2087
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:00,040
 She wouldn't even get it.

2088
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:07,260
 I picture her telling this story to anyone after she lands, just watching whoever she's

2089
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:11,760
 talking to just eyes glaze over with like, what are you talking about?

2090
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:19,960
 You are in some psychotic state where you turn chips into currency and you could not

2091
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:23,800
 get off your own emotional high point.

2092
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:28,440
 You were over the Atlantic Ocean and you had a breakdown over potato chips.

2093
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:33,440
 Even your brain just said win instead of assessing the situation for what it was.

2094
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:37,480
 You just had to find a way to feel like you were winning.

2095
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:41,000
 She had just had a tray of food.

2096
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,960
 There was a salad on there.

2097
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,380
 There were side dishes.

2098
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:50,280
 She had had the whole meal except for the chicken, but it was not a small amount of

2099
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:51,280
 food.

2100
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:53,280
 It was a full on meal that they served on this.

2101
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:54,280
 Wow.

2102
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:55,280
 Yeah.

2103
01:34:55,280 --> 01:35:01,920
 It was bizarre until she said she was from Jersey and then I understood all of it.

2104
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:05,200
 I married a California girl so what can I say?

2105
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:10,760
 Apparently she also spends part of the year in Miami and believe me, she knows how to

2106
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:12,880
 get shit done in Miami too.

2107
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:14,920
 There was cocaine involved.

2108
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:19,160
 I knew this was a cocaine story one way or the other.

2109
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:21,160
 She's doing that cocaine.

2110
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:22,160
 No, no.

2111
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:24,400
 That's not how you do cocaine, Jacob.

2112
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:25,400
 Cocaine.

2113
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:26,400
 Cocaine.

2114
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:27,400
 Cocaine.

2115
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:28,400
 Cocaine.

2116
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:29,400
 Cocaine.

2117
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:30,400
 Cocaine.

2118
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:31,400
 Cocaine.

2119
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:32,400
 Cocaine.

2120
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:33,400
 Cocaine.

2121
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:34,400
 Right in the vein.

2122
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,400
 That's the rhyme.

2123
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:36,400
 Cocaine.

2124
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:37,400
 Cocaine.

2125
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:38,400
 Right in my vein.

2126
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,400
 Jim Dandy.

2127
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:40,400
 Jim Dandy.

2128
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:41,400
 Go Jim Dandy.

2129
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:42,400
 What the fuck are you here for?

2130
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:43,400
 Who asked you to come?

2131
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:44,400
 What are you doing?

2132
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:45,400
 Nobody knows.

2133
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:46,400
 Lovely, Jacob.

2134
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:47,400
 What's up?

2135
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:48,400
 Lovely, Jacob.

2136
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:49,400
 It was great.

2137
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:50,400
 It was a great week.

2138
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:51,400
 Glad to be back.

2139
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:52,400
 Glad to be back on the old scoops here.

2140
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:53,400
 This is great.

2141
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:54,400
 It's good to be back.

2142
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:55,400
 Thanks, everybody, for joining us.

2143
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:56,400
 We've run out of time.

2144
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:57,400
 We didn't have it.

2145
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:59,400
 We don't have any Jock vs. Nerd time.

2146
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:00,400
 We just talked.

2147
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,960
 We'll be back here and we'll be recording.

2148
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:06,920
 For anyone joining us live, we'll be recording again on Friday for the Monday episode, as

2149
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:07,920
 always.

2150
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:08,920
 And so you can join us there.

2151
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:12,200
 I was going to ask you guys if we can go an hour early on Friday.

2152
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:13,200
 Yes.

2153
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:14,200
 Yeah.

2154
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:15,200
 Great.

2155
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:16,200
 We'll send that invite out to the patrons.

2156
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:17,200
 Yes.

2157
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:18,200
 Yeah.

2158
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:19,200
 There'll be an hour earlier on Friday.

2159
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:22,360
 The reason why is I'm heading off to Arizona, so if you're getting this, you can come tonight

2160
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:27,320
 Thursday, Friday, Saturday in Mesa, Arizona, seven o'clock shows at Mystique, the Magic

2161
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:28,320
 Experience.

2162
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:29,320
 It's no dinner.

2163
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:32,120
 It's just me, an hour long show at seven o'clock.

2164
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:33,120
 Come out and check it out.

2165
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:37,000
 And the reason why I'm asking to go early is because I am bringing my sons with me to

2166
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
 Arizona.

2167
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
 Oh, nice.

2168
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
 Yeah.

2169
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,800
 And so I'm going to, we'll get out and we'll do other stuff during the day and have fun

2170
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,800
 with my kiddos.

2171
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:48,400
 Oh, that'll be so great.

2172
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:49,400
 Yeah.

2173
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:51,400
 So I'm excited about that.

2174
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:55,800
 I want to thank everyone who joined us here today, especially Canadian Scoop Crystal for

2175
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:56,800
 hopping on there.

2176
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:59,800
 Appreciate it.

2177
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:03,320
 I want to thank the Jacob's Racist Cab Driver.

2178
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:09,440
 So again, not a hundred percent sure who he's racist towards.

2179
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:12,360
 Sounds like everybody to me.

2180
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:13,360
 Maybe everyone.

2181
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:15,080
 You made quite a case for someone who's unsure.

2182
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:16,080
 Okay.

2183
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:17,080
 Yeah, yeah.

2184
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:20,840
 But of course, this podcast wouldn't be possible with the generous people who've been supporting

2185
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:21,840
 us on Patreon.

2186
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:26,040
 So we've gotten a bunch of new signups that we appreciate that as we head into both scoop

2187
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:30,160
 fest and trying to find a new churn at the same time, a lot of bills are becoming due.

2188
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:37,240
 And so people supporting us there, we will be finishing a revamp of our Patreon with some

2189
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:41,320
 adjustments heading into this month, heading into August.

2190
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:45,460
 And we'll announce all that when it's all settled, probably the next episode.

2191
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:48,800
 And I'm going to thank some of the people who support us on Patreon right now.

2192
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:52,520
 And all these people love to shoot people on pink street.

01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:46,860
 When Scoop, Who Dat Scoop, Will Beardy Dan, Will Kellner, Will Pritchett, William McDonald,

2225
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:49,640
 and Wind Walker Scoop 23.

2226
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:50,880
 Thank you so much.

2227
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:51,880
 Thank you so much.

2228
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:56,040
 If you want to be thanked on air or get a myriad of other prizes galore at different

2229
01:40:56,040 --> 01:41:00,160
 tiers that fit your budget on a both monthly or yearly basis, we could use your support

2230
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:01,320
 over at PreachingFun.com.

2231
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:02,320
 Come visit PreachingFun.com.

2232
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:09,320
 It's better than hanging with your mom.

2233
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:19,920
 Better be bad.

2234
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:23,320
 Or if your name doesn't sound anything like any of the names that I just said, head on

2235
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:27,240
 over to fartsinabag.biz.

2236
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:35,720
 Farts, farts, farts, farts, farts, fartsinabag.biz.

2237
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:39,720
 That's fartsinabag.biz, that along with PreachingFun.com, it takes you over to our Patreon page where

2238
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:43,120
 for as little as $2 a month, you can help keep this show on the air.

2239
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:45,200
 Matt's right about all that stuff that he just said.

2240
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:49,240
 It's possible that we're going to be moving into a new studio the same month as doing

2241
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:50,240
 Scoop Fest.

2242
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:51,240
 You fool.

2243
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:52,240
 Smart idea.

2244
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:53,840
 How do you use that support over there?

2245
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:54,840
 You fool.

2246
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:56,800
 That might just be how it ends up.

2247
01:41:56,800 --> 01:42:00,640
 Yeah, but this is a great time to support us if you enjoy what you're hearing.

2248
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:05,560
 And also, now that we're doing more of these live Zoom things, this is a great time to

2249
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:08,640
 become a patron so you can get the invites and come and join us live.

2250
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:14,320
 It's wonderful to see all these lovely people that have supported us for some, for a long,

2251
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:15,320
 long time.

2252
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:17,480
 And we really do appreciate each and every one of you.

2253
01:42:17,480 --> 01:42:22,380
 And it's a really fun community in the first place, but to become part of it live, that's

2254
01:42:22,380 --> 01:42:23,380
 really special.

2255
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:24,380
 We're really enjoying this.

2256
01:42:24,380 --> 01:42:26,680
 At least I, myself, am really enjoying this new vibe.

2257
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:28,440
 Paul speaks for himself and himself only.

2258
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:29,440
 That's right.

2259
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:30,440
 Only me.

2260
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:31,960
 I'm the only one that's really enjoying all of you lovely people in the chat.

2261
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:35,160
 I find seeing laughing faces when I make jokes to be a burden.

2262
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:36,160
 Yes.

2263
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:37,160
 Yes.

2264
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:39,280
 Well, lucky you.

2265
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:42,000
 But thank you, each and every one of you who are patrons.

2266
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,200
 We really appreciate it.

2267
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:44,200
 Couldn't do the show without you.

2268
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:45,200
 It's true.

2269
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:48,960
 I was invited onto this live recordings, and I wouldn't have known to make that cocaine

2270
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:51,280
 or a runner, except I kept seeing people laugh when I did it.

2271
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:52,280
 So there you go.

2272
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:53,280
 There you go.

2273
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:54,280
 That's how it works.

2274
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:55,280
 But yeah.

2275
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:56,280
 Scoopfest stickers are still on sale.

2276
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:58,360
 Go to scoopfest.com and check that out.

2277
01:42:58,360 --> 01:43:00,560
 We have a hotel discount as well.

2278
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:04,520
 So call the Orleans and demand to be part of the discount block of rooms with a discount

2279
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:05,520
 code of...

2280
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:06,520
 Paul?

2281
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:07,520
 Superman?

2282
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,520
 Catwoman?

2283
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:09,520
 Invisible Jet?

2284
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:10,520
 25?

2285
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:19,160
 Catwoman again.

2286
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:20,160
 Right?

2287
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:21,160
 I think that's right.

2288
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:22,160
 That sounds right.

2289
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:25,840
 And if this code doesn't work out, just tell them Scoopfest when you call in and make your

2290
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:26,840
 reservation.

2291
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:27,840
 Just call the Orleans.

2292
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:28,840
 Tell them Scoopfest.

2293
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:29,840
 It'll work out.

2294
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:31,400
 But please do make an effort to come out to Scoopfest.

2295
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:33,640
 You're going to have a great time.

2296
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:38,680
 If you're on the fence at all about it, get off that fence, talk to some scoops.

2297
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:40,600
 There are lots of groups.

2298
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:41,600
 Oh yeah.

2299
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:42,600
 Flash.

2300
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:43,600
 I missed Flash.

2301
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:46,600
 Thanks, big sexy.

2302
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:48,480
 What's Jeff saying?

2303
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:51,640
 If you don't have a ticket, you need to reconsider your life choices.

2304
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:53,240
 Jeff is right.

2305
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:54,240
 Listen to Jeff.

2306
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:56,060
 He knows what he's talking about.

2307
01:43:56,060 --> 01:43:59,500
 Reconsider your life choices if you're not already coming to Scoopfest.

2308
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:01,640
 It is a wonderful, wonderful time.

2309
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:03,020
 We have a great time.

2310
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:04,780
 Our community has a great time.

2311
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:06,560
 And if you come once, you're going to want to come again.

2312
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:09,080
 But that kind of holds true for everything.

2313
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:13,160
 But yeah, please, please come on out to Scoopfest.

2314
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:16,360
 SCFI 25C.

2315
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:17,360
 There we go.

2316
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:18,480
 Mikey Newman confirmed.

2317
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:19,760
 So we'll be having movies with Mikey.

2318
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:21,200
 We'll be hosting our trivia battles.

2319
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:24,800
 He's excited that we're doing four battles this year.

2320
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,000
 He's so good.

2321
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,240
 Just made Travel Registration for one of our other special guests.

2322
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:30,800
 I'm very excited about it.

2323
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,580
 It's getting pretty exciting.

2324
01:44:32,580 --> 01:44:33,760
 So many special guests.

2325
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,100
 So many special gifts.

2326
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:37,800
 So many special things going on.

2327
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:41,340
 It's always greater than the sum of its parts.

2328
01:44:41,340 --> 01:44:43,880
 And it becomes this really special thing.

2329
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:48,700
 We are eternally grateful and always surprised by how cool it ends up.

2330
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:52,180
 Someone reached out to figure out technically how to make Paul's Hollywood Squares graphic

2331
01:44:52,180 --> 01:44:53,180
 work.

2332
01:44:53,180 --> 01:44:55,420
 And so we're excited about that.

2333
01:44:55,420 --> 01:45:00,120
 I still want to do like really basic cardboard.

2334
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:01,120
 I think that's fine.

2335
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:02,120
 Yes.

2336
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:03,120
 Absolutely.

2337
01:45:03,120 --> 01:45:04,120
 We'll see how it goes.

2338
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:06,840
 But it's going to be exciting.

2339
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:07,840
 So yeah.

2340
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:08,840
 Come out to Scoopfest.

2341
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:09,840
 Thanks for this everybody.

2342
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:10,840
 Stay safe out there.

2343
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:11,840
 We love you and we'll see you soon.

2344
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:12,840
 We'll see you soon.

2345
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:38,760
 Thanks everybody that hung out with us on Zoom today, and thanks everybody that hung out

2346
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:44,880
 with us.
