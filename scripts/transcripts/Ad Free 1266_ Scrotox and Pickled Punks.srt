1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
 It's that time, it's my favorite part of the show.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,320
 This is the part of the show where we thank you, the Ice Cream Truck Drivers.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,160
 Thank you Ice Cream Truck Drivers.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,840
 I want to thank Scoop Brady, Scoop DeJure, Scoop Cata, Slippery Caye Motherfucker, The

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:22,160
 Lost Ice Cream Truck Driver, Thunder Cougar Falcon Scoop, and Travis Jaguari.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,960
 If you want to be an Ice Cream Truck Driver just like these fine folks, deliver that fucking

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,320
 ice cream straight to people's fucking ear holes.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,240
 Head over to PreachingFun.com, PreachingFun.com is where you can go to sign up and who knows?

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:40,400
 The life you save may be your own.

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,400
 And now, a program.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,920
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an Ice Cream Social?

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,960
 Yeah, I'd love to.

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,600
 Great, let's go.

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,440
 I confirmed that my wife's band that we talked about on the last episode is in fact not a

15
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,440
 secret.

16
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,800
 So I am not in trouble.

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,080
 Okay, great.

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,080
 That's good.

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,280
 It's time for Matt and Mattingly's Ice Cream Socials sitting in Pittsburgh.

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,280
 That's Paul Mattingly.

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,000
 Sitting in Las Vegas, it's Matt Donnelly, and in Las Vegas, it's me, Jacob the Audio

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Guy.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 We're PreachingFun.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 We're PreachingFun.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,200
 Yeah, my wife's band, next year, 2026, is the 250th anniversary of the United States

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
 of America.

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,760
 Are you sure we're going to make it to that?

28
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,760
 No I'm not.

29
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,560
 We're prepping just in case.

30
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,720
 But yeah, next year is the 250th anniversary of the United States of America, which also

31
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,880
 means a bunch of cities and towns across the country are also turning 250 years old.

32
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,080
 So this coming summer, there's just going to be an assload of town festivals and city

33
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,040
 festivals and fairs and all of this stuff.

34
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,920
 And so SJ and one of her agents had this idea, like, let's put together just an American

35
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,580
 rock band.

36
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,160
 And I just kind of do, yeah, so that's the style.

37
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,760
 My favorite band name that I've come up with so far is Imminent Domain.

38
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,320
 It's not quite right, but we do really like that name.

39
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,000
 That's beautiful American stuff, though.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 That's it right there.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Yeah, it is.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 It really ties in.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,680
 So with us in studio, we have Dr. Mike is here.

44
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,680
 Dr. Mike.

45
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,680
 Dr. Mike!

46
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,680
 Thank you, guys.

47
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,760
 In studio, I mean, we're on Zoom and you're in Australia.

48
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,480
 Right, yes, as close as I could get.

49
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,440
 In a room, it's Dr. Mike.

50
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,400
 Now how old is your country?

51
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,080
 What birthday are you guys celebrating?

52
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,840
 Depends on who you ask.

53
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:53,800
 If you ask the indigenous population who have been there for sixty five thousand years, I

54
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,520
 would say that the country is many, many, many thousands of years old.

55
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,880
 But if we're talking about colonial, seventeen eighty eight.

56
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,880
 Okay.

57
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,880
 All right.

58
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,880
 Yeah.

59
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,880
 So what does that make it?

60
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,880
 Not that old.

61
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,880
 Not as old as the US.

62
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,880
 Just a little behind us.

63
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,880
 Not far.

64
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,880
 Yeah.

65
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,880
 We're seventeen seventy six.

66
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,880
 Oh, there you go.

67
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,000
 Is that number is that is that year a number that Australians just know?

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,520
 Like I think I think most citizens of the US know the know the name or they don't know

69
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,520
 the date.

70
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,520
 Seventeen seventy six.

71
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,280
 Is that is that something?

72
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,280
 You know what?

73
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,240
 The reason why I know it is because there is a part of Australia called seventeen eighty

74
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,120
 eight, which is where they landed.

75
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,520
 And that's the only way that I remember it.

76
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,080
 Despite your way of history, you guys don't agree on what your oldest bar is on your three

77
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,000
 bars that argue that's their oldest bar.

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,320
 That's the oldest bar.

79
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,240
 There's one down the road for me, which is supposed to be the oldest in Australia.

80
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,240
 Yeah.

81
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,800
 And then you go for a drive down the road again and there's another one.

82
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,480
 I like this.

83
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,840
 But you wrote a book.

84
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,840
 I did.

85
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
 Yes.

86
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,480
 The Body A to Z.

87
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,200
 You've sent me a blurb to to preview it and I read none of it.

88
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,120
 I read not not a single part of it.

89
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,640
 And I appreciate it.

90
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,120
 I think it's I think I think it's it's fine.

91
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,920
 I only sent you the blurb with twenty four hours ago.

92
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,920
 Yeah.

93
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,920
 That's not your fault.

94
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:27,560
 And I was like, I said, now the procrastinating is on my end.

95
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,400
 But I know you've been working on this book for a while.

96
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,480
 So tell us what went into the book is you always know the title.

97
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,080
 What motivated it?

98
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,200
 The book's called The Body A to Z.

99
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,760
 I'm a professor of medicine in Australia.

100
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,840
 I've got a YouTube channel where I teach people how the human body works.

101
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,800
 I've got a podcast where we do the same thing.

102
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,640
 And I'm on social media talking about, you know, this and that in regards to people's

103
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,240
 anatomy and physiology.

104
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,920
 And in all honesty, the only medium I hadn't touched yet was book form.

105
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,320
 And Matt, who I do all my YouTube and podcast stuff with, likes to likes to joke that the

106
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,520
 people who watch my tick tocks, probably the Venn diagram of those that watch my tick tocks

107
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,320
 and read, it doesn't overlap significantly.

108
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,560
 So that's right.

109
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,880
 Two distinct circles.

110
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,880
 Right.

111
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,880
 Yeah.

112
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,920
 Two very distinct circles with a big gap in between.

113
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,040
 I've got bad news for you if you think you're finding readers on our show.

114
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,920
 Hey, hold on.

115
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,920
 So yeah.

116
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,520
 And the book came out a couple of weeks ago.

117
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,880
 It's an alphabetized.

118
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,500
 It's not a textbook, obviously.

119
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,440
 It's an alphabetized journey through some of the lesser known structures and functions

120
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,600
 of the body.

121
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,560
 It's for anyone from 12 to 112.

122
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,400
 We go through topics like the external anal sphincter.

123
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,080
 We talk about why, for example, we that is important for 12 year olds to talk about that.

124
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,640
 I'm glad I'm glad you said the age thing before talking about that.

125
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,640
 Yes.

126
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,840
 There's there's there's a lot of there's a lot of interesting topics.

127
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,400
 I think the the Scrotox topic, have you guys heard of Scrotox?

128
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
 I have.

129
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,520
 Sadly, I know what it is.

130
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,760
 So I believe I know exactly what it is.

131
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,360
 I can't wait to hear you describe it, Matt.

132
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:27,940
 If you are worried that your ball sack looks older than it should, all you got to do is

133
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:32,880
 pull a little Botox in that bad boy to de wrinkle it, smooth it right out.

134
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,880
 Yeah, man.

135
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,880
 Who is that?

136
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,880
 Smooth it out.

137
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,880
 A baby's ball sack.

138
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,160
 I met a guy who actually had Scrotox and I was like, run away.

139
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,600
 I mean, it's true that one third of the ICS hosts have had it done.

140
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:57,640
 Dr. Mike, regarding Scrotox, is that something you would advise or recommend?

141
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,800
 No, I wouldn't.

142
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,680
 For a couple of I mean, one, I'm not sure.

143
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,240
 I mean, the aesthetics, I don't know who is staring, who is staring at that part of the

144
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,240
 body.

145
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
 I don't know.

146
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,920
 And if you've got a common misperception, it's a common misperception that people do

147
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,280
 it for vanity.

148
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,280
 It's for aerodynamics.

149
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:22,720
 Well, OK, if it is aerodynamics, I'll give you if it's for aerodynamics, because then

150
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,480
 that means you're already shaving.

151
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
 Right.

152
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,680
 But if you do that without the intent of shaving every day, you're just wasting your time because

153
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,520
 you can't see the non-wrinkle with the hair in the way.

154
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:40,720
 That's why I started putting Botox in my chin.

155
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,360
 Frozen Cusser is right, though.

156
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,880
 It helps with some people who have excessive sweating of their balls.

157
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:53,240
 They will do that as well, because Botox paralyzes the muscles in that area.

158
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,320
 So one, the aesthetics, two, the sweating.

159
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,920
 But the ass sweatings.

160
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,920
 Exactly.

161
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,920
 Three, the aerodynamics.

162
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:11,400
 So you have a very informative YouTube videos, you have over a million subscribers.

163
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:17,080
 You must get some strange questions to answer as a doctor from YouTube.

164
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,560
 What are some of the strangest questions you've been asked?

165
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:29,620
 I would say the strangest questions, I did call back radio for three years on our ABC

166
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:34,440
 radio station and the people that would call and the questions that were asked.

167
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,960
 I mean, there was one guy that that said he could smell snakes so he could walk into a

168
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,960
 shed.

169
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
 Yes.

170
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,960
 Yes.

171
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
 You heard me.

172
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:51,200
 He said he could walk into a shed and know where a snake was in the shed by his nose.

173
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,560
 And he wanted me to explain how he could do it.

174
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,160
 He doesn't know why.

175
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,400
 He just said, I knew where it was.

176
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,600
 And I said, what did it smell like?

177
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,760
 He said, I had a musky, musky smell and I could pinpoint exactly where in the shed this

178
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,760
 snake was.

179
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,960
 Did you just tell him he's clearly house-slytherin?

180
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:16,200
 There was another guy, he wasted a genie's wish.

181
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,880
 Like what would you do for the other two?

182
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,000
 It was the oddest super power I've ever heard.

183
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Really?

184
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,560
 I'm getting a thing.

185
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,560
 I'll be back.

186
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,120
 Paul has announced that he was getting a thing and left.

187
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,120
 Hope he's okay.

188
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,840
 Paul's scrotal botox person has arrived to the house.

189
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,840
 He's got to let them in.

190
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,360
 They have a lot of set up.

191
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,400
 Paul's going to his garage, maybe he'll smell a snake while he's in there.

192
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,200
 Oh yeah, there you go.

193
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,400
 Maybe he can locate one for us.

194
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,320
 In Australia though, isn't it, I mean, isn't that kind of a bullshit trick to be able to

195
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,040
 be like, this shed has a snake in it?

196
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,080
 That's just a safe bet, right?

197
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,440
 Like, yeah, yeah, there's a snake in that shed.

198
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,480
 Point in a corner and there's a snake.

199
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,960
 It's not even 50/50.

200
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,640
 It's just, it's likely there's a snake.

201
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,900
 No, I got a lot of strange calls.

202
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:23,240
 One guy that was trying to argue with me about, for some reason, sunglasses don't protect

203
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,280
 your eyes in any way.

204
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,280
 I didn't understand his point.

205
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:33,720
 And he kept referring to his Turkish friend as evidence and saying that I've got a Turkish

206
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,480
 friend who's never worn sunglasses and his eyes are okay.

207
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,200
 So explain that, which I found difficult.

208
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,560
 I cannot, I can't explain that.

209
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,080
 So he had a one person case study.

210
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:53,200
 Yeah, he just called up, he called up and he goes, I've got one for you.

211
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,360
 I've got a Turkish mate, never worn sunglasses and his eyes are totally fine.

212
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
 Explain that.

213
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,640
 Did he believe it was tied to his friend being Turkish?

214
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,360
 Was that part of the deal?

215
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,800
 Did the Turkish have heartier eyeballs?

216
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,200
 He did refer to him as a Turk at least a dozen times in the question.

217
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:24,280
 I don't know why I was so focused on this friend is a quote unquote Turk.

218
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,200
 How long have you been working on the book?

219
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,760
 So the book took us about 12 months to write.

220
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:36,960
 God, I have to say writing a book is not an enjoyable process.

221
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,600
 Many people refer to it as like, like, like, like in like surgical ways, like it was like

222
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,220
 losing a limb or like, like they basically just all talk.

223
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,600
 Most authors talk about writing a book as if it's torture.

224
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
 Yeah.

225
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
 Yeah.

226
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,640
 I would say it was, I would say it was like losing every limb and then getting pushed down

227
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:01,360
 a hill and trying to keep your, keep your balance.

228
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,280
 It was, it was just trying to find the time to write a book and then, you know, you've

229
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,600
 got to, you need a lot of intense time.

230
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,520
 You can't write 30 minutes of a book.

231
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,600
 You've got to sit down and get into it and, and figure out how you're going to present

232
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
 it.

233
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,480
 And Matt and I aren't writers.

234
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,000
 So we have to learn how to write during this process.

235
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 We're academics.

236
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,700
 We know how to write academic papers, but to write something that is fun and enjoyable

237
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,480
 for everybody to read was not easy.

238
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,160
 Now Paul helped you a little bit with, with, with jokes, is that right?

239
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,640
 Yeah, so we're writing a second book at the moment and Paul, which is going to be A to

240
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,280
 Z of diseases and Paul is helping us punch it up.

241
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:49,000
 So we're throwing him some of our draft chapters and he's sending back some of his, so, you

242
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,800
 know, he's got some very good, very funny quips, but he's also got his typical obscure,

243
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,520
 you know, metal lyrics from a band that nobody's ever heard of.

244
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,240
 We might not necessarily keep that particular reference.

245
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,240
 That's your mistake.

246
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,240
 That's good.

247
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,240
 I actually wanted you to talk to you about Paul when he wasn't on air and then you did.

248
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,240
 So it's good.

249
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,640
 This is, this is what now he's coming back.

250
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:24,880
 No, no, he's been, Paul has been fantastic.

251
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,880
 Which is definitely all that was said.

252
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,600
 Dr. Mike said that you've, you're, you're, you're, uh, you're doing some additional writing

253
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,360
 for A to Z diseases.

254
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,960
 I am working on some, uh, punch up, uh, editing for, uh, the chapters.

255
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,960
 Yeah.

256
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,960
 It's been a lot.

257
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,960
 How do you think that's going?

258
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,960
 I think it's going great.

259
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,280
 I think it's going great.

260
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:50,680
 Um, I mean, I can only say they've been very kind, uh, in their responses to my, uh, silly

261
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,680
 stuff.

262
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,680
 You've been fantastic.

263
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,680
 So all has been silly.

264
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,680
 Yeah.

265
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,680
 Absolutely fantastic.

266
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,680
 It's been great.

267
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,680
 It's been wonderful.

268
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,920
 Uh, I can, what, what's fun for me is having this, this, uh, opportunity with Dr. Mike

269
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,680
 allows me to now proudly say I am juggling basically four jobs at once, which is awesome.

270
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,560
 Uh, welcome to America 2025.

271
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:17,880
 Well, you've been, it's, it's been super helpful for us.

272
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,240
 Um, you know, Matt and I, we think we're funny.

273
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,680
 We're by no means funny and when we get into that mindset of writing something about the

274
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,920
 body, we tend to lose, I'm worried that we lose humor because we're trying to get facts

275
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,880
 and you're pulling us back in with the humor, which is brilliant.

276
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,840
 Uh, it's been, it's been really fascinating for me.

277
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,100
 I'm learning a ton of stuff.

278
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,040
 This latest chapter that you just sent me, can I speak on that at all?

279
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,520
 Yeah, absolutely.

280
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,940
 So it's all about the dancing sickness, which I am actually familiar with.

281
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:54,620
 So what I'll do is Michael send me the stuff and I'll, I'll read it and then I'll just

282
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,680
 let it go for a day or two and let it percolate and then come back to it.

283
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,760
 Um, but yeah, the, the dancing sickness, I don't know if you guys are familiar with this,

284
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,320
 but it was a, uh, mold in the bread.

285
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,320
 You remember this Jacob?

286
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,400
 Well, it's shaking like you got the St. Vitus dance.

287
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,400
 That was it.

288
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
 It's the same thing.

289
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,300
 That's exactly the town that it happened in.

290
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,880
 And so, yeah, people, uh, people got affected by this and they've just danced themselves

291
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
 to death.

292
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:28,960
 Uh, many people did because it gave them these weird, uh, brain conditions from ingesting

293
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,860
 this bad mold that came from, what kind of grain was it?

294
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,860
 Mike?

295
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,760
 Oh, that's a good question.

296
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,760
 I can't remember.

297
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,240
 I think it was oat grain.

298
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,240
 I'm actually wrong.

299
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,240
 Someone should write a book about this.

300
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,240
 Oh yeah.

301
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,840
 I think it, I think it was oat grain.

302
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,080
 But anyway, it was moldy and that's what it was.

303
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,920
 And it caused people to get sick.

304
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,920
 Nobody knew what it was.

305
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,640
 You know, of course everybody thought it was possession or some kind of, or something wrong

306
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:59,480
 with the water, a million different theories came up, but then it spread to a bunch of

307
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,480
 different places.

308
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,200
 It's crazy, but they finally figured it out.

309
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
 Thank God.

310
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,480
 Our FDA is rolling back protections on shit so we can get this dancing going again.

311
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,480
 That's right.

312
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,800
 You that, that is a bit frightening.

313
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:20,360
 A bit point because I mean, well, we said, we said Paul, a chapter on lead poisoning

314
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:27,020
 and the potential link between lead poisoning and mass murders, you know, the way things

315
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,920
 can become contaminated quite easily.

316
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,000
 And without oversight, that can lead to a huge amount of issues.

317
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,600
 I think one of my favorite chapters with the new book that Paul's helping us with at the

318
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:46,960
 moment, um, is, uh, a disease called Monday disease in which, so, uh, Alfred Nobel, I've

319
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,200
 got a case of the Monday, not you think, but this is awful.

320
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:58,320
 Yeah, it's a, so Alfred Nobel, he basically created nitroglycerin, the explosive and felt

321
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,140
 bad for the amount of lives he potentially has lost because of that.

322
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:06,840
 So he decided to put money into, you know, the Nobel peace prize and so forth.

323
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:13,560
 And that's where that's gone from there, but, uh, nitroglycerin and, and, uh, nitro or

324
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:19,840
 nitrous oxide, it, nitrous oxide is a vasodilator tells you blood vessels to relax, but very

325
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,220
 chemically similar to the explosive and the people that were working in the factories

326
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:29,800
 making the explosives were exposed to this chemical and it would dilate or relax their

327
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
 blood vessels.

328
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,840
 Very easily absorbed through the skin.

329
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,840
 Exactly.

330
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,880
 And the, when you get a headache or a migraine, that's because your blood vessels are suddenly

331
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,520
 relaxing too quickly.

332
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,800
 And so they'll get headaches coming back to work on Monday, but because it relaxed their

333
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,520
 blood vessels, those who had heart disease got relief while they're at work because their

334
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,160
 blood vessels were relaxed.

335
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,640
 And then they'll finish work on a Friday, go home for the weekend, start to get chest

336
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,960
 pain over the weekend again, potentially suffer angina or even heart attacks and then come

337
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,140
 back to work on the Monday and then get the headaches all over again.

338
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:12,600
 And that was the Monday disease, but the Monday disease was a temporary relief for people

339
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,920
 with a heart condition.

340
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,920
 Yeah.

341
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,920
 Exactly.

342
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,920
 Right.

343
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,920
 Yeah.

344
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,920
 And that was through that.

345
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:26,160
 They discovered how that could be utilized for the alleviation of vein type problems in

346
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,160
 the body.

347
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:33,520
 That happened to me when I had that scary incident before I was put on blood pressure

348
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,880
 medication where I came in to get it.

349
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,880
 Oh, really?

350
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,880
 I came in to just get it.

351
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,880
 What happened?

352
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:45,280
 I came in, I talked about this a long time ago on the show, this was, I went in to get

353
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,720
 a sign-off because I was going to get sinus surgery to remove polyps from my nose, which

354
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,680
 I still never had.

355
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,680
 And my book-

356
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,880
 You never had the polyps or you never had the surgery?

357
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
 I never had the surgery.

358
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,880
 Okay.

359
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,080
 No, I was convinced by a stage hypnotistic that I had nose polyps and he never snapped

360
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,080
 his fingers.

361
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,080
 That's horrible.

362
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,080
 Anthony Cools played a terrible prank on Matt Nottole.

363
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,920
 Anthony Cools, what a bastard.

364
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
 Anthony Cools.

365
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
 Come on, man.

366
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:21,420
 Give me back my sinus is Cools, uncool Cools.

367
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:25,840
 My blood pressure was through the roof and they literally were like, I was like, so I

368
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,840
 can't get surgery tomorrow?

369
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,240
 You can't leave this office.

370
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:35,640
 And I was like, oh, and they took a big nitroglycerin, I don't know, they took a big clear gel and

371
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,960
 just put it right on my all across my chest.

372
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,800
 And it was awesome.

373
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,240
 And I was like, I, cause I take pills now to keep it regulated, but that gel thing was

374
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,240
 so cool.

375
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,600
 I was like, I would like to do the gel, but apparently it's like, it's like, you can't

376
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,600
 control it or whatever.

377
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
 Yes.

378
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
 It's only done.

379
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,040
 It's hard to get dosage right when you're smothering someone in a gel.

380
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:05,360
 Say it again, but slower, Dr. Mike.

381
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,040
 But that's exactly what happened with the, with the stuff they've, you know, they found

382
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:16,800
 all these different uses for this, for this heart condition medicine and they had a controlled

383
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:23,280
 test, a controlled experiment with these miners who were coming in and they kept giving all

384
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:29,320
 these miners these blood pressure, no, they were actually in the hole digging miners,

385
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,320
 still not children.

386
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
 Cause that's coming back into America as well.

387
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,480
 We're letting 12 and 14 year olds dig holes.

388
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,480
 No, they're smaller.

389
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,320
 You don't have to dig as big a hole.

390
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,320
 You're right.

391
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,320
 And Hey, they haven't lived a life.

392
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,320
 They don't care.

393
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,320
 Exactly.

394
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,320
 Yeah.

395
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,320
 They don't count.

396
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:48,840
 So, but all these miners come in and finally, after months of these tests, one guy goes,

397
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:55,920
 Hey, uh, I don't know if this is anything, but I had a raging boner at night.

398
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,080
 And the other guy was like, Oh, well yeah, me too.

399
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,080
 Yeah.

400
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,080
 I did also.

401
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,080
 Yeah.

402
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,080
 Yeah.

403
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,080
 We all had raging boners all the time.

404
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,560
 And so finally they go, Oh, fuck.

405
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,600
 Now we can make some money.

406
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
 That's how they discovered.

407
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
 That's how they discovered.

408
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
 Yeah.

409
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
 It's amazing.

410
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:21,080
 I have a boner for over four hours last night, but they're so embarrassed to even talk about

411
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,080
 it.

412
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,080
 They almost missed it.

413
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,080
 God damn it.

414
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,080
 We need sex ed everywhere.

415
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,080
 God damn it.

416
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,080
 No way.

417
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,560
 I looked up, uh, Dr. Mike, I looked up the St. Vitus dance and this one's talking about

418
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:36,080
 being a, a neurological disorder, not that was, that was thought to be caused by mold

419
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,080
 and it's something else.

420
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,080
 Is that something different?

421
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,860
 Yeah, there's, there's another condition, which is St. Vitus disease, um, which is a

422
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,320
 neurological and it affects the way that the body moves.

423
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:52,120
 So the person moves rhythmically because of the way that the motor system is being affected.

424
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,120
 So that's a different condition.

425
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,560
 Oh, but that's not, that's not like a life threatening disease.

426
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,560
 Yeah.

427
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,120
 Richard in the chat was mentioning it was ergot.

428
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,520
 That was the specific mold that caused the problem.

429
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,520
 Oh, gotcha.

430
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,520
 Yeah.

431
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,520
 Oh, neat.

432
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:11,080
 Ergot the rhythm, ergot the music, ergot my brain exploding on the floor.

433
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,080
 Yeah.

434
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,720
 Uh, I'll tell you what else ergot and that is the following sponsor.

435
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,360
 Today's show is brought to you by, of course, Dr. Mike and Dr. Matt's book, the body A

436
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,120
 to Z, which you can get somewhere.

437
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,160
 Yep.

438
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,160
 And it's correct.

439
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,160
 You can't get it somewhere.

440
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,720
 It's your local Walden books.

441
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,720
 Is it available in America yet or no?

442
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,880
 Well, I, I don't know if you guys know this, but there's these things called tariffs that

443
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,520
 are happening in the U S but is it affecting the economy at all?

444
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:48,280
 Um, well, I don't know again, Matt, you might not be aware, but, um, yes, significantly.

445
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:54,680
 Um, and it's affecting my book sales in the U S because shock it costs if somebody in

446
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,880
 the U S, uh, well, if my publisher wanted to make the book and sell it in the U S people

447
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,440
 would have to pay about 60 U S dollars for the book.

448
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,760
 And my book's not worth 60.

449
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,880
 What is your MSRP on that bad boy?

450
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,480
 What is it normally going for?

451
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:17,520
 Uh, well in Australia, I think what Paul's trying to ask is how much for raw book.

452
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,520
 Right.

453
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,840
 I'll ask you for raw book.

454
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,040
 I'll rule book you Paul.

455
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,040
 Okay.

456
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,040
 Don't worry about that.

457
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,040
 I appreciate it.

458
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:33,160
 You can get it in Australia for $37, uh, which is Australia, which is a little more three,

459
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,720
 three U S dollars probably.

460
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:43,680
 No, but yeah, but, but you can order it, uh, and they can ship it to the U S through readings.

461
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,760
 It's, it's, it's a publisher, a distributor called readings and they will ship it to you

462
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,800
 or you can get it as a Kindle through the, uh, U S Amazon.

463
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
 Yeah.

464
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,800
 Okay.

465
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
 Okay.

466
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
 Yeah.

467
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
 So you can get it through readings.

468
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
 All right.

469
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
 Yeah.

470
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,360
 The body, A to Z, uh, Dr. Matt and Dr. Mike, uh, they are the authors on there and yeah,

471
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,160
 it's on Amazon, uh, for a Kindle and get the physical one in all those ways.

472
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:12,160
 Also $37 Australia is about $24 U S there you go.

473
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,600
 And now I've answered all the questions that today's show is also brought to you by the

474
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,480
 hemorrhoid razor, a razor to cut your hemorrhoids.

475
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,880
 That's from NOLA in 2021.

476
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,920
 I'm glad there's a doctor present tells us about how well this works, the hemorrhoid

477
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,920
 razor.

478
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,920
 Yeah.

479
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,920
 What's going on?

480
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,280
 I'm the hemorrhoid razor cutter.

481
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,280
 That's right.

482
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:38,080
 Looks like you've got a polyp on your bottom bud.

483
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,320
 Time for the hemorrhoid razor.

484
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,380
 This sharp one's going to slice you clean.

485
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:49,760
 Come on over, spread those cheeky weakies and let me get a slice in.

486
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,320
 I've cut you to the quick, I have slippery slice.

487
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:00,920
 No preparation needed for this H E double hockey sticks.

488
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,920
 That's right.

489
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:07,000
 I'm taking you to hell ass first with my hemorrhoid razor.

490
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,480
 It's a simple slice right around your colon, but just before it, your GI will never be

491
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,140
 the same.

492
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:22,480
 Look here, when you clench that sphincter, I'm going to make it pinkter when I slice

493
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,560
 with my hemorrhoid razor, a slicey slice.

494
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:33,520
 Your little chocolate starfish better make its last wish as I come in with my hemorrhoid

495
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,720
 razor.

496
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:46,080
 Your eye of Sauron is going to be a power on blood when I get my hemorrhoid razor, slicey

497
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,120
 slice.

498
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,760
 Please do not shit for four to six weeks after the use of the hemorrhoid razor.

499
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,760
 Smart.

500
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,000
 Enter hate scoops at checkout.

501
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,680
 So Dr. Mike, let's talk hemorrhoids for a second.

502
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,560
 There are several different causes, right?

503
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,920
 What's the ultimate?

504
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,920
 Let's describe.

505
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,440
 What is the hemorrhoid?

506
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,720
 So there are veins that sit around the anus and they can basically enlarge.

507
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,720
 Because they're lazy and don't want to get a job?

508
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,000
 My hemorrhoids sit around the anus all day.

509
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,480
 They sit around the anus all day.

510
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:35,400
 And when they get larger, they can be facial.

511
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,400
 So it's an enlarge.

512
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,520
 And why should we razor blade them?

513
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:45,760
 You know what, I've been a listener for 10 years and I had to be part of the episode

514
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:52,120
 where it was like Gio said, it's the worst, most disturbing ad I've heard so far.

515
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:57,040
 Putting a razor blade to a hemorrhoid makes me feel sick.

516
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:00,120
 That would do a lot of damage.

517
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,400
 That would really not help, right?

518
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,880
 That would exacerbate the problem.

519
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,480
 I mean, if you think about how much blood can come from a hemorrhoid just from excretion.

520
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,480
 And I do.

521
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,480
 Right.

522
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,480
 And I do often.

523
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,480
 Yeah.

524
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,480
 And Jacob often does.

525
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,480
 Putting a razor blade to it wouldn't be good.

526
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,720
 I mean, some of the ways they get rid of it, banded surgery.

527
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,360
 So they banded up to get rid of a sheep's tail.

528
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,360
 Oh my God.

529
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,560
 That's got to be a big hemorrhoid.

530
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,560
 Yeah.

531
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
 Yeah.

532
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,200
 Well, we'll have challenge accepted, Paul external.

533
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,200
 Okay.

534
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,200
 All right.

535
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,840
 Ben, have you ever met anyone with a prehensile hemorrhoid?

536
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,840
 Use it to climb a tree.

537
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:44,080
 When I'm scared, I could hang from a branch by my hemorrhoid.

538
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,920
 Oh my God.

539
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:52,120
 Um, there's, there's a new way that they're doing it, which is they sonicate it.

540
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:57,840
 They actually use sound and what the sound does is I actually don't know what the mechanism

541
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,840
 is.

542
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:04,280
 I don't know if many of the, um, it's a guided by voices album.

543
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,280
 Look man.

544
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,080
 Is that just a blast speaker?

545
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,480
 Not a lot of hemorrhoids here.

546
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,480
 So thank you.

547
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,480
 That's right.

548
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,480
 That's right.

549
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,120
 Now we have a very specific, uh, follow up coming from a listener here, Jacob.

550
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,120
 Can you also highlight, uh, Jessica Jane Peterson, please?

551
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,120
 Uh, Jessica Jane is in chat there.

552
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,200
 Oh, that's a, where is J, where is J. J. Oh, there she is.

553
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,800
 Hey, JJ's here.

554
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,800
 Hey.

555
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:32,200
 I was trying to get JJ to join us in our first episode, but she's here for the second episode

556
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,760
 and she just texted me with a question that has to go directly to Dr. Mike.

557
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,760
 Do you want to ask her?

558
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,760
 Ah, good.

559
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,680
 You know, I feel like, okay, I should say I escaped from a straight jacket eight times

560
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,600
 a week, hanging upside down on 35 feet in the air.

561
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,360
 But if you know about straight jackets, which I'm sure you do, you know, it has that special

562
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,360
 crop strap.

563
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,480
 Can that strap cause these hemorrhoids?

564
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,320
 So how is this strap wrapped around?

565
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,160
 Very tightly around the back.

566
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,760
 But then I'm hanging upside down.

567
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:09,540
 I was like, it hasn't happened yet, but I'm wondering if like there's preventative acts

568
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,520
 to prevent the hemorrhoids that could be caused by this straight jacket.

569
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,400
 Do you think you need to do like a water tank?

570
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
 Is it like a G-string bungee?

571
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
 Okay.

572
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,400
 It is.

573
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:26,520
 It is like a G-string bungee made of canvas through Spanx with fishnet.

574
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,040
 I think your hemorrhoids are safe.

575
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:33,820
 You think the Spanx and the fishnets probably do enough cushioning to prevent the...

576
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:38,400
 There's no preventative measures that I need to take because I just, this sounds terrifying.

577
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,040
 I did not know they fled.

578
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,760
 I didn't know any of these things.

579
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,760
 I texted Matt.

580
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,400
 I'm like, I am learning so much about hemorrhoids.

581
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,400
 My Lord.

582
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,680
 So the fact that you're upside down means that the pressure is probably reduced in that

583
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:56,000
 area and it's all going to your brain, or at least going to your head.

584
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 Sorry.

585
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,120
 Whereas my tightwired act where I just taint myself across, where I just keep shaking my

586
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:07,120
 legs until I inch myself across, that's, that's maybe a bad idea.

587
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,000
 Keep going, Matt.

588
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Keep doing it.

589
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,200
 Matt's raking his asshole across a tightrope.

590
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,000
 Look, man, it's the only way Popov will let me into his pet circus.

591
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,040
 So I have to do that act.

592
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:27,440
 Damn you, Anthony Cools.

593
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,320
 So when, when can we expect eighth, eighth, the diseases A through Z, do you expect it

594
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,840
 to sell more or less than the body A through Z?

595
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:42,460
 Oh, I, I think the diseases A to Z is going to be really fun because Paul's helping us

596
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,460
 punch this up.

597
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:47,040
 I think it's also going to be very funny.

598
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,960
 It's coming out same time as this book.

599
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:55,040
 So this time next year, a Christmas book, I just got to get it done by, we've got to

600
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,040
 get it done.

601
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,040
 Paul by June.

602
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,040
 Oh, easy peasy.

603
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,040
 Yeah.

604
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,040
 Cool.

605
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,040
 I'm stepping it up.

606
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,040
 Paul will not be done by June.

607
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,040
 No, I'm going to tell you that right now.

608
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,040
 He's killing it.

609
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,040
 He's killing it.

610
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
 We send it to him.

611
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,040
 He's, he's, he's back in a couple of days.

612
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
 He's killing it.

613
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,040
 I'm trying to get faster on it now.

614
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,040
 Yeah.

615
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,720
 But I have a much more, a much more full schedule.

616
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,200
 So that allows me more funny.

617
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,520
 I allocate time better now.

618
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,520
 So it's good.

619
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,520
 Well, thanks.

620
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,440
 And where do you want to send people, Dr. Mike to check out where your stuff is?

621
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,880
 If you, I think go to our YouTube page, Dr. Matt and Dr. Mike, have a look, there's videos

622
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,480
 there for everybody or our podcast.

623
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,400
 And yeah, if you want to have considered buying the book, go for it.

624
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,800
 Otherwise hit us a subscribe and a, and a like, and I'll be happy.

625
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,800
 All right.

626
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,800
 Well, thanks for coming.

627
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,800
 Bye.

628
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,800
 Thanks for waking up early.

629
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,280
 You woke up at like four o'clock in the morning to be on the show at your time.

630
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,280
 So thank you.

631
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,280
 Appreciate it.

632
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,280
 I did, but it's all good.

633
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,280
 All good.

634
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,280
 Thank you guys.

635
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:57,840
 It's like I said, I've been a listener for a decade now and I continue to be a listener.

636
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,080
 Please, please clear up any of anything we misquote medically.

637
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,040
 Please always, always fact check us.

638
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,040
 I'll be too busy if I did that.

639
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:13,680
 And I can tell you, honestly, the new book that we're working on is fascinating.

640
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,480
 And I'm sure eight is ed with the body is just as fascinating.

641
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,380
 You're going to learn a ton.

642
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,360
 So check it out, give it a read.

643
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,640
 I've already learned a ton of stuff just in my editing of this new book.

644
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,480
 So I can't wait to pick up the other one, Paul.

645
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,760
 Bad news is that now you have to become a doctor by June as well.

646
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,720
 You have to also be good news, good news, Matt.

647
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,040
 Those kinds of degrees in the States are now not professional any longer.

648
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,360
 So I'm technically a doctor already.

649
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,120
 I'm technically a doctor.

650
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,880
 Come at me, bro.

651
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,920
 I've only seen the reactions to this.

652
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,160
 I don't know the core event that happened that has caused us to talk about medicine

653
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,160
 not being professional.

654
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,760
 I can tell you what's going on.

655
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,640
 You want me to break it down for you?

656
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,600
 The way they're doing this bullshit, because it's always some bullshit loophole.

657
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:10,880
 What they're doing is they're using this formula wherein if a degree's income, if when you

658
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,840
 graduate college, the money you make from your income is not significantly greater than

659
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:22,840
 what a high school graduate would make, then it is rendered as though it is null and void

660
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,840
 beyond a high school diploma.

661
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,360
 By who?

662
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,360
 Right.

663
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,360
 By who?

664
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,360
 Who?

665
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,360
 What are you saying?

666
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,960
 Who renders it null and void?

667
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,760
 What's left of the goddamn Department of Education that's being systematically dismantled.

668
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,760
 Okay.

669
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:46,520
 So what they're saying is that degrees that do not provide a significant monetary payout

670
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:53,520
 that can be compared to the money that a high school graduate makes in its first year.

671
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,800
 Now that does not take into account that as you go through the ranks of these things,

672
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,800
 you make more money.

673
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,040
 And of course, especially with nurses and internships and that kind of thing, it is

674
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,640
 a gradual progression, especially with education.

675
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,680
 A lot of that early education is being pulled out from this stuff too because it takes a

676
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:14,520
 little while to get your feet under you and make actual money and tenuring and all that

677
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,720
 kind of thing.

678
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:22,200
 So that's the loophole that they're using to undermine many of these degrees as being

679
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:28,100
 anything more than what would essentially be a high school diploma equivalence.

680
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:33,000
 And so they're labeling them as unprofessional or nonprofessional through that loophole.

681
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 And what does that mean?

682
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,080
 Does that mean the government doesn't have to fund things?

683
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,080
 Does that mean the government doesn't have to do things?

684
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,320
 It means that you don't get recognized as professional.

685
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:46,300
 The biggest thing about it, and shock of all, this giant pedophile ring is deciding that

686
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:52,920
 these specific careers that also happen to be mandatory reporting careers, which means

687
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:58,320
 that if they are informed of any kind of sexual abuse from a minor, they have to report it

688
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,600
 to the authorities.

689
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,780
 These are also being undercut as nonprofessionals anymore.

690
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,840
 So that's going away too.

691
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,840
 What do you know?

692
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,020
 Shock and surprise.

693
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:12,840
 So that's what's really at the heart of it is making it so it's harder for crimes against

694
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:17,880
 children to be systematically reported and cataloged.

695
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:24,320
 And guess what is not being systematically eradicated through this? Degrees such as fucking

696
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:32,560
 religious studies, which are not having to be reporting because that's where it's happening.

697
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:38,360
 I'll tell you what else they're not paying attention to, the body A to Z. You should

698
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,360
 be paying attention to it.

699
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,360
 You should be paying attention to that.

700
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,360
 Dr. Wright, can we move to Australia, please?

701
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,360
 I know, right?

702
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,360
 Do you have room?

703
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:50,040
 Come to Australia. I've been trying to get the boys to Australia for a long time and

704
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,040
 they refuse.

705
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,040
 No, we want to go.

706
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,040
 We want to go.

707
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,040
 We want to go.

708
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:58,000
 At this point, I think all of our visas would be flagged, but what are you going to do?

709
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 Who the fuck knows?

710
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 Arms wide open.

711
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 Arms wide open.

712
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 Well, thank you, Dr. Mike.

713
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 Thank you, Dr. Mike.

714
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 Thanks for your time, Dr. Mike.

715
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 Appreciate it, man.

716
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 Thank you all.

717
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 Have a great day.

718
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 You too, buddy.

719
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 Hey, you too, buddy.

720
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 You rock, dude.

721
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,720
 I'll tell you who else is punching up Dr. Mike's next book, and that's the following

722
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,640
 sponsor.

723
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:25,920
 Today is brought to you by 19th Deck Handjobs from Captain Scooper in 2025.

724
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,480
 That's 19th Deck Handjobs because sometimes I'm tired of just walking up there.

725
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:40,200
 Well, I was born one day shuffling spades, I finally decided to change up trades.

726
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:46,760
 I went ahead and I jacked off 18 dudes, and the next one showed up, he was already nudes.

727
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,080
 You got 19 decks.

728
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,080
 What do you get?

729
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,000
 A whole bunch of slop and stuff on your neck.

730
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,480
 You can't escape all the jizz that comes and goes.

731
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:04,240
 I owe my soul to these jacked off hoes.

732
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,000
 Well after 19, I thought, where do I go?

733
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,560
 I went back out and found another hoe.

734
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:16,200
 Number 20 came and number 20 went, but number 21 was already spent.

735
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,600
 You jacked 19 decks, what do you get?

736
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:25,440
 Your face covered in jizz and soaking wet, St. Peter, don't you call me unless you are.

737
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:32,920
 The actual St. Peter who has Peters by far, yeah, give me those St. Peters.

738
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,760
 And her hate scoops checked out.

739
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,760
 There you go.

740
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:45,600
 Oh, you know what that horn means, Matt Dolly is heading up to old 19.

741
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,360
 I can only listen to books on tape for so long.

742
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,480
 I'm about to head out to the-

743
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,480
 Just get forward.

744
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,880
 Yeah, right after Thanksgiving, I head back out to the old Sun Princess, miss the old

745
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,880
 gal.

746
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,520
 How long are you going to be out?

747
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,920
 Just a week, which is good.

748
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,400
 Jessica Jane, are you at sea?

749
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,400
 Yeah, I think so.

750
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,440
 I joined the Disney Destiny in, oh God, in three days and I still have to write two more

751
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,440
 routines.

752
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,440
 Crap.

753
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,320
 They work you hard on that ship.

754
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,880
 But then I go to Star Princess.

755
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,960
 So wait, when are you on Sun?

756
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:31,080
 I'm on the Sun in December and then I don't go to the Star until March and then I'm on

757
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,280
 the Star in May and June.

758
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,280
 Okay.

759
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,160
 Well, you don't know whether you're booked then there or are you already booked out?

760
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,600
 Disney's got stuff till like 20 to 27 because they don't want me to have a life.

761
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,720
 So they own me.

762
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,240
 I am owned by the mouse.

763
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:54,720
 I'm even on the Star in August, I'm on the Star a ton but I won't run into you, you won't

764
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,720
 get booked.

765
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,040
 Because Jessica Jane gets booked as a stage magician, I get booked in Little Magic Castle

766
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,040
 Experience so I could be on this ship.

767
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,520
 And then we can do a show together in the Pavilion thing.

768
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,520
 Yeah.

769
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,520
 No, I do have two Star Princess dates in March.

770
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,520
 So we'll see.

771
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,520
 Oh, good.

772
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,520
 Yeah.

773
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,520
 Okay.

774
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,520
 Yay.

775
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,520
 I miss you guys though.

776
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,520
 Hi, JJ.

777
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:21,920
 You were supposed to come to ScoopFest and you bailed on it because we were working on

778
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,920
 a project together.

779
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,920
 I was going to say, yeah.

780
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,920
 Yeah.

781
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,360
 We need you to block out some dates on the next ScoopFest.

782
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,360
 So yeah.

783
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,360
 Yes.

784
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,360
 Yes, we can, JJ.

785
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,320
 We can definitely talk about whose fault that was.

786
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,320
 Vinnie Grasso.

787
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,320
 Can we talk about Vinnie Grasso?

788
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,240
 Fuckin' Vinnie Grasso.

789
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,240
 Yup.

790
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,240
 Yup.

791
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:45,880
 Because who got sent to the Virgin Cruise thing because Matt wasn't available and Mike

792
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,880
 had what?

793
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,520
 His daughter's dance recital or something and Vinnie's like, "I don't want to do it,

794
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,520
 so send JJ."

795
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,520
 That's right.

796
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,520
 That's right.

797
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,160
 But we missed you.

798
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,160
 You recently-

799
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,160
 Vinnie came by though.

800
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,160
 Vinnie came by ScoopFest.

801
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,160
 He was there for all of it.

802
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,160
 He came by and really hung out.

803
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,160
 Yeah.

804
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,160
 Yeah.

805
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,160
 He came by and hung out for a lot of ScoopFest.

806
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,160
 Are you frickin' kidding me?

807
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,160
 Vinnie went to ScoopFest?

808
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,160
 You're frickin' kidding me.

809
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,160
 Matt Foster.

810
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,160
 I knew that'd make her mad.

811
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:17,820
 I believe Jacob is kidding you.

812
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,820
 I believe he's kidding you.

813
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,820
 Vinnie was not kidding.

814
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,820
 Oh, he is kidding.

815
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,820
 I was so mad.

816
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,820
 Vinnie was in Italy.

817
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,200
 That's why you had to go on.

818
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,200
 Oh, okay.

819
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,200
 It was almost not available.

820
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,200
 I can't accept that.

821
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,200
 Yeah.

822
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:32,320
 You weren't at ScoopFest because I was supposed to be on the ship during ScoopFest and I said

823
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,200
 no because of ScoopFest, so you were there.

824
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,200
 JJ, Vinnie-

825
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,200
 But I was there in spirit, just a lot taller.

826
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:47,440
 You talking about Michael Ellsroth dressing up like you for the ScoopFest?

827
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,720
 Can we please, for the next ScoopFest, Mike, can we wear the exact same outfit and walk

828
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,800
 around together arm in arm?

829
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,560
 It would make me so happy.

830
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,960
 You do not need to ask Ellsroth twice to do an elaborate bit.

831
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,960
 I'll tell you that much later.

832
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,520
 No, he will very quickly commit to that.

833
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,520
 He'll run with it.

834
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,520
 Yeah.

835
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,320
 We'll do it immediately.

836
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,320
 So we were-

837
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,320
 We should both be mermaids.

838
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,320
 Oh my God.

839
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,320
 Wait a minute.

840
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,320
 He was there.

841
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,320
 He was there.

842
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,320
 Oh my God.

843
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,320
 I'll misremember.

844
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,320
 That bastard.

845
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,320
 That bastard.

846
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,320
 I'm texting him.

847
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,320
 You were at ScoopFest?

848
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,320
 You told me that you were in Italy.

849
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,320
 I just saw a picture of you at ScoopFest.

850
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,320
 I was supposed to go to the ship.

851
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:43,440
 To do the Virgin gig, so let's talk about that, Vitti Grasso.

852
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,000
 I love it.

853
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 Drama.

854
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,760
 I'm just there to ruin JJ and Vitti's relationship.

855
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,760
 I believe in truth.

856
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,200
 I believe he came by for about five minutes one day.

857
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,440
 I think he came through on his way to the airport.

858
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,120
 He was there just in time to grab a Fez and run.

859
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,120
 Yeah.

860
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,120
 Okay.

861
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,120
 Okay.

862
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,600
 We got to get you a Fez, JJ.

863
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,720
 Oh, I would love a Fez.

864
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,720
 Yeah, yeah.

865
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,720
 That would be awesome.

866
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,440
 JJ is now our neighbor, Jacob.

867
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,440
 I knew you were in town.

868
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,440
 Where are you?

869
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,440
 I'm on Bracken.

870
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,320
 So I'm really close to the downtown arts district area.

871
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,320
 Oh, wow.

872
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,440
 I think I'm a 10 minute walk from the Haunted Museum.

873
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,440
 Oh, how nice.

874
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,440
 Have you been yet?

875
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,480
 No, I have not.

876
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,640
 That was one of my gigs.

877
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,360
 I worked at the Haunted Museum.

878
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,360
 Really?

879
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,360
 Yes.

880
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,920
 Before they opened and during the opening months.

881
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,800
 I was there for just about three months.

882
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,400
 Yeah, Vitti Grasso got Paul the job there.

883
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,960
 Vitti got everybody who he really liked jobs at the Haunted Museum.

884
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,960
 Motherfucker.

885
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,960
 He did not.

886
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,960
 I got that job myself.

887
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,960
 No, but I worked with Zach.

888
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:56,520
 I helped write a lot of the pattern that the guides use throughout the entire museum and

889
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,040
 I worked there for several months.

890
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,720
 I was there for, we had to postpone our opening because October 1 happened.

891
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,960
 So the next Monday we were going to open and we had to postpone it till Tuesday because

892
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,960
 it was too crazy.

893
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,960
 We had to just chill.

894
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,960
 Mass shooting in Las Vegas.

895
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,120
 That's what October 1 is.

896
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:16,680
 So then I was there for Friday the 13th and for Halloween.

897
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,600
 And it was in fucking Sane.

898
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,680
 Yeah, Halloween was nuts.

899
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,600
 We had some crazy shit go down during Halloween.

900
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:30,960
 Yeah, I never had anything too crazy happen to myself, but it's an interesting place at

901
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,480
 the least to check out.

902
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,920
 There's a lot of really cool stuff to see.

903
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,920
 So yeah.

904
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,600
 Did you ever have any moments though where you got freaked out?

905
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:41,520
 Well, I had to actually, I actually had to go turn off lights at the end of the night

906
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,160
 because I was like a mid-level manager type.

907
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,800
 So I did always say hi and bye to Peggy, Peggy the doll.

908
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,240
 So I didn't even, I didn't even fuck with that.

909
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,760
 The only weird thing, there was a couple of weird things.

910
00:43:53,760 --> 00:44:00,260
 There was a latch on this gate that opens and closes for the basement.

911
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,720
 And I would constantly have to relatch that basement gate.

912
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,920
 It was all, that latch was always coming loose.

913
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:12,000
 And then upstairs in the room that held the Dibbock box, which was right next to Peggy's

914
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 room.

915
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,180
 - That's the golf thing, right?

916
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,020
 - Yeah.

917
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:15,860
 - Dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip,

918
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,500
 dip it box, dip it, dip it, dip it, dip it, dip it box.

919
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,420
 - Which is basically based around the conjuring stuff.

920
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,540
 The dipping box room, I had to go in there

921
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,740
 to turn on lights one morning, and I went to try

922
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:30,220
 the door knob, and you know, did you ever grow up

923
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,120
 with siblings of any kind?

924
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,860
 - Yeah.

925
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,700
 - You remember how if your brother or sister

926
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:39,040
 was on the other side of a door holding that door closed,

927
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,620
 and you could kind of twist the knob,

928
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:43,220
 and you couldn't really, and you couldn't really,

929
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:45,260
 I felt that feeling.

930
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:48,660
 And I couldn't get the door to open,

931
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,700
 and I tried it again, and it was the same kind of thing,

932
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,280
 and I just had to let it go, and I just,

933
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,140
 I was like, okay, I'm going on.

934
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,280
 - It turns out Paul's brother was on the other side

935
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,260
 of that door holding it.

936
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,080
 - You never know.

937
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,220
 Those were the only really weird things that happened to me,

938
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,780
 but plenty of other stuff happened to people

939
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,940
 that were around, but a lot of it is

940
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,500
 because he doesn't let people have drinks in the place,

941
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,900
 and they all get dehydrated and pass out.

942
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,660
 That's really a lot of it, yeah.

943
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:16,500
 A lot of it is just people suffering from Vegas,

944
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,580
 and just passing out because it's a lot to take in.

945
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:21,860
 - You pass out saltines and espresso on your way in,

946
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,340
 and then you can't drink water.

947
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,180
 - Honestly, yeah.

948
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,900
 - That's a sprainy little salt.

949
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:29,120
 - Well, there's a lot of fog machines and stuff in there too,

950
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,660
 so that can affect people too, so yeah.

951
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:35,080
 - Can we have a scoop group visit to the museum?

952
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,020
 - An excursion to the museum would be really, really fun.

953
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:38,860
 - Yeah, yeah.

954
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,300
 - That would be really fun.

955
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,740
 I know somebody had contacted me from over there

956
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,820
 about some of my Houdini stuff,

957
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,780
 'cause I was like, well, I live close by,

958
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,820
 and it'd be safe there, but--

959
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:51,500
 - You should chat him up, drop my name.

960
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,100
 I mean, he'll remember me.

961
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:57,300
 And I left on good terms.

962
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:01,620
 They said, come back anytime, so it's all good, yeah.

963
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,300
 Bacon was his right-hand man while I was there.

964
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,220
 He might still be his right-hand man, I don't know.

965
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:10,140
 - Nah, I think Vinnie Grasso's just running the place now.

966
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,040
 - Could be.

967
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,040
 - Vinnie Grasso just texted back.

968
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,620
 He goes, I stopped by on the way to the airport

969
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,780
 to give Matt a magspied for Oscar.

970
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,820
 Nothing to discuss, Ms. Peterson.

971
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,660
 - Oh, boy.

972
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,260
 (laughing)

973
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,100
 Giving you the business.

974
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:26,940
 - Ms. Peterson.

975
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,180
 - Did you owe me a cell?

976
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:30,860
 - He was only there for two and a half days.

977
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:34,180
 - Yeah.

978
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:38,300
 But seriously, JJ, your routines would be a huge hit there.

979
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,940
 He is a mega circus fanatic.

980
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,820
 He has an entire area dedicated

981
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:46,460
 to classic circus memorabilia,

982
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:50,320
 and he has a giant circus diorama built out

983
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,540
 with little tiny pieces that move

984
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,420
 and little elephants that jump through hoops

985
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,260
 and stuff like that.

986
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,500
 - So he's a sideshow fan and stuff, too?

987
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,340
 - Big time. - 'Cause this shit

988
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,020
 I haven't-- - Big time into that.

989
00:46:59,020 --> 00:46:59,860
 - Oh my God.

990
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,660
 - So if you're right next door,

991
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,640
 you should absolutely stop by sometime,

992
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:06,580
 say, "Hey, if you got special events happening anytime,

993
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,700
 "I'd love to come by as a performer,"

994
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,900
 because he's always looking for that kind of stuff,

995
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,020
 and just a little more money in your pocket.

996
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:16,580
 - Some of the stuff I have here is hardcore,

997
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,660
 'cause I lived in Gibsonton, Florida,

998
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,900
 when we would winter with a sideshow.

999
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:25,140
 So I lived in the trailer outside Ward Hall,

1000
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,820
 the king of the sideshow's house.

1001
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:27,660
 - Holy shit.

1002
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:31,020
 - And he had all the stuff from the early 1900s.

1003
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,780
 I have jars of things where I don't even know what they are.

1004
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,740
 - You got pickled punks and shit back there.

1005
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:38,020
 - Oh, yeah, and I know where all the pickled punks

1006
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,900
 are buried in Gibsonton, Florida.

1007
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:40,740
 - Get the fuck out.

1008
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:44,540
 - Because basically, yeah, they made it illegal to--

1009
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:45,380
 - To have 'em.

1010
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:48,940
 - To put actual dead bodies on display,

1011
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:51,160
 and it used to be the flow off of the sideshow.

1012
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,660
 So you go through the sideshow, and at the end,

1013
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:55,300
 you pay an extra dollar to see what's behind the curtain,

1014
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:59,200
 and then they open it, and there's these babies in jars

1015
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,760
 that were real, and they would talk about,

1016
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,620
 you know, this is why you don't do drugs,

1017
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:06,940
 people, ha-cha-cha-cha, and then you leave them,

1018
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:10,420
 and apparently, when it was made illegal,

1019
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,060
 they were worth too much money.

1020
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:15,700
 So all the people that live in Gibsonton live by,

1021
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:18,140
 it's a law that you can have anything on your property

1022
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:20,140
 as long as it has to do with circus.

1023
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,460
 Government can't do anything about it.

1024
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,300
 - Okay.

1025
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,080
 - Like, there's frickin' half-set-up rides,

1026
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,500
 and like a tiger over here, it's insane.

1027
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,080
 But there's a field where all the pickled punks

1028
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,140
 are buried, like, hundreds of them.

1029
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,220
 - Oh, Jesus.

1030
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,060
 - Wow, now see, and that's the kind of stuff he would--

1031
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,660
 - This is why you don't let circus people make the rules.

1032
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,140
 - No, but that's the kind of stuff he would buy.

1033
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:42,740
 Like, he went out and bought David Koresh's Hot Rod

1034
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,900
 a couple years ago, and stuff like that.

1035
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:45,720
 Like, he's always--

1036
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,060
 - Yeah, I don't think Zach should be in charge, either.

1037
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:49,140
 - He's always looking for that kind of stuff.

1038
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:50,760
 You guys would hit it off.

1039
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,600
 You should definitely look him up.

1040
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,220
 - I feel like we'd be friends.

1041
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,060
 - And--

1042
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:54,900
 - You would, you would.

1043
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,200
 You guys would be.

1044
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,040
 You would be, you know.

1045
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,540
 - You can vouch Zach pays really well, right, Paul?

1046
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:00,380
 - Here's the thing. - Zach pays great.

1047
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,300
 - I was just about to say,

1048
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,620
 whatever you're thinking of charging,

1049
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:06,460
 just charge double, and you'll be good.

1050
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:08,440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Okay, okay.

1051
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,380
 He's classic sideshow in every way.

1052
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:14,280
 Classic sideshow is GTFM, get the fucking money.

1053
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,220
 - That is, he is, he loves Barnum.

1054
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,500
 He loves P.T. Barnum.

1055
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:22,120
 That's his whole, that's his ideological guru.

1056
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:22,960
 And that's why he's got all that--

1057
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,700
 - Oh, I've got a Barnum letter in the back room

1058
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,040
 that's written by Barnum.

1059
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:27,880
 I've got like crazy--

1060
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,880
 - Hey, you looking to make some quick cash?

1061
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,900
 Honestly, that's the kind of shit he will buy

1062
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,480
 in a fucking heartbeat for his museum.

1063
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,780
 - Well, you've got me wondering.

1064
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:39,540
 Yeah, I've got, there was a murder in Gibsonton, Florida.

1065
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,780
 There was this guy called The Lobster Man.

1066
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,180
 And The Lobster Man abused his family,

1067
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:45,880
 so they hired a hit on him.

1068
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,420
 His name was Grady Stiles.

1069
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,340
 And I have an impression of his hand,

1070
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:53,380
 like in, like the actual impression of his hand.

1071
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:54,500
 He was the one that was murdered.

1072
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,100
 And there was this crazy story around it.

1073
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:59,140
 - You've got Circus Freak and Murder Mystery Story

1074
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,660
 and Murder Mobilia all connected.

1075
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,380
 He will pay you crazy money for this shit.

1076
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,540
 This is exactly the kind of stuff

1077
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,060
 he loves to have in his place.

1078
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:09,260
 Wow.

1079
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:10,100
 Yeah, you guys will hit it off.

1080
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,900
 - Yeah, if you guys don't know that story,

1081
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,940
 look up Grady Stiles, The Lobster Boy.

1082
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:15,780
 - It's been a long time since I've heard that.

1083
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:18,180
 But he had hands kind of like the penguin

1084
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,260
 in the Batman Returns.

1085
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:22,940
 Yeah, yeah, the pincers.

1086
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:23,780
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1087
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:25,780
 - Yeah, oh fucking shit.

1088
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:28,420
 You guys absolutely have to chat at some point.

1089
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:30,180
 We gotta figure that out.

1090
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,020
 Yeah.

1091
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:31,940
 - A Pickled Graveyard.

1092
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:34,060
 Yes, Andi, it's a Pickled Graveyard.

1093
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:35,380
 - All right.

1094
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:37,780
 Shout out to Richard Bruins for doubling his Patreon

1095
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:38,620
 while we were on air.

1096
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,260
 I'll keep doing this if people keep doing it.

1097
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,100
 So I'll just keep doing it.

1098
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:41,940
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

1099
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,040
 - Thank you, Richard. - This is great.

1100
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,380
 Yeah, we love you guys so much.

1101
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,940
 Thank you so much for sending us--

1102
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:48,220
 - Coach Rat Bastard just became

1103
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:49,700
 an ice cream truck driver, everybody.

1104
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,700
 - Fuck yeah, Coach Rat Bastard.

1105
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,540
 Yeah, baby.

1106
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,820
 - That's what I'm talking about.

1107
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:55,660
 - Welcome to the feed.

1108
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:58,340
 (imitates truck engine)

1109
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:01,340
 - Is Mike technically an ice cream truck driver all the time

1110
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,180
 since he's actually driving his truck?

1111
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:04,060
 - I mean-- - Hi, Mike.

1112
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:04,900
 - Kind of, yeah.

1113
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:05,980
 - Oh, yes. - Yeah.

1114
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:09,740
 And he was kind enough to say that he's gonna up his Patreon

1115
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,940
 as soon as stuff gets squared away from the holidays.

1116
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,260
 So thanks. - Right, so.

1117
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:14,780
 - People who are doing it can fit it with their budget.

1118
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,260
 Obviously, we do not want people to take any financial risks

1119
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,460
 to up their Patreon. - No, no, no.

1120
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:19,980
 - whatsoever. - No, no, no.

1121
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,020
 But we desperately appreciate everything

1122
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,980
 that everybody does for us, so yeah.

1123
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:26,340
 - Well, there is still the experiment

1124
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:29,820
 that we're gonna run after we get $3 billion.

1125
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:30,660
 - That's right.

1126
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,500
 - We're gonna give each of us a billion dollars

1127
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,860
 and see how we spend it.

1128
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,420
 - We're gonna see if we can be better people

1129
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:37,340
 than the billionaires that we have today.

1130
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,660
 So we'll see how that goes. - I know I could.

1131
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,500
 - My guess is no. - I could.

1132
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,580
 - Well, once JJ sells all of her memorabilia to Zach,

1133
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:45,980
 she'll be a billionaire as well.

1134
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,860
 - I'm telling you, you got some money to make.

1135
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:48,700
 - Help fund us.

1136
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:49,860
 - Well, at the very least,

1137
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,620
 yeah, you guys would actually hit it off.

1138
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:52,460
 - Yeah.

1139
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,220
 - That's, well, first of all,

1140
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:56,780
 JJ hits it off with every single person on the planet.

1141
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,260
 - I know, I know, I know.

1142
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,140
 I'm not like breaking news here.

1143
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,300
 JJ gets along with someone.

1144
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,060
 - Yeah, but we've got sawdust in our blood.

1145
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:03,900
 - Yes, yes.

1146
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,460
 No, I think you guys, because of the circus thing.

1147
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:07,300
 Yep, mm-hmm.

1148
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,860
 - For the Zach Baggins turn,

1149
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,940
 I was trying to get to the lead of why we had you on here

1150
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:16,260
 is you just did a concert with Alice Cooper in Arizona.

1151
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:17,940
 - Hey. - Oh, you did that one!

1152
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:22,620
 - Yeah, that was interesting, that was very interesting.

1153
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:23,460
 - What happened?

1154
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,220
 - Well, here's the thing, I'll just tell you what I saw.

1155
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,700
 I saw that you were, at one point, you were eating fire,

1156
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,500
 and at one point, there's a picture of you eating fire,

1157
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,860
 and normally when you eat fire, your head is back,

1158
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:33,420
 your neck is up.

1159
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:34,580
 There's a picture of you eating fire,

1160
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:35,580
 and your face is forward,

1161
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:39,100
 and you're just shoving a ball of fire into your face.

1162
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,540
 - I hurt my neck, I couldn't put my head back.

1163
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:43,780
 (laughing)

1164
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:47,260
 And then I just did it, and I had no eyelashes afterwards,

1165
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:50,740
 but it was worth it, they said I looked like a fat ass.

1166
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:53,860
 - There's no doubt, no doubt.

1167
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:56,140
 So, sorry, tell us all about the gig.

1168
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:59,660
 - So, David Minkin was the one that got it,

1169
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:02,500
 'cause he's been friends with Alice and his wife for years,

1170
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:05,700
 and they are the nicest human beings in the world.

1171
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,220
 And the gig was for this thing they do

1172
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:10,900
 called Alice Cooper Solid Rock, basically in Arizona.

1173
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:14,260
 Any kid that wants to learn an instrument,

1174
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,860
 learn an art, anything, they can stay after school

1175
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,820
 until 10 p.m. at their facilities.

1176
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,340
 They get their instrument for free,

1177
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:21,740
 they get training for free.

1178
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,700
 - Oh, wow, oh, that's awesome.

1179
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:28,140
 - It's insanely cool, and so they had the winners

1180
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:31,700
 of their annual School of Rock type thing in this concert.

1181
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:35,700
 And then it was me, David, and Chris Mitchell,

1182
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:38,300
 Collective Soul, Don Felder,

1183
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:42,740
 his guitarist that was insane.

1184
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:44,940
 I forget what her name was, Nina, I think something.

1185
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,700
 And then Alice Cooper performed with the original band.

1186
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,180
 - Whoa. - Oh, cool.

1187
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:50,900
 - Bad ass. - Yeah, yes.

1188
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:54,180
 But so I got there, and obviously I'm like,

1189
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,540
 we're the magicians, we're not gonna get

1190
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:58,260
 a dressing room or anything, which I was right.

1191
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:01,740
 So we go downstairs, I'm trying to find a place.

1192
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,180
 I was like, I gotta curl my hair.

1193
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:05,300
 I just got off a cruise ship on a plane,

1194
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,260
 and I said, is there any place with a plug?

1195
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,940
 And they pulled me down the hallway,

1196
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,260
 and they said, oh, in here's fine.

1197
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:11,740
 I was like, oh, this is nice.

1198
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,340
 There's nobody in it right now.

1199
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:15,820
 So I curled my hair for like 20 minutes.

1200
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:19,860
 And you guys know, I shed like a Siberian husky in summer.

1201
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:23,380
 Like there's red hair everywhere, all over the floor.

1202
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:25,380
 And so I'm trying to collect some,

1203
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:27,300
 like I could make another JJ out of it.

1204
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,260
 Actually, Mike, I should just give you my hair for a year.

1205
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:32,340
 That's what I should do for your next album.

1206
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:35,380
 - Elsroth, for Elsroth to have JJ's hair.

1207
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:38,860
 - Yeah, well, I got, so I finished,

1208
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:41,820
 and I just had a feeling like I need to get out of here.

1209
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,340
 I leave, I leave the dressing room,

1210
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:47,500
 and my shoulder brushes somebody going into it.

1211
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,700
 They had put me in Alice Cooper's dressing room

1212
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:51,300
 thinking he wouldn't be there yet.

1213
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,980
 And I literally just made a mess of his dressing room

1214
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:54,820
 with my hair.

1215
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:56,300
 It was so embarrassing.

1216
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,420
 And I saw David Meakin and Chris Mitchell

1217
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,020
 on the other side of the room going.

1218
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:05,580
 And then my other fail moment.

1219
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:08,060
 Have you guys ever misquoted lyrics

1220
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:09,460
 to a person who wrote them?

1221
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:10,600
 - Oh no.

1222
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:13,900
 Something I'm very capable of.

1223
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:14,740
 - Yes, yes I have.

1224
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:19,420
 - So Jacob, what was your misheard lyric

1225
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,380
 that you quoted to that person?

1226
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:24,940
 - It was an Ozzy Osbourne lyric.

1227
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,860
 Not too Ozzy, but to the person that had written this song.

1228
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:30,660
 I don't remember what the lyric was,

1229
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,340
 but I was definitely just like singing part of it with,

1230
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:34,580
 like through with this guy.

1231
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:36,780
 And he was like, that is not the lyric at all.

1232
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:40,220
 It was embarrassing.

1233
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:41,060
 - Oh shit.

1234
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:44,660
 - Dude, so Collective Soul, I love Collective Soul

1235
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:47,300
 and Ed Rowland, like the lead singer for it.

1236
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,800
 And you know that song, the, whoa.

1237
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:54,540
 I thought it was, never let your light shine doll.

1238
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:55,620
 - Oh my God.

1239
00:55:55,620 --> 00:56:00,220
 - And I didn't know what the real lyrics were

1240
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:03,220
 until yesterday when I told the friend this story

1241
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,580
 and they're like, they didn't correct you.

1242
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,060
 And I went, no.

1243
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:09,980
 And then the other one, Ed Rowland filmed on his phone

1244
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:12,220
 to send his family 'cause he loved it.

1245
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:16,940
 You know that song that that dadada dadada dadada.

1246
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,180
 I thought it was turn your head now, baby.

1247
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:20,740
 Just say meow.

1248
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:23,260
 - Turn your hair.

1249
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:25,220
 Now, baby, just say meow.

1250
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:26,060
 Oh, turn your head.

1251
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:27,340
 - Just say meow.

1252
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:31,460
 And he laughed so hard during the show

1253
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,180
 when he sang whatever the real lyric is.

1254
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:35,420
 (laughing)

1255
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:38,660
 I was like, oh, it was bad.

1256
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:40,180
 But no one corrected me.

1257
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:41,900
 I still didn't know what the real lyrics

1258
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:42,720
 were when I clapped. - My wife thought

1259
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,260
 the collective soul was, oh, physical attraction

1260
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,340
 is what she thought it was at high school.

1261
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:49,820
 - What?

1262
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:51,540
 What are you guys, what is wrong?

1263
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,060
 Everybody just got hearing problems?

1264
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:53,900
 What's happening?

1265
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,420
 - Baby, just say meow. - Physical attraction.

1266
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:59,820
 - No, Jacob, not everyone has hearing problems.

1267
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:02,420
 (laughing)

1268
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:05,620
 - I told him, I used to think the boots are made for walking.

1269
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:07,580
 I thought it was one of these days

1270
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:10,660
 these boots are gonna walk on over to you.

1271
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,900
 (laughing)

1272
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,140
 - No, it's- - Like, magically?

1273
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:14,980
 - Wow.

1274
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:16,580
 - It's much hotter than that, JJ.

1275
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:17,420
 It's much hotter than that.

1276
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:19,980
 - They're gonna walk on over to you.

1277
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:20,820
 - Oh, God.

1278
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:24,220
 As a kid, I thought "Jump and Drive" was "Drink and Drive."

1279
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:25,820
 (laughing)

1280
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:27,740
 Spin the wheel, you gotta drink and drive.

1281
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:29,620
 - A beautiful- - Spin the wheel, you gotta-

1282
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:32,060
 - A beautiful anthem to drunk driving,

1283
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:34,660
 like this wonderful party song.

1284
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,220
 - And my mom let me sing it.

1285
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:38,500
 ♪ Drink and drive, then you bail, you gotta ♪

1286
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,020
 ♪ Drink and drive, then you bail, you gotta ♪

1287
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:43,340
 ♪ Drink and drive, then you bail, you gotta ♪

1288
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:45,140
 Oh no, I'm dead!

1289
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:50,140
 - My favorite Ska song is "Man Slaughter III."

1290
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:52,380
 (laughing)

1291
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:54,420
 Oh man.

1292
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:56,420
 - Yeah, my parents weren't good parents.

1293
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,740
 - You genuinely believed that the lyric

1294
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:01,300
 was now, "Baby, just say meow."

1295
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:05,740
 - Yeah, I didn't, you know when you hear something

1296
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:07,020
 and you just sing it that way

1297
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,500
 and you never even think about what you're actually singing.

1298
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,580
 - It never occurred to you to even think about it.

1299
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:13,740
 - Well, no, I- - And these are all like,

1300
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,300
 these songs all came out when we were younger

1301
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,700
 and this is before the Shazam and iPhones and stuff.

1302
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:18,540
 You couldn't look up-

1303
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:20,180
 - This was dentist jargon though.

1304
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:21,540
 It's dentist jargon.

1305
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:24,180
 - What's dentist jargon?

1306
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:26,340
 - Turn your head and spit me out.

1307
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,180
 (laughing)

1308
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:28,180
 That's what it is.

1309
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:29,420
 - That's what it is.

1310
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:32,820
 - Turn your head and now baby just spit me out, yeah.

1311
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:34,300
 But it's talking like a dentist.

1312
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:37,620
 - But like, who's giving head in a dentist's office?

1313
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:39,820
 - I mean- - I mean, you gotta go

1314
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:40,660
 to the right place.

1315
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:41,900
 - I guess. - Yeah.

1316
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:42,740
 (laughing)

1317
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:44,940
 - I can tell you right now it took me forever

1318
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:47,420
 to find one that was covered by insurance.

1319
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:48,260
 - Yeah.

1320
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:50,580
 - But turn your head and spit is a dentist thing.

1321
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:51,660
 - It's a PPO.

1322
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:52,500
 (laughing)

1323
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,260
 - But if you break that down,

1324
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:58,420
 turn your head and baby just spit me out.

1325
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:01,580
 - I hear it now that you're saying it, JJ.

1326
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,820
 I get it.

1327
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:05,300
 Turn your head and now baby just say meow.

1328
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:08,540
 Yeah, but he sings with a very affected way.

1329
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:11,740
 I'm gonna beat, I don't like Collective Soul,

1330
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:13,740
 but I know a ton of Collective Soul songs

1331
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:16,180
 because when I was coming up as a young man,

1332
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:18,260
 that was on the radio 24 fucking seven.

1333
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,420
 Their stuff was huge.

1334
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:20,820
 You couldn't escape their songs.

1335
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:22,540
 - Yeah, that's why it was everywhere.

1336
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:25,020
 - I think it's funny that you think it was

1337
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,420
 turn your head and now baby just say meow.

1338
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:29,180
 - I want an all JJ cover band

1339
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,700
 that just sings her lyrics for every song.

1340
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:31,900
 - The wrong lyrics?

1341
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:32,740
 - Yeah.

1342
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:35,260
 (laughing)

1343
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:38,660
 - Jacob, the wrong lyrics, that's a band name.

1344
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:41,220
 - The wrong lyrics is a good band name.

1345
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:42,060
 - Right?

1346
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:43,260
 - Yeah.

1347
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:47,940
 Speaking of all these bands, I saw Bowling for Soup.

1348
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:51,180
 They had a free concert on Fremont Street the other night.

1349
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:53,540
 - They are great live.

1350
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:55,060
 - Oh, they're so good live.

1351
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:55,900
 They're so good.

1352
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,660
 A friend of ours was opening for them.

1353
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,260
 So we went down and saw our friend open

1354
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:01,700
 and then we hung out and watched Bowling for Soup a little bit.

1355
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,420
 They were so good live.

1356
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:04,500
 They were so funny.

1357
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,980
 They talk, they do the songs and everything.

1358
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:10,420
 Scooper Nova girl in the chat saying 1985.

1359
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:14,020
 So that's one of their big songs.

1360
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:15,700
 It was so goddamn funny.

1361
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:16,740
 They're up there, they're playing.

1362
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:19,420
 We're kind of on the side of the stage.

1363
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:22,260
 And we see them.

1364
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:24,740
 We see all the signs and people are holding up signs.

1365
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:25,940
 This is 1985.

1366
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:28,220
 Between every song that they do,

1367
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:30,380
 people are yelling for 1985.

1368
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:31,420
 They want to play it.

1369
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:36,420
 And finally the front man chefs fucking kiss to this guy.

1370
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:42,060
 He goes, hey, hey, how many hits do you think we have?

1371
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:44,220
 We've been doing this a long time.

1372
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:46,940
 We're gonna play our big hit last.

1373
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:49,660
 Quit asking us to play 1985 now.

1374
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:50,900
 We're gonna play it.

1375
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,900
 It's gonna be last.

1376
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,060
 - When I saw them, they were playing the small room.

1377
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:57,180
 It was still the hard rock instead of Virgin.

1378
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:58,300
 It was still the hard rock.

1379
01:00:58,300 --> 01:00:59,940
 And they were playing the smaller room.

1380
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:02,180
 And they were playing vinyl.

1381
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:04,180
 And they go like, we're gonna play.

1382
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:07,900
 This is a song we wrote for Katy Perry.

1383
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:10,060
 And they played you're hot, then you're cold.

1384
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:11,420
 You're yes, then you're no.

1385
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:12,900
 And they played it awesome.

1386
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,460
 They played it fast as hell.

1387
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:16,060
 They just rocked it out.

1388
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,780
 And then when they finished, they go,

1389
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:19,700
 we didn't write that for Katy Perry.

1390
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:22,660
 Do you think we'd be playing this room

1391
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:25,220
 if we wrote that song for Katy Perry?

1392
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:27,620
 We'd just be at home swimming in our money.

1393
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:28,700
 We wouldn't be here.

1394
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:31,620
 (laughing)

1395
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:32,460
 - That's freakin' great.

1396
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:34,460
 - I laughed so hard. - That's freakin' great.

1397
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:35,540
 That's great.

1398
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:37,420
 - I laughed so hard at that bit.

1399
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:41,420
 - I feel like they wrote a song for Katy Perry.

1400
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:44,700
 - It was so smart.

1401
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:45,780
 It was just the funniest bit.

1402
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:46,740
 But they were great.

1403
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:48,860
 They were so great to see.

1404
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:51,060
 - I could hear them from where I live.

1405
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:53,060
 'Cause Fremont Street is so close.

1406
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:55,420
 So there's a lot of times I can't go to bed early

1407
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:56,460
 'cause there's stuff going on.

1408
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:57,300
 - Oh yeah.

1409
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:58,620
 - This makes me so confusing.

1410
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:00,820
 'Cause I heard that concert and then I look out

1411
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:02,900
 and I see Disney drones.

1412
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,780
 And I'm like, God, I thought I got away from them.

1413
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:05,620
 - No, no.

1414
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:06,460
 (laughing)

1415
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:09,340
 - Fantasmic and the freakin' Bellatio.

1416
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:11,260
 I was like, they found me.

1417
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,100
 - Yikes.

1418
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:14,340
 (laughing)

1419
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:17,420
 - He gads.

1420
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:19,420
 - He gads.

1421
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:21,100
 Well, if you're ever downtown again,

1422
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,780
 you hear Bowling for Soup playing,

1423
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,500
 just come on over 'cause I'll probably be there.

1424
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:26,340
 - Yes.

1425
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,180
 - We're gonna play that one last.

1426
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:30,540
 It's our big song.

1427
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:33,380
 - That's very funny.

1428
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:34,980
 - Let me explain to you how show business works.

1429
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:35,980
 - That's very funny.

1430
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:37,620
 - You're gonna be on Disney for Thanksgiving

1431
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:40,260
 or you're gonna be on Disney for Christmas?

1432
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:43,340
 - I'm traveling to Disney on Thanksgiving

1433
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:45,460
 and I will be on Disney for Christmas.

1434
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:47,100
 - Oh, man.

1435
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,940
 - And New Year's Eve.

1436
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:50,700
 - What's the point of us becoming neighbors

1437
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:54,060
 if you spend all your holidays doing cruise ships, JJ?

1438
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:54,980
 - I know.

1439
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:58,300
 But I'm here December 3rd to December 13th

1440
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:01,020
 and then for next year I've taken off two weeks

1441
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:03,500
 of every month because my body--

1442
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,340
 - Smart.

1443
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:07,540
 - Apparently, my cortisol levels are 42

1444
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:10,020
 and they're supposed to be not higher than 28

1445
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:13,900
 and they're like, it's burnout and stress.

1446
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,740
 So I'm making my body--

1447
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:16,580
 - Oh, where's Dr. Mike?

1448
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:17,420
 We should have let Dr. Mike go.

1449
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:18,260
 We should have talked about your cortisol levels.

1450
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:21,340
 - Oh, Dr. Mike, I need Dr. Mike.

1451
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:22,980
 - What is a cortisol level?

1452
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:23,900
 What does that do?

1453
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:25,540
 - It's basically--

1454
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:26,380
 - It's a stress hormone.

1455
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:28,380
 - What regulates stress, I think, right?

1456
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:29,220
 - Oh, okay.

1457
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:30,060
 - Yeah, yeah.

1458
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:30,980
 - I hear people talking about it.

1459
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,180
 I don't know what it is though.

1460
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:33,020
 - I gotta tell you--

1461
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:34,660
 - You don't want a high cortisol level.

1462
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:37,900
 - Instagram says I need to treat it like crazy

1463
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:40,140
 in terms of targeted ads.

1464
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:41,660
 - Yeah, no, every targeted ad--

1465
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:42,820
 - That's obvious, though.

1466
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:43,660
 - It is obvious.

1467
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:45,020
 - It's obvious.

1468
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:48,100
 - Oh, the Instagram medical advice is not solid?

1469
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:48,940
 Oh, interesting.

1470
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:50,620
 - Not to be trusted, not at all, nope.

1471
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:52,300
 - It's very hard to treat your cortisol levels

1472
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:53,620
 with an herbal supplement.

1473
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:56,860
 I don't think we need Dr. Mike back on to tell you

1474
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:57,820
 that's true.

1475
01:03:57,820 --> 01:04:03,100
 But I did switch to actually, it was a cortisol supplement,

1476
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:05,380
 but it was advertised to me as like,

1477
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:08,460
 if you're taking melatonin, you should maybe switch to this.

1478
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:11,580
 And I've been taking melatonin since the pandemic.

1479
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:13,180
 And then a study came out that was like,

1480
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:15,100
 "Hey, taking melatonin every day

1481
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,700
 might not be good for your heart."

1482
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:20,980
 And so I forget what the name of the study is,

1483
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:22,460
 but the study is the placebo's work,

1484
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:23,540
 even if you know the placebos.

1485
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:25,220
 Do you know the study?

1486
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:26,860
 - I mean, I know of studies like that.

1487
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:29,620
 I don't know with the melatonin, though.

1488
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:30,940
 - Well, it wasn't a melatonin-based study,

1489
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:32,460
 but there's a particular study that just basically said

1490
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:35,100
 that we're giving you placebos for the symptoms.

1491
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:36,700
 And people would knowingly take the placebo

1492
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:40,420
 and still report improvement in their conditions.

1493
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:42,380
 So I've switched to this herbal thing

1494
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:43,940
 and stopped taking melatonin,

1495
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:46,740
 and I've been falling asleep better

1496
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:49,460
 on this herbal supplement than this.

1497
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:51,700
 And I'm positive it's just the placebo effect.

1498
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:55,580
 I cannot positively endorse this product.

1499
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:58,220
 I just simply am happier that I'm not taking melatonin,

1500
01:04:58,220 --> 01:04:59,180
 so I'll do it.

1501
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:00,020
 I'll take it.

1502
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:01,100
 - It's called Ambien.

1503
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:01,940
 - Yeah.

1504
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,060
 (all laughing)

1505
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:04,540
 - Matt's going to sleep really well

1506
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:06,300
 on this new supplement, Ambien.

1507
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,860
 - It's actually, it comes in a rock form

1508
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:11,100
 and you hit your head with it until it absorbs.

1509
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:13,900
 (Matt laughing)

1510
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:16,460
 - Wait, so you were taking melatonin on the bus?

1511
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:17,300
 - Oh, yeah.

1512
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:19,140
 - Oh, yeah.

1513
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:19,980
 - On the bus I was taking-

1514
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:20,900
 - Why are you always so tired?

1515
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:23,380
 - On the bus I was actually ended up taking Advil PMs,

1516
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:25,660
 which I knew is something you shouldn't take long-term,

1517
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:29,300
 but I was doing anything to fall asleep on that bus.

1518
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:32,740
 Yeah, I was never falling asleep on that bus.

1519
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:35,220
 - Matt, here's a trick that I've tried,

1520
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:38,740
 and it's worked for me that I just heard about.

1521
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:40,420
 Get yourself a cooling pad.

1522
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:43,260
 Do you have like little ice pack type things?

1523
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:44,300
 - I do.

1524
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:45,420
 - Okay.

1525
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:47,580
 And you got it where you can either wrap it in a cloth

1526
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:50,260
 or something where it could be safe for skin contact?

1527
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:52,220
 - Okay.

1528
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:53,060
 - All right.

1529
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:55,700
 And before you go to bed, once you're in bed,

1530
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:59,580
 just put it on your forehead for 20 minutes

1531
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:03,660
 and that will chill out your frontal cortex,

1532
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:06,380
 your frontal lobe and seriously send messages

1533
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:09,300
 to like go to sleep.

1534
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:11,300
 And so it really, really helps.

1535
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,140
 So try it.

1536
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:13,220
 - This is what you need.

1537
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:14,060
 - There you go.

1538
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:14,900
 - I was just about to say,

1539
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:17,620
 I know JJ invested in some old timey ice bag

1540
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:19,060
 and here it is.

1541
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:19,900
 - There it is.

1542
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:21,660
 - But here's the thing, here's the thing.

1543
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:24,180
 So if you're at a hotel, you can fill it with ice.

1544
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:26,140
 If you buy a drink at the airport,

1545
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:28,460
 before I get on a plane, I buy a fountain soda,

1546
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:29,300
 fill it with ice.

1547
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:30,140
 - There you go.

1548
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:31,500
 - Use it on the back, everywhere.

1549
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:32,340
 - Yeah.

1550
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:33,620
 - Cruise ship, fill it with ice.

1551
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:34,460
 - Yeah.

1552
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:36,220
 - This is, I live by this.

1553
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:37,900
 - That's a genius idea.

1554
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:40,540
 - To be accurate, how much soda do you pour

1555
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:41,620
 into that ice bag?

1556
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:44,100
 (laughing)

1557
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,380
 - It's not none soda.

1558
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:46,220
 No, but that's a great-

1559
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:50,060
 - It has happened once when I was very tired.

1560
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:50,900
 - But that's great.

1561
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:53,100
 - And yes, I did drink it.

1562
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:54,340
 (laughing)

1563
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:55,180
 - Out of the bag.

1564
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:56,340
 - I assume you drank it.

1565
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:57,580
 - Yeah, that's awesome.

1566
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,220
 - Oh yeah, this is how I get water.

1567
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:00,780
 As soon as the ice melts, I'm like,

1568
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:03,300
 I'm not paying $6 for water,

1569
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:04,140
 I'm just drinking all the things.

1570
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:04,980
 - There you go, smart.

1571
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,980
 - Drinking out of a plastic ice bag.

1572
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:07,820
 - Genius.

1573
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:08,740
 - It works.

1574
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:10,740
 - That's how you get that sawdust in your veins.

1575
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:11,580
 - That's genius.

1576
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:12,400
 - Drinking out of plastic ice bags.

1577
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,240
 - You could hide alcohol in this.

1578
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:14,540
 - You absolutely could.

1579
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:15,660
 There you go.

1580
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:16,580
 - Yep, yep, yep.

1581
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:19,500
 - Genius.

1582
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:20,660
 Genius.

1583
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:21,940
 - You say that like you drink.

1584
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:23,140
 You don't really drink.

1585
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:26,300
 - No, not much, but I could.

1586
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:29,060
 (laughing)

1587
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:31,220
 - She just wants to have the option.

1588
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:32,060
 - Yeah.

1589
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:36,100
 - Guys, I'm icing down my knees every night

1590
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:37,540
 with old fashions.

1591
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:38,980
 (laughing)

1592
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:40,340
 - It really works.

1593
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:42,180
 - A little bit of this.

1594
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:43,900
 - It absorbs through the skin.

1595
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:45,420
 - Natural medicine, baby.

1596
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:46,660
 - Natural medicine.

1597
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:50,900
 - Oh, you don't know nothing about no natural medicine

1598
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,300
 and you don't know nothing about nothing

1599
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:53,700
 'cause it's Jack vs. Nerd.

1600
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:54,900
 - All right, you're gonna find out

1601
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:56,500
 who knows nothing about something.

1602
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:59,500
 - Ladies and gentlemen, it is time.

1603
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:08,720
 Time for Jack vs. Nerd.

1604
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:20,940
 - Explosion of me accidentally deleting the scooperty

1605
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:22,460
 before I got to it.

1606
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:25,380
 (laughing)

1607
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:28,780
 - We got a scooperty coming to us today from ML Kennedy.

1608
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:32,340
 The categories are how it started, dot, dot, dot.

1609
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:33,520
 What's their number?

1610
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,480
 Turkeys and potpourri.

1611
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,460
 Oh yeah, it's the Thanksgiving one.

1612
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:38,820
 Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.

1613
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:40,480
 - JJ, what's your Instagram?

1614
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:45,460
 - Wait, my Instagram? - Yeah.

1615
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:46,300
 - @JessicaJaneMagic.

1616
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:47,300
 - JessicaJaneMagic.

1617
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:48,780
 Give JJ a follow.

1618
01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:50,980
 She always does. - Oh, yay!

1619
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:52,020
 I'll follow you back.

1620
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:53,760
 I put weird stuff up.

1621
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,980
 - You document your weird life on ships all the time.

1622
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:58,660
 It's a good follow.

1623
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:00,620
 It's good adventures of someone who lives on the road.

1624
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:02,120
 - I'm very honest.

1625
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:04,820
 (laughing)

1626
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:06,620
 - That's what I don't like about her.

1627
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:07,660
 (laughing)

1628
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:10,300
 - That's how I knew about the old timey ice bag.

1629
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:14,180
 - I do post that on my Instagram, like you guys,

1630
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:16,340
 but I'm gonna mention the alchohol thing now.

1631
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:17,900
 That's gonna be fun.

1632
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:18,740
 - Life hack!

1633
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:23,460
 Matt, you're up first.

1634
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:24,700
 What category do you want?

1635
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:26,780
 Oh, I have to put it back on the screen, don't I?

1636
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:27,940
 How it started, what's their number?

1637
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:30,900
 Turkeys or potpourri are the categories.

1638
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:31,740
 Matt, what you want?

1639
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:33,660
 - How it started, please.

1640
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:35,020
 - For 200.

1641
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:38,440
 This 1996 Tim Burton movie was based on a series

1642
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,980
 of tops trading cards from the 1960s.

1643
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:46,140
 - Hmm, I feel like this is obvious,

1644
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:48,740
 but I'm trying to think of tops trading cards.

1645
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:50,180
 - A league of their own.

1646
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:52,460
 - I know, it's like major league,

1647
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:53,900
 but that wasn't a Tim Burton movie.

1648
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:55,700
 That'd be a weird Tim Burton movie.

1649
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,540
 - That'd be a great Tim Burton movie.

1650
01:09:57,540 --> 01:10:00,580
 - I'll pass.

1651
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:02,560
 - Oh, that passes to me.

1652
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,460
 I have no idea.

1653
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:04,620
 Pass, Paul.

1654
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:06,460
 - Mars attacks.

1655
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:08,900
 - Oh, sure, Mars attacks.

1656
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:09,740
 - Yeah.

1657
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:10,560
 - Good call.

1658
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,380
 That's from a trading card game?

1659
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:14,340
 - Ang, ang, ang, ang, ang, ang, ang.

1660
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:15,180
 - Oh, it's me.

1661
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:16,260
 I'll try, what's their number?

1662
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:17,700
 200.

1663
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:20,780
 The King of England during the American Revolution

1664
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:24,400
 was King George the,

1665
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:30,300
 I wanna say fifth. - Infallible.

1666
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:31,620
 - I wanna say fifth.

1667
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:33,020
 I'm gonna say fifth.

1668
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:35,220
 King George the fifth is what I'm saying.

1669
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:36,060
 Third.

1670
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:36,980
 - Oh, you overshot it.

1671
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:38,460
 Overshot it by two, Jacob.

1672
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:39,740
 - So close. - Yep, yep.

1673
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:40,780
 Wrong George.

1674
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:41,740
 My bad, George.

1675
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:43,340
 Paul.

1676
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:45,540
 - I'll try potpourri for six.

1677
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:47,180
 - For 600.

1678
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:49,300
 How tall is Hello Kitty?

1679
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:51,700
 Please give the answer in apples.

1680
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:53,060
 - Oh, man.

1681
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:57,140
 So Smurfs are three apples high.

1682
01:10:57,140 --> 01:10:57,980
 - Famously.

1683
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:59,020
 - Okay.

1684
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:02,560
 - I'm gonna guess Hello Kitty is also three apples high.

1685
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,800
 - Okay, let's try it.

1686
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:07,700
 - Shit, she's five apples.

1687
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:09,300
 Of course she's bigger than a Smurf.

1688
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:10,140
 Fucking shit.

1689
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:11,900
 - Yeah, what are you thinking, Paul?

1690
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:15,460
 - At F1, there was a Hello Kitty booth this year

1691
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:18,260
 because it's so funny 'cause they added

1692
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:19,620
 this Formula One Academy,

1693
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:21,420
 which is all about training up women racers.

1694
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:23,820
 So they had a big Formula One Academy race

1695
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:25,740
 and they had all women drivers.

1696
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:28,300
 And so one of the sponsors is Hello Kitty.

1697
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:31,460
 So all these people who weren't aware of this new thing

1698
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:33,700
 were just like, what the hell is this Hello Kitty thing

1699
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:34,540
 doing here?

1700
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:37,260
 - Oh, that's great.

1701
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:38,840
 - They didn't like Hello Kitty?

1702
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,420
 - Well, they're just confused by it.

1703
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:44,500
 - A lot of basically car dealers who won some contests

1704
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,580
 that their dealership sent them to F1

1705
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:48,780
 did not appreciate the Hello Kitty thing, yeah.

1706
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:49,620
 - Well, then they're idiots.

1707
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:52,380
 - So they had Mickey Mouse in the gang and Hello Kitty.

1708
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:55,940
 - They're absolute idiots because any car dealer

1709
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:56,780
 worked their...

1710
01:11:56,780 --> 01:12:00,140
 No, seriously, if you were lucky enough to be like,

1711
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:03,020
 let's just say a Toyota dealership,

1712
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:04,700
 and you were lucky enough to get like

1713
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:08,260
 a Hello Kitty limited edition Avalon made,

1714
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:11,980
 holy fuck, those would not stay in stock for five minutes.

1715
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:12,820
 - Good point.

1716
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:14,780
 - They have no idea what they're doing.

1717
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:15,620
 Fuck those idiots.

1718
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:18,340
 - From your mouth to Theodore Toyoda's ears.

1719
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:20,460
 - Theodore Toyoda, send me a message.

1720
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:21,280
 We'll talk, we'll talk.

1721
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:22,120
 - It's weird to have Paul Chris in my mouth

1722
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,380
 because I feel like Paul would get along

1723
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:25,900
 with all of the opulent people that go to F1.

1724
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:28,660
 (laughing)

1725
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:30,740
 - I would get along with the rich people?

1726
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:32,180
 - No, I'm being sarcastic.

1727
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:33,900
 - You'd be so mad the whole time.

1728
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:34,740
 - Yeah, I would be.

1729
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:35,740
 I'd be throwing shit in their face.

1730
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:36,700
 - You'd just be furious.

1731
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:38,660
 - I'd be throwing shit in their faces.

1732
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:39,500
 - Yeah.

1733
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:40,340
 - Matt, you're up.

1734
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:43,260
 - JJ, where should I go?

1735
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:44,360
 What's your gut?

1736
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:48,340
 - Ooh, ooh, turkeys for 400.

1737
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:49,160
 - All right. - All right.

1738
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:50,000
 - Turkeys for 400.

1739
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,240
 (laughing)

1740
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:54,240
 - The budget of this Gina Davis pirate movie

1741
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:56,260
 was around $100 million.

1742
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:59,500
 It grossed about $18 million at the box office.

1743
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:00,340
 (laughing)

1744
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:01,380
 - You know this, Matt.

1745
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:02,200
 You know this, Matt.

1746
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,040
 - I do?

1747
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:03,880
 - No, what is it?

1748
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,980
 - I know this one.

1749
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:05,820
 - JJ, you can tell me.

1750
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:06,660
 - Matt, you know this.

1751
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:07,500
 - You can just tell me.

1752
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,420
 - It's Matthew Modine.

1753
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:13,380
 - Gina Davis as a hot pirate?

1754
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:14,900
 - And Matthew Modine.

1755
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:16,180
 - Where do pirates hang out, Matt?

1756
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:17,740
 - As Matthew Modine.

1757
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:19,300
 - On a ship in a harbor.

1758
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:22,340
 - Yeah, and that ship takes them to a piece of land

1759
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:24,180
 that's in the middle of the ocean called a--

1760
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:25,460
 - Island.

1761
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:26,420
 - It's an island, yeah.

1762
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:28,260
 What do they do on that island?

1763
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:30,340
 - Look for treasure.

1764
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:34,580
 - Nope, they kill each other in a very specific way.

1765
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:36,420
 - Murder Island.

1766
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:37,260
 - Close.

1767
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:39,980
 - Getting closer.

1768
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:40,820
 - Who are you?

1769
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:41,900
 - JJ, you're a horrible lifeline.

1770
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:42,740
 Just tell me the answer.

1771
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:43,580
 We can move on.

1772
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:45,660
 (laughing)

1773
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:46,660
 - Actually, I forget.

1774
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:48,260
 I was just hoping you'd get to it.

1775
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:49,100
 - Matt.

1776
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:50,300
 - Shipwreck?

1777
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:53,620
 - Imagine you had to go down on a sword.

1778
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:55,880
 - Okay.

1779
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:56,700
 - Is there--

1780
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:57,540
 - What would happen?

1781
01:13:57,540 --> 01:13:58,380
 - It's not twash.

1782
01:13:58,380 --> 01:13:59,460
 - Cutthroat Island.

1783
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:00,300
 - There you go.

1784
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:01,700
 - Cutthroat Island is it.

1785
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:04,720
 - All you have to do with these clues

1786
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:07,580
 to get Matt to figure 'em out is reference fellatio.

1787
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:08,420
 - That's right.

1788
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:09,260
 - Got it.

1789
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:10,080
 - That's right.

1790
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:10,920
 - That's true.

1791
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,060
 - Yeah.

1792
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:13,700
 - It is a good movie though.

1793
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:15,220
 - Come on now, JJ.

1794
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:17,580
 - I believe Cutthroat Island was the reason

1795
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:19,700
 that movie studio had to fold.

1796
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:21,260
 - Yeah, it's a terrible movie.

1797
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:22,860
 - It destroyed a movie studio.

1798
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:25,040
 - It's damn near unwatchable.

1799
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,100
 - It was hot.

1800
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:27,100
 - Oh my God.

1801
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:28,580
 - Yeah, everyone's attractive.

1802
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:29,700
 The movie's terrible.

1803
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:31,380
 - What were you four when that fucking thing

1804
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:32,220
 hit the theaters?

1805
01:14:32,220 --> 01:14:35,000
 You were like, wow, of course it was cool to a four-year-old.

1806
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,860
 - JJ watches that shit on mute.

1807
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:38,860
 She sips from her ice pack.

1808
01:14:38,860 --> 01:14:41,500
 - All right, fair enough.

1809
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:43,980
 I mean, I ain't taking nothing away

1810
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:46,220
 from Gina Davis and big old pirate boots.

1811
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:48,820
 It was good stuff there, but you know.

1812
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:50,700
 - I'll try turkeys for 600.

1813
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:51,900
 - You would.

1814
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:54,620
 - This film, developed in part by the four-year-old son

1815
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:58,000
 of the president of Paramount, grossed $65 million

1816
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,780
 at a budget of $125 million.

1817
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:03,380
 It's about trucks with hive mind creatures

1818
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:04,980
 living under the hoods.

1819
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:10,460
 Oh, is that the, what was the,

1820
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:12,700
 it was like the Loch Ness monster looking thing.

1821
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:15,540
 - What does your, what did your wife work for

1822
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:16,520
 for a minute there?

1823
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:18,700
 - A pimp.

1824
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:23,660
 - Okay, after she got done being turned out on the street,

1825
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:27,080
 she decided to go get turned out on the tracks

1826
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:29,260
 with those machines.

1827
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:30,940
 - Was it just called Monster Truck?

1828
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:31,780
 - It sure was.

1829
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:32,900
 - Was that movie just called Monster Truck?

1830
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:33,940
 - It sure was.

1831
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:35,220
 - There you go.

1832
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:36,360
 Monster trucks, yep.

1833
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:40,180
 Yep, there you go.

1834
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:41,100
 Paul, you're up.

1835
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:45,300
 - I'm gonna go, I'm gonna take turkey 800, please.

1836
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:47,300
 I gotta get back on the board.

1837
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:50,540
 - This 1999 movie based on Michael Crichton's novel,

1838
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:54,180
 "Eaters of the Dead" grossed about $62 million worldwide

1839
01:15:54,180 --> 01:15:56,760
 on a bigger than $100 million budget.

1840
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,780
 I guess that was an unlucky number.

1841
01:15:58,780 --> 01:15:59,820
 - I'm gonna tell you what,

1842
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:01,420
 this movie should have made way more money.

1843
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:04,380
 This is not a turkey, this is an exceptional film.

1844
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:09,220
 Antonio Banderas puts in a superstar performance

1845
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:11,260
 in "The 13th Warrior".

1846
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:13,700
 - "The 13th Warrior" is correct.

1847
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:15,620
 - It is such a good movie.

1848
01:16:15,620 --> 01:16:16,460
 - It is good.

1849
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:17,940
 - I have that on DVD.

1850
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:19,620
 That is one of my favorite movies.

1851
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:20,460
 It's a great movie.

1852
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:21,280
 - JJ was just talking about

1853
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:23,180
 how good "Cutthroat Island" is, Paul.

1854
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:25,220
 Don't be too excited to be on her team here.

1855
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:28,820
 - Listen, man, I'm on team "13th Warrior".

1856
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:31,100
 I don't give a shit, "Cutthroat Island", whatever,

1857
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:31,940
 but yeah, "13th Warrior" is good.

1858
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:34,540
 - My favorite movie of all time is "The Phantom"

1859
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:36,700
 with Billy Zane, though, so please do not take that.

1860
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:37,940
 - Stop it, stop it.

1861
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:40,100
 He was the bomb in "Phantoms", yo.

1862
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:46,140
 - Anyone who's absolutely repping Billy Zane first

1863
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:47,940
 is an insane person.

1864
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:51,300
 - No, that's just, that was just--

1865
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:53,060
 - JJ, I know somebody else in town

1866
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:54,540
 that that is their favorite movie.

1867
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:56,060
 - I'm gonna make sure the two of you meet.

1868
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:56,900
 - Really? - Yes.

1869
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:57,720
 - Holy shit.

1870
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:58,560
 - Go, go!

1871
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,580
 - I'm gonna introduce you.

1872
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:02,380
 You don't know them yet. - Oh my god.

1873
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:05,420
 - Matt, you're up. - Oh, this is awesome.

1874
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:06,260
 - You're gonna, you're gonna,

1875
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:08,180
 you better be careful, Jacob.

1876
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:10,760
 You don't wanna get two zaniacs in the same room together.

1877
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,180
 (laughing)

1878
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:14,780
 - Mike a little too zany.

1879
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:16,900
 - It's Matt Franco.

1880
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:19,060
 No, um-- (laughing)

1881
01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:20,340
 - It's always been Matt Franco.

1882
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:22,460
 - It's always been Franco. - Matt Franco.

1883
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:25,620
 - He's got it on a loop in his dressing room.

1884
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:28,340
 - Matt Franco and I literally can talk to each other

1885
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:31,020
 in quotes from '90s Magic Specials

1886
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:33,220
 and only quotes from '90s Magic Specials,

1887
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:34,620
 a full 20 minute conversation. - All right.

1888
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:36,620
 Raise your hand if you're surprised.

1889
01:17:36,620 --> 01:17:37,460
 (laughing)

1890
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:39,300
 Okay, no hands for you. - Raise your hand

1891
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:42,100
 if you wanna be in that room, no hands for you.

1892
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:45,020
 (laughing)

1893
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:46,180
 - JJ, where do we go? - Matt, you're up.

1894
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:47,020
 - Where do we go?

1895
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:51,900
 - Maybe a how it started.

1896
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:52,860
 - How brave are you?

1897
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:54,700
 - Let's do it.

1898
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:55,980
 - How it started for 400.

1899
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:57,740
 This six film franchise originated

1900
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:01,620
 from an unused spec script for an episode of the X-Files.

1901
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:05,420
 It's latest entry grossed over $300 million this year.

1902
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:09,140
 - Six films, huh? - Six films.

1903
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:15,100
 An episode that involves aliens or conspiracies.

1904
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:17,660
 - Okay. - 200 million.

1905
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:20,540
 - Guy girl, guy girl investigators.

1906
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:23,740
 - Huh.

1907
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:24,900
 - Paul, you know this one?

1908
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:28,300
 - It could be something like The Nun.

1909
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:31,140
 You know, they have those one-off kind of ghosty stuff.

1910
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:31,980
 - Oh yeah.

1911
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:34,180
 - You know, monster of the week kind of thing.

1912
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:36,300
 But I'm thinking six films.

1913
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:38,860
 When was this, when was this a scooperty?

1914
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:41,300
 - It's recent.

1915
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,340
 It's a Thanksgiving, it's a Thanksgiving scooperty

1916
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:44,180
 for a commission.

1917
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:46,460
 - 300 million this year.

1918
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:48,460
 So it's a film that came out this year.

1919
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:49,300
 - Yeah. - That's part of

1920
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:51,900
 a school franchise. - So it's a horror movie.

1921
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:55,780
 - Is, what do you call it, up to six movies now?

1922
01:18:55,780 --> 01:19:00,100
 Oh, you know what?

1923
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:04,380
 I think it might be Paranormal Activity.

1924
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:08,460
 - Oh, did that come out this year?

1925
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:11,620
 - I think there was another, I don't know.

1926
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:14,740
 Paranormal Activity or the-- - I'm gonna pass, we're passing.

1927
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:15,740
 - I'm definitely passing.

1928
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:16,580
 Paul, what is it?

1929
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:19,860
 I mean, Paranormal Activity or the Conjuring?

1930
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:22,460
 Is the Conjuring up to six?

1931
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:25,660
 - I don't know, that's literally the question.

1932
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:26,900
 - I'm gonna guess Conjuring, I'm guessing Conjuring.

1933
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:28,500
 - Let's see.

1934
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:29,340
 Final Destination.

1935
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:31,620
 - Oh, I eat my own butt, fart on a shit.

1936
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:32,580
 Okay, I should have known.

1937
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:34,900
 - Wait, my first ink thing was Final Destination,

1938
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:36,020
 but it initially bombed.

1939
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:38,020
 So the fact that it said it reached over 300 million,

1940
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:38,860
 I'm surprised because--

1941
01:19:38,860 --> 01:19:41,020
 - Yeah, this latest reboot was really hot.

1942
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:41,860
 People were really--

1943
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:44,540
 - I think it got like a cult following thing

1944
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:45,620
 with the sequels and all, I think.

1945
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:46,460
 - It's just one of those--

1946
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:47,780
 - And it also got real viral, yeah.

1947
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:49,740
 - I thought it was opening weekend this week,

1948
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:51,300
 and so I didn't guess it.

1949
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:53,540
 - Millennials are desperate to get killed

1950
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:55,860
 by a log carrying truck.

1951
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:56,700
 - Who is it?

1952
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:58,180
 - Oh man, sign me up.

1953
01:19:58,180 --> 01:20:01,340
 - I'll try potpourri for 800.

1954
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:03,380
 - Right back to zero, fart.

1955
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:06,660
 - This is the only current flag of a sovereign country

1956
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:09,660
 without elements in white, red or blue.

1957
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:12,980
 - I got this.

1958
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:14,460
 - White, red or blue.

1959
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:15,300
 - I think I got this too.

1960
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:19,660
 - Is it, I'll take a guess on this one.

1961
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:21,300
 Brazil.

1962
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:23,020
 Is it Brazil maybe?

1963
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:23,860
 - Jamaica.

1964
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:25,580
 - You don't think it's Brazil?

1965
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:27,540
 Oh, I think you might be right.

1966
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:29,340
 It is Jamaica, you were right.

1967
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:30,180
 - Yeah.

1968
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:31,900
 - I got that one wrong.

1969
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:33,020
 - Wait, did I get it right?

1970
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:33,980
 What the hell?

1971
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:35,260
 - You didn't pass, you jerk.

1972
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:36,580
 - I didn't pass, I just got it wrong.

1973
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:38,060
 - I don't give a shit.

1974
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:38,900
 I still want the points.

1975
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,260
 - I lost points.

1976
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:42,140
 I lost points, that's how the game works.

1977
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:42,980
 - Fair enough.

1978
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:43,820
 - Paul, you're up.

1979
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:46,660
 - Popery.

1980
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:49,580
 - 200.

1981
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:51,620
 This name later shared with "Star Wars" characters

1982
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:54,140
 was given to the Mohawk steel workers

1983
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:56,740
 who helped build modern New York City.

1984
01:20:56,740 --> 01:21:01,500
 Ewoks.

1985
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:05,780
 - Ugnaughts? - Called them Ewoks.

1986
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:08,300
 - Sure.

1987
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:11,140
 - Wait, yeah, I'll go with ugnaughts.

1988
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:11,980
 - All right.

1989
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:14,060
 - Skywalkers. - Oh, Skywalkers.

1990
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:15,540
 - Right, right, right, right.

1991
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:17,180
 - That makes a lot of sense.

1992
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:18,460
 See Paul, since that was your turn,

1993
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:20,860
 I'm gonna address your points with that question.

1994
01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:21,700
 There you go, you.

1995
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:22,540
 - Thank you.

1996
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:25,580
 - Matt.

1997
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:27,900
 - JJ, JJ controls me.

1998
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:31,780
 - What's their number 600?

1999
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:34,500
 - What's their number for 600?

2000
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:35,340
 Daily Devil.

2001
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:37,940
 - Oh shit.

2002
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:40,220
 - Yeah, it's on the line now.

2003
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:45,220
 - The current pope is Pope Leo the what?

2004
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:46,780
 - Oh shit.

2005
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:48,180
 - I don't give a shit about the popes.

2006
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:51,860
 - The American from Chicago.

2007
01:21:51,860 --> 01:21:53,100
 - The popiest pope that ever pope.

2008
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:54,820
 - Oh, I love it, Richard.

2009
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:56,380
 - Pope Leo the Bears.

2010
01:21:56,380 --> 01:22:01,620
 - I would rather be locked in a Scottish basement

2011
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:03,820
 than figure out whose pope is whose.

2012
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:06,500
 I will.

2013
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:09,100
 - If you would ask for his name,

2014
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:10,740
 I could not have given you Leo.

2015
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:12,180
 - Right.

2016
01:22:12,180 --> 01:22:13,740
 - Like I said, I know he's from Chicago.

2017
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:15,660
 - I know he's Chicago, that's all I know.

2018
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:16,500
 - Yeah, I know.

2019
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:20,340
 - He literally had a rave at the Vatican like last week.

2020
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:21,580
 - I get it, JJ.

2021
01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:24,620
 I hate people who try to make these popes hip and likable.

2022
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:25,940
 It's like, okay, okay.

2023
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:30,180
 - Yeah, but this pope has really good drugs.

2024
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:32,100
 - And good pizza.

2025
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:34,380
 - All right, six though.

2026
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:35,660
 - Matt, try six.

2027
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:37,700
 14.

2028
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:39,020
 - Oh, mystify.

2029
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:40,300
 - Mystify that much?

2030
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:41,140
 Close.

2031
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:42,140
 - There's been a lot of Leos.

2032
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:42,980
 - Good Lord.

2033
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:48,140
 - It's me, I'll try, I don't know how it started, 600.

2034
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:51,060
 This 1992 movie turned Tony winning musical

2035
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:53,540
 was originally conceived as an entry

2036
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:55,900
 of "Tales from the Crypt."

2037
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:56,740
 - Ooh.

2038
01:22:56,740 --> 01:23:02,660
 - 1992 movie turned Tony winning musical,

2039
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:04,900
 "Tales from the Crypt."

2040
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:07,060
 That is of course, "The Lion King."

2041
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:11,060
 - The Lion King.

2042
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:11,900
 - Really?

2043
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:13,100
 - Huh, no, I don't know.

2044
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:15,820
 - Well.

2045
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:16,660
 - Oh, he's impressed.

2046
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:17,500
 - What do we got?

2047
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:18,340
 - Andy, she guessed Annie.

2048
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:19,180
 - '92.

2049
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:22,420
 - '92 musical.

2050
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:27,100
 - I think I got it, I think I got it.

2051
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:28,700
 - I mean, I gotta pass, Paul, it passes to you.

2052
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:29,820
 What do you think?

2053
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:32,380
 - I gotta guess "Beetlejuice."

2054
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:33,580
 - Yeah, as I guess. - Oh, okay.

2055
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:35,100
 That's gotta be it, yeah.

2056
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:36,340
 Oh no, "Death Becomes Her."

2057
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:38,100
 - Boo.

2058
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:39,340
 - "Death Becomes Her."

2059
01:23:39,340 --> 01:23:40,500
 - I lied, more points. - He passed to Paul.

2060
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:41,340
 He lost the point.

2061
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:42,740
 - Even more points away. - I heard that show's

2062
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:44,580
 amazing though.

2063
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:47,820
 - SJ saw it right before it got nominated for the Tony.

2064
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:50,180
 So she saw it like with a half empty audience

2065
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:51,500
 with the original cast and was like,

2066
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:53,020
 "Oh, this is just spectacular."

2067
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:54,740
 She was so mad that I didn't see it with her.

2068
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:55,580
 - Oh wow.

2069
01:23:55,580 --> 01:23:56,420
 - Paul, you're up.

2070
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:57,620
 - I'll do "How It Started for Eight"

2071
01:23:57,620 --> 01:23:59,740
 to try and get back into negative nothing.

2072
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:00,860
 - Get in there.

2073
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:03,220
 This four time Golden Globe nominee

2074
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:05,460
 was originally cast as Sonya Blade

2075
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:07,660
 in 1995's "Mortal Kombat."

2076
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:09,540
 Unfortunately, or fortunately,

2077
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:11,660
 she broke her wrist while training for the role

2078
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:14,500
 and was replaced by that lady who married Pete Sampras.

2079
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:16,300
 - Right, this was...

2080
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:21,180
 - Kate Winslet.

2081
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:22,900
 - Carmen, not Carmen.

2082
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:26,300
 Her name was Carmen in that fucking thing.

2083
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:27,140
 - Carmen Electra? - Shit.

2084
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:30,060
 No, it's, there's something about marriage.

2085
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:32,180
 Cameron Diaz, Cameron Diaz, Cameron Diaz.

2086
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:35,180
 - Cameron Diaz is correct.

2087
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:37,220
 - I know my "Mortal Kombat" trilogy.

2088
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:38,820
 - Trivia. - Do.

2089
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:40,260
 - Yeah.

2090
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:42,740
 - That gets Matt all the way back to zero,

2091
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:45,260
 which puts him in the lead with zero points.

2092
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:49,140
 Matt is at negative 200 and I am at negative 400.

2093
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:50,260
 Thanks a lot, ML Kennedy.

2094
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:51,340
 Matt, you're up.

2095
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:52,660
 You got four questions left.

2096
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:53,980
 - It's anyone's game.

2097
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:57,580
 - I think there's a daily double left too.

2098
01:24:57,580 --> 01:25:02,940
 - Let's go with potpourri for 400.

2099
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:08,140
 The roots of this ice cream come from Greek words

2100
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:10,020
 meaning new and city.

2101
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:15,140
 - The roots of this ice cream name?

2102
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:16,260
 - Mm-hmm.

2103
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:17,780
 - Huh.

2104
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:20,380
 Ben and Jerry.

2105
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:22,020
 - Hagen Daz.

2106
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:27,420
 JJ, you know any Greek words for new?

2107
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:30,180
 - Nope.

2108
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:34,380
 - Moose tracks.

2109
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:36,180
 - So I'm just repeating everybody in the chat.

2110
01:25:36,180 --> 01:25:37,300
 - What's my yogurt?

2111
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:41,180
 My faille, what's on my yogurt container?

2112
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:44,340
 Or what do all the captains say?

2113
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:45,660
 You probably know some Greek.

2114
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:46,900
 All the captains are Greek.

2115
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:47,740
 - That's true.

2116
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:49,060
 - Is it Hagen Daz?

2117
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:53,300
 - Is this a--

2118
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:54,500
 - Hagen Daz is a made-up name.

2119
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:55,660
 - No, it's not a daily double.

2120
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:56,700
 - Oh, then what am I doing?

2121
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:58,180
 Pass, I don't give a shit.

2122
01:25:58,180 --> 01:25:59,580
 - Yeah, I passed too, Paul.

2123
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:01,980
 - No, I passed, I have no idea.

2124
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:02,820
 - Neapolitan.

2125
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:05,860
 (all groaning)

2126
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:06,700
 - We're so dumb.

2127
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:08,220
 - If only any of us had thought about the show

2128
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:09,900
 that we're currently on.

2129
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:11,460
 Let's see, I'll try to get some points.

2130
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:12,980
 What's their number for 800?

2131
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:18,580
 The youngest of George Foreman's sons is named what?

2132
01:26:18,580 --> 01:26:21,020
 I believe it's George.

2133
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:21,860
 - I think you're right.

2134
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:23,700
 - I think they're just all named George.

2135
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:26,060
 It's George VI, the little Joey.

2136
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:27,420
 - Little Joey.

2137
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:28,460
 - Little Joey.

2138
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:29,580
 Wait, do I get credit for George?

2139
01:26:29,580 --> 01:26:30,420
 - Yes.

2140
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:33,260
 - Wait, no, it was in the category of what's the number?

2141
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:35,580
 - Yup.

2142
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:36,780
 - I don't know.

2143
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:37,860
 Was it?

2144
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:40,020
 If it was what's the number, then I got it wrong.

2145
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:41,540
 - Oh, 'cause what's the number?

2146
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:42,740
 - I did not answer a number.

2147
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:44,140
 - Oh, right.

2148
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:45,260
 - Oh, how it started.

2149
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:46,340
 Oh, no, it was what's their number.

2150
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:48,140
 It was what's their number, yeah.

2151
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:49,820
 Yeah, so no, I didn't deserve those points

2152
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:51,020
 and I didn't get them.

2153
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:51,860
 Paul, you're up.

2154
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:55,220
 You got what's their number for 400 or turkeys for 200?

2155
01:26:55,220 --> 01:26:56,620
 - I'll try turkeys for two.

2156
01:26:58,180 --> 01:27:02,140
 - This 2012 Disney movie based off a "Princess of Mars"

2157
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:06,060
 managed to lose somewhere around $200 million for the studio.

2158
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:07,260
 The movie isn't bad.

2159
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:11,100
 - John Carter.

2160
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:12,140
 - Paul has other thoughts.

2161
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:14,140
 - John Carter of Mars.

2162
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:15,980
 - John Carter of Mars.

2163
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:17,460
 Yes, John Carter. - Oh, it was just John Carter.

2164
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:18,300
 - Yeah, yeah.

2165
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:19,120
 Yeah, so you got that wrong.

2166
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:19,960
 You said of Mars.

2167
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:21,780
 - I did say of Mars. - And that is incorrect.

2168
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:25,100
 And Matt closing out the category and the game.

2169
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:26,220
 Going for the tie.

2170
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:28,580
 - Going for the tie, high stakes.

2171
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:29,980
 - What's their number?

2172
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:31,380
 And it's a daily double.

2173
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:32,500
 - Oh shit.

2174
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:33,780
 - It doesn't increase anything.

2175
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:34,620
 - Oh, that's right.

2176
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:35,580
 - It doesn't.

2177
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:39,260
 The current King of England is King Charles the what?

2178
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:41,980
 - The gracious. - The King.

2179
01:27:41,980 --> 01:27:43,380
 - Charles's have there been.

2180
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:47,540
 - Boy, if there was ever a time to start up

2181
01:27:47,540 --> 01:27:49,300
 a new Charles in charge.

2182
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:52,340
 - Let's see, Elizabeth was Elizabeth the second.

2183
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:54,180
 So that would make King Charles.

2184
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:56,740
 - Scott Baio is King Charles.

2185
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:58,500
 - Oh, it's a daily double.

2186
01:27:58,500 --> 01:27:59,660
 So I have to guess.

2187
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:05,140
 - The good thing is you know that it's a number.

2188
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:07,620
 So it's not like there are infinite wrong answers.

2189
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:10,220
 - I'll go with third.

2190
01:28:10,220 --> 01:28:14,900
 - King Charles the third is correct.

2191
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:16,460
 - Wow.

2192
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:17,740
 - Well done, Matt.

2193
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:19,100
 That is the game.

2194
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:23,820
 Matt and Paul are tied at 200 points a piece.

2195
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:25,940
 I have negative 1200 points.

2196
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:27,940
 But since of course, Matt and Paul tied,

2197
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:29,820
 cat's game, I win.

2198
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:30,860
 - Jacob wins.

2199
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:32,020
 - Jacob wins.

2200
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:34,060
 - Congratulations, Jacob.

2201
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:35,260
 - I know that's from ML Kennedy.

2202
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:36,100
 Thank you, thank you.

2203
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:37,940
 - I hope when they, 'cause we get updates

2204
01:28:37,940 --> 01:28:41,100
 of who writes them, they score them, right?

2205
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:42,700
 But I hope they get it right,

2206
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:45,020
 where they score your win for Paul and I tie.

2207
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:45,860
 I hope that was part of the--

2208
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:47,700
 - Oh yeah, you guys get the points.

2209
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:49,220
 Yeah, you get the points in the--

2210
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:51,260
 - Right, in the points totals, but yeah.

2211
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:53,100
 - Yeah, but I should get credit for the win.

2212
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:55,060
 - That was a really good one, ML Kennedy, thank you.

2213
01:28:55,060 --> 01:28:56,700
 That was an excellent scooperty.

2214
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:57,740
 - That was.

2215
01:28:57,740 --> 01:28:59,100
 If you wanna send us a scooperty,

2216
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:02,060
 just like ML Kennedy did, heyscoops.com is where you can go.

2217
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:03,540

01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:08,580
 You can make us an Obelisk jock versus nerd.

 You can do all those things over there at heyscoops.com.

2222

 You can also send us an email over there.

2223
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:15,980
 We read emails on the show from time to time.

2224
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:18,820
 Matt, I have a piece of physical scoop mail here for you

2225
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:21,540
 that a house guest of mine brought for you.

2226
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:22,660
 - Oh, well then there you go.

2227
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:24,700
 - My friend, Scott Burrell from Natchitoches

2228
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:26,140
 is in town right now.

2229
01:29:26,140 --> 01:29:28,180
 And he brought you a Bruce Springsteen

2230
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:30,580
 and the E Street Band tour hat.

2231
01:29:30,580 --> 01:29:31,660
 - Yes. - Wow.

2232
01:29:31,660 --> 01:29:33,260
 - From their 1999 tour.

2233
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:34,420
 - That's so cool. - Or 1990.

2234
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:35,460
 - Yeah, 1999 tour.

2235
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:36,340
 - Wow.

2236
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:38,860
 - That was when they reunited.

2237
01:29:38,860 --> 01:29:40,820
 - Yeah, so I've got a hat here for you.

2238
01:29:40,820 --> 01:29:42,740
 - Freaking awesome.

2239
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:44,860
 - Yes, I'm very excited about that hat.

2240
01:29:44,860 --> 01:29:47,020
 I wanna thank Dr. Mike for stopping by today.

2241
01:29:47,020 --> 01:29:49,180
 - Yes, absolutely, thank you, Dr. Mike.

2242
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:51,380
 - He and I have been texting since he got off air.

2243
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:53,100
 Next time we do a double episode,

2244
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:54,540
 'cause when we do two episodes,

2245
01:29:54,540 --> 01:29:58,060
 he can wake up at a reasonable hour and join us.

2246
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:00,860
 We're gonna do a Dr. Mike answers

2247
01:30:00,860 --> 01:30:02,500
 all of our medical questions episode.

2248
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:04,140
 We'll tell the scoops in advance.

2249
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:05,900
 - Oh, good, yes.

2250
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:07,780
 - All the scoops. - That's a great idea.

2251
01:30:07,780 --> 01:30:09,380
 That's a brilliant idea.

2252
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:11,460
 We should do that sooner than later, yeah.

 The page is actually called Help Finish Hey Scoops the Movie.

2439
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:43,740
 They are currently 70% on their way to the goal.

2440
01:37:43,740 --> 01:37:44,740
 - Yeah, so yeah. - But we wanna push it

2441
01:37:44,740 --> 01:37:45,940
 past the goal, we wanna get it really--

2442
01:37:45,940 --> 01:37:47,820
 - And we wanna go past the goal, of course, yeah.

2443
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:50,560
 'Cause there's gonna be more expenses and everything,

2444
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:52,980
 that it's gonna be a bit of a moving target,

2445
01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:56,060
 but it's gonna be all reasonable and great.

2446
01:37:56,060 --> 01:37:59,120
 So if you're interested at all in the Hey Scoops Movie,

2448
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:03,100
 - How big of a role does Vinny have in the documentary?

2449
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:05,940
 - I was gonna ask if he's in that day movie.

2450
01:38:05,940 --> 01:38:08,500
 I mean, the day that they were filming the movie,

2451
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:09,780
 I'm sure he did.

2452
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:11,780
 - I think he's the narrator, right?

2453
01:38:11,780 --> 01:38:14,020
 Yeah, he's like the-- - He's the narrator.

2454
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:16,540
 - He's the Jiminy Cricket, I think, of the movie.

2455
01:38:16,540 --> 01:38:20,940
 - No, no, no, no, not okay. - No, no.

2456

2460
01:38:32,260 --> 01:38:33,100

2468
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:49,320
 I'm on top of it. - Oh, right.

2469
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:51,940
 - Does anyone else have any announcements?

2470
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:52,780
 - Yeah.

2471
01:38:52,780 --> 01:38:54,660
 - Tomorrow, Hangout, seven p.m.

2472
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:55,500
 But that's Wednesday. - No, no,

2473
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:57,340
 that was last week, Paul. - And this is going out

2474
01:38:57,340 --> 01:38:58,620
 Thanksgiving, right? - Monday.

 Okay, great. - This is our post

01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:03,380
 Thanksgiving episode, this is our Monday

2478
01:39:03,380 --> 01:39:04,220
 after Thanksgiving episode.

2479
01:39:04,220 --> 01:39:05,700
 - Oh. - We're all so full.

2480
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:07,380
 - This is our tryptophan episode.

2481
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:08,620
 - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah.

2482
01:39:08,620 --> 01:39:11,440
 - So we hope that you use some song lyrics

2483
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:14,500
 if you got challenged to say grace at your table.

2484
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:15,540
 - Yeah, don't forget to do the--

2485
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:17,620
 - Bermuda, my mama, come on, pretty mama.

2486
01:39:17,620 --> 01:39:19,620
 - Yeah, how far can you get into-- - The Kokomo challenge.

2487
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:21,620
 - The Kokomo challenge, how much Kokomo?

2488
01:39:21,620 --> 01:39:23,240
 Can you fake for grace?

2489
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:27,220
 That's what, that's always-- (laughing)

2490
01:39:27,220 --> 01:39:28,740
 - If you didn't do it at Thanksgiving,

2491
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:29,900
 Christmas is right around the corner.

2492
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:32,740
 - That's right, they always get a chance.

2493
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:34,980
 I want somebody to get through it 100% one of these days,

2494
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:35,940
 it's gonna be awesome.

2495
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:37,900
 - I think the Kokomo challenge is one of the funniest

2496
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:39,060
 things we've ever done.

2497
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:40,660
 - It is, it's pretty great. - It really is.

2498
01:39:40,660 --> 01:39:42,180
 It really is, we should've stopped there.

2499
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:45,140
 - 'Cause a lot of it sounds like a prayer.

2500
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:46,580
 - Yeah.

2501
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:47,820
 All right, thanks for this, everybody.

01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:56,820
 - That dreamy look in your eyes

2505
01:39:56,820 --> 01:39:59,700
 gives me a tropical contact high.

2506
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:02,820
 Thank you, Jesus. (laughing)
