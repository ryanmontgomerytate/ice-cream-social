**[0:04:56]** Ranch slunk coming through with blats valentine's there's valentine's ale back in the day

**[0:05:01]** Mm-hmm. Anyhow, I'll figure it out. I'll figure it out schlitz

**[0:05:07]** Sliding on uh, yes schlitz is still made and is currently owned by uh pats brood company. There we go. Wow

**[0:05:14]** Yeah, they probably bought all the vintage and they reintroduced the original 1960s formula

**[0:05:19]** It's it's brood and milwaukie. They but milwaukie as we know milwaukie in missouri both start with an m

**[0:05:25]** So I think that's fine

**[0:05:26]** they have a uh

**[0:05:29]** Some kind of cornered market

**[0:05:32]** on all the

**[0:05:34]** Nasty sounding names for beers

**[0:05:36]** This is classic old beers. This is classic old factory worker beers, man. They all just sounded like

**[0:05:42]** bodily functions

**[0:05:43]** shapers

**[0:05:44]** Yeah, oh god. I got a bad case of the shapers. I should have I should have got the vax when I had the chance

**[0:05:50]** No, I'm going I'm going through milwaukie

**[0:05:52]** uh

**[0:05:53]** with the with the jokers of magic

**[0:05:55]** um

**[0:05:56]** I was there last time we built the foolershow in milwaukie and doing paps at the paps center was like so fun

**[0:06:03]** Oh, right. Um

**[0:06:05]** I thought it was more cool than the audience did the audience didn't give a shit, but um

**[0:06:09]** I thought it was super fun

**[0:06:11]** They paps their prime

**[0:06:14]** Yep, they're paps. They're paps

**[0:06:17]** Uh, I finished up my uh f1 weekend. Uh, oh, yeah

**[0:06:22]** Oh, yeah, how was the rest of f1?

**[0:06:24]** Well, yeah, I was uh

**[0:06:25]** Basically trying to figure out the story didn't end well last time we were recording

**[0:06:28]** So I didn't get into too much of the nitty gritty details, but right the bottom line is uh

**[0:06:33]** They thought it'd be really funny to have two inept announcers announce some of the marquis events at the ski lodge

**[0:06:39]** For all three nights at at the uh at the f at the mercedes tent, right?

**[0:06:45]** um

**[0:06:45]** And the race is about an hour and a half long

**[0:06:49]** and having inept announcers

**[0:06:51]** uh

**[0:06:52]** For an hour and a half for an hour and a half is a little is a little long

**[0:06:55]** Are you one of the inept announcers? Yes. That's that was my job

**[0:07:01]** I mean was it

**[0:07:03]** Did you have breaks?

**[0:07:05]** Yes, or more importantly did the audience have breaks? Well, we we we eventually we figured out. Yes

**[0:07:12]** you know good good so, uh, we

**[0:07:15]** But uh, it was funny was like so we we were brought in right and then we came up with all these things for all these characters to be

**[0:07:22]** I came up with stetson barber. You can call me big barbie

**[0:07:26]** and uh

**[0:07:28]** We were going to do all these games and everything and uh

**[0:07:33]** All of a sudden we were at our first brainstorm session and they said oh

**[0:07:36]** We just have to you know film something and send it to Mercedes just so they know what's going on. Oh jesus

**[0:07:42]** Exactly exactly exactly exactly

**[0:07:45]** Just instantly

**[0:07:46]** So I was like film what like what are we shooting over right and it was like, you know

**[0:07:51]** And so it was it was me and uh, kasey wilson, right?

**[0:07:54]** friend of the friend of the show we love kasey

**[0:07:57]** and Mercedes based out of

**[0:08:00]** germany

**[0:08:01]** well, yeah international

**[0:08:04]** international

**[0:08:05]** automobile behemoth Mercedes Benz. Yeah, where's their

**[0:08:09]** Core base is the germany?

**[0:08:11]** I mean they're they're originally from germany. I don't know where they're based now

**[0:08:14]** Right exactly. I now's your chance to put on your best german

**[0:08:18]** And give them the kind of inept announcer

**[0:08:21]** That's really gonna sell it

**[0:08:22]** My lieber I can't believe what has happened with the car

**[0:08:28]** The tires they're rolling over and over the potholes

**[0:08:32]** And and the potholes are wet

**[0:08:35]** Why are we so much rain in the vegas?

**[0:08:40]** The rain didn't do the effect. How many cars are there? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

**[0:08:46]** nine nine cars

**[0:08:48]** There are nine cars. nine

**[0:08:52]** Uh, Mercedes still based in germany. Yes Mercedes are going to Benz the rules to win. That is what we do

**[0:09:03]** So, uh, uh, who welcomed f1. I'm your host Dieter

**[0:09:07]** exactly

**[0:09:08]** Now it's a time on sprockets for every race

**[0:09:12]** That's that's next year, man. You just beat Dieter

**[0:09:16]** So we're filming by the way like kasey and I came in for like a brain door

**[0:09:19]** You know a day at the office brainstorming session. We weren't dressed

**[0:09:24]** Like particularly flashy or well or in character or anything

**[0:09:29]** And so you didn't have your uh, you had your casual tuxedo on not your show tuxedo

**[0:09:33]** And so we had different people to manage the project different people to brainstorm. There wasn't necessarily a distinct director

**[0:09:42]** So we're going to make this video. I was like, what's so what's this video?

**[0:09:45]** I'm like, they just want to see stuff and I was like, which stuff, you know

**[0:09:48]** and so

**[0:09:50]** I kind of help orchestrate like a four phase flow to take one of the video right good

**[0:09:56]** And we finish and I go, okay. Well, that's the take and then I go

**[0:10:00]** We can we can cut up the best bits of that maybe it may be we'll do another run

**[0:10:04]** Uh, and we'll just do fresh bits. Uh, who who's editing this?

**[0:10:09]** Oh

**[0:10:10]** Oh

**[0:10:11]** Sweet summer child matt

**[0:10:15]** They're getting this raw. They're gonna be lucky

**[0:10:18]** You know what this is it's going to be on a flash card

**[0:10:20]** Mailed by a ups and it's going to get there in five weeks. They're going to be like, what's this loss?

**[0:10:26]** Oh, I was I was expecting you to say what are you talking about matt? I just sent it

**[0:10:32]** Right, that is basically what was what was happening. Oh shit

**[0:10:36]** so

**[0:10:37]** Our project was like, well, I don't see myself like editing a lot. I mean I can cut the

**[0:10:40]** There, but I'm gonna

**[0:10:43]** I don't see myself doing a lot

**[0:10:45]** That dang jaco, we need to get you that t-shirt. I don't I don't see myself doing a lot of editing here

**[0:10:55]** Hold on so

**[0:10:58]** Uh, I was like, well if we're not editing then I don't think we should do a second take right like because we're we're not gonna

**[0:11:07]** We're not gonna come we can't we can't edit the takes together

**[0:11:10]** And the magic's gonna be lost by the time it gets around to the second roll, right? Yeah

**[0:11:14]** You're gonna watch 20 minutes of stuff instead of 10 minutes of stuff that you know, whatever

**[0:11:19]** and so

**[0:11:21]** I I'm like, and I was like, I feel like I feel like this is a bad idea

**[0:11:27]** You were you were right matt. You were right. Your instincts were dead

**[0:11:30]** I was like, we're not really showing them what we can do or whatever and they go

**[0:11:35]** No, they just want a gist of what's going on

**[0:11:40]** And I was said

**[0:11:41]** It's a casey. I was like, I've never known any corporate client let alone even production companies. I've pitched projects to

**[0:11:49]** To show a single ounce of imagination when it comes to like what's going on

**[0:11:53]** Nobody wants the gist of it. They want to see what the finished product is

**[0:11:58]** The only thing that that kind of video does

**[0:12:01]** Is let a middle management person say no

**[0:12:05]** That's exactly what I was thinking. I was like, I was like, I that's all I was thinking. I was like, oh gosh

**[0:12:09]** I might not get to do this gig. That's all it is

**[0:12:13]** That's all that is that's all that that's all they do is say no

**[0:12:17]** Because they're so scared to death of taking credit for anything that could go wrong

**[0:12:22]** right now

**[0:12:23]** to

**[0:12:24]** My cruise credit

**[0:12:26]** They this is not their first radio with Mercedes, right? So they've gone around around with them before

**[0:12:31]** So they kind of knew what Mercedes likes. Well, they just simply

**[0:12:36]** Been like, you know, they've simply presented stuff where Mercedes was skeptical

**[0:12:40]** And then all of a sudden it goes off without a hitch and they're and they're happy and thrilled them

**[0:12:45]** Okay. Oh, so I that's true. The the company has some credit with the with the car company. Yeah

**[0:12:52]** Like for example, this is a multiple times that I was I was performing a thing called the ski lodge

**[0:12:55]** I'm sure the first time they said, hey, we want to shove a giant ski lodge in the back of your

**[0:13:00]** Hospitality area. They were kind of I'm sure the first thing was like what what how does that make me sure some eyebrows went up

**[0:13:06]** Right

**[0:13:07]** And now it's like some people's like favorite part of the whole attraction

**[0:13:10]** And so now nice lodge has been getting bigger and bigger with each race and this is like the fourth race

**[0:13:15]** They've had a ski lodge, right? Very cool. It's going to be an alpine village by the time

**[0:13:20]** The next race, right? I hope so. I mean, I doubt I'll be at some point. I hope so

**[0:13:25]** It's just going to be the winter olympics happening and an f1 race breaks out

**[0:13:33]** And uh

**[0:13:35]** So they're setting off the video and then all of a sudden I get a call

**[0:13:38]** I was like, hey, instead of uh noon to three tomorrow, can you come from 11 to five?

**[0:13:45]** Hold on. I'm just doing some some quick back of the napkin math here

**[0:13:51]** And I joke I wrote the video went over that well, huh?

**[0:13:59]** Yeah

**[0:14:01]** Did anyone I know the answer to this did anyone acknowledge that maybe we shouldn't have said that video?

**[0:14:07]** No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We have notes. We have notes. No

**[0:14:14]** No

**[0:14:15]** No one will ever say in any industry. I don't know. Maybe I think I did yesterday. I just shouldn't have done it

**[0:14:21]** But this is where the uh, uh, uh, our our team leader was super smart

**[0:14:27]** We came in the state for a long time

**[0:14:29]** And uh case and I brought in stuff to look more professional

**[0:14:33]** uh

**[0:14:34]** And smart smart they said let's do another round

**[0:14:37]** But let's bring in everyone from the office and let's do it with a with an audience

**[0:14:42]** Oh, that's smart. It was smart. It was smart

**[0:14:46]** Uh, oh because your stuff reads with human beings

**[0:14:51]** Not just yeah

**[0:14:52]** Of course, no

**[0:14:54]** That's exactly how it is god. It's okay. They just want the gist of it. It's so different

**[0:14:59]** It's honestly it's why I love how we're doing our recordings now with our live audience

**[0:15:04]** It helps me tremendously when I'm doing my bits to see if people give it half a damn about it

**[0:15:09]** Right, right. Sometimes it do the answer is no, but

**[0:15:13]** Once in a while

**[0:15:19]** It's such a pleasant surprise everybody's like fuck that shit. We all hate they're all throwing their hands up

**[0:15:25]** Give me the booze

**[0:15:28]** Yeah, just thumbs down to camera. Yeah, get the fuck out of here, man

**[0:15:32]** With your garbage. They're just waiting for you to put on a bikini and do shots in a hot tub

**[0:15:36]** That's like all like all the other twitch broadcasts figured out honestly

**[0:15:39]** I've been waiting for that for 12 years start up and only fans and just do it. I'd fucking do it

**[0:15:45]** There probably is a market. I don't know. I've already got something of a user base. Maybe I should look into it

**[0:15:51]** Why not? It's already a market

**[0:15:52]** Wait a second Jacob. Did you just hear that in 20 seconds? Paul talked himself into doing an only fans like

**[0:15:57]** Oh, you think I've been thinking about this just today son

**[0:16:01]** Please you started with I can't do an only fans and then in three sentences said I guess I can

**[0:16:09]** I can't

**[0:16:11]** I'm doing one right now

**[0:16:16]** There was there was somebody who wanted us to do an only fans and do like uh stand up

**[0:16:22]** On on only fans. Do you remember that several years ago? I don't wait. I don't remember this at all

**[0:16:27]** Someone told us that we should do comedy somebody pitch this to us that we should do uh stand up and uh improv

**[0:16:33]** On our only fans. Oh

**[0:16:36]** And I think we all had that reaction. I think we all went like oh

**[0:16:39]** All right

**[0:16:44]** We've already failed to thrive on twitch

**[0:16:46]** We might as well add another platform that we tank on we should just do that

**[0:16:50]** Hey your definition of thrive

**[0:16:53]** Pump the brakes. We can get on every platform that is made for something else and do comedy

**[0:17:02]** Just just us uh doing doing live performances where people just tell take our clothes off while we do it

**[0:17:08]** The truth is I'd be really refreshing. I've never felt that attraction, you know that that kind of attention before

**[0:17:13]** It'd be fun matt take off your pants. Oh wow take take him off matt. It feels good

**[0:17:18]** Yeah, it's nice and airy right you guys start pantsless fridays

**[0:17:22]** I I get that uh, I get that I would be um

**[0:17:26]** I get that it would get old

**[0:17:27]** You know for for any for any of our more attractive listeners out there who who suffer harassment on the on the regular basis

**[0:17:34]** I'm not trying to belittle your harassment. I understand that maybe we get old

**[0:17:38]** It's just never happened to me. So uh, it's a novelty at this point

**[0:17:42]** I think if you open up a channel called bare necessities, I think you'd be a hit and I think that's all I need

**[0:17:48]** Be good to go might be a different demographic than you're used to but I think you're ready to rock

**[0:17:52]** Attention is attention and money is money, man. I don't know

**[0:17:55]** It sure is

**[0:17:57]** I think it would be hard to you know, tell the kids don't come upstairs daddy's doing a bare photo shoot for his only fans

**[0:18:03]** Like it might be a little tougher to pull off though. You're right. It it would be hard

**[0:18:09]** Real hard

**[0:18:11]** Lumberjack in it. That's a great name

**[0:18:13]** That's not a bad one

**[0:18:16]** That's not a bad one

**[0:18:17]** Yeah, I found the like ML Kennedy. Hey scoop starts a farmer's only profile

**[0:18:21]** Get my my flannels on here. That's all I need

**[0:18:27]** Only flannels. How about only flannels only flannels?

**[0:18:31]** Oh that has to already exist, right? Let's see

**[0:18:38]** Only flannels.com

**[0:18:41]** Let's see only flannels.com

**[0:18:46]** The fuck

**[0:18:48]** Oh jesus

**[0:18:50]** No, that was another twitch channel. I don't know how that came up. Oh weird. That's weird only flannels has a twitch channel already

**[0:18:57]** Only flannels.com seems to be a twitch channel. Okay

**[0:19:02]** So I guess that's it smart

**[0:19:05]** Somebody beat us to it. Yeah, good job

**[0:19:08]** Or they I'll tell you who else uh beat us to that

**[0:19:13]** Lumberjack in it that's sweet sweet lumberjack in it. All right, that is the following sponsor

**[0:21:15]** I shouldn't have done it but I did but you know I didn't pay much

**[0:21:20]** I paid like 40 grand to this guy and I got like 18 high-rise apartment buildings for 40 grand

**[0:21:27]** I thought that's pretty good turns out the tax lien on him

**[0:21:31]** 18 million who knew well I've had a done with due diligence I would

**[0:21:37]** But didn't I saw it don't how about you

**[0:21:42]** Come and stay and then you know you can buy him off of me for a dollar

**[0:21:47]** I'll sell him real cheap now you do have the tax lien liability while that goes over but

**[0:21:54]** Who's coming for it? I mean really?

**[0:21:58]** Nobody nobody's coming to take it take it from a McGillicuddy

**[0:22:01]** You can trust me no one's come to collect from me

**[0:22:06]** No one wants these old abandoned high-rises

**[0:22:09]** Except for circus folk

**[0:22:12]** Apparently circus folk are real interested in abandoned high-rises had I had a wee lad

**[0:22:17]** And a fat man come over and say hey, how about we take your place for circus use?

**[0:22:23]** I don't know

**[0:22:25]** What are you the big guy and he says yeah, I'm the fat man in the circus and the little guy says yeah

**[0:22:29]** I'm the little guy in the circus

**[0:22:31]** And then sure enough they had a giraffe with them too

**[0:22:35]** And a monkey and a lady who could dance on a zebra's back

**[0:22:40]** I couldn't believe it and she said I'd kind of do anything but dance on a zebra's back

**[0:22:45]** I can't dance on regular surfaces because they're too flat and require the spine of a zebra to impact my

**[0:22:53]** Feet in order to enable my dancing. I thought that's strange, isn't it? That doesn't make a whole lot of sense

**[0:22:59]** Turns out they weren't circus people at all. They were aliens

**[0:23:04]** So these high-rise apartments are very

**[0:23:08]** Very nice looking to the aliens who are coming to take us over

**[0:23:12]** I should have known from the one guy who was real big and fat and the little guy there's little guy crawled in him

**[0:23:17]** They later on they crawled inside of him

**[0:23:21]** Yeah, I should have known there's something fish something alien going on about that. I should have asked

**[0:23:25]** I'm the lady who dances on zebras

**[0:23:28]** She didn't have a zebra

**[0:23:30]** You know like she didn't have a zebra. They didn't have a giraffe though

**[0:23:36]** At least that's what they told me it was could have been a stretched out dog

**[0:23:42]** I'm not a hundred percent

**[0:23:45]** I don't know anyway. Come on by

**[0:23:49]** Try out my houses. What are rotten from the inside? They're not good

**[0:23:54]** I'm tired of selling them the alien circus people

**[0:26:09]** Did you have the there's still the only ones that have signed the stage? I was gonna say

**[0:26:12]** The new band will have to sign the stage

**[0:26:15]** We haven't named the new band yet. Is is an as-yet unnamed band

**[0:26:19]** What's the uh criteria? Nope. Nope. It's a corporate band Paul. What do you mean? It's a what?

**[0:26:27]** It's a it's mainly a corporate band. It's okay name that band. Let's go. Let's name them

**[0:26:35]** Now, all right. So so uh, it looks like it looks like general rock. Is that what i'm saying

**[0:26:40]** General rock. Yeah, it's a military band. Uh general rock

**[0:26:44]** There it is. Oh my god. Would that would you say a military band general rock? Oh my god general rock

**[0:26:49]** Four star general rock four star general rock

**[0:26:54]** I don't know what i'm allowed to say about the band. I didn't I didn't discuss

**[0:26:58]** Press with sj. All right, right. Good point. But uh, but yeah, no, it's it's a uh, they're they're the plan is to tour around

**[0:27:05]** Probably this coming summer

**[0:27:07]** Uh and get a get a lot of dates just all over the all over the united states

**[0:27:11]** How about pussy bucket? I feel like that'd be a good corporate band

**[0:27:16]** That is one that is on the board already. Uh, it's it's high up there. It's not number one

**[0:27:21]** But it is it's pretty high up there. I'm on the side between cock magnet and cock and balls magnet

**[0:27:27]** Uh, do do do uh front people. Um, yes, so you can go with a lady song or a band song. Yeah, yeah

**[0:27:36]** That's good. How about that's the name of the band lady song or man song?

**[0:27:42]** You pick

**[0:27:45]** Butch and bitch present

**[0:27:47]** But general rock general rock is not bad. What to have um

**[0:27:57]** Who were the the two with the shootout and body and Clyde

**[0:28:01]** Bonnie and Clyde. Yeah solid solid

**[0:28:05]** Also, uh, they were killed in Louisiana. So there's the there's the tie in

**[0:28:10]** When people are like, why is your new band named Bonnie and Clyde? We're like, no, no

**[0:28:14]** It's okay. Bonnie and Clyde were actually killed in Louisiana, which is where Jacob is from

**[0:28:18]** Who's Jacob? He doesn't have anything to do with this band. It's just he's just a guy that we know

**[0:28:26]** Bonnie and Clyde, there we go. Bonnie and Clyde

**[0:28:31]** Um, yeah, the stage is it needs to be a name and then like a thing

**[0:28:38]** Yeah, like a hoodie and the blowfish

**[0:28:42]** Yeah, I would I I'm not even being coy about it

**[0:28:45]** I would tell you the names that we've already come up with for the band

**[0:28:48]** But I can't think of a single one right now. All right. Well, you've already got SJ in the ruckus

**[0:28:52]** So SJ is not going to front another band with SJ in it

**[0:28:56]** Right, uh, probably not. Yeah, probably not. That'd be saying the commotion. That's good. That'd be some more

**[0:29:02]** Sarah Jessica and the commotion there. Thank you

**[0:29:08]** Uh, but yeah, so that was a lot of fun

**[0:29:10]** And now I have a whole lot of trust that the the trust that was in that picture is a little bit of the trust that we have

**[0:29:16]** I got a whole lot of trust. I got a whole lot of trust y'all

**[0:29:20]** Uh, what I have is I have a way for us to not have to rent pipe and drape for next scoop fest

**[0:29:25]** That's how much trust I have. Oh, that's awesome. How about this? Yeah, sweet bean and the fever machines

**[0:29:31]** sweet bean

**[0:29:34]** It's amazing that you say that that's already number one on the list sweet bean and the fever machines

**[0:29:39]** sweet

**[0:29:39]** Bean

**[0:29:41]** We all came up with that one. Yeah, that was basically everybody went away and brainstormed and all of us came back with sweet bean and the fever machine

**[0:29:48]** Right there at the top of our list

**[0:29:56]** I'm sweet bean. This is the fever machine. I'm saying thank you for having us. Oh my god

**[0:30:01]** Can you imagine if SJ got to be sweet bean?

**[0:30:05]** Holy shit

**[0:30:06]** Every time it's time for her to sing a song the other lead singer guy goes

**[0:30:11]** Take it bean

**[0:30:19]** When Paul says it I just picture money just showering

**[0:30:24]** So much money coming in I just got hit in the head by a quarter

**[0:30:32]** How about coyness interruptus

**[0:30:37]** When they decide they want to be like a corporate band is

**[0:30:40]** Is already a demand for corporate bands or is that a market that they want to try to crack?

**[0:30:46]** No, no, this is this is something that sj and one of her agents

**[0:30:51]** Came up with this. This is a thought for that

**[0:30:54]** It I'm saying corporate. It's really more like like city and city events

**[0:30:59]** That kind of that like when when cities hire bands, you know play the riverfront. Yes for a big city party

**[0:31:04]** It's it's that it's that type of thing. Yeah

**[0:31:07]** Yeah, so let corporates the wrong word. But yeah, I got it city and county events type thing

**[0:31:12]** Chris bill and the exact change

**[0:31:19]** Put some right out there we're in this for the dough. Yeah, it gives a very professional

**[0:31:25]** Oh, Wayne does not like Chris building exact change

**[0:31:31]** Thumbs down from waiting on that one. I think Chris building exact change might have legs, but we'll see

**[0:31:36]** All right. All right. That one's alph. All right. How about a bean bean counter and the accountants?

**[0:31:41]** There you go. You got that going on and then you can get your sweet bean take a bean back in

**[0:31:46]** And then you can do the the dolly parton typing song

**[0:31:50]** You know, these are the accountants taking accountants

**[0:31:57]** Yeah, I I'm also in the same market. That's why I was I didn't know how much I want to be competing with sj

**[0:32:03]** Uh, but I'm doing an all tap dance cover band

**[0:32:05]** So everything every song we play is through the through the toes and heels through the balls over eaten heels of a tap shoe

**[0:32:12]** Interesting interesting

**[0:32:14]** How about the Louisiana moon dogs?

**[0:32:19]** Paul's really trying which is weird. Are they based out of are they based out of Louisiana?

**[0:32:25]** No

**[0:32:26]** All the better of las vegas. All right, alabama moon dogs and one of them's based out of la

**[0:32:31]** Oh, the la moon dogs

**[0:32:34]** The la moon dogs. There you go. Here's what we got moon dogs

**[0:32:38]** location tba

**[0:32:43]** Okay, that's the last percent of the way there the lost moon dogs

**[0:32:53]** I'm trying to think of like if is it even okay, okay

**[0:32:56]** What's in the realm of possibility paul says a combination of words that make you go to sj and say a single thing

**[0:33:04]** What the barrier of entry of like you actually going to stay with an idea

**[0:33:10]** I don't know. I do know that I have not stood up or written anything down

**[0:33:19]** Like she's home, right? She's here. Yeah, she's in the building with me right now. All right

**[0:33:26]** A thousand paul and a thousand typewriters will make a band name

**[0:33:32]** Uh speaking of tap dancing. I saw

**[0:33:37]** Matt's grandmother-in-law. Uh, she has a famous youtube video clip

**[0:33:42]** Ruby keeler. Yeah. Yeah

**[0:33:44]** Tap dancing on a on a giant typewriter. I saw that clip last night

**[0:33:49]** As part of a las vegas show that I went to

**[0:36:29]** The others got in the way for about a minute

**[0:38:11]** I'm not having uh, you know premarital sex with a human

**[0:38:14]** I can fuck this animal and so they made that a crime too

**[0:38:18]** Okay

**[0:39:41]** We're not blind melon. Oh wait

**[0:39:43]** Oh, shit. I need an animal

**[0:39:46]** I know I just named it actual I did blind in an actual band name. That's what I did. Yeah, that's the joke I went for

**[0:39:53]** About

**[0:39:56]** eczema koala

**[0:40:02]** How to fierce enough animal

**[0:40:04]** Fatty rabbit disease marsupial. Yeah, welcome to the stage

**[0:40:10]** sciatica copy bearer

**[0:40:14]** Oh, oh, oh, it's gotta be

**[0:40:16]** Um, oh, shit. Now I need a good one a real good real good ladies gentlemen. Oh whale with cataracts

**[0:40:27]** That's actually kind of good cataract whale

**[0:40:31]** cataract whale cataract whale

**[0:40:33]** I'm just wailing along. Hey

**[0:40:36]** I can't see vertical walrus and the penguin knees

**[0:40:46]** Let's welcome this syphilis koala

**[0:40:52]** Um

**[0:40:53]** That'd be great because the most of them are chlamydia, so they've got a different disease in the mix. I like it

**[0:40:58]** Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, they those koalas fuck agoraphobic agoraphobic honey bad

**[0:41:08]** Mildly depressed kangaroo

**[0:41:11]** We're secretly just doing spanish job song suggestions. We are that's all we're doing. That's all we're doing

**[0:41:17]** But uh, yeah, I think I think don't worry. I've uh written all these down

**[0:41:21]** I have sent them. I have sent them to Mercedes already. They're gonna get back to us

**[0:41:28]** It's gonna be great tomorrow. I'm gonna go to see uh the new wicked wicked for good

**[0:41:35]** Wicked for good

**[0:41:37]** wicked for good

**[0:41:40]** I'm excited about it. I'm hearing all kinds of things out there

**[0:41:43]** Ups and downs

**[0:41:45]** Some people are really critical of it. Some people are really like leaving the theaters crying. We're going multiple times

**[0:41:51]** I think it's hard to have a sequel to a movie like that

**[0:41:57]** Yes, and they and they shot it simultaneously as well, right

**[0:42:01]** And the and you you lose all the credit you got from the first one where you created these worlds

**[0:42:06]** You can't believe what you're looking at, right? Right did it's such a good job creating that world

**[0:42:09]** Now you go making you like, you know, what everything looks like and you're kind of like, okay cool and also

**[0:42:15]** This happened with kill bill

**[0:42:17]** Ah when you have an awesome movie and you don't have to stick the landing

**[0:42:21]** But just leave a cliffhanger and people can leave a theater satisfied with a cliffhanger

**[0:42:26]** Oh, that's really that's that's a lot easier to do

**[0:42:29]** That's a lot easier. I mean ask a tv writer if it's easier to write a season finale or a series finale

**[0:42:36]** Right, right, right, right exactly. That's uh, it's a very valid point. Uh, have you guys watched smiling friends?

**[0:42:44]** Smiling friends. No smiling friends brilliant animated series. I highly recommend it. It's absolutely my kind of humor

**[0:42:50]** It's fucking hilarious

**[0:42:52]** But they go in every season. They just got reneed renewed up to season five

**[0:42:57]** Reneed, okay. No reneed up season five everyone reneed

**[0:43:01]** But they approach every season

**[0:43:04]** Their last episode as though if this is it then this is it

**[0:43:08]** They make it so that it could be the end

**[0:43:11]** So they've taken that approach map from the jump like that's pretty smart. Yeah, I find it's weird a series

**[0:43:17]** That uh does does this bizarrely is slow horses. You guys watching these slow horses on apple

**[0:43:24]** Yeah, watch a little bit of that name great old great great band name

**[0:43:29]** uh

**[0:43:30]** They always end it

**[0:43:32]** Like satisfactorily like if that was the last show it could and then they run a preview for next season

**[0:43:38]** Which I find fascinating because I can't imagine they're always renewed

**[0:43:41]** But they run a preview of the next season at the very end of the montage

**[0:43:46]** And I'm always like, wow, how the hell do you do that? That's impossible

**[0:43:51]** I mean, I guess they I guess they put that together and run it

**[0:43:55]** Until apple says you're not renewed and then apple just takes it takes that part out. Maybe maybe yeah

**[0:44:02]** And also, how do you shoot that? How do you already have it? Yeah, how do you already?

**[0:44:07]** Right, that's that's the bigger question. Where did this footage come from? I find it bizarre

**[0:44:12]** Okay, uh, jacob chase the blaze

**[0:44:18]** Yes, there you go. That's the one. That's the one

**[0:44:22]** Chase the blaze. That's the one we found it's for people who want to have sex with people with std's chase the blaze. Oh my god

**[0:44:29]** A bunk chaser

**[0:44:30]** Bunk as jay in the bunk chasers

**[0:45:59]** Man, I was where was that? Oh, well, I was doing a week of shows in san Antonio

**[0:46:05]** Mainstream country music is so stupid

**[0:46:11]** Hold on this is breaking news mainstream country music is stupid. There are country songs that are amazing

**[0:46:16]** They're a country artist. They're amazing. Absolutely. But the but the other it's just pop

**[0:46:21]** It's just pop with a

**[0:46:23]** Wawa pedal and they literally it's like I literally go like really every song has a drink and a truck in it

**[0:46:28]** Every song has a whiskey and and the truck in it like all of them

**[0:46:33]** Uh-huh just makes me I basically I get so I'm sitting there drinking like coffee

**[0:46:37]** And like I stand turning a coffee shop being like who can't write this like who like anyone can write these

**[0:46:44]** This is not surprising now Matt some of them have a wife at home who is not happy

**[0:46:52]** Some of them wish they just could have done better if if a couple other choices are gone differently

**[0:46:57]** Well, you know, there's some shit going on when the ai is beating them all

**[0:47:01]** Yeah, yeah, but that's been a problem with all genres, but yes

**[0:47:04]** Yeah, and I don't know how the hell you fix it, but Spotify is being hijacked by ai bands

**[0:47:10]** Yeah

**[0:47:13]** And these ai and these and these people people sitting around with ai are just making a bunch of money off of plays

**[0:47:18]** uh

**[0:47:20]** Instead of actual bands

**[0:47:22]** I was just talking to a friend the other day. He was you saying that um

**[0:47:26]** Dr. Torrell, uh, what's the thing that you that you have to write to phd

**[0:47:31]** Uh, you know thesis a thesis. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Dr. Torrell thesis

**[0:47:36]** Betty stop guessing Betty stop guessing

**[0:47:40]** Back on the tour bus

**[0:47:41]** Let's get on the bus

**[0:47:43]** Stop guessing Betty

**[0:47:45]** Yeah dissertation. Yeah that kind of thing. Thank you lorry dissertation

**[0:47:49]** Uh, he's you got it all written out and gave it to his you know faculty advisor person and

**[0:47:57]** Was kind of accused of using ai to uh to write it

**[0:48:04]** And basically the the professor said

**[0:48:08]** You either use ai to write this

**[0:48:10]** Or you wrote this and it feels like ai either way you need to rewrite this

**[0:48:17]** That but but but he was like i go fuck yourself

**[0:48:21]** right

**[0:48:23]** But but no the uh the uh the professor was trying to be helpful

**[0:48:27]** Because because he was like no i did write this you know i i didn't i didn't use ai to do this

**[0:48:31]** I'm getting my phd and this is this is what i want to be doing like i'm doing this because i because i

**[0:48:35]** Want want to do it. Yep. So no i didn't have ai write this

**[0:48:39]** And the the professor was basically like yeah, but when the uh when the committee looks at this

**[0:48:44]** If they feel like it it feels ai

**[0:48:48]** Then uh, then they're gonna hold that against you ai ai

**[0:48:52]** That's my favorite song shut up betty get on the bus i'm gonna cut your hooves again

**[0:48:59]** I'm gonna re-finger up your hooves. I don't see oh mcdonald on the set list

**[0:49:04]** No, betty. We can't play that song. Oh, you're such a talky cow betty

**[0:49:11]** I mean person definitely a person person

**[0:49:14]** But yeah, they were like, oh, we had to rewrite my whole uh my whole thing or like a couple of chapters in it or something

**[0:49:20]** I don't know, uh, but had to rewrite a sizable portion of it because it felt like ai

**[0:49:27]** And i was like this is this is such a weird time that we're in right now because we haven't figured that part out yet

**[0:49:33]** No, and honestly we're in that weird pocket in history where it's just a pain in the ass right now

**[0:49:37]** And college professors are using ai to ask whether or not something is written by ai

**[0:49:42]** So they're doing it too

**[0:49:43]** And some some some college professors are using ai to read people's fucking shit and and grade it. Yeah. Yeah

**[0:49:51]** Oh, yeah, no, it's just it's just like the

**[0:49:53]** That thing any time technology happens it takes us a while to catch up to it

**[0:49:58]** I will tell you what's was weird and almost like why we think ai is fascinating is that I think ai can be wrong

**[0:50:05]** And I think that's definitely so much of lawyers recently got like sanctioned. I think whatever it's called or cc s

**[0:50:12]** cease and desists, um killed no murdered. No, no, but um, they uh, basically

**[0:50:19]** Had ai write their, uh, legal documents and had false sources

**[0:50:24]** Uh, yeah cases whatever and then so we were putting together our quizzes for, uh, f1

**[0:50:31]** We we put together, uh, breakdowns of each rate of each driver

**[0:50:36]** And there wasn't a lot, but there were three

**[0:50:40]** Errors three lines and so f1 one point was like can we go over all of your material before you do it?

**[0:50:49]** I'm sorry Mercedes

**[0:50:50]** We didn't know that we're gonna send that video to you and it made up dumb stuff

**[0:50:54]** Like they had uh pets that didn't have or

**[0:50:57]** Right, uh fears that didn't have

**[0:50:59]** You can while you're working on on the ai stuff

**[0:51:02]** There are times that you can

**[0:51:04]** That you should go in and just be like double double check all of that stuff

**[0:51:08]** You just told me is all of that actually corrected. Did you make up some of that?

**[0:51:12]** And sometimes it'll be it'll be like no, I made all of that up

**[0:51:17]** It'll it'll just tell you. Yeah

**[0:51:19]** But if you don't think to ask then you don't know that's really weird though

**[0:51:22]** I yes, it is

**[0:51:24]** I asked for a list. I was like, what are words have never been used in wordl

**[0:51:27]** Because I want to like see if I can get a wordl in one if I can commit to a word

**[0:51:31]** Oh, okay. Yeah

**[0:51:33]** And uh, it gave me a list and the list was completely wrong. I fact checked it

**[0:51:38]** And it was just like no

**[0:51:40]** It just gave me a bunch of random five letter words and set it check two archives and it was just lying

**[0:51:46]** And back in the 80s and 90s

**[0:51:49]** You'd get on and uh, or you'd find an ad or something and you'd hire just like a college student

**[0:51:56]** To write a paper for you or in high school or something

**[0:51:58]** I was asking if paul's writing down band names. Yeah, I am

**[0:52:02]** fire

**[0:52:05]** And he drew a logo. Yeah

**[0:52:08]** I don't think you'd go wrong with fire lizard

**[0:52:11]** I

**[0:52:12]** Surely not

**[0:52:14]** Paul don't put it fine as it shirts me paul if you're drawing my kid needs a name for his throughout the uh needs a logo for his

**[0:52:20]** three-on-three soccer team

**[0:52:22]** I have I have I have

**[0:52:24]** My brother jingle ballers

**[0:52:28]** The jingle ballers jingle ballers

**[0:52:30]** So they're like a holiday themed

**[0:52:33]** Yeah, so it's a holiday themed three-on-three. It's great people dress up for it

**[0:52:37]** Like it's a really silly is a really silly three-on-three soccer tournament

**[0:52:40]** Do you want me to be pictures of your kids?

**[0:52:43]** Are there gonna be pictures of your kids in santa costumes playing soccer?

**[0:52:47]** Uh, there's gonna be a picture of their coach in the santa costume because I am their coach

**[0:52:51]** All right. Oh, yeah, I'll get my tablet in a minute and I'll draw one up. I just did the artwork for this uh

**[0:52:57]** For this month it's coming out. Okay. Oh, yeah, so I'll get my tablet and draw up a

**[0:53:03]** Possible logo. I have already tasked uh rob with it too. So you you're a competition if it comes in second

**[0:53:09]** That's fine. I don't care. Okay. That's fine. You got you got a competition. Yeah

**[0:53:13]** I I uh, yeah, because basically like my son's

**[0:53:17]** youngest

**[0:53:18]** His soccer team was a disaster this year

**[0:53:21]** Okay, a couple kids got injured a couple kids quit

**[0:53:25]** Some kids would just not show up. They regularly played without like enough kids

**[0:53:29]** Uh, like one kid down my kid would play the entire game. It was a brutal brutal season

**[0:53:36]** So when the three on three came up, I was like, oh

**[0:53:39]** Let's get the five kids who showed up

**[0:53:42]** All the time who had and let's put them in the in the three on three together. Yeah have them play

**[0:53:50]** One one one one a proper finish to their season instead of just constantly getting clobbered by other teams

**[0:53:56]** The five gives you a pair of subs. Is that is that what yeah? Yeah, you can have up to six

**[0:53:59]** And you sub perfect you sub like crazy in three on three

**[0:54:03]** Yeah, okay. And so I was like, let's do it

**[0:54:06]** And then the coach who had finished his last season he coached like seven seasons was like, I'm not coaching again

**[0:54:11]** So I said, I imagine you don't want to come out of retirement and he goes. No, I do not

**[0:54:15]** I said, okay. I said, I will coach this team. I'm going to tell the parents

**[0:54:18]** I have no business coaching this team, but I will coach this three on three team. That's nice

**[0:54:22]** But I'll do it. That's really good at you man. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

**[0:54:26]** Um, so yeah, jingle ballers jingle ballers. That's a I didn't want this to become a democracy

**[0:54:31]** So I simply said, Hey, do you want to play?

**[0:54:35]** Hilly wants to play a three on three tournament. Do you want to join him?

**[0:54:38]** He's named the team the jingle ballers because I didn't want anyone saying anything else. I was like, it's not up for debate

**[0:54:43]** There's no conversation. It is the jingle ballers that is that has happened

**[0:54:48]** He was to be doing that in the snow devils

**[0:54:52]** Snow devils much easier to logo

**[0:54:54]** No, jingle ballers will be fun. Jingle ballers is funnier. How far can we go on the

**[0:55:00]** In your window scale

**[0:55:04]** The the Tino one last year they were just called the hard penises and they had a big giant cock

**[0:55:12]** Lots of veins

**[0:55:13]** Yeah, but the the the testicles were soccer balls. That was what made it a soccer

**[0:55:16]** Yeah, I mean that's the whole thing jingle ballers. That's what I'm thinking already. I'm like well

**[0:55:20]** They showed up to the game in an oscar mire wiener mobile that they had repurposed that it just a giant penis

**[0:55:26]** Yeah, just dragging. They painted they painted. They just all you gotta do is paint veins on it

**[0:55:31]** Just get a carrot purple spray paint and that's that's all I did

**[0:55:35]** In your mobile just like that boom becomes the cock mobile just dragging to christmas ornaments for balls behind it like like like just got married

**[0:55:46]** When I say hard you say penises hard penises

**[0:55:51]** Uh, so yeah, I I guess uh

**[0:55:54]** Paul they're they're 10. So use your best discretion. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I got you

**[0:56:00]** I got you they're 10. So they've only seen 10 years worth of internet pornography

**[0:56:05]** Just right keep that in mind man

**[0:56:07]** I just I think about this every once in a while

**[0:56:11]** And I do think about I thought about it too when when I accidentally gave matt's kid a comic that might have a boob in it

**[0:56:19]** But it was a circle in a circle

**[0:56:21]** I like that. That's moved accidentally. No, it I mean it was accidentally, but also I don't care, uh, but also

**[0:56:29]** But also

**[0:56:31]** If I were a child man, I've got a box of hustlers for your kids if I were me at that age

**[0:56:38]** Because I remember the kind of bullshit links I went to to see pornography at 11

**[0:56:43]** And we had to go to the woods

**[0:56:45]** Or somebody's house with a weird older brother

**[0:56:48]** Uh, you know or whatever. We also watched

**[0:56:52]** Uh in a group

**[0:56:54]** Absolutely, which is absolutely when you think about it or yes weird now

**[0:56:58]** But like, you know, can you imagine

**[0:57:00]** A bunch of guys like gathering around now to watch internet porn around a computer. It's it's a different feeling

**[0:57:04]** It is. I imagine it. Yes, but there's no way kids of this day and age avoid porn

**[0:57:12]** You can't turn on a computer. It's it's just it's in your face

**[0:57:15]** I think about this like what like because like all our, uh

**[0:57:19]** Our tv apps, right?

**[0:57:20]** I have different profiles and the kids have kids profiles, right?

**[0:57:23]** Yeah, and then the kids but the kids know my password to get to my

**[0:57:26]** Of course, right to get to the unrestricted

**[0:57:30]** And then I'm like, oh, maybe I should change that or do something about that

**[0:57:34]** Then I'm like the least of my concern is them finding stuff on like hbo

**[0:57:38]** Right, like right when they have access to the internet. Oh shit. They saw Daenerys's tits

**[0:57:43]** Yeah, whoop-de-doo

**[0:57:45]** They got on the on the max app and looked up old episodes of the red shoe diaries. Oh

**[0:57:51]** That's the thing real sex red shoe diaries. Those are all gone

**[0:57:56]** I don't think you can look those up anymore, right?

**[0:57:59]** Now the question is like so because right now they say it's basically a huge problem is that kids

**[0:58:05]** See so much porn before they actually have sex themselves. They get desensitized and weirded out by it

**[0:58:10]** No, they feel but they feel well, yes, but they they feel also pressured to imitate it or that

**[0:58:17]** They they want to do like porn sex constantly. Yes, right

**[0:58:22]** Like the first time you know when they're losing their virginity. They're like, when should I spit into your asshole, right?

**[0:58:28]** Yeah, yeah

**[0:58:30]** Do we do we gape now or gape later? Yeah

**[0:58:34]** Like that was my first question. There it is

**[0:58:37]** Galactic president scooper star. That's exactly what I came up with. Oh, just scrambled porn that it was exactly my life

**[0:58:45]** That was absolutely my oh man

**[0:58:47]** scrambled scramble tv porn scramble tv porn

**[0:58:51]** Is a great name for sj's band and um

**[0:58:54]** That is a good name

**[0:58:57]** Uh

**[0:58:58]** Yeah, but basically they're trying to do all this crazy stuff and not enjoying it

**[0:59:02]** Yeah, yeah

**[0:59:04]** Now it sucks that sucks

**[0:59:07]** Yeah, but most people most the good thing about that is have to have a basically and i'm gonna have to have a speech

**[0:59:13]** They're skipping from age 17

**[0:59:16]** to age 48

**[0:59:18]** And that's because that's the time when you kind of enjoy sex and after that it's just like, uh

**[0:59:23]** Really? Oh god

**[0:59:26]** There we go. I'm laughing really hard because I'm 47 so it's like oh, I didn't realize I was on the fucking cuss

**[0:59:31]** Yeah, you're on the press buddy. This is it. Yeah, you're knocking on heaven's door

**[0:59:38]** I'll tell you who else is aging is edging while they age

**[0:59:42]** That's the following sponsor edging while you age edging while you age

**[0:59:47]** Hold on. I was I lost the commercials. I was looking at buggery
