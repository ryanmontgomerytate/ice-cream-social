00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:53,100
 we've had to dig passageways for the dogs to go out to poo and pee like you know like

19
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,140
 there's a big mound of snow

20
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:02,780
 up on one side of our porch that yeah ted keeps playing king of the mountain on it so it's really

21
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,860
 cute and very funny they love it the corgs love it they got those double coats they don't give a

22
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,160
 shit they're out there farting around in snow and then they come running right back as soon as they

23
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,800
 get a little bit inconvenient so well i'm just gonna come back inside now but they're they're

24
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,420
 ridiculous um yeah they're they're spoiled we're very fortunate we did not lose power at all during

25
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,780
 all this so we didn't really get any kind of ice per se uh you know we didn't get any kind of ice

26
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,300
 per se uh you know we didn't get any kind of ice per se uh you know we didn't get any kind of ice

27
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:32,240
 we're still digging out we had generous lovely neighbors come by at the height of the storm

28
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:39,420
 yesterday and one guy on his atv with a snow plow on the front plowed most of our driveway and

29
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:45,140
 another neighbor came and snow blowed the rest of the driveway and then it got another six inches on

30
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,100
 top of that where they'd cleared so we had to shovel again and i've got to shovel again today

31
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:54,440
 you called them back you called them i did not call them back over they did they did more than

32
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:03,820
 they needed uh where are you guys we uh we got guys hello hello no they they did great so it's uh

33
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,960
 gonna take a little while to dig out i was supposed to have my first new class this evening

34
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:15,400
 for a new semester at uh skit but we put everything on delay because everybody is

35
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,780
 buried in snow and it's still pretty difficult to get around lots of schools are closed for

36
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,240
 the next couple of days the temperature is only going to go down from here so

37
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,840
 yeah sexy temperature the tough part is going to be as there's a little bit of snow melt during

38
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:37,240
 the day then this temperature goes way below freezing and yeah ice ice ice baby so we'll see

39
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,480
 we'll see how it goes i don't go back to work till wednesday thank goodness or until thursday

42
00:03:54,440 --> 00:04:02,120
 you know still not great yeah uh unless you're a corgi unless you're a corgi then it's then life

43
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,880

44
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:15,760
 the ice cream truck driver at the top of the show uh not uh not technical scoop port you did not

45
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,980
 you're not no no he's on the next show he's on the next show that's why i laughed at myself

46
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,080
 before we started the show because he was saying he hadn't been thanked yet i was like i got him

47
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,080
 he's queued up for today too bad for him we're doing a double show today so he's gonna hear

48
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,580
 about himself on two episodes well we'll thank technical scoop port twice how about that that's it

49
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:41,940
 holy shit a large black cat just walked past my back door and it just scared the shit out of me

50
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,700
 you don't have a black cat no i don't own any cats it should scare the shit out of you

51
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:52,380
 large animal he's coming for your coming for your puppies oh oh it just turned into a human

52
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,760
 it just turned into a human oh shit

53
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:03,400
 just turned to a goth looking human well we also found out he's leaving we have a we have a fire

54
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:10,360
 hydrant in our front yard and during because we had about three days of real heads up on this

55
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:16,320
 major storm coming through and so and doing her due diligence looking up different factoids and

56
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:22,960
 whatnot about preparation etc turns out we are responsible for keeping that fire hydrant

57
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,500
 under control so we're not going to be able to do anything we're not going to be able to do anything

58
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,820
 we're not going to be able to do anything we're not going to be able to do anything we're not going

59
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,800
 to be able to do anything we're not going to be able to do anything we're not going to be able to do

60
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,220
 anything we're not going to be able to do anything we're not going to be able to do anything we're

61
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:31,440
 not going to be able to do anything we're not going to be able to do anything we're not going to be

62
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:31,580
 able to do anything we're not going to be able to do anything we're not going to be able to do anything

63
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:37,880
 funny enough it's not really covered it's kind of clear that leads me to believe that that water

64
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:44,940
 line has some it's a big kind of heat it's a big metal fire hydrant right yes but it also i think

65
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,360
 it has must have some kind of heat source in that water line to keep that all warm you don't think

66
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,820
 it's moving though i guess that's it it's just flowing everyone knows that hot water puts out

67
00:05:53,820 --> 00:06:00,660
 fire faster than cold water science it's just science it's just a big metal fire plug like

68
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,920
 that thing's gonna hold heat longer than stuff around it well nick newman is giving me the wave

69
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,520
 off uh that there is no heat under that that uh fire hydrant what are you gonna listen you're

70
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,820
 gonna listen to a fireman i guess i'm listening to a firefighter i don't know why nick gets all

71
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,540
 fucking crap around here i said it wasn't fucking he didn't listen to me

72
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:26,180
 he's a firefighter fireman shows up makes some chili it says it's not heated you go well i guess

73
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,660
 it's not heated i very quickly changed my opinion on the on the information of experts jacob

74
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,200
 something something i think more of us could learn i just was gonna say it's 2026 are you

75
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,840
 really gonna listen to a fireman tell you what how a fire hydrant works right what a dumbass

76
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,780
 you listening to the experts you want to do your own research why don't you vote

77
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:44,920
 you

78
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:51,180
 yeah uh get a glass of warm milk uh warm raw milk and uh spit at the house that puts it out

79
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:56,680
 did i talk did i talk about this i was at i had lunch when i was in uh when i was in uh burbank

80
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:05,860
 with my friend uh eli and uh his wife erica and she's a doctor yeah and uh she says all the time

81
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:11,820
 now she goes we're gonna you know we we think your child has you know blank and we're gonna

82
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,920
 and our plan to take care of them is to do blank blank blank blank blank blank blank blank blank

83
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:20,920
 and they go hold on hold on and they type whatever she's saying into like chat gbt oh they don't even

84
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,620
 already have an opinion i was already cringing because i thought the parent would already have

85
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:31,020
 an opinion but they have to look no they're not that informed oh that's even worse yeah they

86
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,340
 question they they go hold on before i tell you to proceed i have to look this up and figure out

87
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,620
 what this chat gbt tells me about what you just told me and whether or not i approve great of the

88
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,860
 doctor's plans this is why no one should be using chat gbt no one should be using

89
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:52,560
 any of this ai garbage it is a detriment to all of us uh absolutely i use it all the time

90
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,980
 but uh you shouldn't i don't use it to i am chat gpt i don't use it to question experts i don't

91
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:04,040
 use but you're feeding the beast baby you're feeding the beast just be careful i just tell

92
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:10,780
 chat gbt every day that paul mattingly loves you tell him whatever i want to get paul's i want to

93
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,900
 get paul's name into that chat gpt brain chat gpt can come to my house

94
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:20,800
 we'll have a real nice talk come to my house i fed that beast a long time ago uh i remember when it

95
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,960
 first happened i don't think i've told the story on air but i think it's been long enough i can

96
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:32,980
 the statute of limitations has run out yeah so i when it first came around it was fascinating and

97
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:42,340
 and and and and so i put every approved script of pen and teller fool us into chat gpt yeah

98
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,820
 and uh figure

99
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,320
 maybe it can help me write more scripts because one of the biggest challenges being a writer on

100
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:55,140
 that show was writing 80 versions of we'll be right back with more magic after this sure right

101
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,580
 write 80 versions of that every year try to put some cute jokes in it that kind of stuff

102
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,160
 yeah so i put it in there and then one season

103
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:10,920
 uh all of a sudden like the producers start experimenting with chat gpt to see if it was

104
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,260
 like worth doing and all of a sudden i got like this note that was like hey

105
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:21,680
 chat gpt stuff it's it's pretty good and i know i gave it all of our scripts like whatever but i

106
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:29,400
 didn't make that argument and then they were like uh we we'd switched from a 14 episode

107
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:36,020
 season to a 20 episode season yes right which means that i uh but you had longer to shoot it

108
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:41,080
 so that was fine but i got paid it was about money it was about whether i sure how much

109
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,920
 more am i getting my episode rate is there a flat rate like what's happening

110
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:52,780
 uh with it and they were dragging their heels uh i was the executive producer was not getting back

111
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:59,520
 to me and then they kept making jokes about chat gpt and replacing me with chat gpt

112
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:08,200
 so all of a sudden it was like three weeks before the season started yeah and i wrote a very uh uh

113
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:14,920
 formal note they hadn't hired paul back yet um and i wrote a

114
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:22,160
 very formal note being like hey if you don't want to fly paul back out uh i'd happily switch

115
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,420
 from being a writer to warm-up comic for this upcoming season ah

116
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:35,400
 um because clearly you got you guys don't know what's getting back to my contract i'm hearing

117
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,060
 jokes about replacing with chat gpt just make me the warm-up comic and let's call it a day

118
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,940
 and i wrote it to

119
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,220
 the one executive producer wasn't getting back to me i wrote to both executive producers and

120
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:53,300
 the showrunner good good this seems like a reasonable response

121
00:10:53,300 --> 00:11:03,860
 because i was just getting pissed yeah i got the angriest voicemail i've ever gotten from

122
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,760
 the executive producer

123
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:14,920
 he cursed me the fuck out like read me the riot act like i know exactly what you're talking about

124
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,920
 where he's coming from

125
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:24,320
 because obviously when i did work the two other producers called the that executive producer who's

126
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,160
 in charge of signing the contracts and said what the fuck's going on with that right and so

127
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:37,620
 uh that was an awkward it was awkward backstage a couple times throughout that season it was

128
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:44,300
 a little frosty in the green room a few times uh that particular season of

129
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:50,580
 with that producer with his chat gpt for halloween that year matt felt like it was pointed a little

130
00:11:50,580 --> 00:12:02,860
 bit at him uh yeah no i mean look you know yeah it is what it is uh i said that like my current

131
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:10,420
 opinion with uh ai and chat gpt is like we thought we were creating like this god of all knowledge

132
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,020
 right that we could consult and what we created

133
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,920
 was like a

134
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:22,040
 really eager fresh out of college assistant that's like who's just like wants to just supply you with

135
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,120
 everything sometimes they're right sometimes they're wrong but like they got your back

136
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,980
 right right they're just like uh here maybe maybe you want all this you're like uh maybe two of

137
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:35,920
 those things but thank you actually you said this but that's not even true what you wrote here i

138
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,640
 don't think you researched that properly this is just wrong this is entirely wrong yeah yeah so

139
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,760
 now that's how i look at that's how i look at chat gpt is is like it's a it's a really really

140
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:44,920
 wonderful thing to do and i think it's a really really really wonderful thing to do and i think

141
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,420
 wants the gig it's really going places but right now it's just fresh out of college and it's yeah

142
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:56,680
 and it's trying too hard boy do i like using it to uh to sort information i like putting a lot

143
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:03,160
 of information into it doing like make me a table that shows me all of that yeah yeah it works really

144
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:10,720
 well for that that's it for like clerical and like clinical things it's good you know for knowledge

313
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,500
 but you'll both be moving up to the upper league next season buddy

314
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:11,920
 Jacob Smith everybody Jacob yeah no I'm in trouble next year I'm in trouble next year

315
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:21,000
 um also I guess I have to play next year I I guess after winning I'm I'm obligated to play

316
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,300
 another year I joined uh uh 12 magicians in another league and I won that league

317
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:31,960
 and just want you to know how much worse magicians are than scoops at fantasy football just so I'm

318
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,220
 sure

319
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:41,980
 that that tracks that definitely tracks uh yeah so uh Paul Clayton let's see in third place game

320
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:48,540
 Dave Peterson whose team Tyreek of alcohol beat Justin uh Jelinek from the fighting squirrels

321
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:54,760
 uh so yeah and that's it so if you want to join our league next year this year we were better we

322
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:00,700
 had like a Facebook group and the Facebook chat was a good place to interact and bust balls so

323
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:05,800
 we yeah good some fun trash talk we stepped it up this year uh uh for that was the only thing I was

324
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:10,000
 missing in the other years was there was no consolidated place for me to uh make fun of

325
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,500
 myself uh but this place was very it was very comforting this year I told SJ she was like did

326
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,240
 you win your fantasy football league I said well my my because she was asking about the the big one

327
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:28,020
 that I play every year yeah I said oh I got I got third place in that one but I won the uh the scoops

328
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,020
 one and she looked at me she was like you

329
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:36,300
 you played a fantasy football league with the listeners to your podcast and then you you won

330
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:42,720
 that's that's that's precisely what happened

331
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:50,540
 she goes did you organize this league I said I did not I did not yeah yeah yeah thankfully I

332
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:56,500
 at least did not put the thing together I just played at least the illusion of of arbitrary uh

333
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,460
 yeah yeah we had 22 uh 22

334
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:08,080
 people 22 people 22 teams we've room for 24 so if you want to get in touch with Matt Daugherty

335
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,940
 or Troy next year as we headed it we'll announce it as we head into it but they always we all pay

336
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,760
 to get in the league and then they give a big chunk of change right back to us as a donation

337
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,600
 for our our podcast which is very generous of them and they're wonderful thank you guys oh wait that

338
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:28,740
 means I won money for this too yeah I forgot about that technically yeah yeah so I took money from

339
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,660
 the scoops as well

340
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:35,900
 insult to injury over here I uh if you uh if you look over on the chat

341
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:44,360
 Leon has posted one of the winning t-shirts from the t-fury battle uh which is no ai that was my

342
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,620
 illustration of a duck and then uh people put cavernous butthole under it and you can order

343
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,020
 that through t-fury

344
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:59,300
 great I think the cavernous butthole ducks would be a great

345
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:03,060
 uh team to add to the football fantasy football league for next year

346
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:08,240
 my team name this year was I say horse you say beans so maybe next year I'll change it

347
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:15,100
 go with cavernous butthole cavernous butthole the cavernous buttholes yeah the fighting cavernous

348
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:22,960
 buttholes yeah so I I was uh 18th out of 22 players which is pretty good hey look at you

349
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:29,180
 holding your own pretty good pretty good you're a regular Kansas City chief over here 22 you're a

350
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:34,180
 regular Dallas Cowboy I'm in the lower league right so those those they're automatically above

351
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:38,340
 me oh they're all just all okay yeah they're automatically above me who's even in the Super

352
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:45,020
 Bowl has it happened already do we know it did happen Paul breaking news because this airs

353
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:53,420
 Thursday who won uh the Patriots with a decisive victory over backup quarterback Stitham

354
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:59,060
 won 10 to 7 so they're coming into a Super Bowl with a lot of heat that's it

355
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:05,300
 a lot of heat 10 to 7 did you did you watch that game at all I did because I'm on tour with Eric

356
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:10,420
 Dillman who's in New England there oh sure sure and we were snowed in right which I haven't got

357
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:17,620
 that story yet but we we we were we were uh I I'm uh I am in the snowed in hotel uh in Bloomington

358
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:25,920
 Indiana and so we trudged through the snow to the upstairs bar uh here in town and it was packed

359
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:31,620
 because it's a snow day sure uh and we watched what should have been an awesome day watching

360
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:40,040
 football and instead was one of the most boring actually one of the most poorly kicked games I've

361
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:46,940
 ever seen was it one of those games where it was all field goals no it was all missed field goals

362
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:53,640
 oh no and all botched punts like right and so that changed the outcome of the whole thing huh

363
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:59,340
 yeah it was it was it got snowy and super windy like the game started and it was a clear beautiful

364
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:07,580
 sunny day in Denver oh and then like a blizzard rolled in like third quarter it was clear and

365
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:11,580
 fine by the fourth quarter you couldn't see your hand in front of your face well that was crazy

366
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:22,420
 that was the weirdest thing on uh Thursday I guess it was out here Thursday was like spring it was

367
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:28,840
 weird we were like what the fuck is going on it was sunshine beautiful still snow on the ground

368
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:36,960
 but just gorgeous and then turned on a dime weather-wise yeah and then well then and the

369
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,820
 Rams in Seattle played probably the best game I don't think the Super Bowl is going to be better

370
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:47,080
 than that game no I don't think so I think that was it that was a really good game came down to

371
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:52,400
 really like crazy weird mistakes and yeah like it was a real battle

372
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:58,420
 yeah it was fun that was a great game uh Gelato Steve in the chat I haven't seen Gelato Steve in a

373
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:06,880
 minute he says go Pats yeah I mean it is uh it's it's going to be it's it's funny that like both

374
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,660
 teams will be an underdog story if the Patriots win it'll be crazy for a team that had four wins

375
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:16,720
 last year to take a second year quarterback and win this early would be bananas right and Sam

376
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,260
 Darnold has literally been shipped off by two teams and if he wins as the Seattle quarterback

377
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:27,740
 it'll be a crazy story for him to win if Sam Darnold wins as the Seattle quarterback

378
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,240
 the Jets should have to go to the SEC

379
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:38,380
 because if he wins as the Seattle quarterback that means the Jets are so much worse as an

380
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:45,020
 organization than we ever even thought they were actually no I'm reconsidering we don't want them

381
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:50,900
 in the SEC I was just gonna say I think every Jet fan I know would take that deal yeah I think

382
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,400
 every different I'm thinking about what LSU is doing I'm thinking about what LSU is doing I'm

383
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,560
 thinking about what LSU is doing I'm thinking about what LSU is doing right now LSU is definitely

384
00:29:53,560 --> 00:30:01,760
 running its team better than uh the New York Jets I would Vinnie Grasso's a huge Jets fan I was like

385
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,620
 I bet he'd be like yeah yeah let's do that for them let's do that for a few years let's see how

386
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:13,020
 we can handle the Tennessee volunteers for a while go down there I'll tell you who else can

411
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,660

413
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,660
 underwater breathing apparatus

414
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:20,460
 oh spelling is not the kid's forte I I misspelled weather I went with the wrong spelling of weather

415
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:26,040
 in one of my little uh advertisements for the class I'm teaching on Saturday night uh out out

416
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:31,220
 in Toronto you went with the the h yeah I went with the wrong one the one that describes how the

417
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:36,940
 the uh atmosphere is doing rather than you know oh oh you went the other way no I went the wrong

418
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:41,460
 way yeah so I still can't even get it right when you're correcting me I don't even know I just I

419
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:47,500
 that's that's a that's an Achilles heel uh for me that one but also it's a blind spot I think in the

420
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:54,440
 future it will be an advantage for me to have my spelling errors uh riddled throughout my writings

421
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:01,400
 as it will be indicative of my non-chat GPT infused work so people go oh yeah there's

422
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:07,780
 Mattingly trying to spell again he clearly wrote this without any fucking help obviously from him

423
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:13,640
 is obviously him with his no no ability to spell yeah uh you guys want to do a little scoop mail

 yes a little scoop mail I would love it

425
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:24,540
 let's see uh oh we're starting off with uh with a heavy one today we're starting off with one from

426
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:29,080
 the OG Scoop uh he's in the chat with us as well but he wrote this a while ago hey guys I wanted

427
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:34,220
 to reach out and just say thanks uh to you guys and all the Scoop community in early October I

428
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:39,800
 lost my brother at the young age of 56 sadly he had suffered from mental illness and addiction

429
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:45,480
 for most of his life and was homeless when he passed uh he was in my town uh living in section

430
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,480
 eight housing for the past few years but

431
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:53,160
 drifted to Florida and ultimately ultimately to Las Vegas in August coincidentally he was in

432
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:58,040
 Vegas during Scoop Fest because of ICS and the Scoops I consider Vegas a treasure at home away

433
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:03,600
 from home and the fact that he passed in that area near Scoop family gave me some peace in all

434
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:08,220
 of the sorrow and issues that arose concerning his arrangements I just wanted to remind you uh

435
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:12,400
 that you guys and the Scoops have brought me laughter joy and friendship and it doesn't go

436
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,420
 unnoticed thanks again for all the love and support love you all even you you know who you are

437
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:24,480
 that's Andy the OG Scoop Andy uh so sorry pal yeah man yeah that's tough and then the whole

438
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,980
 scenario that you brought up that seems really tough I don't know how I would deal with uh yeah

439
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:36,480
 with it with a situation like that that's really and I know there was an issue uh I know Andy had

440
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,280
 uh had you know just all of the the the stuff that goes along with that you know

441
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,840
 transporting the remains back and doing doing all of that stuff right uh you know it it

442
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:54,920
 makes a lot of it makes a lot of work and uh it sucks yeah yeah it's it's incredibly difficult

443
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:00,120
 you have to almost delay your grief and put on your professional hat yeah I remember Anne having

444
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:05,100
 to go through a lot of that shit when her father passed and she really had to kind of postpone her

445
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:12,280
 feelings for a while to get everything else lined up properly um it's hard it's incredibly hard to

446
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:17,300
 be responsible I can't imagine being in Las Vegas and being like my brother is unhoused somewhere

447
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:22,940
 around here that's a really weird thing to deal with it's a hard thing to have to deal with yeah

448
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:28,020
 I don't think there was crossover I don't I don't think Andy was in town while his brother was here

449
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:32,400
 because Andy didn't make the the most recent Scoop Fest but his brother was in town during

450
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:39,980
 the most recent Scoop Fest gotcha yeah yep no it sucks but the uh the the Scoop community

451
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:46,320
 of course is always fantastic and uh and that's uh you know part of what OG was was trying to say

452
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:54,100
 that is something that's always worth compliment rescinded nope oh never mind never mind I tried

453
00:36:54,100 --> 00:37:00,200
 I tried everybody you heard me you heard me try shit rejected I will not take it we got one here

454
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:08,060
 from poutine scoop hello fuckers what was your first clue that you guys liked music as a kid

455
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:14,320
 I don't mean uh bus dumping bands while on the island music but the first time you knew for me

456
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,700
 it was Alanis Morissette I didn't get you uh

457
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:26,100
 I didn't get you you ought to know oh that must be what that's supposed to be autocorrect uh had a

458
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:30,640
 field day with this email sorry uh I didn't get you ought to know as a teenager but when hand in

459
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:36,020
 my pocket came out as a single I had to get my first cd and radio what was it for you poutine

460
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:45,180
 scoop poutine scoop I know that my first cd that I bought when cds come out came out was uh

461
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:57,620
 razor's edge the classic acdc album razor's edge and I stand by that purchase I stand by that

462
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:04,700
 I you know I've always been embarrassed about my musical tastes and uh I've always been

463
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:10,180
 self-conscious about that even like I shared a room with my brother Rob and when we did homework

464
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:16,660
 together I would default to his taste in music uh he he played the music in the room that we did

465
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:22,860
 homework too uh like I I was still buying just like springsteen and billy joel stuff

466
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:27,700
 I was gonna say having watched that springsteen documentary I think you're uh I think your

467
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:35,100
 embarrassment is justified fully justified the movie the movie you said doc right but the movie

468
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:40,540
 the movie's bad but the documentary is good um oh I haven't seen the documentary uh it's on hulu but

469
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:45,600
 uh he was playing like dylan he was playing old school rem he

470
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,160
 right

471
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:55,980
 he was playing like cool stuff and then I was always just aping whatever my brother older

472
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:04,580
 brothers were into so yeah I I would say I my first cd purchase I literally was like what's

473
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:09,920
 the greatest selling cd at the time was pig fight pig fight dark side of the moon oh all right

474
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:16,000
 um I would actually probably say it was when when uh post island time

475
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:23,380
 I think like uh when steve and I uh did reduce and I moved to san diego as our as our as our less

476
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:30,240
 interesting and less fruitful sequel uh we had a roommate mikey there and he got me into all

477
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:36,600
 kinds of cool bands I really got into tom waits at that time uh yeah it was just a bunch of cool

478
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:41,740
 bands came out of that and that really kind of shaped the way I listen to music I swear to god

479
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:50,020
 that I don't think I like I'm curious how I listened to music before I took acid once once I

480
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:58,160
 took acid I heard music differently the rest of my life huh and I can you describe that well yeah

481
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:03,000
 I don't I was just a melody person I was into whatever the catch was you weren't listening to

482
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,440
 lyrics and then all of a sudden I took acid no I still to this day I'm still not a good lyric

483
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,540
 person but I love arrangements instrumentation like how far where's the

484
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,860
 bass of the mix like versus like where's the drums like where the keyboard and I get fascinated

485
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:22,580
 by arrangements and sounds and quality of sounds and and types of sounds and and I like all of that

486
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:29,640
 stuff in music now and that did not happen until I took lsd okay and I don't know matt I didn't even

487
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,860
 do that often you know I mean like I can count on my hand how many times I've done it but it just

488
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:38,260
 changed the way I heard music forever I think you really need to much how I listen to music

489
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,700
 I think you need to spend some time with nine inch nails the fragile I think that

490
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:46,140
 album will uh I bet I would go back and really appreciate it I think you would because that

491
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:50,800
 that's a double album and it is just layers and layers and layers a lot of shit yeah I mean I

492
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,380
 definitely listen to music in a very similar way I definitely listen to it uh I'm listening to like

493
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,820
 the structure of it I'm I'm listening to like interesting uh side melodies and harmonies and

494
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:08,540
 all uh and yeah I'm bad about listening to lyrics as well yeah I remember like like going to

495
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:11,720
 Beyonce's album and like hearing she puts hints of her other songs in other songs and she's like

496
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:17,200
 following those threads and stuff and the patterns and yeah I like all that stuff now

497
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:22,680
 uh but I'm still self-conscious you remember years ago when 50 shades closed I was an uber

498
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:29,800
 driver for two weeks oh yeah and the thought of putting on my own music when someone else got into

499
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,920
 a car stranger was like good lord like that was the most stressful thing to me was what to have

500
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:41,580
 on the speakers when someone entered my vehicle yeah my brother and I were very lucky

501
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:47,640
 as kids for a little while while we were going to St. Mark's uh mom and dad couldn't pick us up

502
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:52,460
 after school we had a babysitter for a couple months and she would come and get us and she was

503
00:41:52,460 --> 00:42:00,840
 a cool college student and she was jamming to the Violent Films she had that oh solid car the whole

504
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:09,300
 time um and that first Violent Films album it was fresh it was brand new then and John and I

505
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:14,360
 listened to that a lot that was her jam and so we both got to that John even more than me

506
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:18,820
 like he's seen them in concert a couple more times than I have he's a big Violent Films head

507
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:24,280
 and then we just got into you know a little more alternative stuff you know he went Depeche Mode

508
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:32,440
 Tom Waits I went um they might be Giants and Body Count so you know we both had our things

509
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:37,580
 uh we listened to all kind of crazy shit but that's the thing both of us very diverse musical

510
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,280
 tastes does there was a great time and there was a great time and there was a great time and there

511
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:45,640
 like I'm on uh I'm on a tour right now and we're sharing a Sprinter van yeah and we were doing a

512
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,980
 late night drive and all of a sudden it was like we should put on some music and I was like I'm in

513
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,800
 I'm in the front seat you know and I was like you have you have control you couldn't do it I was

514
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,920
 like and I literally was like what is everybody like like I was like I'm not gonna lead the

515
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:04,920
 charge I will not lead the charge on this I will not do it I was too scared I yeah I was like I

516
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,300
 don't think this whole place is gonna jam out to the Avett brothers I don't think that's gonna happen

517
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,180
 you never know

518
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:15,680
 just gotta go for it Southside Johnny baby I say the other fails the other part of of John and I's

519
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,980
 music and I think I don't know if this applies to you or Jacob Jacob probably you but we were

520
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:27,100
 in a region coming up through college and whatnot that got a lot of bands tons of bands come through

521
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:33,100
 Ohio and Louisville they just there's just a touring circuit through there with venues that

522
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:38,740
 are older venues that can house you know three hundred to a thousand people for level bands

523
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:39,280
 coming up

524
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:46,840
 and at that time you could go see a concert for 15 20 bucks you know yeah so got to see all kind

525
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:52,800
 of shit coming up in college I don't I don't guess that's really an option for a lot of college

526
00:43:52,800 --> 00:44:00,140
 students today I don't know I got to see this is a weird random one I got to see Vanilla Ice on one

527
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:07,900
 of his first concerts that he did when he switched over to like thrash metal oh yeah when he first

528
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,140
 came out of rap

529
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:15,420
 oh right yes like Vanilla Ice or Ice Ice Baby would it might have even still been on the charts

530
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:22,240
 when he was doing this and he was doing like scream thrash metal versions of all of his rap

531
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:30,000
 songs crazy it was crazy it was at a place called the Bait Shack in Louisiana and yeah it was like

532
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 this is insane I remember going up to Ohio with John uh one time we went to see Alanis Morissette

533
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,420
 right before she blew up uh we saw her on her Jagged Little Pill tour right before everything

534
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:50,460
 really got huge like I said we probably saw her for 20 bucks and uh Tyler uh what's his name

535
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:58,320
 the Foo Fighters drummer was with her at that point oh um that was one of his early gigs the

536
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:02,400
 guy who just passed away sadly yeah yeah Tyler Hawkins thank you Hawkins that's it all I could

537
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,980
 think of was Horton thank you uh Scoop Chat so yeah and it was just uh you know it was just a lot of

538
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,740
 you know yeah it's cool and I also got to see Gwar at that same spot I saw Gwar twice in the same

539
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:17,480
 weekend I saw him in Louisville and then saw him again in Cincinnati oh by the way Gwar's uh cover

540
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:22,940

 cover uh Pony Club then do yourself a favor pour one out for odorous also there was a really good

542
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:34,400

543
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,980
 that up and they they always had really good songs they played some really good songs and

544
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,880

545
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:48,540
 it's like 106 or something like that uh but yeah that was that was probably the most that was most

546
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:55,320
 of my music growing up because like we had cassette tapes and all but like I wasn't going

00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:24,520
 like they have to attach each other's mouths to their assholes become one of those things

561

00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:53,440
 Nipsey Hussle album oh I forget what triggered Nipsey Hussle in my head but boy was that album

565
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:59,860
 fucking great uh gone too soon oh and then and then randomly uh boy talk about two sides of a

566
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:06,040
 different coin here uh randomly last night I was listening to one more from the road which is a live

567
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:14,500
 Lynyrd Skynyrd uh concert from the 70s wow so that's my two most recent is Nipsey Hussle and

568
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:21,820
 Lynyrd Skynyrd wow so I guess nobody living I suppose now that I'm thinking about it as well

569
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:30,160
 nobody living nobody living oh let's see we got one here from hey scoop get off my lawn hey guys

570
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:35,200
 exciting news for Christmas my wife bought us tickets for Matt's show in Lexington next week

571
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:41,380
 oh hell yeah that I don't think it's next week anymore right it happened it means I saw you it

572
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:47,260
 means you came and we hung out yes I kept talking about it and she had to pretend it would be awful

573
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:52,480
 to see Matt for a third time just so I wouldn't think that she didn't want to go or just so I

574
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,440
 would think she didn't want to go

575
00:48:53,440 --> 00:49:03,700
 uh boy is she right now the real question is will you do Battle of Dreams again I'm convinced and

576
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:09,220
 possibly wrong about how the trick works so I'll be watching carefully the last time you did it you

577
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:15,040
 kept my wife's dream and put it away for later still waiting to know why see you soon Matt and

578
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:22,240
 here's an obelisk I did a while back for you guys enjoy hey Scoop get off my lawn uh quickly before

579
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:29,140
 you get to that game uh yes no Battle of Dreams was cut from this show uh that was a fooler's run

580
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:39,820
 and the jokers uh they did not want it in the show um uh I don't do that trick as often as I used to

581
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:44,260
 just because I haven't ever been performing in an environment where I have I tried to do it on

582
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:49,960
 cruise ships and what happened was I found that the staff would not get all the papers out to

583
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:55,720
 everybody but they would get out to like 20 or 30 people and it made it feel more exclusive than

584
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:00,760
 exclusive uh with people in the audience there people were upset that they didn't get to do it

585
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:08,020
 yeah and it's also part of the prover that anybody can do it that's it anybody can participate yeah

586
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:13,180
 so sometimes people don't even have the papers like what the hell do I care yeah I actually want

587
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:19,900
 to change the so right now Penn and Teller are doing it in their show and they have made it much

588
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:25,240
 more sophisticated is it going well and it's going very well and Penn has really made it his own and

589
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:31,120
 he invented the trick and performed the trick saw the latest version of Penn and Tellers and said I'm

590
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:36,580
 not going to do it anymore you guys are doing such a better job with oh wow I did and so he said I'm

591
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:41,980
 going to stop performing it um are they back at it you should have you should have started by saying

592
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:45,760
 that you should have started by being like I'm not doing it in my show anymore because Penn and

593
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,500
 Teller are doing it so well well so hondro and I have decided not to for now I didn't really like

594
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,560
 that we were all doing it and like we would also all three of us would kind of like talk about

595
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,600
 different things we've learned from different versions of doing it

596
00:50:55,720 --> 00:51:00,460
 anything that part was awesome you know to feel like I'm included in the group with hondro and Penn

597
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:12,280
 and uh I actually want to change the trick for myself now uh because of doing crowd work off

598
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:17,680
 people's dreams uh versus like I basically I'm trying to like figure out a trick that could

599
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:24,340
 I could cut into more social media friendly things right uh and put it earlier in the show not make

600
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:25,240
 it like a finale piece

601
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:30,280
 uh I'm thinking about asking people for fun facts about them or someone in their family

602
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:34,600
 as a go-to ask instead of asking people to come up with a crazy dream

603
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:41,200
 I think I want to get like hardcore some kind of fun fact about oh yeah fun fact about somebody

604
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:45,940
 that you're there with that's a that's a fun that's a fun ask yeah and I think that and so

605
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:49,900
 uh but right now I'm doing the Joker's tour so there's no room for new material I pitched it

606
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:55,360
 right I said no and um uh uh I pitched it

607
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:59,920
 I said not funny enough so we moved on and I have a bunch of cruise work coming up and then lately

608
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,940
 I've been doing more corporates I don't think it's the kind of trick I want to do for corporates yeah

609
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:08,320
 right I want to like put it in a live environment first to feel what it really is before I figure

610
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,860
 out what the corporate version is um so I'm trying to figure out when the hell I can add

611
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:17,140
 new to my show but the first time the first opportunity I get I'm adding that to to the

612
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:20,560
 to the routine oh yeah um because it was finishing with a physical production of the dream uh right uh

613
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:24,740
 because it was finishing with a physical production of the dream uh because it was finishing with a physical production of the dream uh

614
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:32,840
 when I was touring and uh especially for my show a production is a big deal uh because I'm a one-man

615
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:38,540
 operation uh and I think I have a fun thing for that I think I have a fun way to finish the trick

616
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:44,840
 out so uh we'll see and you got that um and you got that prop that I sent you for your new finale

742
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:45,860
