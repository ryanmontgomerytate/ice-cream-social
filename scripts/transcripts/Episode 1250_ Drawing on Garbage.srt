00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,800
 Oh hello there, I am so glad you're here. I would like to thank the ice cream truck

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,600
 drivers. Thank you so much ice cream truck drivers. It's a new month, I don't have a

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,520
 new list yet, but we will thank each and every ice cream truck driver by name before this

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,400
 episode starts. Not this episode, a later episode of this show. You know what I mean.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,360
 If you want to be an ice cream truck driver, PreachingFun.com, that's where you can go.

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,560
 Go sign up, be an ice cream truck driver, deliver this freaking ice cream straight to

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:42,520
 people's freaking ear holes, and who knows, the life you save may be your own. My voice

8
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,080
 just cracked there a little bit and I realized that I set my water down in a different room

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,720
 and forgot to bring it in here. So I've got that going for me. Hey Johnny, do you want

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,920
 to go to an ice cream social? Oh I will, but now we have to start a show. Yeah, I'd love

11
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,520
 to. Great, let's go. You have this whole fan part for each day whatever you want to go

12
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,800
 with your life. That's true. That's true, I could have gone right now, I could be back

13
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:16,080
 by now, with warm, hydrated, but alas. It's time for Matt and Mattingly's Ice Cream Social.

14
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,120
 Sitting at C, it's Matt Donnelly. Sitting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that's Paul Mattingly.

15
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,800
 In Las Vegas, it's me, Jacob the Audio Guy. We're preaching fun. We're preaching fun.

16
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:33,080
 We are. Hey everybody. What's up everyone? We have a guest in Zoom today. Yes. As I almost

17
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,600
 said in churn, we have a guest in Zoom. I love the new studio, it feels just like home

18
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,480
 to me. Isn't it nice? We just wanted to really make you feel right at home. Celestia, how

19
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,360
 are you? I'm doing good. I've recovered from ScoopFest, I hope everybody else has too.

20
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:57,080
 Oh, that makes one of us. Paul, how are you? You were hurting yesterday, right? I have

21
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:03,320
 had a week, gentlemen. So, I don't know what's going on. I don't know what's happening. I

22
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:11,520
 was tired from ScoopFest, got in Monday early, had a day to recuperate, did laundry and such

23
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,280
 shit. I say a day to recuperate, it was hardly a day to recuperate. Tuesday night, I'm teaching

24
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:28,640
 my free improv class. Wednesday morning, 4 a.m., I'm at Target. So, small window of sleep there.

25
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:38,440
 Right. I get home on Wednesday, I do a Zoom meeting about a show on Friday, our podcast,

26
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,840
 and then I hit the hay because I'm already sleep deprived. I work on Thursday. I'm still

27
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,600
 very sleep deprived. Get up on Thursday, Thursday is lawn mowing day. Come back home, take a

28
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,800
 two hour nap, mow the lawn, then crash out again. Is every Thursday lawn mowing day?

29
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,580
 This Thursday was. Okay, okay. It's also pick up poop and trash day. So, those were my big

30
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:10,880
 things for Thursday. It's good to have a list. After I did my 4 a.m. work till 10. Then Friday,

31
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,560
 finally, this is going to be the start of recuperation time. I'm going to go to work

32
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,980
 on Friday in the morning, and then Friday, well, Friday is going to be busy, but Friday

33
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,500
 we were going to go to the optometrist, me and Ann for our annual, and then we were going

34
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,820
 to hang out all day, drive around, have some snacks, and then, because she was off off,

35
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,960
 which meant she couldn't get pulled in, which is what usually happens when we make plans,

36
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:42,360
 and then I was going to go and do a show at skit with the teachers in the evening, and

37
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:49,360
 then I'd be free and done. And then today was going to just be off. I was going to sleep

38
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:56,760
 in, catch up on sleep, maybe go to the comic book store, whatever. Well. And yet. And yet.

39
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,520
 So we go for our annual optometrist visit, and everything's going smooth, everything's

40
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:08,320
 fine. And then the optometrist says, uh, you need to go to the emergency optical place.

41
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,020
 I'm like, what the fuck? So apparently I have hemorrhaging happening in my left eye and

42
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:21,800
 only my left eye. Uh, there's an emergency optical place. Yeah, there is. Yep. Uh, Pittsburgh

43
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:28,240
 healthcare is way above what you got in Vegas. That's for sure. And it's just optical only

44
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,360
 optical only. Yep. Wow. Yeah. I've never heard of such a thing. I know it was pretty wild.

45
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,000
 So, but here's the, well, I'll say, I'll get to it. But so I'm like, okay, shit. Anyway,

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,960
 it's not both eyes. So that kind of negates diabetic stuff, which I've never had. I don't

47
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,080
 have hypertension. My blood pressure is not perfect, but it's not terrible. Right. So,

48
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,080
 you know, that's not it. It's not bleed out of your eyes. Bad. It's not bleed out of my

49
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:01,320
 eyes. Bad. My optic nerve is unaffected. My coronial area is not affected. I haven't had

50
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,360
 any vision problems. I wouldn't have known anything if I hadn't gone in for my annual,

51
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:13,280
 right? Yeah. So you can see, you couldn't, uh, like in the mirror, could you see blood

52
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,440
 or anything? No, no, no. The only thing that's happening are literal pin, pin prick points

53
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:26,960
 of blood in my eyeball at the ends of veins at the ends of veins that you can't, you can't

54
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,720
 see with the naked eye. You can only see it with the, with the optics of a microscope

55
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:38,680
 looking in my eyeball, right? Okay. Like these things are pin sized splotches of blood. It's

56
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,880
 not like my, my eye, aqueous humorous full blood or anything. How'd you know the name

57
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:47,960
 of my eye was little hemorrhage, little tiny hemorrhages, little tiny hemorrhages. We go

58
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:56,680
 to the optical specialist and, um, we get some more pictures done and the nurse there

59
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:03,800
 is like, I don't know what this is. I'm not an expert. I don't know what this is. I mean,

60
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,760
 you are an expert. She says, I don't know what this is. So they don't know what it is.

61
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,060
 And then it would be really terrible if you went to a doctor and they explained to you

62
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,520
 how they're not an expert. Right. Well, then the doctor comes in, the actual expert doctor

63
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,680
 comes in. This is my first day, buddy. Really? Sorry, I don't know what this is. And I've

64
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,600
 been in this fucking thing. I read a whole book and this was not in it. I've had my eyeballs

65
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,160
 dilate over here. Well, it's because it's not in tandem that's throwing them. Right.

66
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,400
 Gotcha. And I think it's probably a vascular thing. Like something's just not. Did you

67
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,320
 tell them about your fight club? Right. That was the thing. I don't know. Did I experience

68
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,480
 head trauma? That's the other thing. Like that's the other thing they asked me about

69
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,760
 head trauma. And I'm like, did I experience head trauma? Well, that's it. Good head trauma.

70
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,440
 You're not going to remember, right? Did you tell them? That's right. That someone told

71
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,440
 you that you had dust mites in your eyelids and you took a vacuum cleaner to one of your

72
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,160
 eyes? Did you tell them? I told them that. They said, no, that shouldn't affect anything.

73
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,920
 But I did. I did. I had, you know, I had a lot of travel. I had a lot of work, extra

74
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,600
 stuff, extra stress. You know, we were, we're busy. Sure. Sure. I've been doing shows. I've

75
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,240
 been, I've been busy as fuck. One legged man and asking contest. You heard my, my week

76
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,600
 when it got scoops. He thinks it was your, uh, your character changes during Pollywood

77
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,160
 squares. It's possible. Too much pressure on your, on your eyeball. Any of it's possible.

78
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,320
 So the other thing is what made this an emergency? I mean, what would happen if it was not treated?

79
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,720
 Because I don't know. Only one real podcaster in the zoom right now and it's Celestia Ward.

80
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:38,360
 Yeah. Because the, the optometrist believed that it could be a, a vascular issue. Oh Chris,

81
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:44,480
 thanks for putting us on with soccer, buddy. Poor Chris. I hope his back is feeling better.

82
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:50,920
 So, um, no, we're running into medical elements left and right. Everybody's old. Uh, so I,

83
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,160
 she said it could have been a vascular issue. So she was worried it could be something indicative

84
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,680
 of, uh, you know, stroke or whatever. I shouldn't say that exactly, but that's kinda, you know,

85
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,560
 it could be something Lindsay might be right in the chat. She says you got fucked in the

86
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:09,000
 face too much at scoop. I mean, that's true. Well, here's the thing. So villain meant to

87
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,760
 put tiny nanite robots into your bloodstream, but it was supposed to be for like the governor,

88
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,920
 but somehow it could be, it could be the Borg. You had identical lungages at, at the airport

89
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,040
 and like, and they thought they're going to get nanites into the governor's Russian spies.

90
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,640
 Who the fuck knows? Paul does have nice luggage. So I mean, it could be, yeah. You know, the,

91
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,360
 the Irish band did a lot of Johnny cash songs. Did they in fact, damn your eyes.

92
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,080
 Oh, good question. Good question. But I can see through this burning ring of fire. So

93
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,360
 I don't know. It doesn't hurt. There's no symptoms. That's the thing. So it's no symptoms.

94
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:50,600
 So I'm in the stirrup after having my eyes redialated, rejiggered, fucked with forever.

95
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,840
 Wait, the stirrup? Yeah. Your chin stirrup. Yeah. You put your head in the chin, chin

96
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,760
 stirrup and you press your face against thing and they're looking at you through a microscope.

97
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,960
 Oh, you don't know what it's like to be in stirrup at the doctor. Okay. Not that kind

98
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:09,080
 of stirrup. Thank you. That's what I was going. It's a, it's not a new fetish, a chin rest,

99
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,760
 new fetish unlocked, chin rest, chin stirrup. I don't know. I only want to be in stirrups

100
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,360
 now at the eye doctor. That would have been some shit. Put me in the stirrups doc. It

101
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,960
 might come to that. So he's looking at me and he's asking me all these questions. Do

102
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,320
 you have all these, you know, health things? No, no, no, no. All this other stuff. Uh,

103
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:37,160
 you vape? No. Uh, do you use, um, uh, what was the wording? He said, um, Oh, he said,

104
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,320
 do you use IV drugs? And I go, IV drugs? Anne was in the room with me. She starts laughing.

105
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,000
 She's like, no, no, he doesn't do any kind of stuff. But I mean, it was just such a foreign

106
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,680
 concept to me. I'm like, IV, what are you talking? What do you mean? IV drug? Am I getting

107
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:56,480
 a slow drip of morphine somewhere? No. Do you vape? Do you use Tik Tok? Have you lost

108
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,480
 all hope for owning property or retiring? All right. We can knock millennial off. He's

109
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,760
 not doing millennial. I, I didn't know what the fuck was going on. So anyway, I was like,

110
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:13,080
 no, no, no, no, no, no to all of it. And they're basically stumped. So they, they set

111
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:19,600
 up a battery of tests. Uh, so I went and got blood work today. So I'm getting blood work

112
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,720
 today. Um, which they're checking for like syphilis, AIDS, all this other shit. I'm like,

113
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:33,360
 God damn it. I had to put in my, I had to put in my social security for an AIDS check.

114
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,920
 I don't know. Anyway, so we're going through all these tests. It's a fucking mess. I don't

115
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:44,900
 know what they don't know. They don't know. That's the thing. I get, I get to be a medical

116
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:50,320
 oddity. This was yesterday. And then today was the text we get from Paul yesterday is,

117
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,440
 oh, it's a good thing we didn't record today. Cause we're recording a day late this week.

118
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,120
 A good thing we didn't record today because apparently my eye is hemorrhaging. Yeah. I

119
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,000
 wouldn't have been able to record anyway because I was busy with medical shit all day, but

120
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,080
 I was supposed to go and perform at seven 30 over at skit for, with the teachers. And

121
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,440
 I did it and was kind enough to tag along with me. Still. We were already out there

122
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,720
 in the city. So we went ahead and I performed. I didn't stay for the jam, but I performed

123
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,480
 with the four. You drove with one eye. She drove with the other. You guys, I drove with

124
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:26,660
 both eyes, but let me tell you, every fucking tail light was a spectacle. Oh yeah. Christmas

125
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,520
 lights and my eyes were still fully dilated. Even I had shades on and it was still really

126
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,440
 crazy and I was looking, my eyes were like saucers. So I did that. I felt, you know,

127
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,160
 I felt pretty good about making that responsibility and coming through on that. How was your show?

128
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:50,680
 Yeah. Yeah. And so, um, then, uh, we looked fine to pull. We had a show. Um, so, uh, let's

129
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,760
 get mine. The lights went off. Yeah, that was, yeah, there was lights and there were

130
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,600
 games played. So anyway, I think there were people, I couldn't say there were, there were

131
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:04,800
 like 18 or 20. So, um, that's what you were told. You couldn't see. Yeah. I, uh, I will

132
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:14,200
 say this. Uh, I love improvising with Matt Donnelly. Um, yeah, I really love it. It's,

133
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,240
 it's a special, wonderful thing that I have in my life and there's really no substitute.

134
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:27,000
 Um, so, uh, I will say also, uh, yeah, then, uh, today, like I said today had to go get

135
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,120
 up early. So I didn't get to sleep in again. I'm like, eh, I got to work tomorrow. They

136
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,880
 said no restrictions on anything, but I still feel kind of weird. I don't know, but it's

137
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,800
 all good. Again, no pain, no, no, I'm not seeing things different. I don't know what

138
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:48,200
 the fuck is going on. It's just frustrating as hell because it is a, a medical mystery.

139
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:56,000
 But today, even though I had to get up early and get my blood drawn and I would just, and

140
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,800
 has been my rock beside me the whole time. Really incredible. Uh, she's the sweetest

141
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:09,720
 thing ever. She's terribly, terribly worried for me. She doesn't talk like that at all.

142
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,560
 She's way more worried than I am. I'm more angry than worried. I'm just like this when

143
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:21,920
 I talk, I don't sound like this when I sing. I got to follow up on Tuesday, but aside from

144
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:31,200
 my eye hemorrhaging and having to get blood drawn today, today might just be my perfect

145
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:37,920
 day. It might just be my perfect day. So other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?

146
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,400
 We get the blood drawn, we get the blood drawn. The costumes were immaculate. Ann is feeling,

147
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,560
 you know, feeling the security at the booth could have been better. She's feeling very

148
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:53,560
 sorry for me. And she's proud of how brave I've been through all this. And so we go right

149
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:59,280
 after the, the eye thing, right? Or right after the blood draw, we go, we're out on

150
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,560
 McKnight road, which is all the stores and fancy malls and stuff like that. Um, it's

151
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,640
 the busiest, one of the busiest streets out there. Everybody calls it McKnight mayor road

152
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,680
 because people drive crazy. It's big city, dah, dah, dah. Anyway, so we're driving along

153
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,000
 and I'm thinking to myself, the places I've been on McKnight road, we don't go out very

154
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,560
 much to McKnight. And I was like, Oh, did special boy get a special day? Did I ever

155
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,960
 get a special day? I'm like, Oh, Ann, can we go to the ice cream? Can we go to the exchange,

156
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:33,360
 which is a Zia records type place, right? Oh, nice. Nice. I love Zia records where it's

157
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:40,360
 all like a good, a good record, used music, used video games, used toys. I'm in hog heaven.

158
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:47,560
 I go and I see, and I've been, I've been itching to get a new rock band guitar because I, that's

159
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:53,480
 one of the things I let go during my move. I foolishly let go of all my plastic instruments

160
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:59,000
 and you can't get one for all of the video game rock band for under a hundred bucks.

161
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,800
 And I need one for my three 60 because it's gotta be, so it's gotta be old. It's gotta

162
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,360
 be retro. And when you start getting into that old three 60 models, a lot of people

163
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,720
 didn't treat them great. So I don't, I didn't want to risk buying one online because then

164
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,400
 I'm out like 130, 150 bucks. And I don't even know if it's going to be covered in rat feces.

165
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:23,120
 So which is one of the songs, which is one of the songs you have to play on rock band

166
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,480
 rat feces. But really, as soon as I walked in the door, I'm thinking, you know what?

167
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,320
 I should go and look about a rock band guitar. Cause that's really the only thing video game

168
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,280
 related I need right now. So I look up and they've got a box, a full box of the whole

169
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:42,240
 kit and caboodle. Oh, the kit and the caboodle, 250 bucks. And I'm like, ah, shit for everything.

170
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,440
 But I don't really want the drums anymore. Don't need the microphone right now. But then

171
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,480
 I look over at the other wall and I see, and I asked the lady, I said, do you have, do

172
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,760
 you have just like a single guitar hero guitar for three 60? And she goes, why? Yes, we do.

173
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,640
 And she goes, we don't get these in very often, but this one just came in. And then I look

174
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:09,560
 up and it's really clean and it's really nice. And I'm like, oh shit. And so this is where

175
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,960
 the nanites got the Paul. This is where the nanites came in. This is it. It was a hundred

176
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,280
 bucks. So it's a splurge, but I've been trying to get one for a couple of years now, four

177
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,040
 years since I moved out here. Cause I really want to play Beatles rock band again, because

178
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,320
 that game is just so pretty. You've ever played Beatles rock band, Jacob? No, I didn't know

179
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,720
 there was a Beatles rock band. It's gorgeous. You should do yourself a favor of what I'm

180
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,640
 doing tonight though. I'll tell you what I'm doing tonight here in just a minute. Well,

181
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,240
 just look up Beatles rock band at some point on YouTube, whatnot. The visuals are glorious.

182
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,880
 Oh, really pretty cartoon animation. And it's just, by the way, Celestia got tired of this

183
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,840
 conversation just left. Yeah. No, she's there. She's there. She's still here. She's not.

184
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:53,040
 Oh, no, she left. She's back in. Great. Um, unfortunately we're still talking about the

185
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,600
 same thing, Celestia. You can leave again. I'm sorry. I'm just, I'm just Paul's special

186
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,880
 day. Yeah. Just explaining my, my favorite day. So we do that. So number one, I'm already

187
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,280
 ahead of the game. Got my rock band guitar. I come out grinning like a fish and looks

188
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,120
 at me like I'm a crazy. I'll just say for a fact that if not for Celestia, a frequent

189
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,120
 guest and friend of the show, I'd be really embarrassed that we're taking this long to

190
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,320
 get to our guests. But no, no, no. Celeste, Celestia, I appreciate you indulging me because

191
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:28,800
 I know you, you will allow me to say this dumb shit for a minute. I just have one question.

192
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:35,240
 How much did you pay your optometrist to say you had a medical mystery to give myself a

193
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,600
 special day? Yes. Uh, there's nothing I hate more than medical bullshit going on and having

194
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,080
 to get involved in the show. Sure. Sure. Sure. It makes me insane. Uh, yeah, I just, I lucked

195
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:52,440
 out and I lucked out doubly because Anne actually really cares about the whole medical wellbeing

196
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:59,400
 of me. And, uh, married men live longer. That's exactly right. It's true. I would not have

197
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,000
 gone to do any of this already. I would have been done as soon as she said, that's not

198
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,280
 how it's going down with Jacob and ice marriage. I'll tell you that much right now. Nope. Well,

199
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,480
 every time I tell Lester, I feel a little bad. She just hits me. Our next stop is the

200
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:19,920
 Ross Park mall, the Ross Park mall where gunshots rang out just the other night. Yeah. Oh, big

201
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:26,160
 drama in, in, in, uh, outside Pennsylvania or outside Pittsburgh. Oh man. So there was

202
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,560
 apparently some gang bullshit went down. Anyway, whatever. But, but by the same token, we drive

203
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,300
 in, there's a big line all around the mall. We're like, what the hell is this? And we

204
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:41,440
 park in and sure enough, it's a pop-up Sanrio shop. It's a Hello Kitty cafe van selling a

205
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,280
 special Hello Kitty merchandise. And there's just a line around the block for hello. So

206
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:51,320
 you got in line. I did not, I skipped the line and went right for the Lego store. Thank

207
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:56,280
 you very much. He put on, he put on his sunglasses from the optometrist and carrying a cane and

208
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,840
 they let them, if they had been selling, if they had been selling bots, Maru merchandise,

209
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,200
 possibly. And I mean, I don't say no to some cool Hello Kitty stuff. That shirt of mine

210
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,920
 is one of my favorites. Bots. What's bots Maru bots Maru is the angry little penguin

211
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:17,200
 with the spiked hair. That's what I say when I finished laying out my, my plan of like how,

212
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,040
 how we're going to pull off a heist. And then I finished with like, and bots Maru and I

213
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:29,720
 finished and then we, we go on with my bots. Maru is the secret code word. Turn off the

214
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,520
 laser. That's going to cut James Bond in half. So Celeste, you're running skeptic camp. Oh,

215
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:42,680
 sorry. No, no, no. Anyway, no, I bought Legos as Anne bought me Legos, which even better.

216
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:48,120
 I got treated to Legos and then we went to the whiskey store. Who's a big boy. Get your

217
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,920
 Lego and got some whiskey. Then she drove me to the comic book shop, which is in its

218
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,760
 new location. I got to go to the comic book store and now I'm back home and we stopped

219
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:06,040
 at Panda Express on the way home. So I mean, perfect. Perfect. So the perfect day. There

220
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:10,980
 was somebody that commented in the, in the comment section that this is what happens

221
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:17,280
 to a dog the day, like right before they get put down. Hey, don't think Anne's not thinking

222
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,600
 about maybe this is it. I better get him some Legos before he kicks the bucket. It's possible.

223
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,240
 Anything's possible. Get him some Legos up the life insurance policy. We've got to understand

224
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,080
 the poor woman's been traumatized. She came out here and four months later, her father

225
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,240
 passes and not even four months, like three months. It's just like, you know, so, uh,

226
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,160
 yeah, she's a good point. She deserves to take you out and get you everything you want.

227
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:46,280
 She's earned. Look, look, it's not that she just, she just, it's not not that she just

228
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:52,240
 really loves me. I love her too. Like crazy. It's, it's, I, I couldn't do anything without

229
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:59,600
 her at this point. So anyway, uh, yeah, it's all good. So I'm having a pretty good day

230
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:07,120
 except for, uh, exploding eye for whatever that, uh, you know, who else is having a pretty

231
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,080
 good day all except their eyeball popping out. That's the following sponsor. Oh, today's

232
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,080
 show is God damn it. I hit the wrong window. No things opening up. Oh, I've got it. Hold

233
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:23,600
 on. Uh, today's show is brought to you by Johnny Australia's commercial undersea navigation

234
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:32,320
 and telemet, uh, telemetry. There you go. T L L C Johnny Australia's commercial undersea

235
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:41,320
 navigation and telemetry. That's C U N T L L C. Good. Hi everyone. I'm now you're looking

236
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:47,560
 to go down under really down under down under the sea. Well, if you need to go under the

237
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:53,560
 sea, just look to me, Johnny Australia with his C U N T. It'll take you everywhere you

238
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:59,400
 need to go and places you shouldn't. That's right. My telemetry operations will get you

239
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:06,920
 navigating the wonderful world of Jacques Cousteau. Yeah, but mind you don't run any of those

240
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:12,000
 manta rays. They'll take you out in a second. They don't play around. They got a vengeance

241
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,400
 for us Aussies. They like to stab us in the heart with their spear for tails with that.

242
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:23,280
 And that's it. That's all she wrote. So get a C U N T and go swimming. Why don't you?

243
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:35,480
 Huh? Yeah. And her head scoops a check out. Yeah. Get a C U N T by my C U N T. Okay.

244
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:44,360
 Celestia Ward is here. She's helping create and run a new skeptic convention. Paul, what

245
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:52,360
 Legos did you buy? So I got the Gameboy. I'm sorry, everyone. We are out of time. Celestia.

246
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:57,000
 I'm so sorry. Apologies. We're gonna have to bump you. Well, no, I like that. You've

247
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:04,400
 completely overstated what it is. So I should just leave it at that. No, I know. Celestia

248
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,240
 is starting her convention. It's gonna be cool. What is the thing? Tell us about it.

249
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:15,760
 It's not a whole convention. It's what's called a skeptic camp. Oh, okay. Skeptic camp. And

250
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,240
 they've been doing these all over the country. And Las Vegas is kind of like, well, we should

251
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,720
 probably do one because you know, Vegas has got kind of a skeptical history. We had the

252
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:32,440
 amazing shorty here. We had years of the amazing meeting put on by him by the J ref the James

253
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,800
 Randy educational foundation. And then I missed the amazing meeting happening here. I liked

254
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:42,000
 seeing those people running around. They were they were a fun group to have around. Cool.

255
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,920
 And then Randy went ahead and died. What the hell? I know. Did you get to selfish and donut

256
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:57,420
 party? One time? Yep. My wife was in the band. So yeah, I was at I was at every bacon and

257
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:03,680
 donut party. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. I even got to the one at the old. What's the country

258
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,640
 bar that used to be down like all the way down by the south point that's a town square

259
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,400
 now. Not smokies, but something like that. But I remember. Yeah, they had it. They had

260
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,840
 like the full band down there and everything. And yeah, it was all it was all great. Yeah,

261
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:23,240
 yeah. Yeah, I I have fond memories of all that stuff. What don't you think we're this

262
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,120
 country's chock full of skepticism right now? Don't we have enough skepticism? Oh, yeah,

263
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,040
 everybody. Everybody from top to bottom is full on critical thinking. That's what we're

264
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:38,880
 celebrating. We're celebrating like the country is going great. It's a victory. There's there's

265
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,040
 no misinformation whatsoever coming at it anywhere. Good. Well, actually, you bring

266
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,520
 up it's just a big pat on the it's a big pat on the back for the community. Just job well

267
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:54,760
 done, everyone. Gold stars all around. It's just on a deck of a battleship. You're all

268
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,160
 going to be in flight suits. There's going to be a big mission accomplished banner behind

269
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,880
 you. It's going to be a whole thing. There's nothing political. That's that's actually

270
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,320
 one of the saving braces of something like a skeptic camp. It's a place where we can

271
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,380
 talk about weird stuff like we're going to be talking about UFOs and gambling legends

272
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:15,920
 and how to quote unquote beat the house. And we're going to have good there. And we're

273
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,360
 going to be talking about like, you know, Area 51. And I'm going to be talking about

274
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:26,660
 creativity and drawing and skepticism. And it's not going to be political. So hopefully

275
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:31,360
 people won't have their tribal masks up. And if you can teach somebody critical thinking

276
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,240
 by talking about like Bigfoot, then they can apply those skills to other things in their

277
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:44,840
 lives that might be a bit more weighty might perhaps hold the future of democracy in their

278
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:54,040
 hands. Now that I think that is a great theory. Do you are how optimistic are you that that

279
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:59,060
 theory is going to work in practice? Are you very optimistic? Because I'm a little skeptical

280
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:07,480
 of that theory. It will never work 100%. Nothing ever works 100%. Sure. It does make a difference.

281
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:14,240
 I mean, the most recent example is the RFK Jr. came out and said, Hey, Tylenol causes

282
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,920
 autism, blah, blah, blah. What? I didn't hear about that. All right. So is that an example

283
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:25,400
 of where we should exert skepticism? I don't know what your feeds looked like after that.

284
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:32,440
 But mine was completely chock-a-block full of social media doctors who are who have made

285
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:39,040
 a social media presence for themselves. Every magical every major medical organization,

286
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:44,600
 you know, the College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, pediatrics, you know, every branch came out

287
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:50,420
 and said, No, here's how you actually read the studies. No, please don't pay attention

288
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:55,840
 to what just happened on TV. Here's what doctors actually figure out. And here's, you know,

289
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,680
 the whole history of it. So that's, you know, public education. Skepticism has always been

290
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:08,020
 the intersection of science, education, and consumer protection. We don't want people

291
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:13,200
 to get ripped off. We don't want people to take wrong medical advice from charlatans,

292
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,240
 no matter what position of authority they might be in. And we want people to understand

293
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:25,040
 how the world works because it's pretty freaking cool. You know? Yeah. Right. We want to know

294
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:31,240
 what the fuck is wrong with Paul's eye. Right, right, right, right. Absolutely. Yeah. And

295
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,960
 we don't want conspiracy theorists on the internet to answer first. Oh, they will anyway.

296
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:42,920
 I mean, they will answer first and loudest. What will take place at the camp? At the camp?

297
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:48,520
 Well, we've got a number of speakers. We have a magician, Joan Ducour. Do you know her?

298
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:53,920
 Oh, I love Joan. I asked you. I asked you and you're like, Oh, I'm going to be gone.

299
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:58,240
 So I forget what you've got going on in the 25th. But this is happening. I would have

300
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,400
 declined anyway, because if you want people to speak towards research and education, I'm

301
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,280
 maybe not the best example. No, no, we just wanted magic. We just wanted somebody to perform

302
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:13,200
 magic. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, as a palate cleanser. Exactly. Now here is a fish. Does

303
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:21,040
 anyone have a guess as to where this came from? Or was it actually magic? I would love

304
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:28,680
 to turn your act into a TED talk. It's a full on TED talk. We've got to do that. We've got

305
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:34,680
 to come up with all these different topics that your act could lend itself to. I'm skeptical

306
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,520
 about whether those are his baseball cards from when he was a child and if they are baseball

307
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,840
 cards. Well, every magician you ever watch should be watched with skepticism. You should

308
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:52,480
 not be assuming they have miraculous powers. But that's why skeptic magicians get along.

309
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,460
 But actually, that is the absolute truth. It's not like if we were allowed to actually

310
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:02,400
 making people think we were magical, that would be a really weird profession. And that

311
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:07,640
 is how some magicians pursued their paths over the years, especially historically. But

312
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,960
 no, it's exactly like the more skeptical the audience is, the more the magic tricks really

313
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,080
 get reactions. Right. So that's what you're trying to do. So you are relying on an audience

314
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:23,040
 for being intelligent. Well, many magicians do. Some magicians don't. Have you had the

315
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:29,520
 experience in your career as a magician? Have you had the experience other magicians have

316
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,600
 kind of awkwardly felt really weird about where somebody comes up to you after and they're

317
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:42,760
 like, oh, you really have these amazing powers. Hey, my sister has cancer. You know, where

318
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,520
 they have not honestly think you have miracle powers and then they immediately hit you with

319
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:51,120
 some kind of big life request. Long term listeners will remember that someone wanted to become

320
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:58,960
 my apprentice at the end of one of my shows. Some guy thought I was actually doing magic

321
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,280
 and then he was writing things down creepily on a piece of paper throughout my entire show.

322
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,960
 And they came up to show me the things he was writing down and wanted to let me know

323
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:10,800
 that he was on the path to figuring these things out, too, and wanted to become my apprentice.

324
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:16,600
 And I could not get him to leave me alone for hours. This was in Elkton, Maryland. And

325
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,960
 I am still here, though. I would still like to be your apprentice.

326
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:30,840
 Jacob's not that wrong on the voice. And it was a really strange situation in which I

327
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:35,640
 was conceding like, no, you know, get out of here. The most embarrassing story of that

328
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:41,060
 is that I was doing pre show for Piff the Magic Dragon when I was dressed up as a giant

329
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:45,200
 like knight king person. All right. And I would just work on some card tricks before

330
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,320
 Piff and the dog came up for the VIP experience. So I did what's called a lie detector test

331
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,480
 where I have, you know, give people cards and say, I want you to say yes, no matter

332
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,720
 what to every question I asked, you know, is it a heart? Is it a spade? Is it red? Is

333
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,120
 it black? Is it the number card? Is it a face card? And I have them repeat the answers over

334
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,040
 and over again. They say yes every time. And then I go up, you know, three of hearts and

335
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:10,240
 they're like, oh, you nailed it. And a guy was like, hey, I teach psychology at my high

336
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,400
 school. Could you maybe go over some of the principles you used for that? And I could

337
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:20,480
 maybe use it in my school. And I was like, oh, buddy, the guy dressed like a knight doing

338
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:28,240
 pre show for a dog is not someone who was mastered body language.

339
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:34,720
 Well, that's that's that actually hits back to some pseudoscience. I mean, that they

340
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,320
 I don't know if you remember that show lie to me. It was based loosely on Paul Ekman's

341
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:44,380
 work where he honestly believed you could detect lies just by seeing micro expressions

342
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:50,240
 and everything. And yes, yeah. The Secret Service has claimed to be able to do that

343
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:57,420
 for years. The Secret Service claims that they teach micro expression reading to their

344
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:04,540
 agents and they they claimed their agents are the best at seeing seeing lies happen

345
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:11,840
 of all of the whatever agencies around the world. It always sounds like bullshit. Anytime

346
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,920
 I hear somebody talk about it, it just sounds like total bullshit.

347
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,820
 Well, everyone has a version of a bullshit or lie detector in themselves, right? We all

348
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:23,140
 know or think when somebody's fucking with us or lying with us or whatever. So it makes

349
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:27,600
 sense that someone in a government agency would suddenly exert a lot of ego and energy

350
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:34,600
 into that element of things. But yeah, I mean, it's all you know, and that's why like even

351
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,160
 like lately there was even like a government threat about polygraphing people for trying

352
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:42,760
 to control. I was about to say Kristi Noem has decided to polygraph like a ton of people

353
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:49,040
 looking for whoever's leaking stuff and it is now widely known. Like I think it's widely

354
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:55,680
 known that polygraphs do not work. Yes, but not widely enough. It is the subject of television

355
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:03,360
 shows, books, all the like it's it is as widely known, I think, as anything can be. But it's

356
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,200
 not widely known that it doesn't work. I think it is though. I was once hooked up to a polygraph

357
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:14,480
 by a police officer. Uh huh. I have been too. Yeah. In a real situation? I was applying

358
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,400
 for a job with the police department. This was like 20 years ago. Mine was not a real

359
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,000
 situation at all. I got to the finals. Like, you know, it was like me and like five other

360
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,400
 people for the position and they hooked me up and and I'm like, this probably lost me

361
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:35,220
 the job. I was like, you guys know these don't work, right? And he's like, well, it depends

362
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:40,920
 on who's giving it. And if the person who's giving it knows how to read it, blah, blah,

363
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:46,360
 blah. I believe you can be better than other people at it. But it's not it's not it doesn't

364
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:53,360
 just work. Yeah. It's a tool to leverage people to make them. Yeah, it's it's a thing. Yeah.

365
00:33:53,360 --> 00:34:01,080
 It can be used as a tool, but it's not it's not Wonder Woman's magic lasso. No. Which

366
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:06,960
 policy just paid $250 for a kitten caboodle at a magic shop on a special day. Yeah. Absolutely.

367
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:14,120
 Wonder Woman has three magic lasso. So one is the lasso of truth. One is the lasso of

368
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:20,560
 faith and the other's chastity. Yeah, that's the truth. Faith and chastity. I can't remember

369
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,360
 because absolute Wonder Woman is from hell now. It's awesome. Oh, that's great. Raised

370
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,720
 by Circe in hell. It's it's you have roughly 20 minutes of talking material that you can

371
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,000
 do on on Wonder Woman now. Look, I'm not going back into another Celestia layout. Let Paul

372
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:42,520
 cook. Let's go. Look, hey, that's just here. No, Celestia. What a winner scoop in the chat

373
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,840
 while Paul's thinking of his question says that they failed a polygraph that they had

374
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:52,840
 100% told the truth on and they have a stress disorder. Yeah. So false false negative on

375
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,280
 that one. Yeah, that's that's an interesting one that I had not heard of. I think what's

376
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:05,120
 the most important question to ask when you're starting to approach a topic from a skeptical

377
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,400
 or critical thinking point of view? What do you think is like the most important way to

378
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:17,080
 start a position of intellectual humility? Because you could always be your own. You're

379
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:23,800
 right. I like that. Skepticism is is really about learning that your brain is broken in

380
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:32,440
 any number of ways. Everybody else's are too. But your own biases are so powerful. That

381
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:38,800
 is the secret between like atheists and the very religious, right? Like religious people

382
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,520
 can't believe how know it all atheists are and atheists can't believe that people of

383
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,920
 faith have such faith. Right. And so they both use the other being an arrogant know

384
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:55,480
 it all all the time. But but if you truly are coming at stuff from a scientific perspective,

385
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:01,280
 I mean, even just as an improviser, I've been doing it for a long time. I still don't know

386
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,340
 everything there is to know about how to do it best. I still don't know the best techniques.

387
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:11,560
 And when you learn more about theater and performance, you know that you don't know.

388
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:16,440
 Well, you're describing Dunning Kruger. I mean, the fact that people who are experts

389
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:22,000
 get pretty humble about like how much else there is to learn in that. Right. That's it.

390
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,040
 He sees a 20 minute video on YouTube and they're like, I know the doctors are lying to us,

391
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,680
 you know. Yeah, but that's where I live is in Dunning Kruger play. Not that side of it.

392
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:37,560
 But Paul, you know, Freddy Krueger, you live in Freddy Krueger. I do every night. You're

393
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:45,760
 mine, bitch. Yeah, it's scary, scary. Freddy Dunning. Freddy. Freddy Dunning Krueger is

394
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:53,320
 a whole nother. Somebody has to have done. What do you think? What do you think? Is reality

395
00:36:53,320 --> 00:37:04,280
 formed by dream or is dream part of reality? Ha, bitch. Yeah. Freddy Dunning Krueger is

396
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,640
 the name of a two thousand twenty four rock music single by the Manchester based band

397
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:15,360
 ether. Of course, it has good job. Manchester based band either. I'm surprised it took until

398
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,960
 twenty twenty four. I'm going to have to look that up. We're going to have to play that

399
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:27,400
 at the skeptic camp. That sounds funny. Yeah. If it's right. Yeah. It's October 25th, Saturday.

400
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,080
 We're starting at nine a.m. We're going all the way through to seven p.m. We're going

401
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:35,380
 to have a game show. We're going to have talks. We're going to have activities. We're going

402
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:42,400
 to have free lunch. You do have to register. Go to LVSOS dot com to register. That stands

403
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:50,480
 for the Las Vegas Society of Skeptics dot com LVSOS dot com. Just a quick Google form.

404
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,280
 You'd say if you're going, if you have any minor kids you're bringing with you, blah,

405
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,760
 blah, blah. And we will hopefully be able to have enough food for everybody if everybody

406
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:04,800
 registers on time. And we've got a lovely venue down over on the east side of Las Vegas.

407
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:11,280
 It is actually at the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Las Vegas on Lake Mead. And

408
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,200
 I was a little hesitant that, you know, one of one of our organizers is a member there

409
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:22,720
 and she's a total atheist. And there's a lot of atheists in the Universalist Congregation.

410
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,740
 And I'm like, a church, really? And she's like, as a member, I can get us the venue

411
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:32,600
 for free. And I'm like, OK. And I went over membership. Now you're talking. It's perfect.

412
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:38,100
 There's like a big lecture hall area. There's break rooms. There's like it's absolutely

413
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:42,680
 a wonderful place to hold an event. Oh, yeah. That's good. Best guys have it all figured

414
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:53,720
 out. Yeah. And no, no taxes. Hey, so Celestia, I have to say, I'm a little bit skeptical.

415
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:59,320
 I've heard there's no such thing as a free lunch. I'm skeptical that it's going to start

416
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:08,660
 promptly at 9 a.m. to be skeptical about the lunch is not free. Organizers are shelling

417
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:14,480
 out some some money to help. Actually, we are also asking people to bring some non-perishables

418
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,200
 because they run a food bank for the community. Oh, nice. So it's sort of in exchange for

419
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,760
 all these lectures from cool people. We've got Brian Dunning of Skeptoid.com is coming

420
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,400
 out. Oh, great. Susan Gerbic of she's known as the Wikipedia attrition. She's like the

421
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,840
 organizer of Gorilla Skeptics on Wikipedia. She's coming out and giving a talk. Kyle Polish

422
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:39,160
 of Data Skeptic. He's going to be talking about gambling math and everything. So nerds

423
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:44,760
 will have a really good time at this and bring some canned food or non-perishables for the

424
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,440
 food pantry. And hopefully you'll get a sandwich from the catered sandwiches we're going to

425
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:56,840
 be bringing it. Nice. Yeah. And there'll be a taco truck for dinner. Oh, you need a whole

426
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:04,800
 truck? Yes. The first person to finish the truck will win a taco. But is it taco? Come,

427
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:11,720
 come, come, come, come. That was my is it cake joke about a taco truck? All right. Oh,

428
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,160
 is it cake? Oh, no, it read, it read. No, no, no, it's better. It's funny when I explain

429
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:24,280
 it. That was just as funny. Celestia, you stopped by ScoopFest and you did filthy caricatures.

430
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:31,620
 I did. And I was so mad I couldn't do it last ScoopFest. Andy Taylor had to cover for me

431
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:38,200
 because I had pneumonia. Oh, and he wasn't nearly as good. No, he was tame. He was tame.

432
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,640
 He said he said it was more stress. If I'm remembering correctly, he said it was a bit

433
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:47,360
 more stress than he thought it would be. Because really, your brain cells are going like in

434
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,720
 all different directions for weeks before. They're lined up for you. Yeah. I was trying

435
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:58,140
 to think of like dirty things I could draw in five minutes. And, you know, I'm actually

436
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:02,260
 very relieved to not have to think about these things anymore because it was one of those

437
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:07,400
 like intrusive thoughts. I just have these images going around my head all the time.

438
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,000
 Okay, okay, I can do somebody like that. Oh, I can draw somebody doing that too. And if

439
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,400
 I have two people, if I have three people, blah, blah, blah. Yeah. Did you did you have

440
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,120
 any ideas that you weren't able to use? Yeah, I had quite a few that I wasn't able to use

441
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:27,840
 because a lot of more more than I expected. People sat down and it just sort of happened.

442
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:32,720
 Like stuff I didn't even think about beforehand, like the two guys in a banana suit. I mean

443
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:42,640
 of Yeah, that was I have never drawn two guys in a banana suits, having sex so vigorously

444
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:50,080
 that the Chiquita sticker pops off. But that was fun to draw. Right. When you didn't draw,

445
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,920
 that's what they were doing. But what did you draw while they were doing that? Oh, I

446
00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:00,280
 drew them sipping Cosmopolitans. Oh, that's nice. That's nice. They were fucking each

447
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:06,160
 other raw. So everybody, people I've showed some of these pictures off. I didn't put them

448
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,520
 on Facebook, but I showed them to some, you know, private friends and everything. They're

449
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:15,000
 like, What was this thing you drew? It was like a swingers party. And I'm like, No, no,

450
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,800
 not at all. These. This is not a sex camp, you know, thing. These are just not officially

451
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:31,680
 sex camp is October 25th in the basement of the sex camp sex camp. Yeah. But I honestly,

452
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,480
 I think a swingers party would be way less fun because I mean, y'all are just a loving

453
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:44,680
 community of open minded humorous people. And I think I was talking to Brian Brushwood

454
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:50,640
 afterwards and he said, it's like the horseshoe. It's like the horseshoe theory. He's like,

455
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:55,040
 we've got a lot of really smart people here, but at the end of the horseshoe, there's also

456
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,840
 a lot of really dumb people. So we've got like the smartest dumb people and the dumbest

457
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:08,560
 smart people all gathered to do fun things. I'm in the dumbest quality area. Yeah. I rely

458
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,640
 on the scoops brain power. Oh yeah. I'll tell you how dumb I am in the dumber smart category.

459
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:19,080
 I'm so dumb. I've got my old Apple computer here that has all my music on and everything.

460
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:23,280
 And I've locked myself out and I can't remember my password and I've just fucked. I just,

461
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,000
 I've just got to sit here for days to try and get the password on this damn computer.

462
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,660
 And if I don't get it, I'm going to lose thousands of dollars of music. It's going to, it's going

463
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:38,320
 to make me so sad. So somebody popped up on on socials the other day. It was some, uh,

464
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:44,480
 some sporting person, I think had lost the password to their Bitcoin wallet. They had,

465
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,120
 they had a bunch of Bitcoin and in this wallet for back when it was very cheap and somebody

466
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:54,000
 had given them like 40 Bitcoin or 400 Bitcoin or something. And they don't know the password

467
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,680
 and it's, it's a few million dollars in there. Yep. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well there

468
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,960
 was, wasn't it, wasn't it somebody on here that told us the story of how they had paid

469
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:10,880
 an ex-girlfriend for pizza in Bitcoin. Right. Uh, but it was, it was the only Bitcoin that

470
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,120
 ex-girlfriend had ever gotten. So he wasn't sure if she even knew that she had some Bitcoins

471
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:21,280
 that were worth like one point something million dollars. Yes. And he had not talked to that

472
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,200
 ex-girlfriend in a while. I don't remember who that was. I think it was, that was some

473
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,040
 story from the, from the way back past. It's a scoop mail, wasn't it? I think it was a

474
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:32,040
 scoop mail. It might have been a scoop mail or a guest or something. Yeah. Somebody, somebody

475
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,680
 will tell us over the next, uh, over the next week or two. I'm sure somebody will, somebody

476
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:40,800
 will remember that bit. I am not an economic expert at all, but Bitcoin skeeves me out.

477
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:49,080
 I, I don't. Yeah. It's like, it's math and it's, I agree with that. And I've always

478
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:56,080
 thought that it made it so much math. So gross. Math all over me. No, I love math. I just,

479
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:01,840
 I just don't know if I'm comfortable with using math as currency. I don't, I don't

480
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:08,960
 know if I'm comfortable with math. I am not. Well, I don't know what you're talking about

481
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,680
 Felicity, because it makes sense to everybody else. The rest of us are all on board with

482
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:24,240
 it. I stand corrected. I'll go invest. Um, I saw it like you were, uh, you get hired

483
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:28,960
 to do these like crazy gigs all the time. Um, I saw, when were you doing caricatures

484
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,880
 on mugs and calling them mug shots? I thought that was pretty neat. I was. Yes. Yeah. Uh,

485
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,280
 is this what's, what is, is the, is it, I've never, I guess I don't know how to ask this.

486
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,700
 Is the, is the character world evolving? Like what's happening? Yeah. The industry is going

487
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:49,600
 through some stuff and I, I always feel like this kind of indicates times of economic uncertainty

488
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,880
 when party planners call you and instead of just, Hey, come do the regular thing you've

489
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,880
 done for years and years. They're like, we want you to do your thing, but we've got this

490
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:00,560
 weird idea and we want to try and, you know, capitalize on your talents by doing this other

491
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:06,960
 thing and so they fit you into all these, yeah, they try to judge it up. And so the

492
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,080
 latest thing has been drawing on napkins has gotten really big. Like, Oh, like you pretend

493
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,560
 you're Pablo Picasso and you're drawing on napkins for people at the night. You're going

494
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:23,320
 by yourself, a college education. Yeah. Go and take your child to Madrid. Yes. Go and

495
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:33,280
 buy a vacation home, Pablo, Pablo by UA house. None of my napkin scribbles will get anybody

496
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:41,680
 a college education right now, but once you're dead and appreciated, look the fuck out. That's

497
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:46,200
 what it happens. Unless you're Pablo. Who else, who else got that ride? Got that ride

498
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:51,840
 like Pablo Picasso. Who else came, came up with it and still, yeah. Like, I mean, who

499
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:59,160
 else was John Michelle Basquiat? Okay. I was gonna say Basquiat Warhol. See Paul's relying

500
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:03,520
 on the scoops for intelligence, but Basquiat passed away very young. He didn't get to ride

501
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,720
 it for long. That's right. He didn't, he didn't write it for long, but he wrote it in flight

502
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:14,560
 a bit. Uh, I mean, he would, he would, he would go into groceries for gas stations with

503
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:19,920
 no money to buy a pack of cigarettes and then just doodle on a receipt and you know, just

504
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,320
 that, but that was his life for a while. Okay. So he did. Okay. Cool. That is a, that's cool.

505
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:29,040
 Let's try that today. I know many artists who have gotten free drinks from it and they're

506
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:35,040
 not Basquiat or, or anybody famous, but you know, it's been a long time way to get free

507
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:40,220
 drinks, but what, what the agents are now having artists do, you know, caricature artists

508
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:46,880
 in Las Vegas, working trade shows and parties and corporate events is there. And I, I'm

509
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,480
 feeling a connection here, Matt, to what you do. And I'm finally understanding the draw

510
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:58,440
 of it here. Nope. No pun intended. They're having me do stealth caricatures, which means

511
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:03,640
 I hang out in a corner. I stand up against the wall. I draw on a little clipboard and

512
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:10,760
 then I slide it to the unsuspecting model who has no idea I've been drawing them. Whoa.

513
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:15,760
 And the male artists, I know the male caricature artists hate to do this. They're like, I feel

514
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:22,000
 creepy. I'm sliding. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Handing them. It's like, it's like watching binoculars

515
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,880
 don't help. That makes that makes it more creepy. But I got to tell you, I was born

516
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:32,360
 to do this. Celestia uses opera glasses. I just, oh, that would be lovely. I'm going

517
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:36,880
 to have to do that now. The glasses actually help because it makes it harder for people

518
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:42,240
 to see that I'm staring at them from like 20 feet away. Oh yeah. Yeah. And, and I've

519
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:49,160
 got progressive lenses so I can look far or near or far or near. And, well, that's what

520
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:53,840
 I always tell the ladies that I'm staring at. I'm like, Hey, these are progressive. Yeah.

521
00:48:53,840 --> 00:49:07,440
 I'm as progressive as they come. Farther than near. I'm staring at you progressive. From

522
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,160
 near and far. I'd like to break off a piece of that action. Come on now.

523
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:17,720
 I'm Paul Mattingly. How are you doing? I have never been a magician. I have never been a

524
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:24,320
 stealthy person, but I am an overweight middle aged white woman. You put me in a trade show

525
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:33,840
 room with a clipboard and I am a ninja. Nobody sees me. I blend into the wallpaper. I look

526
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:38,200
 like every other. The bartenders think I'm keeping tabs on how much they're pouring.

527
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:48,960
 They get a little nervous. Oh. Near. It's one of the higher nups. Neat rocks. But when

528
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,720
 you, when you slide the drawing, I'll just say, where do you, how do you, when and how

529
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:57,960
 do you deliver the finished product? That's the magic part. Plenty of times I just handed

530
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:03,360
 to them and say, this is for you. But a lot of times I can slide it right next to them

531
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:07,640
 on, if they're at the bar, if they're sitting at a table, kind of, if they're at a cocktail

532
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:11,800
 table, I've even been able to put it into one guy's pocket without him realizing it.

533
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:18,120
 And they, they don't notice. Not only do they not notice sometimes only one person out of

534
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:23,600
 the group will notice it or nobody will notice it. And I just skulk off and I like, you can

535
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:28,160
 count one, two, three, four, five. And then they're like, Oh my God, what the heck, you

536
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:34,200
 know, and explosion of like, somebody has drawn my picture. And how did this, where

537
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,880
 did they go? And sometimes they're looking for me in a panic for like the next 20 minutes.

538
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:44,080
 I bet people chase me down by the end of the night going, how did you even do this? I didn't

539
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:50,520
 see you. And it's people are so unobservant. Oh my God. If I was evil, I could have, I

540
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:54,240
 could have ripped off every single one of them, taken all of their purses and wallets.

541
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:54,560
 But

542
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:06,000
 I just remember my password. So I'm on cloud nine right now. I just unlocked thousands of

543
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:13,200
 dollars of music for myself. Everything's coming up. This is going to be the best day of my

544
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:17,440
 life before we're done here. Also, I'm enjoying the hell out of this episode. I'm glad to

545
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,840
 see Celestia. We've got we've had more people in the room than we've ever had guys. We keep

546
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:28,840
 going up. We had we had 42, which is our max now that we've had so far. Everything's

547
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:34,440
 happening. Everything. Things keep going up. Exactly. So things keep going up. This is

548
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:39,640
 great. This is great. This is great. I'm loving it. Yeah, you scoops are here for my best

549
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:43,400
 day ever. You want to tell me when your password so that you have it as a backup? I sure

550
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:50,000
 don't. I sure do not. I sure do not. Winner scoops suggest that you write it down. Yes.

551
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:57,240
 I am going to write it down 1000 times. Yes. Celestia, has there once has there been any

552
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:01,720
 requests you've had to say no to the people trying to make your your profession into

553
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:06,920
 something maybe more difficult? Yeah, I had somebody recently asked if I could draw on

554
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:14,120
 golf balls. Oh, god damn, that sounds awful. And I you know, I was a little snarky. I was

555
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:20,760
 like, um, I've drawn on coffee mugs and napkins and other stuff. Golf, you know, unless the

556
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:27,880
 people have a lot of dimples, I'm not going to draw them on a golf ball. Who's golf? Yeah,

557
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:35,080
 who's golf? Oh, hey, sure thing. But is he okay? Welcome to my golf party. I'm Joe golf.

558
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:42,520
 You're going to draw my balls tonight. I haven't had to draw on people. I that's you've never

559
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:48,040
 drawn. That's it. That's what you've never drawn on skin. Well, I have, but I haven't been paid

560
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:57,800
 to do it. Okay. Have you was like a look for a tat? Was this for a tattoo possibly? Or? No,

561
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:01,400
 no. That's the reason why I would never be a tattoo artist. Everybody always asks, Oh,

562
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:05,400
 you should get into tattoos and blah, blah, blah. Number one, the tattoo market is flooded.

563
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:11,960
 Everybody and their mother might be the tattoo artist in the 90s. But I don't like the idea of

564
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,880
 something I draw. You know, if you don't like it, I want you to be able to throw it away.

565
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:20,760
 So drawing on napkins and cups, maybe drawing on garbage is for me, I guess.

566
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:28,680
 I have never been able to get rid of that tattoo. Oh, God. There's a question for Briar.

567
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,360
 You ever had someone ask you if they could get one of your works tattooed?

568
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:37,160
 I have. I haven't. I've had somebody send me a photographs of it.

569
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:44,200
 Gosh, it's been a while. I've had somebody, you know, because occasionally people like have their

570
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:49,560
 loved ones caricatured and then plaster their wife and kid on them from the caricature.

571
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:53,800
 And that's happened to me a couple of times. And then I had this one guy, the only time I've

572
00:53:53,800 --> 00:54:01,160
 actually been like, yeah, cool. All right. He said, I'd like you to draw my tattoo design.

573
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:05,000
 And I'm like, well, it was really slow. I was at a caricature. I was at the caricature stand.

574
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,680
 Logos or tattoos. When you go to a caricature artist and you're like, hey, can you invest five

575
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:15,960
 minutes in something? I want to make permanent for my business or my body. You're already dealing

576
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:22,280
 with somebody who cuts corners. It's not a great idea, but he wanted to, he wanted to have a tattoo

577
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:29,880
 that would win him bar bets. And so he explained he wanted a, a rooster in a noose. Like the new,

578
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:37,640
 the rooster was being, you know, hung, tangled. Yes. And he said this was going to win him bar

579
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:43,400
 bets. And I'm like, okay, I could draw a rooster in a noose. Tell me how it's going to win you a

580
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:48,200
 bar bet. And he said, well, he's betting people that he has a tattoo of a rooster with a noose

581
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:52,200
 on it. And they say, I bet you don't have that. And he says, ha ha, I won. I'm, I'm waiting for

582
00:54:52,200 --> 00:55:00,360
 one of you to guess, but if you don't guess, I'll tell you. There's a chicken, chicken, chicken,

583
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:07,560
 choking. I'll show my cock in this bar. Well-hung cock. I'll choke my chicken in his bar. He was,

584
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:12,760
 he was going to tattoo it right below his knee. And he was going to bet people that he has a,

585
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:21,080
 that his cock hanging below his knee. He's got a cock hanging below his knee. Oh, that's funny for,

586
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:25,320
 yeah. So the person doesn't want to blow you anymore. That's pretty,

587
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:32,360
 we know these jokes. Well, we know these jokes. We all know these jokes very well.

588
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:38,520
 These are jokes that are better in theory. There are a lot of physical bits that are just better

589
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:42,600
 in theory. I know you go to that, what are the nursing home argument, which is like the moment

590
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:47,560
 the nurse is like coming in there and you're like, Oh God, this is a low hanging chicken joke. Fuck

591
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:59,240
 you. Eat your apple sauce. Oh, the nurse at the retirement home. Hey, hey sweetie. I bet you I got

592
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:04,680
 a cock hanging below my knee. You have dementia. That's right. Yeah, yeah. You told me yesterday

593
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:12,200
 the same joke every day, Taryn. Did you blow me? I did yesterday. I blew you buddy. Oh, I bet that

594
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:18,200
 was great. It was. Thanks pal. Oh, good. You want to blow me again? I don't have your applesauce.

595
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:29,880
 Oh, I do like applesauce. You know who else likes applesauce from old men who have pictures of cocks

596
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:36,680
 on their knees? That's the following sponsor. From the gorilla dentist from that Bjork video,

597
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:42,200
 from the makers of hemp burlap boxer shorts, it's permanently wet socks.

598
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:54,280
 Hey, how's it going everybody? I'm a creepy Best Buy guy. I just want you to know that

599
00:56:54,280 --> 00:57:02,120
 sales are way, way down. We've got like three stores left and decided to expand our inventory.

600
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:13,480
 Unfortunately, we rented a warehouse and all we had was socks. The warehouse got compromised.

601
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:21,640
 Somebody put a bunch of milk in it. I don't know who would put a bunch of milk on socks.

602
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:30,600
 Milk socks, gross. They did. So we got an abundance of damp old milk socks.

603
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:38,520
 And if you're looking to buy some, I can get them for you real, real cheap.

604
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:45,000
 But what if I'm not looking to buy some? Then I'm going to put them on you while you're tied up.

605
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:54,040
 And I'm going to slowly leech the milk out with my mouth. I'm going to suck the

606
00:57:54,040 --> 00:58:00,200
 rancid milk out of your socks while I leave your socks on. Yeah.

607
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:08,840
 You know, the best thing about having rancid milk socks is just a couple of weeks of wearing them.

608
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:15,160
 And you've basically made yourself a whole vat of cottage cheese in your shoes. It's really nice.

609
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:23,080
 On the one hand, I was going to tell Jacob it was too loud to hear Paul. And then I was like,

610
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:28,920
 I'm fine with that. That's fine. That was a little extra disgusting, Paul.

611
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,920
 But that's what I do. That's what I'm paid for.

612
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:41,000
 This is the trick. Paul's having a day. No, no, no, no. No, no, no. Thanks to my,

613
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,720
 let's get it straight. Thanks to my exploding eye and my beloved wife Anne McFeeters,

614
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:50,760
 I am on the brink of having the best day of my life. The best day of my life.

615
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:55,720
 And that includes all of you being here. You are party to the best day of my life so far.

616
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:02,520
 So far. It's going to keep getting better. It is a commercial that Anne's going to fast forward,

617
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:10,120
 just so we're clear. She is. You know what? Also, I would say that our, like ScoopFest for me was

618
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:15,000
 one of the highlights of my life. This last ScoopFest was really, really good. Not, you know,

619
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,920
 but easily top 10 things that I've done in my life. And I would say, Matt, you and I,

620
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:28,600
 our bucket shows were easily top three performances of my life. These bucket shows were just off the

621
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,960
 hook for some reason. I'm so glad it's all of my life. Paul was ready to retire from stage

622
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:37,000
 performance after this bucket show. I loved those bucket shows so much. They were really good.

623
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:48,040
 Yeah, go ahead. Both shows found like a really great button. And when we were like, when my

624
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:53,960
 improv group were like maniacs, when we were all like eight equally dedicated maniacs about long

625
00:59:53,960 --> 01:00:00,280
 form improv, you would find those buttons in our shows. And it was like so satisfying where you

626
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:06,120
 actually bring a kind of wave of callbacks and like something dovetails that changes a character

627
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:11,240
 into something that suddenly fits the puzzle. It's so hard to describe, but when it happens,

628
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:16,360
 and so, and basically Mark Roberts did it twice. That's what I was going to say. I was going to

629
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:21,720
 say big thanks to Mark and Brenna both for bringing an amazing energy to it too. It wasn't just us

630
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:29,800
 this time. No. And it felt retro. Like we called the shows on the buttons and I was like, man,

631
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:36,280
 I haven't felt like this in a long time. Absolutely. I will never forget. A lot of long form teams,

632
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:40,520
 including our other bucket shows, you can ape it, right? You can kind of like push it the way

633
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:44,600
 that the audience feels like it's cute and it's enough and it's close enough. And yeah, we get it.

634
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:50,440
 Or even just end on a laugh. Yeah. But these, you're absolutely right. There was a symmetry

635
01:00:50,440 --> 01:01:00,200
 and a actual connectivity to it all. It paid the fuck off. Both of them had payoffs.

636
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:04,360
 And it's interesting because yeah, when I teach improv, I said there's a difference in a callback

637
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:10,360
 and a connection. Yes. And it was really hard to illustrate it and both ended with really strong

638
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:18,200
 connections and not just callbacks. Yes. It was really nice. Can I ask you guys as improvisers?

639
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:25,320
 Because I have this recent fear as a caricature artist, because I've watched many caricature

640
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:30,840
 artists before me kind of, you get, you know, your twenties, you're kind of sucking, you get better,

641
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:35,960
 you learn more, you get more experienced, you get quicker, you get, suddenly you're in the mentor

642
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:42,760
 position. And I turned 50 recently and you guys are kind of around the same age where you feel

643
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:47,080
 like you're in your prime. You're like, I am bringing all this experience to bear. I'm faster

644
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:53,240
 than I've ever been. I'm doing well. And then you're like, how long until I'm one of the old

645
01:01:53,240 --> 01:02:00,040
 people who loses my edge? Because you also see that. Are you guys like trying to milk every,

646
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:06,760
 no pun intended, you're trying to milk sock every moment. You're prime here. Are you worried that

647
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:11,720
 like in another 10 years, this could all just be like, you know, you're not hitting it anymore.

648
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:17,000
 That's a great question. Can I answer first, Matt, and let you say next what you think?

649
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:22,440
 You're already faster than me, right? So somebody's showing you how slow I'm getting with age. Yes.

650
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:29,800
 So here's my thing. And I think about when I was real, I was, I've had a couple of really cooking

651
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:36,280
 times in my career. And the one was when I was part-time track full-time second city

652
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:42,040
 and going back and forth between shows. Well, I was understudying. What were you tracking?

653
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:47,160
 Motherfucker. Anyway, there were days when I would do seven hours of Klingon,

654
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:53,080
 get a shower at the, at the Hilton, take the monorail to the Flamingo and do two shows at night.

655
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:59,240
 I was firing on all fucking cylinders. I was a young man doing it. I didn't know at the time

656
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:07,240
 that that was a prime time of my physical and mental performance time. We never do.

657
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:13,880
 Aha. But this is the difference, Jacob. I think with age, we do sometimes know,

658
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:21,080
 like I am very conscious of the fact that that last, that that last scoop fest was great.

659
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:27,480
 And those, uh, bucket show performances were very high bar. So I think Celestia,

660
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:37,160
 as long as you know you're doing well, you won't become the old daughter. You won't become the butt

661
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:46,440
 of the joke because, uh, unless your mental faculties completely fail you, there may or

662
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:51,960
 may not come a point where you go, you know what? Time to hang up the gloves. But I think, uh,

663
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:56,280
 self, self-awareness is the key. I think, well, and I think that's the key, but it's also,

664
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:00,440
 just like we were talking about with skepticism and the Dunning-Kruger and all that kind of thing,

665
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:07,720
 you know, you know how good you are right now, but you also still, still know, like, is it fair to

666
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:11,880
 say you still find yourself improving and growing and learning new techniques even to this day?

667
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:17,240
 Oh, absolutely. I tell people the day that I stopped learning how to draw is when I'm going

668
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:23,800
 to stop drawing. That's it. So I think, I think the other side of it too is with the age comes

669
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:30,280
 the awareness of, Hey, I am really doing really well right now. I've had 50 years of this shit.

670
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:35,080
 I remember when things go to hell. This is not one of those times things are going pretty good.

671
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:39,960
 Yeah. Yeah. Um, it does. So a certain perspective for sure. And I, and perspective is,

672
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:45,720
 is the big word there. So long as you have, have the perspective on it all. Uh, I don't think you're

673
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:54,120
 going to lose it. Uh, again, time, physicality, mental things, uh, your eyes, hemorrhaging,

674
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:58,760
 those are stuff outside of your control. That's the only way I can see, uh, something coming up

675
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:05,320
 to where you're like, where you become the person that shouldn't be there anymore. That's my thought.

676
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:17,800
 What did you think, man? Um, just the same. Uh, I, I know I actually, I actually know I peeked. Uh,

677
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:23,240
 I'm not as good of an improviser as I used to be. Um, what are you talking about? No, no, no, no,

678
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:28,120
 no way. I'm going to speak here. Yeah. Okay. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, you know, this isn't like a,

679
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:32,680
 what was me thing. I think I've gotten very like, uh, someone told me once, and this might be

680
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:37,720
 totally wrong, but Krav Maga was supposedly this like martial arts form where you boil down every

681
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:42,600
 other martial arts form to it's like simple, most lethal moves where you just do the most direct,

682
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:48,120
 different things. And I think as I've gotten older, I simply have developed a Krav Maga style of

683
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:54,840
 improv where like I'm still intellectually. Those are the Gracies, right? Um, what's that?

684
01:05:54,840 --> 01:06:00,280
 No, no, that's Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Krav Maga is, uh, Israeli, I believe it was developed for the

685
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:04,600
 Israeli military. Yeah. My bad. Like I used to play a lot more different characters,

686
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:09,960
 do a lot more different voices, do a lot more different things than I'm, I'm very much now

687
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:15,640
 just kind of a very much different versions of myself and almost all of my scenes. I just

688
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:21,080
 have lost that ability. Like I talked about this, like I used to, you know, for my freaking movement

689
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:28,040
 final in my, in my BFA acting class, I walked around, uh, like a polar bear for, for an hour

690
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:33,800
 and a half. Right. And like behaved. And that was like a fight. And like, there's no way I could do

691
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:39,640
 that now. You know, like there's no imagine if somebody asks you to, and there are artists,

692
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:42,840
 right? There are clowns and stuff that we know that can simply just commit to energy and do that

693
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:47,240
 kind of stuff. Absolutely. Yeah. I used to, you know, be able to make up songs so well that I

694
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:52,200
 would go to coffee houses and just have a, a, a grab a, grab a guitar player or a keyboard player

695
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:57,160
 and just sit in and do three funny songs for the audience and kill and just like go around.

696
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:01,640
 I did it like I spontaneously took over like a, uh, like a coffee house one time when you put on

697
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:08,520
 like an improvised concert, like, like I used to like destroy with song stuff. And Paul has held

698
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:14,520
 onto his song construction abilities for improv so much better than I have. I can go for like one or

699
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:20,280
 two versus a best. It's the weed, Matt. It's the, yeah, I, I, I did a lot. I did a lot. I did a lot.

700
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:26,120
 I did my fair share of smoking. I did my fair share of drinking. Uh, I also then. Oh, I thought

701
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:30,360
 Paul was saying he was high all the time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm stoned when I'm coming up. No,

702
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:37,320
 no, no. No, I swore off long. I swore off short form as a long form zealot for over a decade.

703
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:42,120
 Right. Uh, thank practice those skills. Right. And it was only moving to Vegas that I was like,

704
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:46,920
 oh, I actually was skilled at this. It wasn't, it wasn't easy and fun for everybody. It was

705
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:52,600
 something I was good at, you know? And so, uh, I stopped rapping. So that was offensive for,

706
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:58,520
 for, for college white dudes to rap. Um, and so I stopped rapping. Uh, you may not have been

707
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:05,640
 completely wrong about that part. Right. And so, uh, those skills deteriorated. And so,

708
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:13,640
 but I still understand improv. I think at a high level, right? Yes. I think, I think I still see

709
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:20,280
 the performance piece for what it is better. You used to get, you used to get a little prickly

710
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:25,640
 about this and I wonder if you still do. Uh, people would comment every now and then that you were

711
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:30,040
 a really, this years ago, people would comment every now and then that you were a really good

712
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:36,680
 improv show runner from on stage. Yes. You used to get a little prickly about that. Do you still or,

713
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:41,720
 or no? It's, it's, it's, it's a hard thing, right? Because like, basically like, am I actually doing

714
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:46,040
 what I'm supposed to be doing, which is ego-less improv, right? Like that's actually, it's kind of

715
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:49,240
 like, uh, uh, when you get into long form, there's kind of like a Zen approach where you're just

716
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:53,560
 trying to make the pieces happen and unfold and you're really not supposed to be that egotistical

717
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:56,920
 about it. And so yes, I'd have people be like, you know, I didn't, I thought you were just okay. And

718
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:01,320
 then I saw you multiple shows and realized how much you were doing that kind of stuff, that kind of

719
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:06,360
 copy would come up all the time. But, uh, and Paul, but what Paul was referencing earlier is that I,

720
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:10,840
 I see the pieces, right? So I go like, Oh, this is starting off great, but it's running in this

721
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:14,920
 direction. And if we don't counter and do a different kind of scene over here and do something

722
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:18,680
 differently over here, this piece is going to implode in 15 minutes. You're, you're always

723
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:24,440
 thinking big picture on stage. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. This is why we work well together. Yeah. Because

724
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:30,200
 I get lost in the sauce. Right. That's what I tell people working with you, Paul is I go, Paul,

725
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:35,480
 if I wanted to make a scene, simply take a half hour and two pieces, I would just come out and

726
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:39,960
 start a scene with Paul and Paul would play that character unflinchingly for a half hour. He

727
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:44,040
 wouldn't give me a smoke. He wouldn't give me a wink. He would not look up. And other performers

728
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:47,160
 I perform with would, would kind of give me a look at, are we really doing this kind of thing?

729
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:53,480
 Paul does not Paul Paul buckles in and goes. And so, yes, I think my biggest compliment to Paul is

730
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:58,520
 that I can create, make sure we create different worlds, make sure we're not imploding, make sure

731
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:04,040
 we're peppering different people into different universes and making sure that while I have

732
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:11,880
 elements of those thoughts, yeah, you're thinking in a very, uh, very elegant structural way about

733
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:20,680
 what does the show need? Yes. Then when you make an initiation that, um, that will facilitate that,

734
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:32,040
 I have the, the luck and the, uh, the, um, that gives me the opportunity to then shovel in something

735
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:40,440
 that also wedges with that. Yeah. You know, but like on my own, I wouldn't necessarily make as

736
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:45,480
 good a choice. That's what I always tell my students. There are no wrong choices in improvisation.

737
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:52,280
 There are better choices. Right. And what Matt helps me do is he sets me up with better choices.

738
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:59,320
 He aims me towards the better choices. And that's why Paul encourages his students to go to Matt and

739
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:05,640
 ask to be his apprentice. Cause on my own, I will be a crazed goofball. And while it may be entertaining,

740
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:11,080
 it won't necessarily hold together the way it does when we work together. Yeah. I mean, Paul and I

741
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:14,200
 taught workshops together and Paul will teach these crazy character workshops where it teaches

742
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:18,360
 people just to buckle in, make choices, double down, go harder, you know, take it to a, take

743
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:23,560
 it to a 10, you know, that kind of stuff, be unflinching. Um, and I will teach pattern play

744
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:28,280
 and rule threes and all kinds of stuff, just to that, that all those things that kind of pepper

745
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:32,360
 a thing. So like an example for everyone listening is we're getting so in the weeds on this.

746
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:39,000
 It sounds like good cop, bad cop. No, no, no. It's not completely

747
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,920
 disrelated from that. We have totally different education. Paul and I have a totally different

748
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:48,600
 improv background. Our teachers and our schools of thinking are completely different from one another.

749
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:55,000
 Um, and, uh, like if you watch a show and there's multiple people, there's a thing called a tag out

750
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,600
 where someone from the back line will come in, touch the form on the shoulder and the person

751
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:03,240
 staying on stage remains the same character. And that person becomes another person in that person's

752
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:07,000
 universe. And you can change locations wherever you are. You just go to another spot and that

753
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,560
 person and that character's life. And the biggest thing I do is an example of what Paul's talking

754
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:17,240
 about. As I say, that is a challenge to everyone else on the back line. Can we make this a rule of

755
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:22,760
 threes? Whatever this person does with that character, can you all follow that lead and make

756
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:31,320
 it two and three? And then when you do that, you look brilliant to an audience that you, that you

757
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:35,240
 all can play that way, you know, and stuff like that. And so that's an example of like, that's

758
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:40,920
 just a technique thing and creating triggers in people's brains that make their forms better.

759
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:46,200
 But all right, let's change the subject. I think you're going to have to charge a

760
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:52,520
 tuition. This is like a workshop. Well, but, but, but that's more like a camp to Celestia's point,

761
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:59,560
 Matt, given that, that whole, uh, talk there. Yeah. What do you think keeps you and what do you

762
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:05,240
 think will keep Celestia from falling into the obsolescence category? I remember going out to

763
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:09,880
 Improv Olympic when I was, uh, you know, 20 something years old. I think, I think maybe

764
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:14,600
 just even 20. Um, you know, my whole improv group, we went out to Chicago and just stayed on the

765
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:20,040
 couches of Mission Improvable, uh, for a week. And we took workshops every day. Chicago went to shows

766
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:25,400
 every night at Improv Olympic. And that was when I realized I really liked long form more than short

767
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:33,400
 form is because I saw, um, older guys killing it on stage, like doing really great, funny scenes.

768
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:39,400
 And I was like, Oh, good. Because I'm becoming that that's it. I was like, that gives me hope,

769
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:43,000
 right? Cause I felt like when I watched, and this might be wrong and I'm sorry for any listeners who

770
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,240
 this fits, but like, I felt like when I saw older people doing short form, it looked kind of cheese

771
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:51,320
 ball to me when I was young, right? I don't know if that would look to me that way now, but it did

772
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:55,400
 look that way then. And so I was so excited that you could still be characters. You could still do

773
01:13:55,400 --> 01:14:03,000
 whatever. And it was, and it was, uh, it was still like, okay. So that was pretty cool. And so, uh,

774
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,360
 I think as long as you are, when you're doing something more theatrical, I think you have so

775
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:16,200
 much more freedom to age. I'm more, yeah. And I am more, uh, worried about it for my magic career

776
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:21,560
 specifically, uh, because once you become an old guy, magician, it totally changes the lanes you

777
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:26,760
 have to pursue gigs. Like it is just a different world when you're an old guy. There've been so

778
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:32,920
 many amazing old guy magicians though. I mean, but it takes some like curating, right? Like people

779
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:36,120
 have to kind of like you in the community. They have to kind of put you on a pedestal. You have

780
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:40,760
 to kind of be people's first recommendation. Well, maybe if you get in good with, uh, some, uh,

781
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:45,640
 classic magicians, maybe you can find some, some guys who have made it, made their bones

782
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:48,680
 and become friends with them. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe you could, maybe you could

783
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:55,720
 actually deeply befriend one of the greatest magicians to ever live in the history of the

784
01:14:55,720 --> 01:15:01,480
 planet that might set you up for success. I'm not guaranteeing it. I'm not. I think I've had

785
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:06,120
 Hondros Insta. All right. Well, let's go. Let's talk. Okay. So let's get Hondo on, on the foreign and see

786
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:10,600
 if we can get you in the pocket with him. Good. Cause that might, uh, make things a little bit

787
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:16,360
 smoother. Like my, my, my, my joke is that my, my magic career has been that of a foreign star.

788
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:24,600
 I've gone from babysitter to milf like instantly. And uh, and, and it's, and it's, and it's, and it's,

789
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:29,400
 and it's difficult, you know, uh, uh, like the geek that haven't, it is difficult to go to milf.

790
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:34,680
 That's true. If I were probably don't never go ask the milf. If I was, if I was fine,

791
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:38,200
 if I was five or maybe 10 years older than I am right now, I would not be on the gig. I'm doing

792
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:43,080
 right now. I'm telling you that right now I would not be hired for what I'm doing. You, you, you,

793
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:46,280
 you would not be on the gig because they wouldn't hire you. Not because you wouldn't do it is what

794
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:52,440
 you said. Correct. But Matt, now that you are and you're gaining the experience of it and you're

795
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:58,520
 getting into that system, somewhat, do you feel with some degree of confidence in 10 years,

796
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:05,320
 should things be where they are, you could then book that gig because of the experience you're

797
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:08,760
 getting now. I said like a really good example of someone's doing something that I would probably

798
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:15,000
 love doing is this guy named Sean Farquhar out of Vancouver. Uh, Sean was the first, one of the,

799
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:20,760
 uh, the, uh, one of the first people to fool Penn and Teller on, um, fool us. Uh, he would forever

800
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:26,600
 was a cruise ship war horse and just in private gig guy and just did everything all over the world.

801
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,880
 He's won all these awards for being master magician and that kind of stuff like that is it.

802
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:36,440
 He's one of one of the most respected magicians out there. He's very funny, very funny. Um, and

803
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:42,360
 he now runs his own magic theater in Vancouver that has like 40 seats. It's in like a speakeasy.

804
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:46,200
 You have to like find it in this like old antique shop. That's where I've heard that name before.

805
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:51,560
 Yeah. Yeah. His speakeasy there is a big deal. Yeah. And so he, he got off the road and now he

806
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:55,320
 runs the shows every Friday and Saturday and he just, and he sells out, he adds another show

807
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:59,160
 and he does, so he does like sometimes two, sometimes four, sometimes six shows a weekend.

808
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:05,240
 And, uh, and the math just makes sense for what people pay to go see him do his thing,

809
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:11,640
 but he has enough of a reputation as a, as like, as like a fantastic magician to do that. And so

810
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:16,600
 that is definitely like a trajectory and he's older, uh, not, not that much older,

811
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:22,120
 but he's a little older. And, and, and so like that to me is an example of like a trajectory.

812
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:29,480
 I could try to follow or ape or whatever. Yeah. Cool. Uh, the chat is going crazy right now.

813
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:35,880
 They're just doing different, uh, MILF, uh, things and making magician the, um, and there's just all

814
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:41,480
 kinds of different things coming up in the chat right now. It's, it's really fun. My favorite so

815
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:51,160
 far is from Rich Milb magician. I'd like to book that old Milb, chaotic clumsy magician. I'd like

816
01:17:51,160 --> 01:18:00,520
 to feed reasonable plan. Cause I, I, I don't know if you've heard, but, uh, speakeasies might become

817
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:05,880
 a thing in Vegas, Matt. Well, that's a, you want to talk about side effects of changing times.

818
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:10,760
 Yeah. I mean, uh, the entertainment industry as we know it, the mainstream entertainment

819
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:16,440
 industries, we know it is dying. Uh, and so that is, that is a, uh, that, but here's the thing.

820
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:20,760
 That's exactly like, that's the only way I could work in Vegas right now. Like my dream is to work

821
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:25,880
 at Vegas and be home with my children more, maybe even like coach a soccer or basketball team or

822
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:32,360
 something like that. Uh, and I, and I can't, right. And I'll never gain the notoriety it takes to

823
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:36,920
 launch a show on the strip. And that because launching a show on the strip means millions of

824
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:42,120
 dollars, no matter what. So even if someone would give me a million dollars a day, I couldn't in

825
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:46,840
 good faith be like, yeah, we can figure it out, you know? Um, but if there is a venue, like a

826
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:50,440
 speakeasy that hires multiple entertainers and the reputation for the speakeasy is like, you got to

827
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:54,520
 come here and have an awesome time. And I just happen to be someone who's part of that awesome

828
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:58,440
 time. Like that's the way I could work in Vegas. And if that happened tomorrow, I would do it

829
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:04,120
 tomorrow. Yeah. Well, I think there's hope for that. And I think, uh, Celestia too, uh, you've

830
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:09,880
 probably been on the end of this too. I know for myself, I've had to invent and create spaces to

831
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:15,720
 perform throughout my life. It's just, you know, from, from the, the shows I'm running over at, uh,

832
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:21,720
 pod duty, just because I went into that space was like, this is a, this is a place to do improv.

833
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:26,200
 Like this is going to work and it's working, you know, free, free classes and whatnot, but it's

834
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:30,680
 still, it's, it's working really well in that little thing. And like, I, I, I started a coffee

835
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:40,040
 house so I could do improv, uh, you know, and, uh, that I think that's the hard part about getting

836
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:44,040
 older. When we were younger, we would create all of our performance situations because we could create

837
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:48,520
 a social scene around them. And that's the way it goes away. When you get older is that you can't

838
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:55,880
 create a place because everybody's busy. Yes. And yeah. And tired. Yeah. Well, this is the net.

839
01:19:55,880 --> 01:20:01,400
 This is my busy and tired. This is my big dream too is future name of Matt and Mattingly busy

840
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:05,960
 and tired somehow. And I think like you're talking about like, you know, with incorporating stuff,

841
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:14,760
 but like, I want like a coffee house, tea house, comic book shop, small theater kind of environment,

842
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:19,560
 but it's all about just trying to, trying to grow community, but it just takes a long time

843
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:26,520
 to grow community. It just really takes a long time. And I, I, I see myself at the bottom of

844
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:31,240
 the bottom rung of that ladder again with what I am entering into right now.

845
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:37,480
 And I see, I see that fucking ladder and I'm like, God damn it. Don't want to climb this

846
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:45,800
 shit again. And I do, I do, and I'm going to do it. And, uh, and I think

847
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:54,200
 magically some other magical shit will happen. That's always, that's always the hardest part

848
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:59,640
 about improv is you can't take your resume with you. You always have to start.

849
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:04,440
 Yes. It's all starting fresh. That makes sense. Yeah. It's all starting fresh.

850
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:09,720
 You got to prove it. Cause even like still city improv is rolling out the red carpet for you.

851
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:15,160
 Right. Right. Yes. Even still like their audience doesn't know who you are yet. Right. So you still

852
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:21,400
 have to like get that going. Absolutely. It's all new, baby. It's all new. Now it's moving in the

853
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:26,360
 right direction. I've got my class sold out. I've got a waiting list now. Awesome. But the first,

854
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:31,640
 but the first class didn't sell enough timing wise. So it ain't like, you know, but it's coming.

855
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:36,520
 It's coming. It's not, it's not instant. It's not. But yeah, we're building a building, a building.

856
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:40,760
 Straight up. I'm just, I'm just excited for the artists in Pittsburgh. Like it's crazy,

857
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:45,160
 like the embarrassment of riches you got with Paul. And so the fact that like people are finally

858
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:49,000
 catching on makes me so happy because we're going to get there. We're going to get there. We're

859
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:53,480
 going to make some magic happen with all this shit and with my love of comic books. And I was

860
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:59,800
 going to say, but what I, oh, that the point I wanted to make was that it is in no small part

861
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:07,720
 because of this podcast and the wonderful community that I can continue to do this stuff

862
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:12,760
 with the degree of enthusiasm that I do coming off of scoop fast and coming here to just

863
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:16,360
 start stuff again and to really lock down and teach a free class on this kind of stuff.

864
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:23,320
 I am enthused because of what we can create and what this community means to me and how I want to

865
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:29,960
 show up for them in the future by continuing to build stuff here too. So just, I can't thank

866
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:35,480
 scoops enough for what they provide for me every day. It's a, yeah, can't do it without you guys.

867
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:41,320
 Yep. I'll tell you what else you can't do. You can't win Jack versus third, but we're going to

868
01:22:41,320 --> 01:23:11,080
 try anyway. Fuck you. Let me get the budget. Hey, I'll tell you what in a basement.

869
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:17,240
 So Celestia, will you be our go-to lifeline? Sure. I'll hang out and be a lifeline. Yeah.

870
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:21,240
 Fantastic. Thank you. And Celestia toss out all that information for the,

871
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:25,720
 for the skeptic camp one more time. It will be Saturday, October 25th,

872

 rum raisinberg. Hey you face fuckers. Here's a scooperty all about the fun stuff to do

876
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:58,600
 in Las Vegas this weekend instead of attending scoop fest. I kid. Uh, it now occurs to me that

877
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:02,600
 this scooperty is being sent very close to the start of scoop fest and it probably won't happen

878
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:08,040
 before the event takes place. Oh, well, fucking with the face rum raisinberg. You are correct in

879
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:15,240
 all of those things. The categories are shows, sports, food and activities. I'm up first. I'll

880
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:23,320
 just go top left. Shows for 200. You could see this multi-species magic act at the Flamingo Hotel

881
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:36,040
 and Casino. Ex Burlesque. Ever since, ever since ex Burlesque added that chimera, it's shot tickets.

882
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:45,960
 I believe it is piff the magic dragon. Yes, of course. Oh, see now I was going to go with,

883
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:57,000
 uh, what's, what's the, uh, Popovich Gregory Popovich. Yeah, instead of going piff the magic

884
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:01,640
 dragon, you were going to go Greg Popovich. Look, he's the only one that I know of that has the

885
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:10,120
 multiple species and more. He's at planet Hollywood. More live pussy on stage than expert less.

886
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:20,680
 But how much dead should be? His catchphrase by the way. It's his cat's face. It's his cat's phrase.

887
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:30,360
 Ozzy Robb says RuPaul's dog race. I'd watch that show too. We missed you, uh, at the scoop

888
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:35,400
 fest Ozzy Robb. Good to hear from you, pal. Absolutely. A year from late April, early May,

889
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:44,600
 20, 27. Yeah. That's when we're doing the next scoop fest. Yes. Um, sports please for 200.

890
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:50,280
 You can see the Las Vegas Raiders play host to this salmon eating,

891
01:25:50,280 --> 01:26:02,360
 shitting in the woods, NFC North team. Wouldn't it be great if every professional, uh, sports team

892
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:12,520
 had to live their life like the mascots. I didn't know, uh, I didn't know a paleo CrossFit gym had

893
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:26,120
 a football team. That would be the Vikings. The Vikings is incorrect. It's the bears.

894
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:34,040
 Well, there's a Viking shit in the woods. I mean, I think so. I think all those things also apply

895
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:44,120
 to vice. We just, we just had fat bear week. Did you guys see that fat bear week? I did see that.

896
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:48,760
 Yeah. Because bears are getting fat for the winter. You get to vote on them. They've already crowned

897
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:56,200
 the winner. The fattest shit that these, I just, I did see that a lot of, uh, a lot of uptick in

898
01:26:56,200 --> 01:27:01,800
 bears going for people's trash cans to get, uh, you know, loaded up for loaded for bear. Uh, they

899
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:07,240
 were all just getting ready for hibernation. And so like there were a lot more bears in residential

900
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:14,040
 areas just this last week. Yes. This has been your bear report from ice cream social. Just the bear

901
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:23,400
 facts. I will try activities for 600. Oh yeah. Here we go. You could attend the zombie rumble

902
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:32,280
 at area 51 highlighted by live music and a blank show. I wonder if I bet this was supposed to be

903
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:39,000
 area 15. Maybe, maybe not. I think maybe the numbers are transposed. I don't know. Uh, I

904
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:45,240
 will say, I will guess burlesque. Oh, and the burlesque show. Oh no, I'm sorry, Paul. It's a

905
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:51,480
 classic car show. I mean, that's close, right? The burlesque of the auto world. Get to see what's

906
01:27:51,480 --> 01:28:01,880
 under the hood. Yeah. Tassels on it. I'll stick with shows for 400. This here's the concert,

907
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:10,280
 a tribute to blank at the Orleans hotel and casino. This is terrible. I was texting with

908
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:17,160
 someone about this show two days ago. Do you have a clue? I live by the south point or no,

909
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:22,600
 actually no Orleans. I'm confusing myself point with my Orleans here. Yeah. I mixed up a biking

910
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:29,560
 and a bear, so don't feel bad. I, is it John Williams? I don't know. A tribute to John

911
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:36,120
 Williams. It's not a tribute to John Williams. Uh, shit, I got to pass Matt. I don't know.

912
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:43,960
 Is it the band? Is it the concert attribute to the band? Oh, the band, the band. I haven't

913
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:52,920
 been to the Orleans in years. Officially there last week. Oh, well, I still don't know. I will,

914
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:57,240
 I will have to pass. Wait, I know for a fact that we walked past advertisements for it.

915
01:28:57,240 --> 01:29:03,800
 I have an answer. The Viking. Oh, go ahead. The Viking. Here we go. Let's try the Vikings.

916
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:11,880
 Oh, it's Abba. Abba. Now I remember Ozzy Robb coming through with it. The worst part about that

917
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:17,800
 is I had a long conversation with one of the owners of the show downstairs during a scoop

918
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:22,200
 fest. Oh shit. And you forgot that. We ran at each other in front of the, in front of the theater.

919
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:26,360
 I invited them to come up to scoop fest. I don't think they did. Oh, that's too bad. I was like,

920
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:31,240
 oh yeah, bring the cast, but preferably stay in the ABBA costumes. Come on up. Yeah. Yeah.

921
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:37,320
 My mind is fucked. Matt, you're up. Uh, sports 400 please.

922
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:45,560
 You can catch the Destructathon, which features battles between blank combatants from around the

923
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:55,400
 globe. Is it robots? Between robot combatants from around the globe. I mean, that would work.

924
01:29:55,400 --> 01:30:01,560
 I think that's right. What's robots? All right. Let's try robots. Battle bots, fighting robots.

925
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:08,680
 That is like my favorite show in Las Vegas. I I've seen it three times. I still haven't seen

926
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:12,600
 battle bots live, but I really want to. It's amazing. It's the only show in Vegas where they

927
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:19,160
 have like a disclaimer on the, the, the marketing that says normally shows run, you know, 90 minutes,

928
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:22,680
 but occasionally the robots catch fire and that could cause a delay.

929
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:32,680
 It happens. I'll try activities for 800. Get some points back on the board. Daily double.

930
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:39,800
 Perfect. I'm dead. You could dance the night away at this nightclub,

931
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:48,600
 which won best nightclub and Las Vegas is weekly, uh, 2025 best of Las Vegas. Oh God. Uh,

932
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:54,840
 is it, is it Drays? Jacob's whiskey pit.

933
01:30:54,840 --> 01:31:00,360
 Is it Drays? Yeah, Jacob's whiskey pit. The real winner. Nice one, Jordan. We know what the real

934
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:06,440
 winner was. There's Drays. There's, uh, do you have any ideas Celestia? What, what other nightclubs

935
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:11,480
 you're out there? It's not Drays. They just closed. Okay. Well that saves me. I'm thinking

936
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:19,880
 Tao or Omni. Oh, Oh, right. Ooh. Omni. I think, I think it's Tao. I think Tao is coming back

937
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:27,320
 with a vengeance. I'll go with Tao. Okay. I'll try Tao. It's Zook. Those are like the driverless

938
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:33,720
 taxi cabs. Uh, yeah, it was kind of like that. What the hell is Zook? I think that's the club

939
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:40,360
 at resorts world. Oh, for fuck's sake. Oh, and doesn't Josh Gad run that? It's called Gad Zooks.

940
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:48,920
 That makes sense. That makes sense. That's probably it. Zooks. McMullin's. Yeah. I'll go

941
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:56,680
 back to shows for 600. You could go see Magic Mike live at this Las Vegas casino.

942
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:02,840
 Well, it used to be at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, which is now the Virgin. It is currently

943
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:09,800
 at the Sahara. Used to be SLS and now Sahara. Yeah. It was, it was Sahara. Then it was SLS.

944
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:16,040
 Now it's Sahara again. I don't know why. Matt, you're up. Uh, show is 800.

945
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:24,840
 You can see this Grammy award nominated artist known for doing backflips at T-Mobile Arena.

946
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:34,920
 Who's known for doing backflips? You saw the show, Matt. I think. At T-Mobile?

947
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:42,040
 I don't, I think this might've been a, oh, like a one night only concert type thing.

948
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:48,920
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, really? I don't think this was a repeating show. Is it? Oh, Celestia knows.

949
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:55,240
 Oh, I'll go to Celestia. Is that Benson kid? Somebody Benson. He's like, don't you beautiful,

950
01:32:55,240 --> 01:33:00,840
 beautiful thing. Okay. I'm terrible at singing it, but you'll know the song when you hear it.

951
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:08,760
 And he is Robbie Benson. Robbie, no, Benson. His his last name is Benson.

952
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:15,480
 And that's all you need for Jeopardy. Who is Benson? I thought it was just Benson.

953
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:24,040
 Can we just say Benson? Benson Honeydew from the Muppets. Try it. Is Benson enough as the Arbiter?

954
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:31,720
 Me, me, me. Benson Booth. Oh, shoot. It was his first name, not his last name. Oh, shoot. That's

955
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:37,720
 all right. Benson Booth. Paul. Paul, be the Arbiter. Yes or no? Yes, because we got Benson.

956
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:43,000
 All right. Got Benson. Also, we would have also accepted Renée Aubergean-Wall.

957
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:48,040
 Who was on Benson? Yes. That's precisely why we would have accepted it.

958
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:52,920
 Paul, you're up. I will go. Matt, great job on that question, buddy.

959
01:33:53,560 --> 01:34:00,840
 I'll go food for 800. Let's get some points back on the board. According to BoydGaming.com,

960
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:07,080
 these are the two open 24 hour dining options available to ScoopFest attendees at the Orleans

961
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:16,680
 Hotel and Casino. What are the two 24 hour options at the old Orleans? I'll tell you,

962
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:22,040
 it ain't fucking Ballywick. I'll tell you that much right now. Right. Ballywick is open for roughly

963
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:29,560
 42 minutes a day. Mike and Laurie's suite. That's it. That's it. That's pretty much the only option.

964
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:34,200
 Fuck, man. I had to pass. I've never been to the Alsroth suite.

965
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:39,880
 Nor have I. Isn't that funny? It's just Jacob. That makes sense that it's just Jacob.

966
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:43,480
 It's just Jacob. And I don't hang out. I just go in and have a drink.

967
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:52,680
 I mean, I think the diner that I ate at in New Orleans. Chaotic Road ice cream and Dale Jizz.

968
01:34:52,680 --> 01:35:02,920
 One of those things does last. Jizz, mate. Jizz, mate. Jizz, mate.

969
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:11,880
 I think the diner is open 24 hours, but I don't know what the diner is called.

970
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:14,760
 I'll accept diner if you can get the other one.

971
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:25,160
 Oh, OK. Then I think TGI Fridays. 24/7 TGI Fridays? I kind of think it is. I'll say the diner and TGI

972
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:36,040
 Fridays. Nope. Sbarro and Fuddruckers. Holy shit. I ate a piece of Sbarro pizza while I was there.

973
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:40,280
 That could have been sitting there for 24 hours. It could have been.

974
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:47,960
 Those are the two funniest names for any food establishments. It is true. Fuddruckers is hard

975
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:52,600
 to beat. Yeah. Yeah. Is Fuddruckers the one where they make fun of you? No. Which one is the one

976
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:56,840
 where they make fun of you? Dick's. That's Dick's last resort. Oh, that's right. Yeah.

977
01:35:56,840 --> 01:36:00,440
 Jacob, also, that Friday's is closed. It was not even there during Scoot Fest.

978
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:06,360
 Was it gone? Oh, yeah. I mean, there was a facade still there, right? But man, is it closed 24/7?

979
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:11,480
 That's that's what could have confused me. It is indeed closed 24/7.

980
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:17,240
 It's not open 24/7. Oh, it's closed 24/7. OK. Now I see Rob says both of those phrases are

981
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:25,000
 Mormon swear words. Right. Oh, Fuddruckers. Well, Sbarro. Score check. Matt is winning with a

982
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:30,120
 thousand points. I'm in second with zero points. Paul's in third with negative 14 points. We got

983
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:37,320
 one daily double left on the board. Let's see. I'll try food for. No, fuck it. I'm going sports

984
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:45,000
 for 800. You can see all of the high flying action of this small independent wrestling federation

985
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:52,520
 at the nerd bar. Oh, shit. I know this one because I've been trying to get people to go with me to

986
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:57,400
 see this for weeks on the on the rare occasions that I'm actually available to go to it. It is

987
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:07,880
 called Micromania. Micromania midget wrestling, their words, not mine. Wow. OK.

988
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:15,480
 Matt, you're up. I'll do food for 200. You guys remember Micro Machines? Now I'm just thinking

989
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:18,840
 about my. Oh, yeah. I love my Micro Machines. It's like I could talk really really fast.

990
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:22,520
 Well, you can combine the wrestling with the battle bots. You've got micro bots.

991
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:29,400
 Oh. Take it. It's just it's Chick-fil-A. We can just move on. You get a chicken sandwich

992
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:36,440
 from this chain in Caesar's Palace Forum Food Hall. Not just are just not on Sunday.

993
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:44,840
 You what? Just click and say it doesn't open on Sunday. Yeah. The part of that that's confusing

994
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:49,240
 to me is I don't know where Chick-fil-A is in the Caesar's Palace Forum Food Hall. Neither do I. I

995
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:56,280
 just said not on Sunday and no Chick-fil-A. That's it. Church on Sunday. Fuck you. I work in Caesar's

996
01:37:56,280 --> 01:38:02,120
 Palace. I didn't know there was a Chick-fil-A. Paul, you're up. I will take food for 600,

997
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:06,040
 please. By the way, I'm fine with that. I don't need Chick-fil-A. Let's get some points on the

998
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:14,440
 board. Here we go. You could stuff your face at this buffet, which won the best buffet on

999
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:25,640
 Las Vegas's weekly Las Vegas Weekly's 2025 Best of Las Vegas. The Caesars World Buffet? What's it

1000
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:36,920
 called? Oh, it's Becca Buncher. Becca Buncher, meet yourself. The Forum Buffet? The Forum? No.

1001
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:41,720
 What's it called? You want me to tag in? That is the entire question. I can tell you. I can tell you.

1002
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:46,840
 Oh, yes, please. Celestia, help him. It is the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars. That's it. And it's

1003
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:52,600
 either that one or the Wicked Spoon at Cosmo. But it's always a battle between those two.

1004
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:58,600
 Oh, Celestia throwing shade at the Wynn Buffet. Which do you think was the winner this last time,

1005
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:05,720
 Celestia? Well, I think it's going to be Caesars. Right. Telling Bellagio's buffet to fuck right

1006
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:11,800
 off, Celestia Ward. I know, my fucking buffets. Have you met me? I love the Bacchanal. Yeah,

1007
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:15,720
 the Bacchanal is fucking good. The Bacchanal is amazing. The Bellagio Buffet is endless water

1008
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:21,320
 from their fountains. That's right. Oh, God. And they've got the chocolate fountain there too,

1009
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:25,800
 but you're not allowed to touch it. Did you see they put a boat in the fountain this morning?

1010
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:34,040
 There's now a boat. That looks so weird. It's so stupid. It makes the fountains look less impressive

1011
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:41,080
 to stick this big fairy. Do you realize that it's not that big? Yes. Do they put people on it? Is

1012
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:45,480
 that what it is? I guess. I don't know what they're doing with it. They literally just put it in the

1013
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:49,880
 water this morning. Is it sort of F1 stunt? Is it just for F1 or are we going to have to live with

1014
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:56,120
 that all the time? I think it's there as part of the new Carbone restaurant that just opened there.

1015
01:39:56,120 --> 01:40:02,680
 I think it's a stunt from them. Really? I think it's there going forward. I bet they will have

1016
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:07,560
 people you can pay to go out into the middle of the fountain. They had some captain on the front

1017
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:13,400
 of the boat like he was steering this ship. He looked embarrassed. It's a living. Is there

1018
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:20,120
 law of the sea? Yeah. International waters. International waters, baby. Law of the sea.

1019
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:28,200
 International gray water. Also gross. If you're in that fucking place getting squirted on

1020
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:33,400
 by old laundry detergent, right? That is true. Yeah. No thanks. I don't know if I want to get

1021
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:38,040
 on that boat. What's it called? You talked me out of it. The maiden of the mist. This would be the

1022
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:50,200
 maiden of the pissed. Oh, they are not going to be happy with us. Paul, which buffet won Las Vegas?

1023
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:54,680
 We went with the Bacchanal. Bacchanal is your answer. Okay. Let's see. I'm sorry. It is the

1024
01:40:54,680 --> 01:41:00,360
 Wynn Buffet. Get the fuck out of here. The Wynn Buffet. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Jacob tried to help

1025
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:03,960
 you. That's all right. Jacob tried to help you. All I've heard about the Wynn Buffet is that it's

1026
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:09,960
 overpriced. It's good though. Yes, I do. That's why I tried to help you. Well, thank you. Thank

1027
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:16,040
 you for trying. Chris Angel invented the buffet. That's right. I staffed it with all homeless

1028
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:19,880
 people. They had nothing. When I met them, they had nothing. They didn't even know how to cook.

1029
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:24,600
 I taught them how to cook. I taught them how to be there. Now, thank God. Who here

1030
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:28,520
 likes food? Let's hear it for food. Everybody stand up. Let's hear it for food. Everybody stand

1031
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:35,160
 up. Thank you. That's my show. Thank you. Let's hear it again for me. I'm not going to sit back down

1032
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:40,200
 before I leave. I guess I'll just stay standing. That's right. Stay standing. I have a Chris Angel

1033
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:45,880
 little person dwarf story that I forgot to tell. Wait a minute. I'll have to tell it to you next

1034
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:55,560
 time. Okay. That's a teaser. I'm going sports for $600. You can watch the Las Vegas Aces compete

1035
01:41:55,560 --> 01:42:00,600
 against this team in the semifinals of the 2025 WNBA Playoffs. You would have to watch it on TV

1036
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:08,840
 as the game is in a different city. I think that's the Mystics. I think they were playing the Mystics.

1037
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:15,800
 I'll go Mystics. Now it's the Fever. Indiana Fever. You give me fever, Indiana. I think they're playing the Mystics in the

1038
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:25,720
 next round. Fever in the corn at night. Fever. Indiana. Food 400. What an awful place to live.

1039
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:32,040
 You get to eat at this iconic 24-hour American restaurant known for its large portions and neon

1040
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:40,840
 retro interior found in 1972 on the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip. Oh shoot. You know this one.

1041
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:49,240
 Yeah, it's a wonderful place. Go ahead, Celestia. Help me out. It is the Pepper Mill. Oh, right.

1042
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:52,840
 I was thinking about the other place that had the tractor and the thing and the--

1043
01:42:52,840 --> 01:43:01,320
 Oh, the-- Old Red? Hash House of Go-Go? Hash House of Go-Go. Hasn't even been around since '72.

1044
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:05,000
 Yeah, the Hash House of Go-Go. I know. That's why I was hesitating and asked for Celestia's help, Paul.

1045
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:15,480
 Good move. Paul, you got activities for 200 or 400. You are, let's see, 3600 points behind Matt,

1046
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:19,960
 1800 points behind me. Let's take 400. Get some points on the board. There you go. Get

1047
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:26,440
 some points on the board, baby. You can catch Tomorrowland's event Unity at this iconic Las

1048
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:41,160
 Vegas venue. Oh. Oh. Unity. Hmm. It's got to be Sphere. Maybe. Let's try it. It's the Sphere.

1049
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:49,000
 Oh, so they're-- That's interesting. So Disney is using some of their ride stuff in this-- Like,

1050
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:53,080
 did you guys ever go on Spaceship Earth-- Not Spaceship Earth. What was the alien encounter?

1051
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:56,760
 What was the one-- You remember that Disney ride where you sat on-- It was like you were in a

1052
01:43:56,760 --> 01:44:01,400
 rocket ship and you went up into space? Do you remember that? It was a giant theater that turned

1053
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:04,920
 into a rocket ship, basically. Oh, I don't remember. I don't remember. Captain EO?

1054
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:10,120
 Fucking no. It's not Captain EO. Chat, anybody know what I'm talking about?

1055
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:17,160
 Not Small World. No, you got in the-- Mission Earth, maybe? Yeah, I guess it was at Epcot.

1056
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:20,200
 It's not Spaceship Earth. Was it the thing where they spun you around and it felt like you were on

1057
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:26,840
 the Gravitron? No, but there was a shake to the seats when it took off. I'm closing out the

1058
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:31,080
 category as the game activities for 200. I don't fucking remember. You can celebrate the 40th

1059
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:36,520
 anniversary of this time-traveling '80s movie at the Composer's Room. It might have been Mission

1060
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:45,560
 to Mars. Was it Captain EO? Yeah, it's Captain EO, yep. It's Space Mountain, Space Mountain

1061
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:51,800
 final answer. Back to the Future. Yes, I know it's Back to the Future. I'm still naming Disney things.

1062
01:44:51,800 --> 01:45:00,040
 Oh, okay. Okay, Dark Cauldron. Dark Cauldron. That is the game. Black Cauldron. That wins with

1063
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:06,920
 1600 points. I'm in second place with 400 points. Close game today. Paul is in third with negative

1064
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:11,560
 1600 points. Oh, shit. And that's the scooper day for today. It's from Rum Raisenberg. Thank you,

1065
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:16,280
 Rum Raisenberg. If you want to send us a scooper day or a Price is Skryte jock versus nerd or an

1066
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:20,760
 obelisk jock versus nerd, head over to HayScoops.com right there on the homepage. You can do all those

1067
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:25,640
 things. You can also send us some scoop mail. Do all those things right over there at HayScoops.com.

1068
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:30,360
 Sure can. Oh, Matt is so distraught over losing. He's going to jump off the edge of a boat. Don't

1069
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:35,080
 do it, Matt. No, he is. He won. He won. I'm so distraught over winning. I'm going to jump over

1070
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:41,080
 the edge of this boat. Either way, he's not used to it. Don't do it, Matt. You won. I just want to

1071
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:44,920
 show Ryre how he said, should I piss off my balcony? I want to show him what would happen

1072
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:51,240
 if I pissed off my balcony. Just ride onto a lifeboat. Go right back into your face.

1073
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:58,040
 On someone's head. You are like, what deck are you on? You're pretty low. You're pretty close to

1074
01:45:58,040 --> 01:46:04,440
 the water level. I am. Yeah, I asked to be just underwater so I could really crack the door.

1075
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:12,440
 Give everybody a shot of the ocean real quick. Look at that. Right down on the waterline.

1076
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:19,480
 Somewhere over there is Canada. Law of the Sea. How glorious. Matt is just standing there,

1077
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:26,840
 not restrained by any international law. Nice. Oh, he just murdered someone right on camera. It

1078
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:30,920
 doesn't matter. Law of the Sea. Beautiful out there. We're probably going to do another episode,

1079
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:37,480
 but it's my first time on Virgin Voyages and obviously this is totally... It's pretty nice.

1080
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:42,360
 Yeah, it's pretty swanky. I'm not having as good a day as Paul, but it's really nice.

1081
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:49,080
 I have to thank people, yeah? Oh, we're just thanking people in general. We don't have new

1082
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:54,360
 lists yet. It's a new month. I'll give some personal thanks. It's a guy who gave me an

1083
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:59,240
 excellent Americano. Thank you to him. Good. No, I want to thank everybody who supports us over on

1084
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:03,720
 Patreon. If we didn't have Patreon, this podcast would not be killing it like it's been killing it

1085
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:10,200
 now for almost 11. Was it 12 years? I lose track. 12? More than a decade. And that happens because

1086
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:17,720
 people want us to exist and we're not a podcast that relies on hot takery. We don't try to do

1087
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:23,240
 sizzling things to go viral. We just try to joke around and keep people's days a little more

1088
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:28,040
 amusing than it would be otherwise. And if you think that's a cool mission, then go ahead and

1089
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:31,400
 support us today over at PreachingFun.com.

1090
01:47:58,040 --> 01:48:09,480
 That's right. Fartsinabag.biz that along with PreachingFun.com. It takes you over to our Patreon

1091
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:13,880
 page where for as little as $3 a month, you can help keep this show on the air. If you think it's

1092
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:21,400
 worth more than $0, PreachingFun.com, Fartsinabag.biz, those are your destinations. Keep this show rocking

1093
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:26,920
 and rolling for another 12 years. We'll do it if you want us to. I guess that's about it. Yep. I

1094
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:31,560
 want to do this for another 12 years. I seriously do. I really, really do. Then we can go back and

1095
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:36,440
 listen to this episode of how we thought we'd be when we were older. And then when I leave...

1096
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:38,520
 And I can remember when I had a functioning left eye.

1097
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:43,320
 You'll be there in an eye patch and I'll be there showing my new tattoo with a chicken with a rope

1098
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:49,080
 around his neck. God damn. Guys, I've got this great new bit. Jesus. Huge thanks to our guest,

1099
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:55,320
 Celestia Ward. Thank you so much for coming on the podcast. The most patient guest we've ever had.

1100
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:59,400
 We will. And yes, thank you for indulging my bullshit, but this was my best day ever. I had

1101
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:04,440
 to share it. I was blipping out a couple of times. Zoom hated me for some reason. Paul loses an eye

1102
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:08,360
 all on my Patreon. Well, we got you. Oh, you're doing great. Never affected the episode,

1103
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:18,200
 so it's all good. We will definitely share your information for SkeptiCamp on our socials

1104
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:23,560
 and spread the word. And please, Scoops, help spread the word, especially if you're in Vegas,

1105
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:28,040
 know people in Vegas, or just know some skeptics who might go, "Hey, fuck it. I'll go get free

1106
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:32,520
 lunch in Vegas for a weekend. Let's do this shit." Free lunch and critical thinking. Yeah.

1107
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:36,440
 Yeah. Yeah. That's a pretty great combo. I'm so good at one of those things.

1108
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:41,240
 Help us help Celestia spread the word on SkeptiCamp. It's a positive thing for

1109
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:47,160
 the planet and America for sure. So yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you, Celestia.

1110
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:53,080
 And Paul, you got to ask fact check Andy about his eye. He had a retina detachment scare.

1111
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:58,520
 Oh, I know. We've been through it. We talked through it. That was one of several hundreds of

1112
01:49:58,520 --> 01:50:04,920
 things that have kept Crispapus 2 from getting done. It's almost done. It's technically done,

1113
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:07,480
 but that was one of the- Christmas is coming.

1114
01:50:07,480 --> 01:50:12,600
 Huh? Christmas is coming already, yes. Christmas. Oh no, but it's, oh, Christmas is,

1115
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:18,680
 forget it. If we could get Crispapus 2 by Easter- Christmas 27.

1116
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:22,680
 Because the Easter bunny is a big part of the show, is a big part of the story.

1117
01:50:22,680 --> 01:50:26,600
 That'd be perfect. I don't know if we're going to be able to get there. I got to see what Andy's

1118
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:30,600
 up to, but we're close. We're getting closer and closer. So we may need to call on you again.

1119
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:33,080
 Can we put no work demands on Andy's plate right now?

1120
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:38,360
 Exactly. Cause he's, well, no, he's working now. He's, he's doing caricatures right now,

1121
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:43,960
 but he's had a fucking rough year of it. And I, Andy, I love you the most, buddy. You're my,

1122
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:50,760
 you're my art hero. I adore you. You're my, my, my book partner. We'll get the book done when we

1123
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:55,400
 get it done. But Celestia, while you're here at some point, we may call upon you for your editorial

1124
01:50:55,400 --> 01:51:00,920
 skills on old Crispapus 2 as well. My pleasure. There you go. All right. Cool. Cool. Cool.

1125
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:05,000
 All right. Well, thanks for listening, everybody. Thanks for being here. Thanks,

1126
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:21,800
 Ben for creating this podcast. We love you all and we'll see you soon.

1127
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:50,440
 You've heard me talk about Samaritan and today I get to tell you about an additional sharing

1128
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:55,560
 option called Redeem Health Share. It's everything we love about Samaritan, like the freedom to

1129
01:51:55,560 --> 01:52:00,120
 choose your providers and be in control of your healthcare, but with more program options to fit

1130
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:05,080
 your budget and healthcare needs in a modern digital platform. There's an add on feature to allow

1131
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:11,320
 for a wider range of medical bills to be shared, including preventative, dental, vision, and routine

1132
01:52:11,320 --> 01:52:16,360
 care. Join the hundreds of thousands of fellow Christians and check out RedeemHealthShare.org today.
