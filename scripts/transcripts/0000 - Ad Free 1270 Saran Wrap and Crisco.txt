Where's Nick Newman when we need him I was looking for him in the chat before we started. He's not in. Let's see No confirmed cases were reported reported in Nevada, but there is a significant equine Herpes virus outbreak affecting horse events nationwide causing major major disruptions cancellations like the all-in barrel race and It heightened biosecurity at the NFR rodeo, which is the one in Vegas here during early December So a lot of people just didn't bring their horses A lot of people just just left their animals at home and came to the rodeo Apparently the rodeo was really affected by it Paul says Paul Paul's Paul is right. Let's do it Okay, primarily directed through contact nose-to-nose or indirectly from shared items like tack buckets clothing even people's hands Oh aerosol droplets or contact infected with fluids man. It's amazing how we all don't have horse herpes. This is everything I'm already looking up if it can go to People no, it's not a zoonotic jumper.

Mr. Hands has nothing to worry about There'll be more horse herpy stuff in the new Taylor Sheridan show about the rodeo It'll be called it'll be called bull rider long dick man Speech guy Sheridan's running out of good names bull rider long dick man speech guy You know You know what? You know what to say about riding bulls? What's that a lot of times people think it's all about those eight seconds. You got to stay on the bull Those eight seconds. Those are the least important seconds of the whole thing The most important time is when you enter the pen My secret Give that bull a little light touch behind the ear. I See cold on my finger and I give him a little rub right behind the ear with icy cold I See hot and that's what he's what he's recording. What are you quoting? I'm making up a dumb Speech that he would do for this Rodeo, I thought you were quoting something but you're doing I'm improvising Matt. That's what I do. No, no, I don't mean I didn't mean to be that much of a dick about it You didn't make me feel liberal guilt, that's why I didn't think it was a Sheridan speech Also to be fair I don't I don't watch you don't watch so I don't know enough of Okay, so now I know where to go to go with it. Yes I rub a little bit behind there and then when that bull knocks me off After eight seconds if I stay on there for more than eight seconds Bulls outlived its life and that bull is gonna become your quesa frajita over at Chili's next week But you can't look at that bull and realize that's my case of frajita coming to me You look at that bull thing. What a noble beautiful animal and all I see is the 999 dinner for two special at Chili's You fucking limp tarred Enter share it at checkout That closer is that more like yes, I don't close pretty close. That's much closer. What a dick You're gonna watch any of those shows You would hate them Paul. I know I Know there was a thing it was a yellow stone like last year the yellow stone there was this character a PIP like a hippie who got arrested, but he became like a like a girlfriend of Kevin Costner, but like in this like pseudo we don't like each other, but we do kind of thing Oh, yeah, yeah, and her job. The last season was just to get lectured by every cast member a different aspect of Montana society It's a good gig if you can get it and at one point this one character Who's a Native American who's already was already feeling guilt about marrying into a Montana family that like, you know It's against her Native American, you know, whatever she lectured her and I was like Jesus I was like everyone's breaking character just to lecture libs Once we torched this lib girl we can go back to fighting about real things between our cultures But in the meantime the enemy of my enemy is my friend And There's a plot point happening in land made right now and I and I and I and I feel crazy Only because like in season one this person got a payout from the oil company like a wrongful death suit Okay, this couple this whole season this whole season They're fighting over money and I'm like weren't you paying a shitload of money from an oil company? Why isn't that coming up in conversation? Why is it coming up? You're paid out a large plot point last season about the large plot point that's happening right now in mayor of Kingston, which I watch right now like Like the pilot episode is that? What's his name the guy got ran over by a snow blower in real life. Oh Hawkeye Hawkeye. Yeah. Yeah. Yes So that guy he has it becoming his brother's job because his brother gets killed in a botched robbery, right? And they went through like four seasons were like man. We haven't brought him up in a while So the last episode that they bring up his dead brother like six times So go they're really making up for the lost lost bit there Jeremy Renner Jeremy Renner is who I'm thinking of yeah Yeah, it's hard It's hard. He's it is He's a fucking Yeah, okay, you talk about somebody coming away with the wrong life lessons after a near-death experience Yeah, oh Oh, he's just kind of doubled down on his asshole or he's a bit of a shit bird. Okay. Yeah, I How I don't know I I like Jeremy Renner a lot Not a lot. I like Jeremy Renner. I'd fuck him. He's gonna break your heart Matt. He It's probably true but he like like Survived unlike like he and his brother were like split like a box like doughnut holes when they were like dirt poor Okay, they got by in Hollywood by like buying and flipping a house and then flipping that in other houses and doing construction So like that But like he went from like dirt as poor to like building himself up into Like a house flipper while trying to be an actor at the same time and I thought that was pretty cool that he was not Any kind of like nepo baby or anything that like he really had to like fight to stay in the business and try to make A go of it. So I do like it and her locker. Come on. That's a cool debut story. Sure. All right What is why is he a shipper? I get them vibes when I hear him talk. Oh Did something no, he's just kind of he's just kind of his Might I get along with him? I don't give a shit about that His stance on some shit, it's a little bit But whatever it's all is weary Paul is weary of good for him good for him. Do your thing make you make your money Poker the other day for the first time in a very long time. Yeah, and I thought I was gonna watch Someone get murdered. I was at the poker table. I thought one player was gonna murder another player tournament or open table Open table. Okay cash game. Okay. No big deal low stakes cash game one three one three. No limit cash game A fellow that was at the table a couple of seats down from me He won a sizable pot from me got a little bit lucky on the last card drew out on the last card Nobody I'm not saying anything to him. You know, I'm do the hand ends he wins It's a good sized hand just doing yeah, you're stewing. I'm not even stewing. I'm like, oh that's over. All right. He got it He says without me saying anything. He says to me Boy, I thought you were gonna draw out on me there And I looked I looked back I was just confused I looked back I was like I wait I was ahead though I was ahead until the until the last card you got the last card there and you won it He goes. Yeah. Yeah, but I was mathematically ahead already. I was supposed to win that hand already I just wasn't ahead on the cards yet and I and I kind of laughed I kind of I kind of good because he was Absolutely being genuine. He was he was saying that with all sincerity He was like no, no, I was supposed to win that hand. I was ahead mathematically which he wasn't by the time He actually made the call. He was mathematically behind when he made the call doesn't matter doesn't matter He won the hand I wasn't mad about it. Yeah. Yeah, so that was that was that he was a touch of a you know a skosh this much of a just a bit of a jerk about it just a Just not even not even a jerk. I was done with it though. I so we continue playing the game I don't say anything to him about it After I got it after I figured out what he meant by that didn't matter that he was wrong I was over it moving on so about half an hour later I win a big hand a very big hand off of that guy. Okay So I made all the money back and then quite a bit more off of that guy Like I say about half an hour later Again, this person is not sitting next to me. There is a person between us After I win that hand I don't say anything because I'm not stupid When it comes to this I'm not scenario you're in this scenario. I was not stupid at that moment. Yeah, there we go so I Don't say a word The person between us though looks at the guy who just lost the hell and by the way I had drawn out I had drawn out on this hand So I got a little bit lucky on this hand and the fourth card out I got a little bit lucky with that card Well the moment of the setup right you got lucky. That's it. That's it. Yeah, I'm just being quiet I'm stacking up my chips I'm moving on to the next hand the guy between us looks at the guy who just lost and goes Well, that was payback for earlier, huh? And I like my head just snapped up, you know, I'm looking down I'm looking anywhere but at this guy My head just snaps up and I just was like I whatever is happening here. I don't want to be a part of this That's I would give a I would give a stern stop helping Line to the guy over there. Don't I wanted to I wanted to so badly I didn't want to open my mouth though I was afraid that if I drew any attention to myself that it was all just gonna dump onto me I've you did a party you consider going Right and then high-fiving the guy Took the words out of my mouth You need to shut the fuck up Oh shit Would make me laugh really hard I Was crying at the poker table I had to get up and walk away it was awful Because that's it like you you have to laugh at that point because That's all you could do. It's all you can do And if that guy is above the laugh line, he's about to get kicked out of the casino anyway, yes Yes, yes. Yeah, so Jake I just want to make it clear that I'm not involved in whatever this conversation is over here I I think I'm gonna go home. I think I'm just gonna go home in that kind of scenario Can you can you just get up and go? Can you just get up and go after after any game after any hand? Open can open table you stand up any time. I feel don't you feel I have felt bad in the past I haven't played in forever, but I would feel bad after winning a pot and then leaving the it's called hit and run it You know, you're not it's bad etiquette To but it's also how you get money, right? it's certainly it is certainly allowed within the rules and the people who do it are Probably more intelligent than the other people who are still sitting at the table. I just stay there to lose But at least the DC to take a fake phone call pretend to talk about an urgent matter My gosh a baby now both babies both babies at the same time Wait more than two bit. Where's the other babies? How many babies guys guys? I gotta go sorry all the baby lots of babies so many babies so many babies guys. Hey Great game and you need to shut the fuck up. Bye. I Think I stayed for about five more minutes because I didn't know how to not leave awkwardly right and I was like This is it. I'm leaving. Yeah, you're gone to fuck that It was so bad it was so bad. I was like this you're gonna get yourself shot I'm gonna get shot just by sitting here. I don't want to get shot I don't want to be in a fight with some random dude in a casino at 1130 at night I've done I've been sitting at a table where someone hit and run and it's not even I feel that like oh They're there, you know that that lucky motherfucker It's more like all the money at the table is gone like you look like it's just a bunch of short stacks You're like, oh now what are we all playing for $50? Yeah, now the game is kind of over. Yeah. Yeah But still, you know, it's it's an open table That's all I would have sat and played for a while longer if this guy had not egged on the guy that I had Just accidentally roughed up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah the scenario the amount of scenarios where the table And the other guy was already putting more cash down on the table like he was staying in yeah So he wasn't leaving he wasn't going anywhere anytime soon Like no, no, whatever is happening here I don't want to be in it people going on tilts one of the weirdest things to watch and it's so hard to Deal with and yes, especially at like a low-stakes game. Yeah But this this is supposed to not matter, right? Like on on pot therapy Whitney's husband Peter, yeah, he's a professional poker player And so we I always anytime I play poker, which is probably I don't know at this point three times a year I go I'll play poker and Oftentimes I will end up with a story for Peter from these low-stakes games because he's He's won three games aren't the games that he's playing but every now and then you run into A professional, you know a big quote-unquote professional poker player at a low-stakes game Well, they all have these training apps now and they're all like these there's Soles and game theory stuff Yeah Makes people do dumb things on purpose to mess with other people's math and no one's getting the cards and it's gotten super weird But watching people do that at a low-stakes game where no one is doing the math in the first place. Yeah It's like meta fuck you. Yeah. Yeah It's it's crazy. It's just a weird crazy thing and also like, you know, and I I've been you know We've all been victims of bad beats, you know that kind of thing It's like it's poker for a reason, you know, like you're like, oh yeah I was doing the math and then gambling happened. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's the kind of like what we're doing Is tempting fate for bouts of luck and craziness Sometimes the wrong card just comes out or the right card speaking of gambling. Go ahead what are your guys takes on the current state of sports and Sort of the veneer cracking around. Oh that play was clearly somebody Covering a spread or fucking around for no good reason Level A lot of heat right is there gonna be is there gonna be any kind of real? No, cuz what I don't know but my consequence like you can't have a consequence if you don't know that something happened There's no way to tell if something happened unless somebody says like I did this I will say that I will say that I hear Paul and that like when they started loosening up all the sports gambling All the scenarios that everyone thought of sure came up in a hurry all the things that we like what if this happens? What that happens? It seems of all come to a head really quickly Oh, I let me be clear. I don't think I don't think that Paul is wrong on this I think that Paul is absolutely correct on this. Oh, what's that? I don't know. I think you're absolutely correct on this I'm saying I don't know how to prove it I don't know how to I don't know how to like get anyone but like did you see that play? Like it was making be viral. I've been really intentionally not watching any football anything uh-huh, but there was some college game and the kid is running down the field with the ball and Just he's got nobody in front of him. He's almost the goal line. He just walks off the side You see it. I There's so many college games. So there's so many that's things like college sports specifically, right? So like you can watch the NBA in the NFL. You have 30 teams going at it, right or 33 to whatever and With college you have hundreds and hundreds of this 30 teams just in the Big Ten, right? and And in those scenarios, right those those those smaller colleges where they're not making a lot of money Right. So like this if I had the opportunity to take two steps to the left and make $20,000 I think I'd do it All right, you know, let's all right. Let's I'm in for 20. I just need a thousand people to join me You're not over 20,000 you're in for $20 feel like I just feel like You can't trust any sport at this point on a professional level I don't think you have here's why here's where I think you are not wrong But mistaken in the in the path that you're going down. Okay, I don't think you have to go to gambling I think you can just go to the to the legit money the quote-unquote legit money in it And that's all you have like I don't know. Yes, and that's gambling side of it You have to go to the dark money to find the crazy shit College football it's getting nuts and in the end of the mean that's going around is like Indiana has been terrible football for 150 Years, you can pay players and suddenly they're good. They're like Indiana was the only only college playing by the rules for the last hundred and fifty years And I was laughing because Indiana won a crazy game against Ohio State and both players are interviewed We're like I want to thank God. I want to thank our Lord God Lord God Lord God I was like money you have the highest payroll You could thank old Johnny greenbacks You want to thank your river of money of boosters I want to thank God which is what I call all of my sugar daddies here at Indiana University Thank you God. No, it's gonna college football is gonna get weird College football is about to get bizarre because the amount of money that's going into that Through like the legit channels. Yeah, it's it's so much money. It's yeah, it's gonna be great Oh, yeah, and then Andy has mentioned the transfer portal that being able to transfer from from team to team much more easily now Oh, yeah, but coach. Oh, yeah, like coaches leave teams with like I'm gonna leave this $12,000,000 a year job, even though I was I thought I was trying to kind of stay for ten years I'm gonna leave because I was gonna pay me even more money like you can't there's no these contracts mean nothing. Yeah Even more infinite money than protein right, but there's 32 NFL teams, right? Yeah, just 30. I think it's 32 So like if you're like the 33rd or 34th best quarterback, right? you can now make money by staying at a University. Yeah playing quarterback in college, right? If you just want to stay at Michigan So what's gonna happen make more money playing it in Michigan than you can backing up at the New England Patriots? What's gonna happen would just make sense for me to play six seven or eight years at Michigan That's what I'm wondering is gonna that's what that's where it's gonna get no They're gonna have 35 years playing college ball, right? I mean a Shador Sanders is a good example of one. He's playing for the for the Cleveland Browns now He When when the draft happened, he's a rookie this year when the draft happened the place that he got drafted at They said point-blank they were like he could have made more money if he had just stayed another year in college Yeah, but if he had got drafted in the NFL, yeah, they just say it there's like Oh, yeah, he he could have made more money if he had stated he played at the University of Colorado They either just stayed there and made more money that would have just been it Yeah Lorgan copper scale and chat says isn't isn't youth league in high school football falling out of favor for safer sports Yes And a large in the large part Yes, but for the less glorious positions like linemen and things like that are you're finding It's hard and harder to find these quality people want to sacrifice their bodies for for the thankless positions Well again, I can't I can't say it enough like that that Aaron Hernandez special segment that last podcast did they did three episodes on him. Yeah, and both Marcus and Ed were like we came up as youth people young men playing football And they talked about the horrors of it through high school and all that kind of stuff And it's just it's you know, it really it was insane. It was change their mind was insane They've been they've been football like Ed has been a football fan forever Like Miami Dolphins is like part of his identity as a human being and he's now just now after all this This this podcast this little podcast run and doing the research in it He's really just starting to change his mind around the CTE and the dangers of the sport and just the inhumanity of it my Brother was captain of his football team in the high school And he tells stories that I'm still afraid to repeat here now Like really that went down like that would be a crazy crazy scandal Yes, yeah, there are there are things that happened on a regular basis on the on the teams at my high school That people would go to jail for now Yeah, they would just they would go to jail for like child endangerment and things like and I'm not talking about like Terrible things or anything, but just you know, just just the standard things that we would practice. Yeah. Yeah Fights the the cursing that you know, he's all the weird. Yeah It was just weird bizarre shit and looking back on it. You're like, well, that's 16 year old kids Doing this shit and like the old ones are 18 This is this is stupid. This is just dumb I'll tell you what else is dumb but not because they're dumb because we're dumb and that's the following sponsor Today's show is brought to you by dammit close out the window reopen Today's show is brought to you by narrating mistakes.
