00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Oh, hello there. I am so glad you are here. This is the part of the show where we thank you, the ice cream truck drivers. Thank you so much ice cream truck drivers. It's a new month. I don't have a new list yet. But we will thank each and every ice cream truck driver at this part of the show before this month is over. If you want to be an ice cream truck driver, and I sure hope you do, preaching fun.com is where you can go to hang out, sign up to be an ice cream truck driver right there. I'll see you in the next video. Bye for now.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 There and who knows the life you save may be your own.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 And now a show. Hey, Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social? Yeah, I'd love to. Great. Let's go.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Jacob, I want you to know that the jokers of magic are making fun of this microphone on my face for the whole part.

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Because you look like Britney Spears? Yeah.

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 I didn't. It's not the microphone that you just looked like Britney Spears.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 I screamed social sitting over there in Las Vegas. It's Matt Donnelly sitting over in Pittsburgh, PA. It's Paul Mattingly. Also in Vegas. It's me. Jacob, the audio guy.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 I love the microphone on your face, Matt. I think it's dapper backstreets back. All right. Yeah, it is. It's kind of cool.

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 I mean, it improved the audio quality of our show dramatically when I was traveling. So yeah, there you go. I'll take I'll take the jokes. Can't fight that.

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I want to be very clear. I'm very willing to in exchange for improving the quality of this show. I am willing for you to be made fun of by your peers.

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 I said fine with that trade off. I packed it with my regular microphone road road rig microphones, you know, handheld microphones for right Africa Babel.

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 And I said, I packed this because that way I thought if I could drive and do that, we could do the podcast while actually driving and Mike Mills, our producer slash host said, what a terrible idea.

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 And why didn't Mike think this was a good idea, Matt?

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Well, once we ended up driving through not one, but two blizzards.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Well, that would have been distracting. So trying to podcast would have been really, really difficult.

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Honestly, I'm sad that we don't have just recordings of you guys trying to podcast through a blizzard.

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 No, we we hit a second blizzard and we were all upset because the first blizzard was very much talked about in the news is coming towards us. And then we hit a second blizzard in India.

18
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 And I was like, what? No, we had no idea. We had no idea we were going to hit a blizzard blizzard.

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 And then we we hit this gas station at like at like midnight, trying to fuel up and get some food. And we're just surrounded by snow coming down. It was, I guess, the tip of the lake. They kept saying so that the flakes are really big, chunky flakes, tip of the lake.

20
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 I was like, not not to borrow from my clown name, but chunky flakes, a lot of chunky flakes coming down. And then the clown, the guy in the gas, he was like, oh my God, no, we're getting at least 10 inches. And I just heard from Valparaiso.

21
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 They're getting, you know, 15 inches and the other reports. I mean, everywhere I go, it's like he was like, don't go anywhere.

22
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 And one, oh, we were at a gas station in the middle of some town that have hotels. So we were terrible advice for a gas station attendant to give anyone.

23
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 We were going somewhere. Yes. And then we were like kind of starting to panic about like, what do we do? And looking at the nearest hotels. And then I remembered, hey guys, the all the information we just got was from a cashier at midnight in a gas station.

24
00:03:48,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 So like all of the reports are coming from, you know, one point, even the cashier he was working with, she was like, can you chill out? And he's like, I'm just telling them. The other cashier called them down. Great.

25
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 And then she was like, that guy's a soft guy over there. You can ask him. And I was like, well, this is the kind of town we're in where we're actually at the coffee shop.

26
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 You know, the coffee stop where the guy who's salt in the roads is there. Yeah. And I said, oh, you know, the salt guy, she goes, he's my dad. And I was like, we are in a tiny, tiny town.

27
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Oh boy.

28
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 But you made it out. We made it out. We lost an hour driving from Milwaukee to Wabash, Indiana. And then we got in, ended up getting in with the snow at like five o'clock in the morning with a nine a.m. lobby call.

29
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 So it was pretty great. It's pretty great. So we had two shows, Wabash, and then they put the man at two o'clock instead of four. But we did two shows in Wabash. We were a little delirious, but they were super fun. Great crowds came out and including the else Ross.

30
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Hooray. Yeah. And Michael else Roth, always being a gentleman, brought me a Dr. Pepper cream zero for me to drive delicious. He knows is my favorite. He always brings him to scoop fest. He's he's he knows he knows his stuff.

31
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 But I got to sneak out and have a little bitey with with the else. Well, the hard part is always finding a hooker that's named Dr. Pepper cream zero.

32
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 I think he just tells how Matt happens to be in. I think he just pays extra for whoever to just say it. I don't think he can do the legal name change. I think so. I think so. Does anyone who's into commitment? It's Michael else from that is true.

33
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 That is true. So are you still in snowed in areas now or you're back? No, I'm back. I'm back in Vegas. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But you've been driving through crazy snow pack everywhere.

34
00:05:49,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Well, yeah. And the good, the good news for me, I seem like I was making the big sacrifice. Everyone else was flying out of Fort Wayne. I drove the Sprinter van back to Cincinnati to drop off where we rented it from and flew out of Cincinnati.

35
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 And everyone's flights were messed up and delayed out of Fort Wayne and everything. Everything in Cincinnati is going off without a hitch. So I was like, yeah, would you drive three hours just to make sure your flights were totally normal? You would say yes.

36
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Fine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because I'm driving. Who decides to introduce letters to exit numbers?

37
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 You know, this has been at the top of my list to talk about for years. I'm glad we're finally getting to it as a secondary component of the exit. Right. So you go by 42 B, right? So you go by exit 41, then 40 to a 42 B 42.

38
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 See, don't you dare come driving out here and fucking Pittsburgh. You will lose it. It is everything is just blabbering. Blabbering. Blabbering. Oh, Pittsburgh is no, I mean, like it has to get so confused.

39
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Riding with the Uber drivers in Pittsburgh is the worst. I just had, I had to stop paying attention, but it has to be a meeting. Right. And that means someone that maybe goes, whoa, whoa, whoa. Those exits are too close together to have their own numbers.

40
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Well, I guess that's it. I guess that's it. The numbers are mile markers. Yeah, essentially. I mean, on the right on the interstates growing up, you'd have the mile markers and then you would have an exit and the exit would serve as a mile.

41
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 They're supposed to correspond pretty closely. Yes. Right. All right. So I guess the letters are just between the mile markers. But yeah, it seems like they've they've raged out of control.

42
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Jacob, Jacob just said something that makes a lot of sense and I feel dumb for bringing it up.

43
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 But no, I think that's how it's supposed to be. I don't think that's how it is out here.

44
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Well, it's definitely because they're just too close because we have exits. Like we have like on the freeway here, we have, you know, the Flamingo eggs and the Tropicana eggs that are not a mile apart from each other.

45
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Right. The designs of all of it are just so it's just so bad. I drove I had to drive in for class last night and just two or three times.

46
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 It's like, God damn it. Well, Pittsburgh, the driving in Pittsburgh just isn't designed at all. No, it's not. And it's it's it's terrible road stacked on each other over the years.

47
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 And I just, you know, we keep discovering everything in our society is built as a massive Psy op to confuse and upset us and control our brains.

48
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 And I feel like the driving shit is a big component of that, too. Like they make these things. Now we're talking.

49
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Jacob's making sense. Paul saying it's because of a Psy op. We're back in business. I'm telling you, it's all just like, I mean, of course, the interstates were built for.

50
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Interstate trucking primarily, but now we all we have to use them to just get to our third and fourth jobs.

51
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 I don't know. It just seems fucking insane to me how much we have with the interstates initially built primarily for trucking.

52
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Yes. Yes. Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah. Eisenhower was the president who did a lot of interstate stuff, right? Yeah.

53
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I like when you could point at a president and just casually list the thing that they did.

54
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Here's just something that happened under this administration that was just, I don't know, I guess, a net positive.

55
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 I guess. I don't know. Sure. At the very least, it's something that got accomplished.

56
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 But also the crazy fucking thing with my commute. Now, I've gotten to where I'm really leaving very early because I know how insane the commute can be.

57
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 But it's approximately, I think, as the crow flies, as you'd say, about 12 miles from my house to where I'm going. Good shape.

58
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 And I couldn't fly 12 miles if you paid. And it takes me no less than 45 minutes.

59
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Yeah. Ever. Really? That's the that's the quickest ever. That's just the amount of time that that trip takes.

60
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Because you got and I'm so I got so spoiled in Vegas, too, because it's all on a grid out here.

61
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 It's do do do do do do. This used to be a horsey trail. This guy owns a part of this. This is where you cannot be.

62
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 This is a demilitarized zone. Do do do do. It's just fucking bananas. The loopy doop floop driving shit on the horse.

63
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 One hundred fifty years ago. Does that how you were going to get to work today?

64
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Yeah. Oh, well, there's the easiest way for the nag to get through without breaking its leg.

65
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 That's my wife. I keep asking you not to call her that. That'll work. That'll work for a Porsche in about 100 years.

66
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 That's perfect. No problem. Yeah. Perfect for a German engineered piece of machinery.

67
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Horse rhymes with horse. I'm sure it'll be fine. But anyway, yeah, so I've been busy with improv this week.

68
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 I had a free class on Saturday that I co-taught with my friend Sarah. We had a couple of ladies come out.

69
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 We're going to be working with them on a project, too, which is cool. They got to see it.

70
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Big shout out to Malia for coming out to the class, too. And it was awesome to have her there and a couple other scoops.

71
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Alex and Anna showed up, which is awesome. Just great to see scoops coming through at my little events.

72
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 I don't know. The algorithm is not promoting the stuff I'm promoting.

73
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 I thank every scoop for retweeting and putting out as much info on that class as we could.

74
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 We still had nine people. I promoted the show. I mean, I got promoted. I didn't pay for anything.

75
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 You're having a crazy winter, aren't you? That's part of it, too. Yeah. Yes. Yeah.

76
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Ultimately, it was we had nine people show up in two degree weather. So that's pretty good. Right.

77
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 That's also possible that everybody knew about it. It's also possible that the algorithm just did its job and everybody in Pittsburgh knew about that class.

78
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Nine people were in. It's possible. It's quite possible. It's cold as fuck. It's cold as fuck out here and just insane.

79
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 And every time like and then I was going to teach my new level one, which had to get postponed, I was doing that yesterday.

80
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 So last night, again, I'm heading out early. My class starts at six thirty. I'm in the car around five.

81
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 I open up the garage door and it's fucking snowing again. I was just like, what the hell?

82
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 It just doesn't stop. But we've got a solid, you know, almost 10 to 12 inches for Pittsburgh, parking and weather with the famous fall.

83
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Yeah, he's got a solid 12 inches and it's just not moving.

84
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 It's not going anywhere. It's just there. I've already had to dig out my mailbox. I had to dig out a place for my fucking.

85
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Did you get your mailbox? I had to dig out the mailbox because the mail people were like, please dig a path so we can get to your mailbox.

86
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 I'd love to deliver your mail, but we can't. Yeah. So I had to dig, dig a big old path to get them.

87
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Yeah, that big high of seven on Saturday. Scoop and overgrow. Yeah, it's cold as fuck out here.

88
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 And then I dug a place to put my trash can so that it wouldn't be out on the street exactly, you know, and the plowing is crazy.

89
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 So it's where I'm digging out is like 14 inches.

90
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 No, I mean, my buddy, my oldest friends, Pat said a picture of him and his kids standing on the Navisink River in Red Bank, New Jersey.

91
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Oh shit. That river never froze over the entire time that I lived in my entire lifetime.

92
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 I've never heard of that river being frozen. It was, it was nuts.

93
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 This is when Matt goes into his no such thing as global warming because the river froze spiel now.

94
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 That's right. Exactly. The people don't understand. Like it's young guys.

95
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 It goes both ways. It gets real cold. We've been asked to have an emergency Vegas parking and weather.

96
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Okay, here we go. Oh shit. No one does it better than ICS from Ryan.

97
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Is it me or is there a recent increase in people who insist on backing into parking spaces?

98
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Why is this? What does it mean for our society as a whole?

99
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 I need an emergency Vegas parking and weather. This is a great point.

100
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 I have noticed this too. And I asked, but I just like Jacob had a very logical answer for my exit thing.

101
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 There is a logical answer as to why there's an increase in this happening. Great.

102
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Because I've noticed this too. I want to know the same thing. Quality of reverse cameras.

103
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 You're right. All these cars put much better ways where they show you the lane that you're turning in

104
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 and everybody would rather park pulling out of their spot that way than backing up.

105
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 It's annoying. Ready Rich has the best take on this is that you shouldn't be mad that people do it.

106
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 You should be mad that people are bad at it. That's right.

107
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Because that's it. It's like what happens is that it takes so much longer if you're waiting to park

108
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 and you're behind someone and they have to do this giant production to get the car back in.

109
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 So just pulling in the goddamn space. I'd like to, I'm a backer inner.

110
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 I've been a backer inner for decades unapologetically, especially with the truck.

111
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 If I'm driving a pickup truck, it's just so much easier to back in and then pull out nose first.

112
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 But when people are bad at it, it's terrible. And if there are a line of cars behind me in the parking lot,

113
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 then I do the gentlemanly thing and I go nose in just to do it a little faster.

114
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 So I don't have to pull forward and then back in. Yeah, I'm a consummate pull through guy.

115
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 So I go all the way to the other side backing in, but I'm going through and then I'm ready to go.

116
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 That's only dangerous for like two split seconds. Yeah. What do you mean dangerous?

117
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 If someone else is someone else wants to pull into the regular spot that you're pulling forward.

118
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 You don't understand how I do my pull throughs. I park in BFE.

119
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 There is not another car around me, my friend. This is the thing that drives the nearest abandoned lot.

120
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Seriously. And goes fucking crazy over my parking.

121
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 She's like, you always zig when I think you're going to say automatically I go.

122
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 I go so far away. She's like the other night it was it was balls cold again.

123
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 The wind was blowing. We had to go to Lowe's.

124
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 This was right before the fucking crazy storm hit and we went to go find a terracotta pot.

125
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Just in case we needed an emergency heater type thing.

126
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 We could pack because we had plenty of candles and we just needed a terracotta pot to use as an emergency heater.

127
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 We absolutely lost power and everything went to shit. That was your backup plan. Hey, man, it works.

128
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 It fucking works. I love this. I love that. That's your backup plan.

129
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 So we went to go get a terracotta pot. It was freezing cold backstage at Madison, Wisconsin.

130
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 And Mike noticed that the dressing rooms had old light bulbs, not LEDs, but old style light bulbs.

131
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 It was like, yeah, close the doors, leave the lights on.

132
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 And we went and did a sound check and we came back to the toastiest dressing rooms.

133
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 We basically easy. We easy baked ovened our dressing rooms in Madison.

134
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 They are. They are hot. This is how you fucking do it.

135
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 And yeah, so these are the hacks. But yeah, I parked over by the garden section and pretty close to the front.

136
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 There was nobody else there. And we had to walk all the way in.

137
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 She's like, what the fuck you doing, Mattingly? You're killing me. This is crazy.

138
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 She's like, just shivering and shaking the whole way. I'm cold, too. It's cold as fuck.

139
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 But then we got the thing and we're heading out the door and I'm like, can we go back over to the door we came in on?

140
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 She's like, no, we have to go out this exit, which is even farther away from where you fucking parked.

141
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 And I'm like, I didn't know. I thought we could go out the front again.

142
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 She's like, no, we can't. Why did you do this? This is insane.

143
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 That's really she. She does not like my parking. But I don't sound like this.

144
00:17:51,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 She does. But my parking could not be could not be safer in so much as there's no one there.

145
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 No, I don't like people combat park when it, when the spaces are diagonal, you don't back into spots when they're diagonal.

146
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 That's right. No, you don't. You do not back. That's that's how they're designed.

147
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 And so you don't have to back yet to the douches and still do it's buddies literally doing that right now.

148
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Listen to me, douches. Stop it. Hear you. Hear you, douches. That's like almost doing a donut to get into that shit.

149
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Right. Stupid. That's making a you. What a load of people do that in the Caesars parking garage all the time.

150
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Sure has the angled parking spots, but they will get into the wrong lane.

151
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 You know, they'll be they'll be going up the down lane and now they have to back into the spot just because they can't get into it.

152
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 That's a double douche. It's not too negative. Don't make a positive. That's a double douche.

153
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 That stays double douche. It's two squared. It doesn't make a positive.

154
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 I don't know. When I see them doing it, I give them the stink eye.

155
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 They know what they did. They know what they did. We've got snow lined up on the streets everywhere still.

156
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 And the small as the roads already are, it makes some lanes like even more super tight.

157
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 So it's a little dodgeball out there. We should note that it's a it's a Patreon bonus month.

158
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 So thank you for everybody. Yeah, thank you. Thanks, everyone.

159
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 We're pretty fun dot com. We broke our bonus level.

160
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 And for that, we are going we owe you a bonus episode.

161
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Now, we were going to give you a bonus episode anyway, because it's the Super Bowl.

162
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 And we always do our Super Bowl prep for people who don't love football, where we have Mitzi, our odds maker.

225
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 No, don't do that! No, don't do that! Oh, Vulcan rings are notoriously razor sharp on penises.

226
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 But not on fingers, strangely enough.

227
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 I know. I know. It's weird.

228
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Oh no.

229
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 Well, congratulations Starfleet.

230
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 SJ had some weird travel this week.

231
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 Oh yeah?

232
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 She's been in Canada for the last, I don't know, week and a half or so.

233
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Doing shows with the Spice wannabe show.

234
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Oh great, that's back up and cooking, huh?

235
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 SJ, just stay there.

236
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Oh yeah, no, they've got a lot of road gigs.

237
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 SJ, just stay there. You're better off.

238
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 Well, that's...

239
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Just hang out there.

240
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Well, that's just it. That's just it, Matt.

241
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 On Monday, she had a gig back here in Las Vegas.

242
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Oh.

243
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 And so she flew down, did her gig here, was in town for about 15 hours?

244
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Yeah.

245
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 And then 4.30 this morning, back to the airport, back to Canada to do a show tonight.

246
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Holy shit.

247
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 And she's back in Canada until, I think, Saturday.

248
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 How's she doing this? It's insane.

249
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 Oh, air travel, Paul.

250
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 No, like those things that pass over you in the sky.

251
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Oh boy. I'm talking about the physical toll. My God, that's gotta be awful.

252
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Oh no, she's hurting. She is hurting.

253
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Yeah, we did that show together with Sarah Sarash. She was talking about this travel schedule.

254
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 And I said, you know, these are the kind of things like in our 20s, like we've been loved.

255
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Absolutely.

256
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 We did it in our 20s.

257
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 I got to do this gig here and they got to fly.

258
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 You can fly right back here and finish out this gig.

259
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 Yeah.

260
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 And when you're older, you're like...

261
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Yeah, now that SJ is in her late 20s, she hates it.

262
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 It is different in your late 20s. It's true.

263
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Yeah, it's very different in your late 20s.

264
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 Speaking of Sarah Sarash, I guess, I don't know.

265
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Do you trigger warn for the only curse word we really have in the English language?

266
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 The only one that's left?

267
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Yeah, she has...

268
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 Yeah, go for it.

269
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 She has a song...

270
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 A cunt trigger warning.

271
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 She has a song out called Serving Cunt.

272
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 And if you look closely, you can see me dancing as an Elvis impersonator on Fremont Street with her.

273
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 There it is.

274
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 It's very fun. It's directed by my wife, my very talented wife, who may or may not be in the room with me right now.

275
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 And...

276
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 Hooray!

277
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 She did an amazing job. It was super fun.

278
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 And gave me my backup plan for if anything goes south as I got stopped multiple times for pictures just walking in my car, dressed like Elvis on Fremont Street.

279
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 There you go.

280
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 I now know what's going to happen, you know, when my #MeToo scandal hits.

281
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 So...

282
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 Right.

283
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 We'll be right there.

284
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 You got a solid $30 a day coming to you there.

285
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 Remember? Remember when people listened to The Will of the People? Wasn't that fun back in the day?

286
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 Did they?

287
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Those were the days.

288
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 I don't even know anymore. I don't even know if The Will of the People were ever listened to.

289
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 I don't know what the fuck's going on.

290
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 At the time it didn't seem like it was, but now it seems like it really was.

291
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 God damn.

292
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Shit is fucking crazy right now.

293
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Shit's crazy.

294
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Somebody wrote us the other day on Pod Therapy.

295
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Actually, as this comes out, that show might not even be released yet, so I might be crossing timelines here.

296
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 But they were saying, you know, we commented on Pod Therapy when the most recent presidential election happened.

297
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 And just said, you know, basically, let's all stay calm and react to things as they happen.

298
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 And then, you know, a lot of things have happened since then.

299
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 And continue to.

300
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 And so they wrote in and they said, you know, hey, you guys, you said react to things as they're happening.

301
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 And now a lot of things are happening. And now what?

302
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 And we were like, yeah.

303
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 Whenever you think about that, that's what we think, too. We agree.

304
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 That's, yep, that's just it.

305
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 I have a lot of friends in Minneapolis from the improv community back in the day.

306
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 Sure.

307
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 I'm so grateful that we got to go out there, that you brought me along for that festival just recently, because I got to get a taste of that place.

308
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 And the people who were working at huge at the time got to take me on a quick little tour.

309
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 We went around, they showed me the George Floyd Memorial and everything.

310
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 So I was in that whole zone, right? Like it was chill.

311
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 It was totally chill.

312
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 No, Minneapolis is a great city.

313
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 And there's a lot of pride in it.

314
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 And so like what I'm seeing in my timeline is like I am actually like really proud of my Minneapolis friends.

315
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 I feel like I feel like I feel like I feel like they chose the wrong city to mess with in a lot of ways.

316
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 It really seems like that.

317
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 I proud is a good word.

318
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 It's they're doing a really good job.

319
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 I feel bad. This is just arbitrarily heaped on them because someone was mad.

320
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 They didn't win the state in an election.

321
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 Oh, no, I'm not mad about that at all.

322
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 I am I am thoroughly not bothered by the arbitrariness heaping on Minneapolis.

323
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 The shit that just that seems fine blows my mind.

324
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 The stuff that just making me so I don't know, not hopeless,

325
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 but I'm very curious as to where we go from here in a lot of ways,

326
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 it seems to me that no one is exempt from this shit no matter what side of the aisle.

327
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 It's getting you know where we're going from this.

328
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 We're going we're going to full on anarchy colonies.

329
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 Mad Max style.

330
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 I think you might be right, Jacob, because we go.

331
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 It's just going to be city states.

332
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 It's going to be old school city state.

333
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 There's no one each other.

334
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 Athens and Sparta.

335
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 There is no one for me.

336
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 There is no one at the federal level I would trust in any respect.

337
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 So how do you take directions like there's no one to give us a voice.

338
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 There's no one to unify and say, hey, maybe this is our next move or maybe we should try and improve this next.

339
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 You know, there's no there's no steps that are being lined out.

340
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 There's no actionable plan to be taken as I simply do not trust anyone.

341
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 I nominate you, Paul. Paul, you should take us to take us to the promised land.

342
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 No, no.

343
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 All right. No, Jacob.

344
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 Will you just going to go around the horn here?

345
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 No, I don't.

346
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 I don't know that I don't.

347
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 I'll go to the rest of the Zoom technical school port.

348
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Will you take us to the promised land?

349
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 Take us to the promised land.

350
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 It's not supposed to be any one person.

351
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 It's not supposed to be any one person.

352
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 That's why we have a group of government.

353
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Oh, you're right, Paul.

354
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 You're right, Matt.

355
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 I see what you were doing wrong.

356
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Zoom chat, Zoom chat.

357
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 This group of people.

358
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Will you take us to the promised land?

359
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 You know, one person, it's a group of people.

360
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 I would love to have a community lead us into whatever's next.

361
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 For a fee.

362
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 For a fee.

363
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 There's a Patreon level for that chaotic clumsy.

364
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 Who the fuck knows what's going on?

365
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Anyway, I'm just as she just texted me.

366
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 She is at the hotel in Canada.

367
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 Oh, good. She made it back.

368
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 They didn't take her passport.

369
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 Well, we were a little, uh, leaving Canada.

370
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 Cause she's there on a, on like a work visa thing.

371
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 You know, it's all legit and everything.

372
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 And, uh, she was like leaving and then coming back in less than a day

373
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 later during the, during my work visa.

374
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 That was the only thing that she was a little itchy about going back yet.

375
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 Of course.

376
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 But I like it all.

377
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 She has the paperwork for everything and it was all just legit.

378
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Paul.

379
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 It is nice.

380
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 That is the nice thing about doing this in your late twenties versus your early

381
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 twenties is, uh, you're, you're prepared and you're just doing it all legit

382
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 this time.

383
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 Whereas when we did it in our early twenties, we were just doing like

384
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 tourist visas and be like, no, we're not working while we're here.

385
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 I still remember bringing a suitcase of Mr.

386
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 Piffle's, uh, customs of being like, it's just for friends.

387
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Um, going to show it off to some pals.

388
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 If we had our merge confiscated, um, multiple times by Canadian, uh,

389
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 officials sell t-shirts and Mr.

390
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 Piffle's dolls.

391
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 What do you, what do they, they hold it for you to come back?

392
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 Is that how that works?

393
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 Pick it back up on your way out.

394
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 Yeah.

395
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 That's not so bad.

396
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 They sell it at the duty free shops.

397
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 I was going to say, I doubt they just, I doubt they just hold onto it for you

398
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 now anymore.

399
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 I don't think anybody's doing us any favors at the borders these days.

400
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 I think our goodwill ship has sailed back through and everybody's wearing

401
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 the dog who knows shirt.

402
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 Um, Paul, I'll just say, uh, I was, I did Penn Sunday school yesterday.

403
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 Um, and again, this will probably come out before that.

404
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 So we're jumping on podcasts in multiple directions here.

405
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 Okay.

406
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 Um, but Penn, uh, always brings up, it's a quote attributed to Gandhi,

407
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 but people are suspicious of whether it is, but that it is a first, they ignore

408
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 you.

409
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 Then they'd laugh at you.

410
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 Then they fight you and then you win.

411
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 And the, the quote was about fight you stage.

412
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 Yes.

413
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 Yeah.

414
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 I mean, there is reason to be hopeful.

415
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 Look, Lawrence O'Donnell talks about all time.

416
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 Protests always work.

417
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 Protests always work.

418
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 Yeah.

419
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 Uh, uh, and I, I know I brought up on presenting school, the counter example,

420
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 you know, that I don't like is there was anti-abortion protests my whole life.

421
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 And I thought there's no way they're going to take away freedom of choice from,

422
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 from women.

423
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 It's, that's a, it's, it's, it's really bigoted towards one gender.

424
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 Uh, that's not, that's not the way laws are supposed to work, but, um, it did,

425
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 it worked.

426
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 So, uh, January, you're absolutely right.

427
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 J six definitely kind of worked.

428
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Yeah, it worked.

429
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 So, uh, you know, we were at that, we were at the fight and jail phase of,

430
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 of the protest movement.

431
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 So, yeah, I'm just, my hope is that we can survive the fighting,

432
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 the fighting stage.

433
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 I agree with you.

434
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 I think the, I think the, the, the old way is, is dying.

435
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 And this, and these are the death throes.

436
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 Yes, there is some of that too, for sure.

437
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 I just hope we can, we can survive it.

438
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 I hope we're good at the end of it.

439
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 And a lot of people who are staying on the sidelines are no longer staying on

440
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 the, like it is, it is, it is galvanizing what is happening.

441
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 That is true.

442
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 Yeah.

443
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 Well, I've certainly, I've certainly seen, you know, plenty within the, uh,

444
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 podosphere coming forth and letting our voices be heard.

445
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 And I don't want us to be out of that conversation anyway.

446
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 I want everybody to know which side we're on, at least which side I'm on for

447
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 sure.

448
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 And, uh, I want everybody to know that they're not alone out there.

449
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 We see it.

450
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 We feel it.

451
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 We hear it.

452
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 It's fucking horrible.

453
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 And, uh, I like, I guess, like Matt said, um, we're coming together.

454
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 We're getting out there.

455
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 We're getting our voices heard and we're going to get through it somehow.

456
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 I think so.

457
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 We don't have any choice.

458
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 We don't have any choice, but to get through it.

459
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 I mean, I don't think we'll ever do things that are better for the

460
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 environment.

461
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 There's certain things I've think the ship has sailed on, but I think for

462
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 protecting our own freedom and stuff, I think we're going to, we're going to

463
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 get better at it.

464
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 Hopefully, hopefully.

465
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 Yeah.

466
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 The river will freeze over a few more times and somebody will go, Hey,

467
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 wait a minute.

468
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 Well, I mean, it's all fucking connected, right?

469
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 Like I, I truly believe we're going to have to dismantle these, uh,

470
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 goddamn data centers and, um, uh, holding cells.

471
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 We're going to have to dismantle all that.

472
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 We're going to actually physically have to get in there and break apart some

473
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 structures.

474
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 I'm following, uh, there's a new giant data center being built in, uh, rural

475
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 Louisiana, not too terribly far away from my mom's house.

476
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 And, uh, so I've been following this and it's, it's, uh, you know, huge.

477
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 It's, uh, I, I don't even know how many multiple acres.

478
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 Yeah.

479
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 Yeah.

480
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 Like acres and acres of warehouse being built and it's the new meta like AI

481
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 center.

482
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 Uh, and it's being built in a town of like, I don't know, a few thousand

483
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 people.

484
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 Uh, and everybody there is just like scared and weirdly in the dark about

485
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 everything that's happening.

486
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 Cause it's going to, it's going to take all their water supply.

487
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 It's going to fuck up their water.

488
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 Electricity is going to be a thing.

489
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 Yeah. The fact that they can just arbitrarily decide, well, now

490
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 electricity costs five times what it used to, because we need more of it

491
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 for this.

492
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 I guess.

493
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 So Will Smith can eat spaghetti in a more convincing way.

494
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 What the fuck, man?

495
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 You know what?

496
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 I was off of it until you said that.

497
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 Now I'm kind of back.

498
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 Now you're back on.

499
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 I do like being more convincing.

500
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 If I watch unbelievable spaghetti eating, it ruins my day.

501
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 Noodles.

502
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 Yeah.

503
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 Oh, we've got to do something to get through this uncanny Valley.

504
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 I'll tell you what else we're going to do to get through it.

505
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 And that's listen to the following sponsor.

506
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 Today's show is brought to you by Bob Evans flavored toothpaste.

507
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 That's from Florida man scoop in 2024, Bob Evans flavored toothpaste.

508
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 Well, how do y'all and welcome on into my barn shaped restaurant.

509
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 Bob Evans, you know me for my delicious biscuits and gravy, my fresh country

510
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 raised eggs and my oh so succulent bacon.

511
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 Well, now the flavor of Bob Evans is delivered right to your mouth on a

512
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 toothpaste holding device, hopefully a brush.

513
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 But here's the thing.

514
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 We've decided to forego our classic country cuisine and you're getting the

515
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 direct flavor of Bob Evans.

516
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 That's right.

517
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 Me.

518
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 This toothpaste tastes like me.

519
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 My scientists have worked day and night to make this toothpaste.

520
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 Tastes like me, like you're eating a piece of me.

521
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 Bob Evans, the real man behind the restaurant.

522
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 It doesn't taste like your delicious breakfast items.

523
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 It tastes like my delicious breakfast items if you like huevos el Bob Evans.

524
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 What's huevos del Bob Evans taste like?

525
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 Well, open that mouth, let me dip them in.

526
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 You can be the judge when you actually slide some of that paste on.

527
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 See how close we came.

528
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 Speaking of close we came, I did say dip them in.

529
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 Anything for my teeth.

530
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 So let's do it.

531
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 Oh, here's the thing about Bob Evans paste.

532
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 It's good for any cavity if you know what I'm saying.

533
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 Our scientists didn't stop with just flavor.

534
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 They've also worked on lubrication.

535
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 It's the slickest fucking brush you've ever had in your life.

536
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 Soylent gravy.

537
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 Soylent gravy is Bob Evans.

538
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 That's right.

539
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 Get her hay scoops at checkout.

540
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 That was so upsetting.

541
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 It'll drip right off you like come on a gold tooth.

542
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 I don't think that's a metaphor.

543
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 I think you just put like.

544
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 That's essentially what's going to happen.

545
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 That's a simile, not a metaphor.

546
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 I don't think.

547
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 Hey, I'm just a plain old barn bar and restaurant tour.

548
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 That's the difference.

549
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 I'm not a dentist degree.

550
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 What's the dentist doing?

551
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 He's right here doing the dip.

552
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 I want to do a Matt was right segment.

553
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 Beast games continues to be the craziest fucking bat shit thing on television anywhere.

554
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 I'm on episode three with my kids are watching it.

555
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 Oh my God.

556
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 I see that survivor.

557
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 I just can't watch it.

558
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 It scares me to see it.

559
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 OK, so last year, this is a spoiler.

560
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 Never mind.

561
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 I'll wait to the whole thing.

562
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 It's crazy though.

563
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 Like last year we talked.

564
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 We talked about these games because Matt started watching Beast games with his kids when it came out.

565
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 Because Matt's kids like every other child on the planet watches Mr. Beast on YouTube.

566
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 Uh huh.

567
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 And so watch that.

568
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 I watched it because I love really bizarre reality TV game shows like the competition reality TV thing is like a weird spot that I like to dig into in these things.

569
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 I'll say this is truly like the weirdest one.

570
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 It is.

571
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 This year is much more competition based and less psychological torture based so far that I've been watching.

572
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 So that part I like it is still so funny where he sets up things to have like this twist.

573
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 And when people don't become absolute assholes, it's so clear he's so disappointed like he's so upset that people are.

574
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 I am on episode four.

575
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 Yeah, I'm one episode ahead of you.

576
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 Yeah.

577
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 And I'm going to tell you that he has noticed that too and changes some of his tactics going forward to get them to do it.

578
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 And he wants people to be themselves.

579
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 The niceness might not continue as it is in the earlier episodes.

580
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 No, it doesn't go.

581
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 It does not go to psychological torture, though.

582
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 I mean, it definitely doesn't do that.

583
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 But they kind of laugh about it.

584
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 The first season, there was so much crying.

585
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 Yes.

586
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 And so much like it was just awful.

587
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 Yeah, I can't.

588
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 I can't do it.

589
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 It makes me upset to see in the clips.

590
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 Like I said, I just get something to come up in a scroll and I'm like, oh, this looks awful.

591
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 Yeah, I know it's tough, but it is it is really like super.

592
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 I watched this one, this other reality show competition game out of Korea because they make some fucking weird ones over there.

593
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 And this is the idea of it and the execution of it, both are so much bigger and stranger because of it, because they're doing these things on such a large scale.

594
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 I mean, when they when they filmed it in Vegas, they were in Allegiant Stadium.

595
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 They go out to these places out just in the open areas and build these giant scale things.

596
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 And it is weird the amount of effort that goes into something that is so stupid.

597
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

598
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 And I say that as a podcast.

599
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 But we have it on the effort and we're right.

600
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 We're in check. We're in check.

601
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 We got it. We got it.

602
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 We're fine.

603
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 I don't know. I keep watching it and I'm like every time I go every time it says TVPG, it's the beginning of it.

604
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 I noticed that and I think of your kids and I go like, yeah, because kids are because kids are watching this and I've been trying to watch it through the lens of a young person watching it, which is impossible for me to do.

605
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 It is it bothers me on it doesn't bother me, but it like it it it makes me uncomfortable on a different level. Yes.

606
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 Well, on a more positive media note, new show, new show note, I will shout out Mystery Science Theater and Rift Racks are combining again.

607
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 Rift Racks is basically re taking up the mantle of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and they are going to produce four new episodes utilizing Kevin and Mike and.

608
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 Oh my God, Bill from the OG Rift Racks crew as, you know, reprising their roles as Tom Sarvone Crowe and him and yeah, it's going to be really cool to see them back in the saddle instead of the whole new crew, which nothing against the new crew.

609
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 For the most part, there were one or two times that whoever was voicing Crowe on a couple of this last season.

610
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 I was like, shut up. They're just screaming. They were just screaming like that is not the fucking voice.

611
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 But yeah, it's already up to 1.6 million on Kickstarter. It's amazing brand new thing.

612
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 And they've still got 45 days to go something like that. Wow. But it's a wonderful thing to see them back at it.

613
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 And this is the Rift Racks fans coming through big time for them because I've backed several of their kickstarters to a back the mystery science theater crew too.

614
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 But I am far more in the camp of what Rift Racks has been doing than the last because that in more than the than the MS the last MSC three K failed because people were just kind of like that because that last season was just not great.

615
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 And it's because they really jacking around with who they had voicing Crowe.

616
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 They had a couple of people who really knew how to do it.

617
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 But then if you're watching a movie and someone's in there shut fucking up, I can't.

618
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 I love the things that bother you about about movies.

619
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 Paul, it's I watched that mystery science theater 3000 season and there was a single time that the robots voices even occurred to the most recent one.

620
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 The most recent season.

621
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 I don't know if you saw this most recent season because the most recent one you because you would go, oh shit, I can't unhear this.

622
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 It's awful.

623
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 It's awful.

624
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 It's just a screeching Banshee.

625
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 And and it just ruins any of it.

626
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 So they had good performers that first reboot.

627
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 They were fine.

628
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 I was like, this is great.

629
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 You know, let's go.

630
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 But now I'm really excited because it's the old bots with the old voices.

631
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 It's you know, you don't want weird sounding Muppets.

632
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 It's the same shit.

633
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 People are on the Kermit thing, too.

634
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 You know, there's something to it.

635
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 There's really something to it.

636
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 And you know what the frog always said, it's not easy being blue.

637
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 Hey, invent some new robots.

638
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 They invented some new robots.

639
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 Throw them in there.

640
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 That's fine.

641
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 But also, just don't be screechy screechy ain't going to just goddamn screechy ain't funny.

642
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 It's not not Dustin Diamond is he's no longer with us.

643
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 Yeah, he's no longer.

644
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 And so, I mean, just just bringing it up is it's truly in bad taste.

645
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 So everybody who is doing screech impressions on Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes, just stop it exactly.

646
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 Well, they've stopped it because they didn't get funded in the last one.

647
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 But anyway, Mary Jo Peel is going to be back as Miss Forrester and that's going to be funny.

648
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 Pearl Forrester.

649
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 So that's going to be funny, too.

650
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 They got the proper antagonist with them.

651
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 I think it's going to be quite good.

652
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 I'm looking forward to the new four episode mini season thing.

653
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 I went ahead and backed it on the Kickstarter.

654
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 And of course, got to get my physical media on.

655
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 So I ordered the four DVDs and VHS tapes.

656
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 Yeah, the VHS tapes are going up, dude.

657
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 The money on those.

658
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 It's crazy.

659
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 It's true.

660
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 I don't doubt it.

661
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
 They're really expensive now comparatively, especially like horror.

662
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
 I think it's dumb, but I don't doubt it.

663
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 I know it's dumb, but there is a huge market for it.

664
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 But anyway, just want to say shout out to the Riff Tracks guys.

665
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 I listen to them every night pretty much.

666
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 Matt, have you dipped a toe yet on the old to be?

667
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 Did you take in any of the Riff Tracks films yet to try and use them as sort of your lullabies?

668
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 I have not used them as lullabies or check them out.

669
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
 I should.

670
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 I should.

671
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 You really should.

672
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 You really should.

673
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 They got some really great stuff in there right now.

674
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 Yeah, I'm about to do another two week stint on the old Sun Princess, so maybe I can crack it then.

675
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 Well, I'll just put this out there as my number one recommendation for anyone who wants to see if they like this kind of shit.

676
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 Go on to be look up Riff Tracks and then watch Samurai Cop.

677
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:02,000
 The Samurai Cop episode of Riff Tracks is one of the funniest things I've seen in so many times.

678
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 I still laugh my ass off even just thinking about it.

679
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 It is a super cheese.

680
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 Oh, B movie action thing.

681
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 It's crazy.

682
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 I it's great.

683
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:20,000
 You know, if you if you grew up like us when that was the thing like, you know, aping commando and all those kind of things.

684
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
 But Samurai Cop, God damn it.

685
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
 The movie is so crazy on its own.

686
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 And then there had a commentary just blows it out of the water.

687
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 So check it out if you get a chance.

688
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 It's also amazing.

689
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 Like how many movies have they covered?

690
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 They are.

691
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 I think they they're cracking around 500, maybe more.

692
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 It's just amazing.

693
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 Like how many like because it's not like there's a certain aesthetic because there's a lot of like just bad bad.

694
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
 Yes.

695
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
 Yes.

696
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 And it's it's it's it's a very fine needle of thread.

697
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
 You wouldn't think, but it really is.

698
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 And there's some of them that are better than others by far.

699
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:05,000
 I mean, it's basically it feels like what their show basically is, is it seems like if if Penn's old movie night had morphed into a podcast.

700
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 I mean, that's that's what you know, Mystery Science Theater was always that.

701
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
 But there there has to be a certain level of watchability to the movie.

702
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:20,000
 That's like it can't just be absolute trash, unwatchable and again has to have decent audio and all that kind of thing.

703
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
 Because otherwise it just, you know, you can't sit there for two hours and watch it.

704
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 And there's been a couple of of them that are really pushing the line because they are digging pretty deep in the catalog.

705
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
 But yeah, man.

706
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 Oh, God, this hammer.

707
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 I cop will fucking.

708
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:41,000
 Well, I mean, we we learned that lesson, too, with some of the episodes of what was the Michael Landon Angel show?

709
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 Oh, yes.

710
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
 Highway to heaven, highway to heaven, highway to heaven.

711
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 Not all gems, not all.

712
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
 Some of those were just so bad you can't make fun of them.

713
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 Right.

714
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
 This thing's like I love the movie night at Penn's house.

715
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
 It was like one of my favorite things.

716
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
 And then when I was younger and I had a house full of guys, that's what we do.

717
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 We would just flip to find the worst movies on HBO and make fun of them.

718
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 It was an activity.

719
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
 I loved it.

720
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
 I miss it.

721
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 I was like, I'm basically hoping like my kids are now getting funny enough that like if I can get them on board, I have to figure out a way to like get them into the idea of making fun of a movie while we watch.

722
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
 It out loud to make use of the lab.

723
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
 But I feel like I can recreate it with my with my boys right now.

724
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
 Show him some mystery science theater.

725
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:23,000
 Rift Tracks has some some question like Samurai Cop would not be suitable for your youngins.

726
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
 It's violent and there's boobies and shit circles and circles.

727
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
 You wanted me to show them Terrifier 3.

728
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
 I mean, I do still want you to show them Terrifier 3 on Christmas.

729
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
 I would give you I might I would I might actually give you money for that.

730
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 If you show them Terrifier 3 on Christmas.

731
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
 It's the first 15 minutes.

732
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
 They lose their fucking minds.

733
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
 All right.

734
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
 Tell you what.

735
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
 If Matt loses Jock vs. Nerd today, he's showing his kids Terrifier 3.

736
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
 On Christmas.

737
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
 On Christmas.

738
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:07,000
 On the hunt for balls on the hunt for balls.

739
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
 We have a Winter Olympics themed scooper from Freehold Scoop today.

740
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 The categories are curling, biathlon, luge and bobsled.

741
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
 I'm up first.

742
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
 Oh, let's see.

743
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
 I'll try curling for 400.

744
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,000
 This is how much the stones that the players slide down the ice weigh in pounds within five.

745
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
 This is the first one.

746
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
 This is the first.

747
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
 How much does the Rockway is the first question?

748
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
 But Jacob, they're called stones.

749
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:46,000
 And you know, in Europe, when you say, oh, I lost 30 stone or more, you know, or lost five stone over the summer vacation because I stopped eating gummy bears or whatever.

750
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
 So maybe I believe that's 20 pounds.

751
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
 You think you think one stone is 20 pounds?

752
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
 That's what I was about to say.

753
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
 I don't know.

754
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
 I think that's what it is.

755
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 Uh, fine, Paul.

756
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
 20 pounds.

757
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
 That's my logic.

758
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
 All right, let's try it.

759
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
 Forty two.

760
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
 Oh, the answer.

761
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
 Forty two.

762
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
 That's much heavier than that.

763
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
 That's heavier than 20.

764
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
 That's two.

765
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
 Not within five at all.

766
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
 I think it's well, I don't know what I thought is one.

767
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
 I was going to ask you.

768
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
 Is one stone 20 pounds?

769
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
 That's what I thought.

770
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 Did I say somebody weighs however many stones?

771
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
 Oh, it's 14 pounds.

772
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
 Oh, one stone is 14 pounds?

773
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
 Yes.

774
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
 Sorry.

775
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
 Paul, you're up.

776
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
 Okay.

777
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
 Biathlon.

778
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
 Let's go.

779
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
 For 14, for 400.

780
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
 Biathlon combines cross-country skiing and this other sport.

781
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
 Target shooting.

782
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
 Target shooting.

783
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 I'm sorry.

784
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
 It's rifle shooting, Paul.

785
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
 You're not shooting targets.

786
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
 It's rifles.

787
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
 Matt, you're up.

788
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
 Curling for 800.

789
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:02,000
 Curlers use these household devices to melt the ice causing the stones to go further and curl less.

790
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
 Brooms.

791
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
 Brooms.

792
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
 Or brushes.

793
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
 Chim-chiminy, chim-chiminy, chim-chim-chiri.

794
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,000
 Jeff Loomis, not in my house.

795
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
 It's me.

796
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
 I'll try bobsled, 400.

797
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,000
 An Olympic bobsled team consists of either two athletes or this many.

798
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
 I believe it's four.

799
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
 I believe two or four.

800
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
 Nice.

801
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
 Don't they have single person bobsleds or are they called something different?

802
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
 That's skeleton.

803
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
 Oh, that's right.

804
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
 Skeleton is one where you lie down and go feet first.

805
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
 Skeleton.

806
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
 And then you die.

807
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
 What's the one where you go head first?

808
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
 Is that the luge?

809
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
 That's skeleton.

810
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
 Head first is skeleton, feet first is luge.

811
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
 Oh, maybe that's the first question on luge.

812
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
 Paul, you're up.

813
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,000
 I will take biathlon for eight.

814
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:01,000
 Biathletes shoot at targets from two positions, standing in this lower position.

815
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
 Fucking.

816
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
 That's why they're biathletes.

817
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
 They have to show that they're biathletes.

818
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:15,000
 One of them is fucking a lady and the other is fucking a dude.

819
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
 Band kick.

820
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
 Standing in this lower position.

821
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
 Kneeling.

822
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
 One leg up, kneeling.

823
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
 Prone.

824
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
 Prone.

825
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
 Like the--

826
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
 Oh, so we were talking about sexual positions.

827
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
 Like the shrimp.

828
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
 Doggy.

829
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
 Prone shrimp.

830
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
 Is prone kneeling?

831
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
 I don't know.

832
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
 No, prone is laying down flat.

833
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
 Oh, OK.

834
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
 Elbows.

835
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
 Butt up, elbows out.

836
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
 I'll show you.

837
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
 Gotcha.

838
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
 Yes.

839
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
 Oh, that's what it is.

840
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
 I'll teach you some proning.

841
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
 Matt, you're up.

842
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:56,000
 I'll do curling for 1,200.

843
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
 All right.

844
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
 Daily doubles.

845
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
 Oh, shit.

846
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
 Oh, my god.

847
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
 It's happening.

848
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
 The target scoring area of the ring is called this.

849
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
 The same thing you might call your residence.

850
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
 Buckhouse?

851
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,000
 [LAUGHTER]

852
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
 Domicile?

853
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
 Don't go to the tickle house.

854
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
 [LAUGHTER]

855
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
 Who's tickling who?

856
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
 Is it just the house or the--

857
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
 I think it's home base, like in tag.

858
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
 Oh.

859
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
 Home base?

860
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
 No, I think it's just home.

861
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
 I think it's just home.

862
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
 Did they send it home?

863
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
 I think that's what that's from.

864
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
 I'll go with home.

865
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
 All right.

866
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
 The house.

867
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
 Oh, it's the house.

868
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
 Holy shit.

869
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
 The house.

870
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
 We were closer.

871
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
 Nobody listens to Jacob.

872
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
 I would have been closer to Buckhouse.

873
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
 Yep, you would have.

874
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
 It's me.

875
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
 I'll try-- fuck curling.

876
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
 I'll try biathlon for 1,200.

877
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
 You two are both in Vegas.

878
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
 You should know the house always wins.

879
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
 Athletes must hit targets at this distance in meters

880
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
 during Olympic competition within five meters.

881
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
 14 pounds, Jacob.

882
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
 14 pounds, final answer.

883
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
 It's English money.

884
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
 I feel like it's--

885
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
 I want to say it's like 25.

886
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
 But it might be 50.

887
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
 I don't know.

888
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
 I got to pass.

889
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
 Paul.

890
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
 I'll go 50.

891
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
 All right.

892
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
 It is 50.

893
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
 Look at me.

894
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
 Look at me.

895
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
 Back on the board.

896
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
 You know you're biathlon.

897
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
 I'm a biathlete.

898
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
 Sure.

899
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
 Paul, you're up.

900
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
 I'll do it for 2,000.

901
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
 Let's go.

902
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
 Daily double.

903
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
 Look at this.

904
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
 Here we go.

905
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:58,000
 Norway's old inner bjørnsrun holds the record for most

906
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
 Olympic biathlon medals with this many, within three.

907
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
 Oh, for every--

00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
 Yeah.

 In biathlon?

 OK.

 --Norway's early inner bjørnsun said.

 Well, he just had-- he had multiple events to place in.

 --the dude's name.

951
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
 Sure.

952
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
 I think.

953
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
 All right.

954
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
 Great.

955
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
 Double down, same points.

956
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
 [LAUGHTER]

957
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
 Is only a man.

958
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
 Double or nothing.

959
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
 Matt, you're up.

960
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,000
 I got a curling for 2,000.

961
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
 The main two types of shots a curler throws are draws

962
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,000
 and this other type designed to remove the opponent's stones.

963
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
 Dickhead moves.

964
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,000
 Destration.

965
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
 Boppers.

966
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
 Boppers is a great answer.

967
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
 If it's not called boppers, I missed it.

968
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
 It should be boppers.

969
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
 It should be boppers.

970
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
 I'm going to go with knockouts.

971
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
 Ooh.

972
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
 Good guess.

973
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
 Good guess.

974
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
 Takeouts.

975
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
 Oh, so close.

976
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
 So close.

977
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
 So close.

978
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
 You were so close.

979
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
 You should have thought Chinese food.

980
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
 I should have thought Chinese food.

981
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
 I'm getting Chinese food later tonight.

982
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
 I can't fucking wait.

983
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
 I'll go bobsled for 800.

984
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
 The athlete who steers the bobsled from the front position

985
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
 is called this.

986
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
 Captain Suicide.

987
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
 Edward.

988
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
 His name is Edward.

989
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
 It's something about they have like a leash, right?

990
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
 It's like it's a couple of little strings.

991
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
 Pull things.

992
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
 Yeah.

993
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
 A little pulley string.

994
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
 So it's probably something like the leashman or the stringman.

995
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
 The leashman.

996
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
 I saw those guys.

997
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
 They played prim.

998
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
 The quartet.

999
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
 The leashman.

1000
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,000
 I saw it when Chuck Connors was still on it.

1001
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:53,000
 You did not see Chuck Connors in the leashman.

1002
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
 The leashman.

1003
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
 Everybody says they saw Chuck Connors in the leashman.

1004
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
 Nobody saw Chuck Connors in the leashman.

1005
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:09,000
 It's like the steerer or the wheel man.

1006
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
 The steerer.

1007
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
 There you go.

1008
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
 Wheel man.

1009
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
 He's using ropes.

1010
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
 He's using ropes.

1011
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
 He's like the ropester or something.

1012
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
 No, they call him the wheel man ironically, Paul.

1013
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
 Oh.

1014
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
 Because he drives to the event.

1015
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
 Well, he uses his feet probably too.

1016
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
 Oh, I don't know.

1017
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
 I don't think they use their feet.

1018
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
 Yeah, it's on a thing.

1019
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
 Yeah, I don't know.

1020
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
 I pass.

1021
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
 Paul.

1022
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
 Okay.

1023
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
 Here we go.

1024
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
 They use their feet.

1025
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
 Final answer.

1026
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
 Ropesman.

1027
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
 Show me ropesman.

1028
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
 Pilot or driver.

1029
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
 Well, well, well.

1030
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
 Well, well, well.

1031
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
 Aren't we creative, Mr. Bob Sled?

1032
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
 Or should I call you Robert Sled?

1033
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
 Paul, you're up.

1034
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
 Fuck.

1035
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
 I'll do luge for 2,000.

1036
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
 Oh, let's do it.

1037
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
 I got to get back on the board.

1038
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:10,000
 Germany has dominated Olympic luge, winning approximately this fraction of all gold medals in the sports history, within 10%.

1039
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
 73%, Jacob.

1040
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
 That is dominant for sure.

1041
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
 Let's see.

1042
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
 I'm sorry.

1043
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
 It's 60%.

1044
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:28,000
 You're off by 3%.

1045
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
 So close, Mattingly.

1046
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
 So close.

1047
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:39,000
 Horse shoes and hand grenades, Mattingly.

1048
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
 Matt and Natalie.

1049
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
 Well, now that I've leapt into second place.

1050
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
 By the way, we've got five questions left.

1051
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
 Quick score check.

1052
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
 I am currently winning with zero.

1053
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,000
 You're not uncatchable, Donnelly.

1054
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
 Matt has a negative 2,400.

1055
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
 Paul has a negative 4,000.

1056
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:06,000
 I would like to just say at this point in the show that the three of us really know our winter Olympic sports.

1057
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
 Got that winter Olympic fever.

1058
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
 That's right.

1059
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
 I think it's the flu.

1060
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
 Matt, you're up.

1061
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
 Let's go.

1062
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
 I'll go luge for 1,200.

1063
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
 Okay.

1064
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:26,000
 Luge runs are timed to this tiny fraction of a second where races are often decided.

1065
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
 My penis.

1066
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
 It does come in second.

1067
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:39,000
 I would guess thousands.

1068
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
 Oh, good.

1069
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
 A thousandth of a second.

1070
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
 That is a tiny fraction of a second.

1071
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
 You're on thousand.

1072
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
 Yeah.

1073
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
 I'm sorry.

1074
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
 It's hundreds.

1075
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
 Missed it by one order of magnitude.

1076
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
 A bridge too far.

1077
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
 A bridge too far.

1078
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
 Gift of the Magi.

1079
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
 Last places within my grasp, Matt and Lee.

1080
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
 Mine too.

1081
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:13,000
 This is the maximum weight limit in pounds for a four-person bobsled, including crew, within 100 pounds.

1082
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,000
 Well, each of the people weigh 120 pounds.

1083
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
 Yes.

1084
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,000
 So that's 520 pounds.

1085
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
 Right.

1086
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
 Plus some of them have been snacking.

1087
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
 So let's put it at 550 just for the people.

1088
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
 About 550.

1089
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
 550.

1090
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
 Maybe.

1091
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
 Let's be generous.

1092
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
 They're athletes.

1093
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
 They're hefty.

1094
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
 Muscle weighs more than fat.

1095
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,000
 Let's say 600 just for the four individuals.

1096
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
 Okay.

1097
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,000
 The thing itself is very lightweight, I think.

1098
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
 The sled.

1099
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
 The sled.

1100
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:53,000
 I would imagine the sled, the chassis, is all fiberglassy, right?

1101
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
 It's something, yeah.

1102
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,000
 So, I don't know.

1103
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
 30 pounds for the chassis.

1104
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
 Okay.

1105
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
 Then you've got to have the structure and the thing to hold it together.

1106
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
 That's where the real weight comes in.

1107
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
 Wait, the chassis isn't the thing holding it together?

1108
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:17,000
 No, I'd say the legs and the thing would be the, that's another 200.

1109
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:25,000
 So, let's just make it 250 for the whole kit and caboodle.

1110
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
 So, 250 plus 600.

1111
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
 So, 850.

1112
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
 That would be my guess.

1113
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
 Okay.

1114
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
 I pass.

1115
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
 Paul, you're up.

1116
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
 All right.

1117
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
 So, 850 I think would be a safe bet.

1118
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,000
 Maximum weight, I'm going to guess, is 1,000.

1119
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
 Let's try 1,000.

1120
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
 1389 pounds.

1121
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
 I underestimated.

1122
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,000
 You underestimated.

1123
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
 Paul, you're up.

1124
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
 You've got Luge and bobsled left.

1125
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
 Bobsledding down on the farm.

1126
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
 For 2,000.

1127
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:10,000
 Jamaica famously competed in this year's Winter Olympics, inspiring the film Cool Runnings.

1128
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,000
 Oh, Cool Runnings happened when I was still in high school.

1129
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,000
 Which had to have been '92 or '93.

1130
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
 Okay.

1131
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
 John Candy was alive.

1132
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
 Right, but when was that Winter Olympics?

1133
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
 Okay, now I've got to count it down.

1134
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:55,000
 So, 6, 2, 18, 14, 10, 6, 2, 98, 94, 90.

1135
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
 It had to have been '90.

1136
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:01,000
 1990.

1137
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
 Motherfucking shit.

1138
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
 I needed to go one more.

1139
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
 One more.

1140
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
 A bridge not far enough.

1141
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,000
 Wait, I guessed 1990 and it wasn't even, I was off by two years somewhere.

1142
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
 Where'd I lose two years?

1143
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
 Man, I suck at math.

1144
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
 Matt, you lose for 400 or 800.

1145
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:29,000
 No matter what you do, it doesn't matter.

1146
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
 I'll do a luge for 800, please.

1147
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,000
 I think I got one bobsled question right, but then I clearly lost that money somewhere.

1148
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:47,000
 Luge sleds have no brakes, so athletes slow down using these parts of their body.

1149
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
 What parts of their body do they use to slow the sleds down?

1150
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
 I think it's the hands, isn't it?

1151
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
 The scrotums.

1152
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
 Whoa, Bob Evans.

1153
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
 Just like a beaver tail.

1154
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
 Whoa, Bob Evans.

1155
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
 Just dragging it down.

1156
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
 Beaver tail.

1157
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,000
 Jesus, you need to get that thing checked out.

1158
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
 If you're scrotum, it's beaver tail.

1159
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,000
 I mean, it's got to be hands or feet, right?

1160
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
 It has to be one or the other.

1161
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
 I'm done guessing at this fucking game.

1162
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
 Is it their knees?

1163
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
 Or their own heads?

1164
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,000
 The luge, are they on their stomach or on their back?

1165
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
 No, they're on their back.

1166
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
 Skeleton is head first.

1167
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
 Okay, so they're sitting.

1168
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
 Luge's feet first.

1169
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
 Okay.

1170
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
 Chaotic.

1171
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:40,000
 They use their opponent's stones.

1172
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
 They throw up parachutes.

1173
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
 I'll say hands.

1174
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
 Let's try hands.

1175
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
 Feet or toes.

1176
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
 Damn it.

1177
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,000
 I've been really good at narrowing it down to 50/50 on this one.

1178
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
 And I've gone the wrong way every time.

1179
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:02,000
 You have been really good at at least saying the correct answers somewhere in your discussion every time.

1180
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
 I have good math.

1181
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
 I am closing out the category and the game luge for 400.

1182
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:13,000
 If I get this question right, one of us will be in positive points.

1183
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
 Well, I'm not counting the day.

1184
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
 Unlike Bob's letters who sit upright.

1185
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
 Yes.

1186
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
 Luge upright.

1187
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
 Oh, news.

1188
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
 Athletes race in this body position.

1189
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
 They're on their backs.

1190
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
 Yeah.

1191
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
 Wait a minute.

1192
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
 Jacob, that puts you in positive points.

1193
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:35,000
 I have 400 points and I will.

1194
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,000
 What just happened is I won the game with 400 points.

1195
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,000
 Matt is in second place, though, with negative 4,400 points.

1196
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,000
 And Paul is in third place with negative 7,200 points.

1197
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
 Winter Olympics.

1198
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
 Catch the fever, everybody.

1199
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
 Catch the fever.

1200
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
 Get pumped.

1201
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
 J.J. just popped into the chat.

1202
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,000
 I'm trying to get J.J. on earlier, but she had a very important doctor's appointment.

1203
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
 Oh, sorry, J.J.

1204
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
 Good to see you, though.

1205
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
 Can you unmute yourself, J.J.?

1206
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
 No, she can't.

1207
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
 No, the answer is absolutely not.

1208
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
 No.

1209
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
 Oh, well.

1210
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
 No, the answer is genuinely she can't unmute herself.

1211
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
 Hey.

1212
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
 Did I do it?

1213
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
 Yeah.

1214
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
 You did it.

1215
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,000
 You guys, I just had my Botox and filler redone.

1216
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
 You can do it.

1217
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
 Revenge Med Spa.

1218
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
 Revenge?

1219
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
 Revenge Med Spa?

1220
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,000
 I mean, you sound so happy about this, but you look so apathetic.

1221
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
 Oh, my God.

1222
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
 Right here.

1223
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
 It worked, dude.

1224
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
 It worked.

1225
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
 It weirdly feels good.

1226
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:46,000
 I feel like it's some sort of weird face massage for weird people like me.

1227
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
 I was like, "Do the needles."

1228
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
 But yeah.

1229
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:54,000
 J.J., as someone who is open about their cosmetic work, can you tell the story about what happened

1230
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
 to you at the Las Vegas airport, please?

1231
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
 Fuck, man.

1232
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
 This is such bullshit.

1233
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
 I was so mad.

1234
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,000
 So I get off the plane, right, and I'm like, "I have 20 bucks.

1235
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
 I'm just going to put it in a machine and see what happens."

1236
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
 Sorry, the Botox doesn't work yet, so my face is all over the lot.

1237
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,000
 So I sit down with my backpack, and I've got my Magic Castle hat on.

1238
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
 I put my 20 bucks in, and it goes to 60.

1239
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
 And I'm like, "Whoo."

1240
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
 And the lady comes around the corner.

1241
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,000
 She puts her hands on her hips and goes, "Hello, little one."

1242
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,000
 And I'm like, "What the fuck?"

1243
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
 And I was like, "Are you talking to me?"

1244
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
 And she's like, "Yes."

1245
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
 She goes, "So you're trying to gamble?"

1246
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
 And I was like, "Yes."

1247
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
 And I was like, "I'm 36 years old."

1248
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
 And she's like, "We're going to have to see some ID."

1249
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
 Oh, my God.

1250
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
 So I got out my passport.

1251
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:52,000
 She opens it, and she goes, "Oh, God."

1252
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
 Yeah.

1253
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
 So, but that means that this shit works.

1254
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
 I guess.

1255
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
 Yep.

1256
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,000
 The hands on hips little one is so degrading.

1257
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
 Hello, little one.

1258
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
 I get to go like that.

1259
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
 Hello, little one.

1260
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,000
 Do you think this is an affectation of you dealing on Disney

1261
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
 so long that you are just de-aging

1262
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:19,000
 because the Disney magic is just continually de-aging you?

1263
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
 I'll tell you what.

1264
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
 I've gone places where people are like, "She's a vampire."

1265
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,000
 Matt was at the Crazy Castle in Savannah, Illinois,

1266
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
 where people that tour it try to get me to stand in front of a mirror,

1267
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,000
 and then they go, "She does have a reflection."

1268
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
 It's crazy.

1269
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
 But no, Disney, I literally asked him.

1270
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
 I was like, "Listen, I don't want a lot of shit."

1271
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
 I was like, "Disney cheeks.

1272
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
 I need Disney cheeks."

1273
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
 Okay.

1274
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
 There she is.

1275
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
 Disney cheeks on point.

1276
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
 Oh, Lord.

1277
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,000
 We're at the end of the episode, so we have to save your topic.

1278
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
 You have to come back on next week and do the other thing we want to do.

1279
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
 Oh, deal.

1280
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
 Because if people want to hear about some porch pirate shit

1281
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
 and Jesse going full Nancy Drew, I got you.

1282
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
 All right.

1283
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
 Yeah.

1284
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
 Of course you did.

1285
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
 Of course you fucking tracked down a porch pirate.

1286
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:11,000
 I did the police's job for them, and that is a story for another time.

1287
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
 Yeah.

1288
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,000
 JJ, you're on a ship next week?

1289
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
 Yeah.

1290
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,000
 I got on the ship the 5th, but I have really good Wi-Fi on Disney.

1291
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
 Okay.

1292
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
 I'll let you know, because I'm doing it from the ship, too.

1293
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:28,000
 So we'll both check in from our ships, and we can do your porch pirate story.

1294
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
 Yes.

1295
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
 I've got photos and video, too.

1296
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
 I documented the whole thing.

1297
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,000
 Wear your life preservers.

1298
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
 Congratulations, and make sure you have an adult hold your hand

1299
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
 when you go on the ship, okay?

1300
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
 Careful there, little one.

1301
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
 Okay.

1302
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,000
 Oh, you trying to get on the ship?

1303
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
 Oh, look at you trying to get on the ship.

1304
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
 It is a big, pretty ship, isn't it?

1305
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,000
 Where's your little guardian?

1306
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:58,000
 I work here, cunt.

1307
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:07,000
 I am the oldest person in the entertainment department on this ship.

1308
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
 Like, by 10 years.

1309
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
 Holy crap.

1310
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
 Oh, yeah.

1311
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
 The kids are on the ships.

1312
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
 Oh, yeah.

1313
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
 The kids take the ship jobs.

1314
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
 That's true.

1315
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
 Some of them are, like, 18.

1316
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,000
 Like, I saw Maleficent came out of the elevator,

1317
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,000
 and they have to stay in character, even in the crew area.

1318
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,000
 So I was backstage, and she's like, "Move out of my way, peasant."

1319
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
 And they were like, "She's 18 years old."

1320
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
 I was like, "Well, fuck."

1321
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
 What do you mean they have to stay?

1322
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
 We're going to talk more about this next time you're on.

1323
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
 They stay backstage in character?

1324
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
 What?

1325
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
 No, no.

1326
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
 Oh, yeah.

1327
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
 Oh, yeah.

1328
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
 Oh, my God.

1329
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,000
 My Loki, Maleficent, Cruella ship.

1330
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
 This is why we can't have you pop out at the end of episodes, JJ.

1331
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,000
 You're a powder keg of craziness.

1332
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
 We need you to give you a proper episode slot.

1333
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
 Disney characters on the cruise ships have to stay in characters backstage.

1334
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
 That's incredible.

1335
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
 Yes, until they get to the wig room.

1336
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
 Yep.

1337
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
 The wig room.

1338
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
 What happens in the wig room?

1339
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
 It stays in the wig room.

1340
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
 They just break down.

1341
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
 It's like, "I was mean to so many people.

1342
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,000
 I was just such a jerk."

1343
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,000
 I killed a real puppy out there.

1344
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
 I had the same character.

1345
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
 The puppy came up to my head.

1346
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
 They handed me a puppy.

1347
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
 I'm Cruella.

1348
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
 They handed me a puppy.

1349
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
 What would Cruella do if somebody handed her a puppy?

1350
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
 Make a handbag on the deck in the moment.

1351
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
 Dude, the Cruella 2, the amazing thing on Destiny is the people that are Loki, Cruella,

1352
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
 and Maleficent, there's not multiple cast.

1353
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
 It's just them.

1354
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
 So they know everything that's been said.

1355
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
 They are awesome.

1356
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
 Oh, man.

1357
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
 Wow.

1358
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
 Oh, yeah.

1359
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
 There's actually a Cruella improv show, and it's awesome.

1360
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:52,000
 It took me until just now to realize that you were saying Loki, L-O-K-I, and not Loki,

1361
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
 L-O-W-K-E-Y.

1362
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:58,000
 I was like, man, JJ is saying Loki about a lot of things.

1363
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,000
 It's Loki, Cruella, and Maleficent.

1364
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,000
 I was like, okay.

1365
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,000
 I guess they're Loki about it.

1366
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
 Loki giving Mickey a mini.

1367
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,000
 All right.

1368
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
 All the Disney life.

1369
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,000
 I'll send you the Zoom links next week, JJ.

1370
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
 Yes, yes.

1371
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:21,000
 My face won't be nearly as mobile, but I'll have fun.

1372
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
 Oh, shit.

1373
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
 All right.

1374
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
 We'll see you then.

1375
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
 See you, JJ.

1376
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
 Love you, JJ.

1377
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
 Bye.

1378
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
 All right.

1379
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
 Amazing.

1380
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
 I want to thank Smitty Scoop for her scoop pretty.

1381
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
 I want to thank Pinch Up for creating this podcast.

1382
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
 It wasn't Smitty.

1383
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
 Who was it?

1384
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
 It was...

1385
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
 Oh.

1386
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
 It was Freehold Scoop.

1387
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
 Oh, thanks, Freehold Scoop.

1388
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:50,000
 I always think Freehold Scoop and Smitty Scoop are the same person.

1389
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
 No.

1390
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
 But they're not.

1391
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
 Not at all.

1392
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
 Oh, no.

1393
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
 I don't think they are.

1394
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
 They have two different names.

1395
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,120
 Because Smitty is the Middletown Scoop.

1396
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:02,000
 Their questionnaires fuck us both in the same way, but yeah.

1397
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
 Yeah.

1398
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
 Well, I apologize.

1399
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
 I don't know what you're talking about.

1400
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,520
 I had positive 400 points.

1401
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:12,720
 I apologize to Freehold Scoop, but I kind of don't, because that really buried me.

1402
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:13,720
 That really hurt me.

1403
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:17,000
 That one did kick you right in the face.

1404
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,240
 That was my worst scooperty in a very long time.

1405
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,240
 It was.

1406
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:25,960
 I think that was our worst collective scooperty in a very long time as well.

1407
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:26,960
 Yeah.

1408
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,920
 When you start losing that hard, you just got to swing for the fences.

1409
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:29,920
 I know.

1410
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:30,920
 You just got to fucking go for it.

1411
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:31,920
 You just got to say fuck it.

1412
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:32,920
 Here we go.

1413
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:33,920
 Good money after bad.

1414
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:34,920
 Yeah.

1415
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:35,920
 Just say, "There we go.

1416
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:36,920
 Here we go.

1417
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:37,920
 Let's see."

1418
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:38,920
 Oh, by the way, if you want to send us one of those, if you want to send us a scooperty

1419
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:41,760
 or any kind of jock versus nerd, heyscoops.com.

1420
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:42,760
 Go over there.

1421
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,840
 You can send us a scooperty, any kind of jock versus nerd.

1422
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:50,000
 Also send us some scoop mail, do all those things over there at heyscoops.com.

1423
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
 All right.

1424
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
 It's a new month.

1425
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:57,160
 We haven't organized our Patreon thank yous yet, but we will get everybody thanked throughout

1426
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:58,160
 the month here.

1427
01:16:58,160 --> 01:16:59,160
 We want to thank everyone for supporting us.

1428
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:04,080
 A huge thank you to all of you for getting us over the hump onto our bonus episode spot.

1429
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,880
 Let's see if we can maintain it for February.

1430
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:06,880
 Absolutely.

1431
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:07,880
 Right.

1432
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:10,480
 We appreciate all the new scoops coming in and contributing.

1433
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:11,480
 Please keep it up.

1434
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:14,400
 We want to keep bringing you bonus episodes every month if we can.

1435
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,400
 Yeah.

1436
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:16,400
 Absolutely.

1437
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:17,400
 All right.

1438
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:20,960
 Well, thanks for, thanks for putting us in your ear holes week after week.

1439
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:26,960
 And if you want to support us as a patron, get access to some of those bonus episodes

1440
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:31,080
 and other other cool rewards, head on over to preaching fun.com.

1441
01:17:44,400 --> 01:18:04,680
 Or if you're also excited about scoop fest, Norway, head over to farts in a bag.biz that

1442
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:08,080
 along with preaching fun.com, it takes you over to our Patreon page where for as little

1443
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:11,760
 as $3 a month, you can help keep this show on the air.

1444
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:15,720
 We are dependent on our Patreon supporters, so please, if you think this show is worth

1445
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:20,560
 more than $0, preaching fun.com, farts in a bag.biz.

1446
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,040
 Those are two of the ways you can support us.

1447
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:24,080
 They're kind of the main ways you can support us.

1448
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:26,520
 Another way you can support us is you can tell people about us.

1449
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:30,160
 Spread the word, be part of the obelisk scheme.

1450
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:31,440
 We need more listeners.

1451
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:32,520
 We want more listeners.

1452
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:37,000
 We demand more listeners, but we will not stoop to doing a pyramid scheme.

1453
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
 No.

1454
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,480
 That is unethical and we will not do it.

1455
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:40,480
 Gross.

1456
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:41,480
 Awful.

1457
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:44,520
 We tell those two friends and then they each tell two friends and all that stuff.

1458
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:45,520
 That's a pyramid scheme.

1459
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,600
 We are an obelisk scheme.

1460
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,600
 One person.

1461
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:52,720
 You'll find one person that's going to really dig this show, vertical growth all the way

1462
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,000
 to the top.

1463
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,040
 Build the obelisk.

1464
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:58,320
 Tell that one person who you think is going to really dig this weird shit that we're doing

1465
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:02,640
 over here and they will then be part of it as well, then they'll tell a friend and they

1466
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,400
 will build the obelisk.

1467
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:10,640
 If everyone listening right now would simply tell one person and get one new person listening,

1468
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:13,520
 we could nearly double our listenership.

1469
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:14,520
 Almost.

1470
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:15,520
 Almost.

1471
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,520
 Almost.

1472
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,520
 Praise yourselves, everyone.

1473
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:18,520
 Paul's doing Kentucky math.

1474
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:19,520
 Again.

1475
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:25,960
 Hey, is there a store where people can go to buy our merch, Jacob?

1476
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,560
 Oh, no, no, no.

1477
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:28,560
