 San Antonio and last time I was here scoops gave us Bucky's shot glasses and
 there's one for each of you that forgot to bring home oh wow I'll bring you some
 Bucky's glasses thank you yeah I think of Bucky's do you go to Bucky's while
 you're in Texas I've been I haven't been I know it's like a statewide treasure I
 know people yeah been to Bucky's love of Bucky's and it's it's I think it's
 expanding or has expanded to Louisiana as well all I know is that when I was
 performing as hillbill I put my baseball cards into a Bucky's bag and put that out
 with a fishing pole and people really laughed at the Bucky's people love the
 Bucky's bag yeah that makes sense that makes sense Bucky's for people who don't
 know is the biggest truck stop you've ever seen in your life but it's not for
 truckers it's just for you know regular Joe's driving their little Toyota Corolla's
 up and down the street yeah so it's ridiculous yeah they've got smokers
 they've got smoke shops you can go in there yeah it's all crazy I think there's
 one supposed to open it near Las Vegas or like on the way to Las Vegas or
 something like that a lot of day scoop in the chat right now is saying supposed
 to be getting a Bucky's in Utah yeah maybe that's it yeah can't be Utah's
 ahead of Nevada on the Bucky's list man but that hurts that hurts my feelings I
 feel like you know we don't we don't have the the lottery we don't have
 Bucky's I feel like 20 years from now we're gonna be dealing with Bucky's like
 the Walmart situation like how there are no more gas stations there's just
 Bucky's it's just Bucky's yeah mm-hmm yeah oh yeah no yeah for sure oh and
 Leon Kasab is pointing out in the chat too that they are they're big Christian
 no big Christian activists as well yeah it's it's tough it's tough no I guess
 we'll just go to in and out or Domino's instead yeah you'll be fine we got we
 got a sheet slash wah-wah locked down out here in PA so ain't nobody coming for
 sheets and wah-wah I don't think holy sheets oh why the why the sheets not
 that's their current catchphrase stop it no why the why the sheets not that's
 hey hey you want to get 10 tacos for 699 why the sheets not that's terrible
 that's what that's that's what they say and they're in their chicken nuggets are
 called nuggets chicken nuggets are called schnuggets cuz that's fine but
 yeah everything's why the schnuggets makes more sense than why the sheets not
 schnuggets approved schnuggets approved no problem I'm fine with schnuggets you
 gotta explain why the sheets not because they didn't want to go with eat my
 sheets I sheets you not I sheets you not guaranteed to give you the sheets no
 bullshit yeah that'd be good Laszlo I could give two sheets I got these are all
 better than why the sheets not why does he's not because she's isn't substitute
 for the word fuck now it's yeah why is this why the shit not it is not us is
 not a phrase oh well I don't know you don't know look if you talk to my
 bundled up GI that's every day it's a sheets not it's like a Rubik's Cube no
 I'm never no I've never wanted to talk to your bowels I will tell you this one
 thing I do not suffer from is constipation that has never been an issue
 in my life ever ever Paul's Native American name is flowing river it's
 absolutely it is mud Creek unstoppable maybe it's cuz you're getting too many
 schnuggets I haven't eaten a long time haven't eaten it sheets a long time but
 I will tell you this I was betrayed by value gentlemen oh yes so we went we
 went last week to to Aldi do you guys have Aldi now in Vegas we just got it
 yeah right I haven't been yet but we and I grew up I grew up with an all day
 around me in Jersey okay so I really like Aldi our Aldi is good got some
 really great stuff and brother the value just stacks so we're going long and I'm
 grabbing some grub here and there picking out a few things and all these
 one of these places where you can put in a quarter into the bass cart and get a
 bass cart and rent the bass cart what it you just said bass cart three times what
 the fuck is a bass cart so I grew up calling them carts yeah Buggies I see I
 never call them Buggies they're called no I called them Buggies they call them
 Buggies out here okay I always called them carts or baskets yeah that's fine
 no they people out here don't know what the hell you're saying when you say
 bass cart no and people like I think I have that with the sheets with that was
 a snuggies independent film that came out in the 90s about that artist who
 drew with like maple syrup on his placemat you know what he was great my
 dad was a my dad was a grocery man I'm gonna say bass cart is probably insider
 terminology that I inherited oh I bet you it is yeah gotta be I bet you
 anything because he would you know I just I always called it a bass cart
 anyway so actually when I go shopping I don't deal with any of that okay I get
 on like a mechanic sled and I lie on my back and I walk around with like an
 Easter basket on my belly and I just shopped that way I just reach I back
 around I move around the store that's like that old Richard Simmons thing
 right of like only search shop in certain spots in the grocery store and
 this is the way to do it you get on your belly on the bound oh yeah only stuff
 you can reach from your from laying down that's the only stuff that's safe to eat
 anymore yeah so anyway I don't think I've ever heard the term bass cart
 before well but yet regional term particularly used in the Pacific
 Northwest and other areas for shopping cart or grocery cart I but it's for the
 smaller one right you're talking about no this is just saying the the big one
 the regular size was bass cart because I was accepting the notion that it was an
 insider for a different kind of cart right so you get the regular shopping
 carts and you get together get the bass carts too I know it's talking about say
 in my brain I always just conflated it to being it's a cart that has a wire
 basket on it mm-hmm right that was what that was why it was a bass cart that's
 that's what it looks like here on the of the old Google yeah so anyway nobody out
 here stealing carts or what about what about what about tiscots or tascots is
 anyone stealing those out there yes the blue and yellow ones specifically are
 gone you cannot what about my virtue someone stole it a long time ago and I've
 been looking for it ever since you're not gonna find it you're not gonna find
 it at Aldi pal what about my my pearls has anyone stole my pearls god damn you
 know I think I'm gonna try and incorporate that bit but I think it's
 gonna become more common because our power grid is gonna start failing a lot
 more often so anyway you don't have to take a cart at Aldi ah bass cart
 latter-day scoop we have a picture there it is shopping cart filled with bass
 well done bass cart for sure good job so well done well you know you don't have
 to bring a cart you can just bring your bag okay reusable bag and stick it in
 there and then take that to the checkout line and stick it back in the bag which
 what I usually do is I don't shop a ton of stuff very rarely do I use a cart you
 can also just grab they leave boxes in the front so you just grab a box oh yeah
 yeah from the product and throw stuff in a box check out and you're you know kind
 of eco-friendly save some time it's nice I like it and also people forget their
 quarter sometime and can't rent a cart so they just need to carry a box anyway
 we're shopping around and I'm like ooh it's hot dog time there's hot dogs so I
 grab some hot dogs and I'm looking at the hot dogs and they're like you know what
 time it is it's hot dog time hot dogs are maybe maybe three bucks maybe all
 right great good and then I look a fair price for a hot dog and right neck well
 for eight hot dogs I look right next to these hot dogs and there's another pack
 of hot dogs that aren't an Aldi in-house brand what how much how low would you go
 on a pack you've already gone below the number that I would once I see $3 hot
 dogs I go nope I'm done these these I believe the I believe the Aldi hot dogs
 I believe they were priced at a point where if you took those up to the cash
 year the cashier would turn around and give you three dollars along with the
 pack of hot well they should have these these boys paper these boys were 89
 cents so I was like Mike Neal said in the chat you guessed 99 cents you went
 over my friend I was like you're out according to Price is Right rules I got
 to try this I got to see what's up 89 cents let's go for how many any cheap any
 cheek just yum eight wieners 89 cents so a dime and change per hot dog yeah I
 swear to God I'm gonna get diarrhea listening to this Leon is sending the
 right gift so uh poor Lindsey so he said sexy Barry White don't don't come in
 with 11 cents like my 10 cents and change wasn't good enough math that's
 it's a change so I or 11 cents I had those in the fridge for a while we hadn't
 I hadn't gotten to crack them open yet and today yesterday it's the first of
 the month time time for the doggies to get their medicine great and the doggies
 like their medicine for the most part but one Billy Bones does not like his
 heart tick flea worm combo and he only likes his heart-tickin fleas he only
 takes it with hot dogs so we're like okay well I got these hot dogs what
 better way to test them than with the doggies so I crack them open I put a
 couple in the microwave and a sense vomit on it comes walk this way a smell
 like we have never experienced comes filling filling that cost exactly 10
 cents and change yeah and you put it in the microwave oh that's the only way I
 cook my wieners that's so gross you are a monster you are a monster person the
 only way I cook my hot dogs is microwave so the smell has infiltrated the home
 it's really it's really rough scooper Nova girl and say you are eight years
 old scooper Nova girl you are overestimate you're guessing hi so when
 you when you bought those hot dogs they're like the savings come with their
 own cost there was a monkey's paw yeah storm clouds rolled in as you got into
 your car well when I did it and gave me a look was like okay and I found this
 pack of hot dogs there were three dollars and something hot dogs oh my god
 what are we gonna do the two dollars and eleven cents we saved from buying
 regular hot dogs well and I'd say well about part of a comic book that's
 basically it next to these three dollar packs of hot dogs though there was a man
 he was his hair was all slicked back and he had on a beautiful black silk suit
 and he said Paul he knew my name he said Paul wouldn't you like to save two
 dollars and something since he was right and this is where we got old Tom Jacobi's
 hot dogs did you say Tom Jacobi he died he died ten years ago Tom no I just saw
 him today Matt you'll be happy to know that I did have my dogs I did hedge my
 bets and on the way out I also picked up a pack of five straight-up fatty big old
 what he called a bra grill dogs big bra okay you're right you don't do those in
 the microwave do you oh yeah what the fuck their cheese infused
 brats Matty cheese infused brats oh you are cheese infused brats I passed on the
 chili infused ones it is like how did you how did you pass on the if you're
 getting the cheese infused brats and putting them in the microwave Paul don't
 pass on the chili infused ones I did I pass on some anyway we start cutting up
 these wieners and I'm I have to get pieces between Bill and Ted basically
 where they call me when Paul's done I'm gonna go hey I bought it yeah I start I
 start pushing I have to push ah push the pill into the wiener meat to try and
 disguise it and then I give I give one piece with pill into the dog's mouth and
 quickly offer him a second piece no pill so that he'll wolf it all down cuz half
 the time Bill is smart he will eat the wiener around the pill and spit out the
 pill he's such a little fucker so I get his face Paul leave his face and I've
 had Botox this is all right let me tell you so much emotion coming through Matt
 Donnelly's face here's the problem through a chemical that numbs skin and
 nerves bill spit out so many pieces that I had to go in for more hot dogs I had
 to renew a couple more hot dogs is it possible that Bill also hates your
 fucking new the second the second now he loves them this is the thing I was like
 and these things think so bad that the dogs are gonna go crazy hot dogs it
 makes me fart like makes that already gets it going yeah Matt Matt Matt
 microwave hot dogs I mean do you boil water and boil them on the stove is that
 your move grill them like a human being grill them where am I gonna grill a hot
 oh like on a pan no that's a lot of stuff barbecue grill man that's a lot of
 work no thank you nothing easier than grilling a barbecue I would argue putting
 a putting a hot dog into the microwave for a minute is far easier Paul Paul let
 me let me help you out here buddy let me help you out go to Walmart today get you
 a George Foreman grill and just be done with life no these are gross I would
 accept the George Foreman grill from you right now I'm not I'm not gonna accept
 the hot dog in the microwave it's a meat skin issue yes what's it what you don't
 like what happens on the tech you're seeing should be crispy well it gets
 crispy sometimes no that's impossible in the microwave nope you're lying to
 yourself but you're talking to a guy who loves the texture of pudding skin so
 that's kind of what I've got with the microwave wiener if that's your level
 of crunch I want to bite into a hot dog with crunch gross you're a Nathan's guy
 huh yeah yeah no fuck that shit I don't like me yeah I pay a whole 389 at Aldi's
 for a Nathan's hot dog you like you like you like a natural casing do you also
 use lambskin condoms is that how you roll I only I only eat lambskin condoms
 yeah but off you go grill you go to go to Aldi buy some lambskin condoms go to
 IKEA and fill it with a bunch of meatballs and I empty all the meatballs
 full of like a meatball I stuff stuff a brat into a lambskin condom and I double
 grill yeah it's like that's how you get that extra crisp it's like a twice baked
 potato yeah that'd be more like a jacketed potato right so so I get this
 wiener and I'm breaking up the pieces of it and this is the second time it's been
 in the microwave a sec in the chat for a scoop fest refund and is like and is
 like dear God we had to turn the fan on on the window to blow air out of the
 house because it was so stank it was awful and then so I've been I've been
 cutting up and squishing all these wieners and this is this is how you know
 it's bad wieners again this is how you know it's bad I threw away what was left
 I threw away the other four wieners you threw away you threw a 44 cents worth of
 wieners I never throw away food I don't throw away stuff I don't I rarely do
 these were so bad I was like fuck this I can't I can't possibly but finally got
 microwave his wieners maddingly found the bridge too far I finally got that
 fucking gift from I think you should leave is so good so uh I finally got
 bill to take all his pill finally got all of it done everybody ain't there at
 what cost meat torturing your dog I'll tell you I'll tell you what the cost was
 the cost was the unmistakable stench of a dead cows penis on my hands after four
 washings it was still there it smelled like from under cheese at the circus it
 was so fucking bad this thing I don't like the stink on my fingers would not
 I put dawn soap on it I put all kinds of soft soap on it I I contemplated giving
 my fingers an Epson salt bath because it was that how it permeated my flesh look
 Paul do you guys buy sponges do you have sponges in your kitchen I do have
 sponges yeah you get the sponges with the rough side on the back of it mm-hmm
 get those put a little bit of dish soap on it and use that scrubby side to scrub
 your hands I mean and you have to like you have to really scrub into it but
 that's that's how I get like it would sit on your hands did you let the dawn
 liquid sit on your hands did I let it sit on my hand oh did you soak your
 hands and like dish wash oh remember remember the palm olive when you would
 soak your hands in it remember that yeah who yeah that's that was a thing that
 ladies did Paul I figured out who made your hot dogs who Al Qaeda Al Qaeda
 made your hot dogs Al Qaeda Al Qaeda hot dogs everybody loves I'll have Al Qaeda
 Al Qaeda hot dogs serve me up a wiener from Osama somewhere in a cave there are
 people celebrating the victory of selling those hot dogs and getting the
 permeate an American household here's the thing and my investigative journalist
 wife and we're going to collapse them from within she quickly she quickly
 while she sat on the couch many feet away from the kitchen smelling the
 death end trails she went ahead and jumped online to find out what is going
 on with these wieners and she found a reddit a reddit thread apparently they
 changed the recipe on these just like two months ago all right everybody is
 like dear god what is this this is not a hot dog this is the
 smelling it is the nastiest thing people were like I've been buying these for a
 long time now they're really disgusting we looked on the ingredients there were
 all these weird our hot dogs will fly a plane right into your taste buds they
 really did the secret ingredient is cat shit says fro-yog and he's right it was
 nasty there's all like cumin and lots of powders and I don't I don't know like
 for a while it was like chicken and beef for the top ingredients they're not
 anymore oh god yes he looked at the ingredients after he was done yeah well
 I didn't eat any well and dared me to eat a little bite night a little bite
 it was so nasty when was the last time you purchased something from a grocery
 store that your wife then had to dare you to eat or cause her to me they get
 on reddit to figure out what was going on when I've been into it I chewed up a
 little bit it was like it's like kind of like a falafel meat if it had been on a
 New York sidewalk for a couple days like a gyro you mean yeah like a gyro but
 like really like I'm like somebody stepped on this here gyro this big cut
 like the gyros that would come with it would just be like the weird gray meat
 you never you never quite knew where it came from yes yes yeah yeah yeah just a
 rotating pile of something yeah so it was it was bad and and she was looking up
 all these different people saying oh god these these hot dogs just are are the
 nastiest thing I've ever eaten this is gross I don't know what's going on with
 this and then the kicker was she looked on the on the bag to find out what the
 branding and everything it's an all the in-house thing but she saw on the
 packaging it says explicitly do not recycle this plastic I've seen labels
 that says hey this plastic is not recyclable no but this one was like
 warning what did it say why I can tell you my theory okay it's contaminated
 there's something horribly wrong with it oh anyway it was really gross it was
 really really bad oh I just did a search on our new Aldi hot dogs good is oh yeah
 search that okay yeah one of the lines is people have had experience with bad
 experiences with recent quality issues like the hot dogs being too greasy okay
 too small okay or leaking what a horrible adjective leaking the hot dogs
 are leaking people hot dogs al-qaeda hot dogs the leakiest wiener you can buy mom
 well call the cops the hot dogs are leaking the hot dogs are leaking put your
 thumb in it I mean this is sort of canary in the coal mine times though
 guys we're on the front we're on the front lines of do not give those hot dogs
 to any canary very very oh there's they're probably ten percent canary very
 relaxed FDA guidelines at this point you know our food safety is gonna go rid of
 red dye number five or whatever sure we are sure we are and replacing it with
 important important asbestos from Russia pureed sea turtle yeah you know the
 leaky hot dog lately that's the following sponsor today's show Matt and

 scoop that's who submitted this okay November of 2024 good it's Jacob's
 guides to taking notes on how things are sexy but not sexual how young is too
 young to make this distinction I don't know the last I don't the tagline to at
 all hey listen no hundred percent this is what it is what it is is bananas
 I'm talking about bananas now they're sexy right they're not sexual I mean you
 could use them but I wouldn't but they're kind of sexy right but how young
 is too young green green means too young if there's green on a manner don't play
 ball that's all you gotta do that's that's simple rule just stay away from
 green manners also leaky wieners stay away from green manners and leaky
 winners mean to too young too young I mean I'm an old grandpappy pappy van
 Winkleman so give me my old man on drinks I want my old all my drinks should
 be named after very old gentleman mmm all I want in my mouth is elderly men

 terrible terrible uncle Arthur those are my favorite one terrible uncle Arthur's

 they don't have any they just leave it out in a bucket in a very thin very
 shallow bucket terrible uncle Arthur's awful tantrums or something like that
 it's called I can't remember exactly how phrased it uncle Arthur's terrible
 tantrums whiskey go ahead and get some of that what it's basically they put it

 check out you put those bananas lambskin condoms crispy I wouldn't saw the Wizard
 of Oz at the sphere last night we should have been sled with that we
 shouldn't talked about hot dogs for the a block you know what you know what I
 just gave you 20 minutes of gold from a fucking rotten pig's asshole shut up
 liquid fire shit gold is what you gave me make Wizard of Oz the a block but
 then we fell into this pile of gold and I can tell you this Judy Garland doesn't
 microwave up half as nice as an Aldi wiener that is true you take that she's
 real stinky you take that back you'd have to spare as my Judy holy shit the
 sphere is still amazing yeah the sphere remains amazing they I I think they
 might have found their thing I think they might have found their thing that's
 gonna make money every day when they don't have concerts in that building
 just reboot movies all right specifically this one this is okay so
 it's so weird so it's not the whole movie they have they have taken the
 movie they have edited out big chunks of it so the whole thing is only like 70
 minutes I think huh I think I think the whole movie about 70 minutes they've
 used you know there's a ton of AI there's a ton of processing there's all
 these things because basically they're taking all the scenes that are zoomed in
 so like if you if you're zoomed in on any M for instance in one scene where
 she's standing in a room talking to people you don't just see her zoomed in
 you see the whole room of filled with filled with like whoever's in the room
 that she's talking to got it so they they took things from the movie they
 took implications from the movie and expanded those out and fleshed those
 out it was really neat a lot of AI stuff a lot of a fit not a lot but a fair
 amount of background characters I don't know how you guys are watching movie and
 TV scenes with big groups of people I find myself always watching the extras I
 think we've talked about this before Oh no I there are little people I only look
 at the stars watch your watch your mouth there there please there no but little
 people is the right thing to say yeah yeah guys eat all the hot dogs you
 fuckers oh no no eat shit it's better for you that's it that's the new curse
 all the hot dogs upon your house Oh God the worst thing your house will be
 uninhabitable it'll smell too bad yeah no I look at background characters in
 fact that's actually my kids will do that too and they actually did over
 their own grandmother and numerous scenes because they realized that back
 when my my mother-in-law was doing a bunch of background work all the time
 right up in the background of some of their favorite shows and she'd forgotten
 she'd done that show or something it's very yeah she had forgotten that she had
 animated herself into spongebob squarepants she was an extra on it so
 this is where they're using you know whatever AI technology CGI technology
 to create you know larger groups that fill the whole screen and stuff like
 that right that's right and they're making a whole new scenes and intro
 scenes like when the when the house lands in Oz instead of just opening like
 in the in the movie Dorothy opens the door to the to the house that just
 landed and she walks out into Oz she walks out into Munchkin land in this
 there's the whole storm scene and by the way they've got you know huge wind
 machines and snow and all kinds of shit falls on you and the chairs vibrate and
 it's the whole 4d experience but on a 20,000 seat scale instead of 100 seat
 scale at the at the fair or whatever so it's really all this stuff they they
 start the movie after Dorothy has already interacted with Mrs. Gulch with
 the witch so like they start the movie a good 15 minutes in basically they start
 the movie about two minutes before she's seeing somewhere over the rainbow mm-hmm
 so I mean they just skipped through a lot of stuff but I mean it is it is neat
 and there it was full 20,000 people in there or however many people they have
 is their occupancy for the for the movie stuff well it's already it was like you
 know it's it's doing the number one tourism thing which is people plan trips
 around coming out to see it right and apparently we were talking to a buddy of
 mine who's one of the people who run the show over there he was saying they've
 already sold over 400,000 tickets geez Lord yeah so like they're just yeah I
 mean cuz we went to the show last night that was their that's every Raiders
 that's every Raiders game for the season 400,000 yeah close yeah close to right
 right that ballpark yeah for sure well I'll tell you what's encouraging to me
 is seeing is seeing so many of my local friends getting acting work inside yeah
 the theater as extras and sort of like guests and hosts and all that kind of
 thing yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah bunch of people a bunch of people I
 know are working yeah I was like wow like Marcus is there and yeah I saw a
 picture I was like this is just like a who's who of people I've worked with in
 the past this is cool yeah yeah so well it eliminates all these other shows and
 jobs nice that they picked up our friends on the way which is good that's
 right well I mean we did talk about that last night we talked about that with with
 a friend of ours James last night he was like oh no one of the guys running the
 show he was like all these great shows in town and we're just selling fuck tons
 of tickets I know it's hurting the other shows in town yeah yeah I was like yeah
 it's true but I mean it's also part of it you know it's it's Vegas goes through
 changes and that's the song we all think of when we hear changes and you know
 like every shows every every casino is never production show right right like
 used to have some kind of big big show that had song song and dance and you'd
 have five every song every casino hired 50 dancers and sure just went away they
 dance on the deco the Titanic while it sank that's right that's when that last
 the longest Jubilee right yeah but but everybody you know even the pen and
 teller theater the Rio used to have a production show in there and that's why
 it's like such a big backstage area for Penn and Teller it's because it always
 used to be also they used to also split it with dance with a dance team yeah so
 it's it's you know it is interesting that like you know Cirque du Soleil has
 been open for you know 30 40 years right in this town right and and so you know
 it's interesting that like a literal Death Star got built in the middle of
 the strip and you're like oh no but that's a license they still haven't
 gotten they still haven't been able to just make themselves into the Death Star
 and this is when you're talking about the way you're talking about this very
 experience this this was Star Trek this is Star Trek the experience oh yeah yeah
 especially I mean the dome was what they built you in the I don't know you went
 to that listen motherfucker they built the dome for the original Klingon
 encounter which worked with the this the actual motion ride carts all right the
 vehicles and then when they put in 4d only the ending of that was a theatrical
 4d experience but it had seats that would poke you in the ass and squirt you
 with water and shoot you with air and stuff oh dude I mean it didn't have the
 dick-sucking alien like I would propose we're getting there we're getting there
 eventually every day we're a little bit closer to that dick-sucking alien did you
 see it happened at the corn concert did you see it see what specifically there
 was a guy at a corn concert up in the up in the nosebleeds jacking it during going
 at it during this is going whole hog turn the show and a bunch of people like
 hey dude knock it off and he's like no I'm getting there like he went he went
 to completion on him he didn't give a damn yeah so like the last corn that's
 hurt is the second nastiest thing that's been discussed on this show today that is
 horrible so I didn't know I didn't know Lucy K liked corn everybody likes corn
 Matt all right they're hard to digest though okay so all right Vegas politics
 and entertainment see change and all that stuff aside yes let's get it what's
 getting the actual experience of going to see Wizard of Oz we get that they
 open the doors I think 45 minutes early so we get there they have decked out
 well they've added a whole bunch of stuff to the lobby so there's all new
 LEDs and all there's a mini sphere in the lobby that people in the zoom chat
 just saw a minute ago so they do all kinds of Wizard of Oz scenes on that
 after the movie is over that's when they do a live performance they do they do
 live performance afterwards you get to like interact with the wizard they've
 got a huge hologram an interactive hologram of the wizard that that appears
 out in the lobby and sorry Jacob breaking news we're getting updates in
 the chat about the guy jerking off with the corn concert turns out people were
 punching him in the back of the head and trying to turn to basically stop him
 they were trying to stop him I don't think they stopped him what they didn't
 realize was featuring out a bug to the guy jacket like he's like he loves a
 good donkey punch he's like oh yeah no don't hit me no
 please so much human contact certainly won't put me over the edge so was Darren
 the the wizard when you were there Darren was not the wizard when I was
 there but our friend James Simpson was oh he was the the guard the the you know
 you can't see the wizard nobody sees the wizard not nobody I know how that James
 is the used to work at 50 shades right yes yeah yeah yeah you know James yeah
 he's good guy very good yeah we even got we even got a special little just us
 picture with with James and the wizard in their costumes oh that's awesome yeah
 it's on SJ's phone or I'd show it to you James will James knows everyone
 everyone knows yes yes he is one of those work horses for Vegas that's right
 in like every show yes that's right so we were there it is so what I want to
 talk about it's so weird to watch a movie that assumes that everyone has not
 only already seen that movie but that everyone is very familiar with it yeah
 yeah yeah so like like I said earlier like the movie doesn't start with all
 of the setup that the that the real movie starts with it doesn't start with
 you're getting to know the characters it doesn't they're like you know these
 characters we all know that you know these characters we're gonna skip over
 this part we're not gonna have this 20 minutes in the movie where we get to
 know Dorothy and Annie and Uncle Henry and all these people but you don't need
 to know that you know who these people are we're going straight over the
 rainbow she's gonna do the over the rainbow then pretty quickly after that
 we're gonna see Gulch she's gonna be there trying to take the dog dogs gonna
 get away and we're going to Oz so like 10 minutes in their defense we're there
 you have done you have like 80 years to see the original version you know I'm
 not really I'm not criticizing it but it is the first time I've ever seen
 something that assumes that you already know the full story of the thing that
 you're watching well the ruby slippers are still the number one most valuable
 movie prop in existence oh they have to be they are I'd be I'd be surprised if
 anything else was close to it well I think they might get usurped soon possibly
 depends on what I just saw that by what Jacob what do you think is gonna get you
 serpent go ahead oh okay I think it'll be the giant robot from Pacific Rim Luke
 Skywalker's lightsaber handle yeah you're closer there Matt yeah it's an
 original screen used Vader lightsaber that is going up for sale yeah Leon
 Casab says that rosebud is the number two most expensive prop yes found in
 the trash that that makes sense too yeah was we don't want to any spoilers for
 Citizen Kane to anyone has not yet seen Citizen Kane go ahead fast forward about
 15 seconds while we do all the spoilers for Citizen Kane yeah I think the the
 next sphere show so make sure you bone up on it I think Leon absolutely no
 kidding around go to the sphere to watch this again oh that'd be amazing actually
 I'd do that today that'd be great maybe they'll get that that'd be really cool
 it would be really good they could do a lot of crazy shit with Citizen Kane so
 watching this movie with the assumption watching a watching a movie play that is
 assuming that I don't need to get any information from the movie is a weird
 experience already and then watching a movie that I have seen I mean who knows
 how many times I've seen the Wizard of Oz in my life I mean probably hundreds
 if not thousands of times back when we were kids it was on TV at least once a
 course yeah and I would watch it all the time is a big on TV yeah I've embarrassed
 my mom by saying this before but my mom did famously asked me one time a few
 years ago when they colorized the the middle part of Wizard of Oz oh my and I
 had to break it to her that they had not colorized it they that's how the movie
 had been made it was the first part in sepia and second part in color she said
 oh no no no when I was a little girl it was all in black and white mm-hmm and I
 said mom no no no when she was watching it she was watching it at her home on a
 black and white television exactly so it was all black and white just only for
 her oh people who watch it on black and white TVs I was like now you were
 watching at the black just you just be the family be carving up the recently
 microwaved hot dog and they'd watch it watch it over at the old black and white
 TV thanksgiving Matt they never had the luxury of microwaved hot dogs in the
 50s I didn't know the joys of the pudding just give a mental spirit through
 it and put two lighters on both ends they did do that shit they fucking would
 fork it and cook it like that all crazy that crazy remember did you ever see
 that one and cooked hot dog over a fire still sounds better than microwaved hot
 dog sure did you ever see that hot dog cooker that you could put in your car
 yes see that shit yeah it plugged into the fucking lighter and you could cook
 hot dogs in your car like a monster now that's as good as the booze fridges
 though the booze fridges that were built into the car boy oh boy those were the
 days you get like the the refrigerator built into the glove compartment and
 shit yeah oh so good this is where you keep your martini shaker while you're
 in the car they had that they had booze fridges hot dog cookers yeah places
 where you could shit and smoke prostitute prostitute dumpers old cars
 had it all man well it was just the trunk yeah well I'll mean but it was
 sold as a prostitute dumper nobody nobody carried trunks back then yeah they
 didn't call it the trunk they called it the prostitute dumper yeah we call it
 the trunk before I take it for a test drive how many gallons is this
 prostitute dumper oh this is an 80 gallon prostitute dumper all right that's a lot
 of prostitute dumper in there so I can get probably what three prostitutes in
 there oh four four petite ones four petite prostitutes before I have to take
 her in for servicing absolutely sir all right all right I'll take it good sir
 you won't be you won't be disappointed and because you got it today just after
 Labor Day I'm gonna throw in two prostitutes in the prostitute dumper free
 of charge Wow prostitutes get the dumper start the hot dog machine and grab
 yourself a cold seltzer oh I love seltzer well I have some cold seltzer in
 my booze cabinet but only the seltzer is for the prostitutes toots don't get
 booze no booze for toots no booze for toots no booze for toots
 toots in the boot that's what the UK it's called the boots called the toot boot
 oh I'll tell you who else has put prostitutes in the boot of the car not
 in the trunk just in the prostitute dump and that's the following sponsor
 today's show is brought to you by hey poops calm horse laxatives ha why poops

 filly step oh good god Wilbur I'm tired of my trainers reaching in feet deep
 with their gloved arms and grabbing at whatever remains inside my digestive
 tract I've had full full bales of hay pulled undigested from my lower colon
 and that's the game I don't want to play anymore no this old sway back needs
 himself some help getting his sway back if you know what I mean so give me some
 of that laxative that's maxitive give me some of that poop firing inspiring dump
 building no killden fart producing lumpy horse juicing yeah I need me some of

 oh oh no oh I took a double dose and I've prolapsed oh no help me sir you
 have to leave the studio now well come on let me stay my anus is hanging out
 here like an Aldi hot dog yeah that is part of the reason I need you to leave
 you smell almost as bad as a microwaved Aldi hot dog look I've got a bag for it
 oh oh that's fine then I bring this I bring this bag and bass cart to tote
 around my prolapsed anus
 you know people come to me after listening to this show and they say how
 do you guys come up with all this material you guys have writing meetings
 and sit around and really really come up with different ideas and really workshop
 them and everything I go no we actually come up with everything right there on
 the fly we just we just go through and we talk about stuff and we have
 conversations and sometimes it takes us to fun places like a horse a talking
 horse with a prolapsed anus we don't we don't think about that at all before the
 show starts that's just what comes up but it's all we'll think about after no
 no still the second most disgusting thing said on this show today basically got a
 radio flyer wagon designed specifically to carry my anus. How do you carry your anus?
 I carry mine in a red radio flyer wagon. Thank you radio flyer. What I like about the
 radio flyer is the color match the color match is pretty good for my anus. It turns out my anus is the exact shade of red as a radio flyer wagon.
 It's fairly it's fairly unobtrusive and people who don't know wouldn't wouldn't
 even know it's like I'm not wearing anything at all. It's very inconspicuous. Wizard of Oz thumbs up worth
 going very expensive expensive but but a fun ticket and definitely a different
 experience than anything I've seen I think anywhere before right yeah yeah
 it's a crazy thing it's a crazy thing for sure so you thought you think they're
 just gonna like well I mean I guess they're gonna keep cranking that one is
 there is it an indefinite run I think so yeah yeah I think it'll run until people
 stop buying thousands of tickets for it I actually know it's not even fully
 finished that's true they're still adding they're still gonna be adding more
 things to it yeah and they're selling stuff is there a merch thing associated oh
 definitely oh I got a shirt I got a Wizard of Oz shirt for sure yeah you know
 me and my merch laughs at me every time we go to a concert or something Jacob
 will go by the merch is it a is it specifically sphere themed there's one
 t-shirt where you it says you putting a pill into a hot dog meat for Toto mm-hmm
 yeah that in there Oh Toto oh if you don't eat this pill you'll get fleas
 and ticks I know it makes my hands smell like the underside of a hobo's rectum
 but please just have it just the underside yes the underside of the
 uncovered underside of the whole underside of a hobo's rectum yes it
 smells like dandelions and her hey scoops check out yeah yeah not finished
 winter scoop is it's what they're calling it's in its edging phase it's in
 that's right the Wizard of Oz I also ran into a friend of mine we went to the
 sphere with our cousins who were in town and they were laughing at us
 actually the same thing that we were talking about with James earlier they
 were like holy shit is it fun going out to entertainment things with Jacob and
 SJ because we just see people that we know the entire time of course so one
 of the people that we ran into was the artistic director from over at the new
 area 15 Universal Horror Nights and yeah so she like they've just gotten opened
 over there they're cranking it out I think they're still gonna make some
 changes over there I don't think they're done just like the sphere so I mean it
 is that that gives me a little bit of hope when we're talking about the the
 entertainment jobs going away and yeah oh yeah there's all there's old stuff
 that's that's getting hurt but there's always new stuff coming in as well so
 it's it's always a fun thing it's funny that you mentioned that getting going
 around getting recognized and being the gad about that she is and working in all
 these coffee shops she is also becoming like well-renowned we went sure we went
 to the Thai place for lunch yesterday she goes in the first time you up my
 name's Anne the first person to see this is a former employee of hers and they're
 having a nice sweet conversation the whole time and then as she's walking we're
 walking us to a table a longtime customer says oh hey I thought that was

 sucking egg smell over the
 explosion of nuked meats I'm gonna tell you right now I had a whole other jock
 versus nerd picked out today I changed it over to this one once we start talking
 about the hot dogs okay this is from Leon Kassab good afternoon gentlemen
 here is my brand new Mikey style quiz oh that I am entitled real or fake food
 brands okay I was inspired by another podcast I listened to that will
 occasionally cover press releases for new products from food change chains it
 is an endless well of what the fuck I think it could be nicely modified into a
 Mikey style quiz rules are simple is this food item real or fake I will
 provide a description that has come directly out of a press release or news
 story on the product or description that I made up you know how it works I'm
 pretty proud of this one enjoy so as Leon and Leon is happy with this one so
 I'm gonna give you a food description you're gonna tell me if it's real or
 fake okay Pizza Hut the world's largest pizza company is bringing together two
 of America's most popular treats Paul pizza and hot dogs in the form of its
 all-new hot dog bites pizza the American rendition of the popular global pie
 features 28 premium mini hot dog bites baked into the crust and is served with
 a side of French's mustard is this real or fake it goes to me sure yeah it's
 real Paul says real Matt I agree I agree it's real we are committed to
 bringing more flavor and fun to the pizza category than anyone else and our
 new hot dog bites pizza is an absolutely epic flavor mashup inspired by two of
 America's favorite foods says Jared drink water vice president of marketing
 at Pizza Hut last year Americans ate an estimated 150 million hot dogs over the
 July 4th holiday we've taken the appropriate steps to notify the national
 sausage and hot dog council that they will need to adjust their statistics for
 2015 thanks to Pizza Hut's induction into hot dog bites pizza
 that's horrible someone in the chats as they ate it and did not enjoy it really
 interesting that's the person who didn't enjoy that first thing I think of when I
 think of pizza is hot dog all right we got one to one tie right now Matt you're
 up first on this one and oh good news Matt it's Starbucks somebody says hot dog
 I say now that's Italian so as you saw from the first one these are from all
 they're not necessarily present so the the hot dog pizza with hot dogs hot dogs
 on the pizza possible he got a pretty good idea Jimmy why don't we try to Jimmy Matt is
 Starbucks gravy latte real or fake description this holiday season Starbucks
 is introducing the Thanksgiving latte a savory beverage combining rich turkey
 breast broth with steamed milk top sage infused foam pair it with your favorite
 pie slice for the ultimate festive and dull pie slice as you know I get the
 fuck out of here as we know Starbucks sits around and just daydreams about
 women in giant SUVs sitting at a drive-thru for 20 minutes and that's
 right and pulling out something that has a specific color and so this fits
 none of those categories and so I'm going to say false false fakeity fake I
 will say they do some stupid shit in the name of capitalist chicanery that fucking
 CEO that came in a while back and he knew a guy who knew a guy who had a fuck
 ton of olive oil they started putting olive oil and some of the lattes like
 that was a thing like anybody ever put this fucking stupid not a thing but they
 actually actually rolled that out sold lattes with olive oil in it get the fuck
 out of here but no there's no way there's gravy fucking coffee no they are
 doing protein foam which is close to gravy I make some of that at home I make
 my home protein foam double crisp double crisp the protein foam that means that
 is fake it is still tied two to two the holiday special number three for you
 Paul okay scoffee cup from KFC scoffee cup scoffee S C O F F E E cup from KFC
 okay have you ever desired a sweet snack while you're drowning that morning coffee
 on the run but really can't afford to use your other hand to hold it well
 Kentucky Fried Chicken has a game-changer for you and the fast food
 chain is pushing the limits of what we consider a beverage container with its
 latest announcement it's called the scoffee cup an edible cup made out of a
 wafer biscuit wrapped in sugar paper and lined with a heat resistant white
 chocolate no phony baloney Paul says phony baloney Matt I sure baloney phony
 let's go for it I would drink this the answer it's real
 shut the fuck up what if our customers occasionally like to have their cake and
 eat it why wouldn't we want them to have their cup and eat it instead that's from
 KFC spokeswoman Jocelyn Boney maybe told the USA Today the cups also feature
 aromas and come with the scents coconut sun cream and freshly cut grass the
 those last few descriptions are disgusting but that is a lawsuit waiting
 to happen I don't they've rolled it out nationally though I don't feel like I
 think it's not I've never seen that in my neighborhood yeah I don't know I don't
 know if that's a current thing or a past thing I think that thing failed
 miserably well it's so Leon Casaba saying it's British he wrote this thing
 so there you go but that makes sense now thinking about it as it's a scone cup
 it's not scoffy that does make sense right it's pot scone pot cup in it it I
 love me a cup I love me a scone why not eat the both of the same thing governor
 give me scoff a scoffy it's probably pronounced scoffy oh did I mess you up
 Paul I'm sorry tonight yes when you say scoffy I was like scoffing at their
 customers no I don't Paul will continue this game of jock versus nerd under
 protest I don't give up number four the nightmare King sandwich from Burger King
 math is for you Burger King says its new sandwich is clinically proven to induce
 nightmares in time for Halloween the fast foods change chains Nightmare King
 is available through November 1st at participating locations nationwide this
 spooky sandwich features a quarter pound of flame grilled meat a white meat
 crispy chicken fillet melted American cheese thick cut bacon creamy mayonnaise
 and onions on a glazed green sesame seed bun true Matt says true Paul what do you
 think true it is true according to previous studies four percent of the
 population experiences nightmares on any given night says dr. Bob the lead study
 Bob and oh I guess they really did a study after eating the Nightmare King
 the data obtained from the study indicated that the incidence of
 nightmares increased by 3.5 times after eating that said I believe you I is the
 nightmare diarrhea latter-day scoop yes is this always the nightmare is this
 some fucking CIA shit what is going on here this is CIA shit yeah MK ultra yeah

 America's favorite 100% real cheese snack into one portable box chef
 delonis senior marketing director for Kellogg's US snacks division many of our
 fans were already exploring pairing different wines with cheese it's just
 like wine and cheese you can build you can compare real cheese inside each
 cheese it flavor with the perfect wine complement and find a pair to enjoy all
 summer long so these cheese it in this box wine company are trying to break

 selling that on the princess cruises it's a real deal I don't see we got let's
 do one more here captain crunch delights from Taco Bell this item is Taco Bell's
 first variation on Cinnabon delights a cream filled donut hole reminiscent of
 Cinnabon's cinnamon rolls the new cat and crunch delights are a donut hole
 version of a bowl of cat and crunch berry cereal with milk the pastry evokes
 a giant crunch berry with the familiar flaming pink color not found in nature
 the cream filling represents sweet cereal milk and the pastry is rolled in
 a coating of crushed cat and crunch cereal yeah I know whatever it is it
 sounds super healthy well I don't if this is this supposed to be ad copy or just
 yeah that would be their ad copy or their their press release but they
 wouldn't say they wouldn't say not found in nature I don't think oh interesting
 that's my and my other thought is Cinnabon having the the name of that
 stuff like they're not gonna share that with another company unless they're owned
 by the same parent company which I don't know they could be because there's only
 like four companies but I'm good is it my guess no it's Matt's guess okay but
 you're doing great yeah Paul give me a lot of help there I'm gonna guess fake
 yeah Paul I to say fake Matt you got you got Paul the answer is real oh shit I
 should have called it I agree with Paul the rest of the way yeah the new
 breakfast item went into test Tuesday at units in Bakersfield California and aims
 to bring back sugary childhood memories of Captain Crunch's crunch berry cereal
 it's a nostalgic throwback brand from when you were a kid said Amanda Clark
 Taco Bell's senior director of marketing we feel like it will appeal to what we
 call kiddults or the kid adults out there about what the hell what the hell kind of
 person would that be what do they mean what could they possibly be talking
 about kiddult that whatever whatever that sounds like some made-up bullshit
 that sounds like some kiddult get the fuck the fuck you talking about that's
 that's bullshit craziness we got two more to do here let's let's wrap them
 up Gatorade pickle punch Paul oh god description hydration meets brine with
 pickle punch a new limited edition Gatorade flavor formulated for athletes
 who swear by pickle juice for cramps electrolytes combined with zesty dill in
 this bold refreshment man Gatorade pickle punch being out here in the Berg
 everything gets pickled up okay they have a fucking pickle festival
 pickles Berg they call it pickles Berg sure everybody puts pickle on everything
 everything is pickle nobody puts pickle in the corner limited edition Gatorade
 pickle I must say I don't know that's gonna be nasty tasting I'm gonna say no
 just cuz I think it's nasty and Paul thinks it's nasty so he thinks it
 doesn't exist Matt true it is false now we got exciting now we're decked down to
 a nail biter going only up by one right the last question last question this one
 goes to Matt first tostinos salsa cereal there is no better snack duo on game day
 tostinos chips and salsa appearing so beloved that even diehard football fans
 are willing to take their eyes off the game to get the perfect bite but this
 season tostinos and legendary wide receiver Julian Edelman are changing the
 game and introducing the most creative way to snack tostinos salsa cereal for
 those asking themselves what salsa cereal is it's exactly what it sounds
 like eating chips and salsa with a bowl and a spoon it's a clever twist on the
 classic chips and salsa pairing that has been a game day staple for decades but
 makes it easier than ever for football fans to enjoy the game without ever
 needing to miss a second of the action plus milk plus milk what the fuck
 Matt you're up first false tostinos salsa cereal false in Matt's opinion Paul
 I'll tell you what gamesmanship and the only other thing is they included the
 name of a player that could just be nobody could have included the name of
 an NFL player without it being real no I got a gamesmanship I gotta I gotta true
 it are you going true I have to to games true on the salsa cereal because this is
 me and Matt oh I guess you're right I guess that is the right games play to
 make I have to he guessed false I gotta guess true that's true yeah yeah so it
 is it is the right gameplay move to make and and real honestly the use of the
 name of a player they don't you know there you go now they don't just throw
 names you don't have players around like that like there's nothing that's true
 that is true it's real Paul is right oh my god disgusting
 horrific game day staples tostinos chips and salsa have always gone hand-in-hand
 with watching football said Leslie Vesper vice president of marketing
 PepsiCo foods North America salsa cereal is the latest way we're bringing fans
 new experiences to enjoy the game and snacks to go with it no no god damn it
 no not interested Leslie Vesper not interested that's horrific that is
 horrific but I knew it as soon as they grabbed a player name barf doesn't make
 sense that that logic doesn't make sense I mean you were correct and I'm wrong
 but it's very easy to write a player's name into a fake thing but Matt we have
 discussed this many many times I get to the right answer the wrong way all the
 time oh Jesus there it is look see it's got his face in the chat
 Julian Edelman's salsa cereal oh my gross that's gross how turned on I am by
 it yeah see it's the corn concert don't hit me in the back of the head but
 that's the big thing right now is having these players and people you know do
 these big collabos yeah there was some person it's happening now to me to the
 point where because I'm unloading all these boxes of shit and there's a some
 cereal that's coming out with some music person I'm like I have never heard of
 this person I am a thousand years old oh I discovered something this week
 completely unrelated anything else I've discovered the thing that I think makes
 me feel the oldest what is it you guys have anything that when you see it it
 just it just immediately makes you feel old young people for working working
 knees for me I believe it is the genre k-pop oh I see or hear a k-pop music I
 just got fuck I'm old yeah yeah cuz I'll tell you cuz I like more j-pop I don't
 really know anything about k-pop I know some j-pop k-pop besides black pink I'm
 at a loss I like I see pop I see pops are delicious what's your favorite
 flavor cherry for now until RFK jr. takes it away
