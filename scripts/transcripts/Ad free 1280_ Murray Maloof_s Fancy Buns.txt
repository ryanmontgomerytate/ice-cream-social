 last night using okay using the smash
 that jacob sent me a link for uh last time we brought up making burgers i was uh can't smashing
 can't smashing some burgers for my kids and my youngest likes himself a pretzel bun so i get like
 a fancy i get like nice pretzel buns from the uh from from a supermarket and then youngest has
 excellent taste so then i get like a nice like kind of like a brioche style bun for my other
 kid who doesn't like pretzel buns he normally just takes a regular hamburger regular just
 usually gets a regular hamburger and then he gets a regular hamburger and then he gets a regular hamburger
 bun but he's the only one eating it so i'll buy like a roll you know and um and he's eating it and
 i said uh you don't you don't like the fancy bun do you and he goes dad i'm an american
 there it is i want no fucking brioche bun
 ah
 mm-hmm
 my i demand that my bread have a clown on it
 wonder has to be in the title it has to be just the most bleached i need it yeah i need to be
 so preserved yes like mold cannot grow on it no i want my hamburger bun to have been made in 1987
 ah i wanted to have been sitting that's when they were still good oh they were good preserved
 under salt
 they were so good then it's like those mcdonald's buns with that exact same weird white spot on the
 bottom of all of them oh classic classic consistency out are you out get out of my
 house i don't know how many decades it's been since i had a mcdonald's hamburger clearly it's
 been a minute yeah uh and uh jacob i know you you've long not been a fan of the southwest general
 seating procedure
 we've documented no i i have not been and it seems like i might be finally getting my way
 you might be but in the meantime you know as someone i don't mind it i i don't i like it i
 i love it a lot even though they started even though they started charging for bags it's still
 cheaper to check bags on southwest than any other airline and so i still yep fly southwest because
 it's still like 35 bucks and i just had a long conversation uh last week about uh airlines
 because we were talking about like airline uh credit cards
 and for her band and for for all of her gigs and everything and all the travel that she does
 yeah and and we we ended up uh because we've been using southwest and we were like let's look at
 these other airlines let's look at the other cards and everything and nope southwest that's
 just where we that's where we stayed man i'm telling you you've got the major hub there in
 vegas and that was what i got weaned on having to go out to jersey i had to not fly southwest from
 here
 there was no southwest from here to jersey no there's not it was out very disturbing
 baltimore i think i went on united i went united both ways and i was just like oh i don't like this
 i do not care for this i do not care for this united stuff at all i am uh getting online in
 chicago to fly back home uh here from after doing my corporate gig uh-huh and uh it is um it is
 tight quarters in uh
 oh uh oh i'm blanking on o'hare and i i'm blanking because i should uh side note i drove like hell to
 the wrong airport uh i went to oh that's the worst and the only thing that the only thing that was
 good was that you know i had rented a car but i since i do have checked bags what i like to do
 is like to pull up the curbside rush up the curbside check-in oh i like this move yes check
 my bags then return my car rental car and i'm not lugging all of my bags through the airport
 uh yes taking my carry-on
 because there's a secret that most airports don't want you to know and that's that they can't tow your
 car instantly they can threaten it they can threaten to find it they can yell about it a lot
 they can do that they can't tow it instantly so they were like trying to check my bags at at midway
 and the woman is making a very confused face and i'm panicking because as she takes longer i'm
 looking to see making sure i'm not getting eyed for a fine with my rental car and uh and and she
 goes uh you i don't know what's going on i've never gotten this message before i brought this
 guy over he doesn't get the message before i think you have to go inside and my brain went
 no i don't i have to go to a different airport my brain is like wait and so i was like somehow
 did i book a ticket home from a different airport and then i realized i landed at a different
 airport and didn't realize it i had just been to chicago three weeks ago for chicago magic lounge
 and so my brain was just confusing the two airports and i so i luckily uh uh left with a
 lot of time so i arrived at the proper airport with very little time so i was still rushing
 but i wasn't going to miss my flight or anything i was i was like oh god but i i drove like hell
 between those two airports anyhow so i'm there i'm in southwest and it is tight at o'hare it is
 like you know because southwest makes you line up they usually make you line up along along the thing
 the line they have here is like a very stunted little little uh they don't have the uh the
 square footage no they don't in the airport there so you gotta like basically they've got the square
 footage at midway but not at o'hare and there's a young man well coiffed man from india i believe
 with his tall very tall sister or girlfriend i don't know yep and he is either way they were
 making out he is he is beaming
 uncomfortable anger already like he is holding his bags and he is like elbows out and we're in
 tight quarters and you got to do the thing we're like hey what number are you i'm this number sure
 yeah yeah this is what i'm okay with and jacob hates and i'm trying to figure out you know where
 to stand or whatever and um you know it's within increments of five it's within increments of five
 uh and i honestly i do have my own pet peeves with it where like some people kind of go
 like if if i'm seven and they're nine and they're in front of me and i go i'm seven they go they'll
 some as a southwest person will confidently go like yeah like meaning like you don't have to
 get in front of me we're both in the same vicinity and i kind of go like close enough and i kind of
 get like no that's the whole fucking point is numbers that's that's some bullshit is lower
 than nine that's some bullshit ass so this guy has got his elbows out and i'm saying i'm a seven
 i'm saying it you know and uh i'm saying it out loud and i get a couple of people give me him and
 his sister wife are not communicating and he is like stewing i can feel him stewing from his back
 you know someone's so angry oh it's the worst doing right goodness and so finally some guy
 comes up like a little late to the party and is like excuse me a1 a1 a1 excuse me a1 yeah yeah and
 i was like oh this guy's coming through like lipitor through a vein here and uh uh he is uh
 there and the guy goes no no no no no no and he goes yes i'm a1 and he goes no we're all a1
 which confused us all i was like i was like we i am spartacus i today we are all a1 no buddy
 matt never got off the plane i don't know who paul's been talking to this entire time we live
 here um and so uh uh i was laughing he goes no i've done this before i know how this works i'm a1
 excuse me i'm definitely up there and he shouts like no like he starts like to open his arms and
 clear everyone back like no one move kind of body language oh that's i feel so bad for this guy
 that's just the worst because he's having a terrible day and he's like and so the guy with
 a1 is like waving like anyone from south was like get get over here please get get over here
 whatever and he says the the indian guy says no no no you announced that uh it is open seating
 oh boy and the and the flight attendant's like no yeah when you get on the plane it is open
 seating goes no you announced open seating so it is now open seating meaning that like
 no no no like whatever you want is wherever you want to go no son like no no no you announced
 open seating so now anarchy you know what this means
 i was like listen he's like our podcast is a similar our podcast is a similar rule about dibs
 so i understand what you're saying yeah dibs has been called is what you were saying you're saying
 yeah once once anyone with south us utters open seating the numbers on our on our tickets become
 useless they're right out out the window disqualified nope don't even look at them
 again they're not worth the paper that they were printed on the open seating
 motherfuckers so i take this opportunity to turn a person with a nine and i'm actually with someone
 with a four and a three who don't want to go past this angry person so we're all we're all like our
 little why we're all why not it's like little clutter space together right behind him so i
 decided to announce and interpret what is happening i was like this guy thinks because
 the words open seating were uttered in any capacity our tickets don't matter now
 oh boy
 oh boy
 i make a point of nothing else matters you gotta get up super early or stay up super late
 yeah and you and you get on that app and you wait for the moment that thing flips over
 and you hit your button to get your good seat availability i'm telling you right now uh mr a1
 and myself we are you know we both fly southwest enough uh that when you you get a list they check
 in for you you're gonna get your a well an a1 is is that's a 50% chance you're gonna get your a1
 50 ticket
 also a1 is i know because like they make sure that like pen gets it uh whenever he flies because he
 can get that one seat that has the he's six seven so there's that one seat you have more more like
 room yeah but that's an extra expense yes and it's and it's yeah and oftentimes it's a privilege
 like it's oftentimes like it's like a anyone traveling often is a1 is like someone who travels
 like every day like it's just a it's just a huge right right thing or whatever but i uh but yeah i
 was laughing so angry and he continued to be a show they they got the front row with the extra
 seats so they could feel like they were in first class you know that's all i think it's all they
 were anxious about was getting that first row which means you have to put all your shit behind
 you which i hate so i never sit in that row i fucking hate that right um and then uh guys i
 tell you something i was i was haphazardly stick with me as a good person so i says i already checked
 bags i would say if it's a full flight i will gate check my one carry-on bag and only have my book
 bag oh okay and so i get on the plane but i put my book bag up in the carry-on which they is it's
 that's not okay they frown upon that right yeah but here's the thing i do the same thing i do the
 same thing though and i'm ready and i'm ready exactly so i put it up there and i go if they
 call me i'll break my book back down if they don't call me i bet the person who's got this
 center middle seat is going to have their bags they're gonna be pissed they have to put their
 shit all the way behind them and i will i'm going to put my book back down and i'm going to put my
 offer that row so i waited till the whole thing was on the person was like can i sit in the middle
 seat like i'm fucked uh i said yes and not only that here and i took my book bag out put it at my
 feet and then i put their carry-on into the space and they'd carry on right above their head
 not all heroes wear capes guys not a champion of the flight not all heroes wear capes but this one
 carried a book bag i was waiting for tears is maybe strong but a thank you uh whatever
 give a shit that i did a good thing for they didn't care at all oh wow what do you know i mean
 they still they still gave you the the the thank you hand jay during the flight right i mean that
 person is an american
 i was like did you realize what i just did for you like do you understand yeah
 they did not you owe me you i said that's it
 open seating and then i hit a music cue and everybody had to switch seats until the music
 stopped did the guy end up getting on the plane where he was was he was he not stopped what they
 didn't put him back anywhere no they let him on and he was just i mean he got up like probably
 like seven times to get something out of one bag or another and then they were yeah
 he was having a terrible day i see these people in airports and on flights where i'm just like
 i like you were being horrible to everyone around you and i hate you so
 much are these that being said yeah i recognize that you are having just the worst day that a
 human being can have and i'm sorry for you do you think it was because he didn't want to fly
 do you think it was he was a nervous flyer and you know these people they they can't handle
 the loss of control that flying is and so i mean i think i think it factors a lot you know i think
 we have we have uh folks here who work in the airline business but i i've including myself i
 think i'm much more anxious on a plane and i get much more fucking pissed about little shit that
 sure but i find as someone who is with you often uh both in and out of airports
 uh yeah yeah no matt you're definitely much more anxious flying
 i can just you don't have to wonder buddy hey i just are i said nothing to that woman that shook
 my seat i didn't say you're not a hero sir i just said you're more anxious uh right and so i tell
 myself you're not going to care about this in like 20 minutes right like that's what i tell
 myself when when i start to get future matt does not give a shit about this shit about this um so
 that's the trick uh but it is it is yeah i think i think everyone gets fucking pissed about going
 on planes um no it's not it's not a fun experience for anyone so uh speaking of good deeds guys well
 well i'm patting my own back here okay uh other arm so
 there was uh uh an attack on verizon either a cyber attack on verizon or just a big fucking
 fuck up at verizon but all right all verizon went down like two days ago uh-huh oh shit i was giving
 like uh like crappy service like across the country and uh at the same time there's an apple
 update that night before on my phone and then okay i got up my phone was not working and then i was
 like oh shit maybe the update messed something up or maybe whatever right and then all of a sudden
 people and they had their phones down too man going around without cell service for more than
 24 hours is crazy like i know it's so dumb but i was like man the world would fall apart if this
 happened for like four days oh yeah we'll fall apart matt yeah we'll we'll fall apart because
 paul is looking forward to it the amount of time to just hop to my car is like all gps it from the
 car and all of a sudden i was just going like shit no i'm out
 i have to figure out incorrect i have to figure out where i'm going wow um
 and so uh uh but i'm getting this thing on my phone that's a sim card failure
 and okay and i got it gordon knows what i'm talking about and um yeah and everyone else
 i'm talking about who has verizon phones didn't get that message right oh but i went into a verizon
 store and i was like oh my god i'm gonna be like oh my god i'm gonna be like oh my god i'm gonna be
 like hey uh i have my phone says sim card failure and they literally there's three of them and they
 all went yeah i know the network is down and it's down like across the country or whatever and i
 said oh but mine said sim card failure he goes they're all saying different different things
 the different people if you look or whatever so they were like ignore all the other things it's
 the network yeah the network is just wreaking havoc yeah now i'm against people in chat saying
 they have verizon and nothing went wrong with them
 well good for fucking you okay
 if you google the news stories say verizon outage you will see uh news stories on it
 uh i'm looking at it right now uh the weird thing is it doesn't seem like verizon has
 said still what what caused it they have not said what caused it i'm thinking i ran but i don't know
 but why not guess you think you ran too much i think i ran too hard and messed up my phone
 yeah yeah well i'll tell you i said
 no so i said i said i said i said oh i i go oh so you've been dealing with this all day and they go
 right yeah and i and i go oh that can't be fun they go one woman literally pointed us and said
 it's your fault and you're not doing anything i was like really the retail person working
 for verizon storefront is in charge of the network they're like i like to sell your phone
 and keep this entire network going across the world wow now now matt it sounds like you made a bit of
 a some an assumption there yeah when this retail store employee just told you this story you then
 assumed that they did not indeed control the verizon network oh my god i'm a fool i didn't
 even ask you buddy it's it's right there but do you yeah right i could i could but do you i could
 have just said that and then it'd be like as a matter of fact you caught me on the undercover
 boss day yeah i'm tom verizon i run this thing i'm tom
 verizon i decided to get a little taste of that old 1475 an hour see how see how that treats me
 see it take a little taste of how the other half lives watch this and then he takes off his glasses
 and shakes down his long hair and he's a beautiful girl the whole time amazing i'll tell you who else
 was a beautiful girl the entire time you didn't even realize it and that is the following sponsor
 there's more to the story but today's show is brought to you by
 the bearded liberal truck driving school school for the bearded liberal truck driver trucker

 i'm sorry i do we learn how to drive trucks while we're here at all i was hoping to learn
 how to drive a truck eventually mr yambi pamby boy oh boy you sure like to mouth off a lot you
 know you might want to think about taking some meditation classes fucking shit no i was just i i
 thought that was a good idea i thought that was a good idea i thought that was a good idea
 i thought this was a truck driving school and so i was just here oh it most assuredly is it most
 assuredly is but uh i can't help but notice you got some pretty fancy shoes on there
 they're uh they're nikes you have any ideas where those were made and by which infant's hands
 boy oh boy uh no no i i don't i i just bought the shoes uh pay less i think hey uh
 let me ask you a quick question what's your favorite war
 i'm sorry wrong answer there is no war but class war get the fucking truck
 so i leave the verizon store with no service
 uh-huh decide to wait out the the outage and i um i go next door to the smith's and i get cupcakes
 and i bring um all the workers oh that was very sweet oh i say sorry and then they fixed your
 phone for you that's really nice they're like here you go here you go sir let me turn your phone
 well i wake up the next day i do a little research at night you know research i asked
 chat gpt how to fix my phone and uh that's it you're fucked buddy and then i go on youtube
 uh and watch some videos
 uh and then i go on youtube uh and watch some videos and then i go on youtube uh and watch some
 oh you did do some research and i'm trying to do all this shit to my phone did you figure it out
 pretty quick youtube's like hey everybody's screwed no no i meant that like uh like like
 oh so oh sorry i skipped a step so basically i started i started talking to all my other verizon
 friends and they got their bars back and i didn't by the end of the night oh ah okay so at midnight
 you know everything's closed but at midnight i'm realizing that like everyone else i'm the only one
 still with no service on my phone have you tried turning it off and turning it on again right i did
 put it in rice i shoved it in rice um i tried to uh rub its thigh and whisper in its ear
 to turn it on and um tear and it's tear duct
 and then it tells you like you can take out your sim card thing have you ever taken out
 the sim card of your own phone it's a pain it's scary you gotta get like a little paper clippy
 thing and you gotta like push real hard like harder than you would on like a delicate object
 and then like it goes and then it comes out and i laughed because i was following the directions
 on the youtube thing but of course you're playing pausing playing pausing and it says do not blow
 into the empty slot like a nintendo and i was like oh that's exactly what i did i had too late
 you need to put that before you need to tell me i did that immediately that's a go have you guys
 seen all the videos where people pour molten uh glue into their phone holes and pull it out
 as a cleaning method yeah oh no i've seen those i don't know that that's advisable i don't think so
 i i haven't done it um i don't i've seen the videos i haven't been tried to replicate i don't
 think you'll go i don't think you'll go to the apple store and they'd be like have you done
 molten glue at home i don't think that's ever gonna be i think it would fuck you up i think
 you could maybe do slime maybe no i'm do not i'm not putting any goo in my phone yeah they use the
 hot glue
 yeah i don't know yeah like if i get a little fuzz in the in the charging port of my phone i get a
 little q-tip and just pop the pop the fuzz out you get wait you pop out fuzz with a q-tip with more
 fuzz that seems ridiculous fight fuzz with fuzz fight fuzz with fuzz well you know now that i'm
 saying no now that you're saying it as an old-time video game collector you know we when i'd buy all
 those used copies they got and and movies too they got stickers all over them of course the best way
 that sticker residue off is with another adhesive sticker there you go so there you go fight fuzz
 with fuzz fight fuzz with fuzz uh mike nielsen matt have you gotten the $20 account the the
 account credit uh i haven't gotten that i probably show up on your next bill uh you're you're owed
 well i think you have to get it i think you have to call them and oh we say hey motherfucker you
 better get on according to the new york post there is a call for this to be done automatically now
 imagine it's like a $20 account credit which is being slammed for being inadequate do you feel
 like $20 is adequate or inadequate for your pain and suffering like i mean so a day without cell
 service is worth more than $20 oh yeah definitely more than 1 30th of your bill well i think i think
 it's a breach of their contract and i think it probably isn't given all the legalese that i'm
 sure it's not but at the same time i think that but i'll go to the prices store and tell them that
 but in certain cases it's a life or death situation i think i think they could really
 become uh here not heroes they could make some good positive news if they waive the monthly fee
 for everybody yeah i think i mean that if they said scooper nova girl matt wants to know how
 much the cupcakes were did were you even with the $20 credit are you still in hot to uh verizon here
 i got $60 cupcakes each whoa basically i got the
 nicest cupcakes i've ever seen with jules and ramsay's corner cupcakes um no i got you know
 seven bucks yeah okay nice cupcakes so even with the 20 you're coming you're coming out a little
 ahead even even with the cupcakes on the 20 you're coming out a little ahead i'm probably not gonna
 go for the $20 credit i'm just gonna let you know right now you're not those are things where you
 value your time at zero i don't value my time are you kidding me
 to just call them up and say hey give me $20 they go yeah there's the word there's the word what do
 i do paul right just just call them just it's so easy the word just makes it so easy oh boy i won't
 be on the phone for an hour on hold with all the other schlubs trying to get a $20 fucking refund
 okay maybe you don't do it today but no way no way they're gonna let people stay on on hold for
 an hour for their $20 thing that's fucking great oh so you just click a link there you go i'm sure
 you can do it you should absolutely do it i just got $20 back from my uh oil change i'd spent but
 i spent 20 minutes doing it but that's worth it to me that's a dollar an hour for me you're really
 distracted by this $20 this is not where this story is going i'll tell you why because this
 is the $20 that's what this is to me you're speaking in terms of action figures that's a
 craving the hunter are you crazy you don't want to crave in the hunter are you insane
 are you insane not really i don't want to crave it though well you don't want to crave in the
 hunter you're not a spider-man fanatic he killed spider-man you know how hard that is to do
 this guy figured it out people have done it yeah i think he's the only one call the cops
 that's a crime that is murder he ended up dying over it
 oh he didn't actually kill spider-man that's the twist
 look this is all adding up to is on the day there was a software update on the day there
 was some kind of weird cyber attack or not that took down a lot of verizon's network
 yes by total coincidence on the same day my sim card crapped out
 just a total do you think it couldn't have been coincidence it was some kind i think it was
 no or the update what do you think jacob what do you think i i tend to i i do tend to lean
 towards paul's way of thinking on these uh with the electronic stuff is is uh if if one thing
 happens i i don't i don't think it's usually coincidence i think it's usually somehow
 by something yeah maybe not in the way that maybe not in the way that we're thinking about but like
 i have an older phone i
 have a 12 right okay so i think what's the 17 is out now i think
 did someone give your phone a comic book with boobs in it because that's the ultimate corruption
 circles on circles circles in circles
 i i showed i showed my sim card the entertainment landscape in las vegas and it just gave up and
 crapped out it went like yikes you made me
 you made it research the boring company was like corruption corruption
 corruption joe lombardo corruption corruption file corrupted
 well joe lombardo is the uh nevada governor so somehow yeah somehow somehow he's the nevada
 fucking governor boy we got out of that i wasn't telling you i was telling the people listening i'm
 telling you i got out of there by the skin of my teeth before i started dude compared to some other
 look i don't like joe lombardo and i'm not voting for him ever right but i mean compared to what other
 states have for politicians i guess you're right i count my blessings he's an old school
 intelligence scumbag not a just a blatant youtube lying scumbag right um suppose
 yeah yeah like there are some things that he says when he's like yeah i was just over there
 and that that i walked over here i'm like oh he he just said something that was demonstrably true
 okay that's okay
 okay okay
 yeah laurie in the chat like hello indiana over here could be a lot worse
 i count my blessings with lombard you know hey you throw a dart at the old us of a you're gonna
 find some horrible shit right now i'll tell you who disagrees with paul about that completely
 and that is matt's son who is an american that's right also the following sponsor this show and
 this friend of mine who is an american who is an american who is an american who is an american

 i uh get accused uh probably weekly of giving someone a false name
 whoa oh my name is so common yeah jacob smith i get accused almost weekly of giving a false
 name to people i have never been accused of that so people go like no no no what's your real name
 yes like in what environments like if i have to give a name for anything
 like a valet yeah like a valet parking starbucks anything anything like that if i have to give a
 name and uh it's like going up for a reservation uh party of two for alan smithy please and they're
 like what yeah well it does read it reads pretend i mean i'm not convinced it's your name you
 shouldn't wait we just learned this lesson so we get to put it in action right away is it your real
 name
 all right
 breaking news
 breaking news who could say yeah like like i'll drop a car off at the valet and then they'll be
 like oh we need uh we need a last name for the ticket smith and they will just stand there and
 look at me and not move their pen at all to write my name down yeah no no we like we've heard it
 all dickhead what's your name yeah and they will like i'll get like i'll often get like an eye roll
 or or anything and i'll be like i it's common because a lot of us are named smith i don't know
 what to tell you okay jacob so now you need to take on like a bob dylan jack frost type vibe here
 you need okay you need you need a day-to-day events like that where you're getting reservations
 or uh valets you need a pseudonym or a nom de plume if you will that will somehow at least
 ring less false than jacob smith
 okay okay sir antoine no no a lot of people know they're knights a lot of people don't go don't go
 you know putting a hat on the hat here don't don't make this into too flowery all right no no i've

 winning but let's see hiram twatberger oh sebastian thank you canadian scoop i do like
 saying my name is sebastian george jetson you should go by paul mattingly that's a good one

 murray oh of course that's what i should do what's your name murray murray murray here's my
 second suggestion your last name should be a name really known in town
 so it should either be like win or green spun or whatever you want to you want to really try
 just wink and nod it like yeah i'm gonna park your car it's like sure no problem murray win
 and they gotta go like wait is he a fucking win-win is he who knows and you gotta put everyone on
 their toes you gotta make sure murray riviera yeah yeah yeah i don't know if newton's strong

 a fucking realization last night this is just a personal thing it doesn't help our our podcast at
 all but i just had a personal realization last night that made me so happy and that is uh casey
 wilson and i are on the same schedule at absent these days oh nice and that means that the next
 time they do a a quiz show it'll be on one of my off nights and i'll be able to go go play oh very
 nice i was i really just thought about this last night i was so happy to realize that well i guess
 sarah has to ross's show i got to do the show with your wife that's right yeah i heard about it
 i heard it went well i saw a little bit of video from it it was super i heard your set uh went very
 well it did it went very well i was so happy after doing like three corporates in a row that i was
 oh my best just just letting loose uh it was really really funny um it was super fun i also
 had like awesome people hop up uh so you know for straightish jacket escape uh i had a a gay guy and
 raise their hands for who are the straightest guys in the room.
 And they came up, and they were just hysterical.
 You know, like, when audience members try to be funny,
 and they aren't, it sucks.
 If they're funny, it's not.
 Great.
 I laid out, and they just, she just took over.
 At one point.
 Smooth sailing.
 You know, I come up, I got the shackles stuck between my legs.
 And a guy in the back just goes, oh, balls.
 Like that, like that.
 And I was like, that's funny, right?
 Like, this is funny.
 And I go, and I let her go, I would tip my cap to you, sir.
 But obviously, you know, and I just show that my hands are stuck between my legs.
 And the girl just walks over and just doffs an invisible cap over my head.
 Just tips my cap for me.
 Hilarious.
 Well done.
 I was like, this is great.
 Is this a burlesque performer that you know?
 No.
 I just, I just, I met her that night.
 Oh, that's great.
 Shay was her name.
 Yeah, yeah, she was great.
 Who was it?
 Nice.
 Shay.
 Shay.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 She's named after a stadium.
 Oh, you should give that as your name.
 I was going to say, I should have asked if that was her real name.
 She gave me a fucking valet name.
 She gave me a fucking fake valet name.
 Yes, I'm Shay Stadium of the Connecticut Stadiums.
 You know, we have all that stadium money.
 We have all that stadium money.
 How much stadium money do you have?
 But, yeah.
 Do we have two knitting scoops?
 We do.
 We have two knitting.
 This is good.
 I love it.
 It's a higher compliment than when we're told that people, people like to, people tell me
 like straight confidently.
 Like, I fall asleep to you all the time.
 And I don't know how to take that as a compliment.
 You should take it as a compliment.
 I said that, I said that to Joel Hodgson.
 He did not take it as a compliment on Twitter.
 But that's because he couldn't hear the nuance and love in my voice.
 That's right.
 I live by those movies.
 But knowing, I think knowing that people knit to us is maybe, that is the highest compliment, I think.
 It's a pretty high compliment.
 I can see multiple knitters.
 It is very relaxing.
 David Sorensen, what do you do with your hands, buddy?
 Get to knitting.
 Get to knitting.
 Go.
 Come on.
 Let's go.
 There he goes.
 He's doing it.
 He's doing it.
 Mattingly, what are you doing with your hands?
 Losing at Jock vs. Nerd.
 Boo!
 Boo!
 You want to do a little Jock vs. Nerd action?
 Oh, am I?
 Fuck.
 Fuck yeah.
 I'm on the hunt for balls.
 Excellent.
 Hunt, hunt, hunt for balls.
 Hunt, hunt, hunt for balls.
 Balls.
 On the hunt for balls.
 Oh!
 All right.
 Real quick.
 Two things.
 First of all.
 Okay.
 It's colder than a witch's tit out here in fucking Pittsburgh.
 It's so...
 Paul Mattingly's favorite saying, everybody drink.
 But you love your governor, so lucky you.
 We do have a pretty good governor.
 It's so cold out here.
 Uh, that's why I'm literally wearing a jacket because we have heater on in the house.
 It's just, it's cold.
 It's so, so cold.
 It's been bitterly cold for days and the, the cold is just seeping into the bones of the
 home at this point.
 Uh-huh.
 Uh, and then also.
 We have stopped, we have stopped the show.
 Paul is cold.
 I don't know if you saw, but the final reveal has been made.
 Uh, the Pokemon.
 On the Masked Singer?
 The Pokemon crossover with Lego.
 The first three sets have been revealed.
 Oh.
 Did you see?
 Pokemon Lego?
 Yes.
 There's new Pokemon Lego?
 I have not seen, no.
 So, Mega Bloks, which is the company owned by Mattel, which is one of their rivals, they
 had the license for a while and they were making Pokemon Legos.
 So now the Pokemon company is working in tandem with Lego.
 Can you, uh, put a guess out there as to what the biggest set of the, it's Charizard, uh,
 Venusaur, and Blastoise in a big diorama.
 What is your price tag you think might be on that?
 Uh, three piece, big display set.
 Oh, I thought you were going to have us guess what they were, but you named the characters
 because I was all ready to guess.
 Um, there's two other sets.
 I can have you guess.
 Okay.
 Well, I wouldn't have been able to name any of the characters anyway.
 Well, what do you think?
 I was going to guess either Riachu, Pinky Rat, Foxfire, or Hermie.
 Uh.
 I'm reading them off my phone.
 No.
 Um, okay.
 Pikachu, of course.
 Riachu is an evolution of Pikachu.
 You could make a Riachu out of that Pikachu.
 Yeah.
 Riachu is an evolution of Pikachu.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Price tag for all three of them is a Lego build.
 It's a, it's a, it's a one piece.
 It's the three big bads from the original game in a, in a large display base.
 Big.
 It's big, big.
 And like, it's pretty big.
 So a lot of pieces.
 It's big.
 It's a big, it's a big set.
 What is your, what is your price tag guess for this big Pokemon Lego set?
 $20.
 I mean, it's going to be 20 bucks.
 All right.
 All right.
 Good guess.
 Good guess.
 I'm seeing $350.
 I'm seeing $495 in the scoop here.
 $1,000 is guessed by Andy.
 $4.95.
 I think it'd be more than that.
 Dave Sorensen is.
 Is it limited?
 Is it?
 Are they only making blank amounts?
 No, it's not limited.
 No.
 Okay.
 No.
 Oh, that is a great hat, Yarn and Sticks.
 That is a great hat you just made.
 That is a nice looking hat.
 That's really cool.
 That's really cool.
 I would pay.
 How much is it?
 I just, two birds for no reason.
 I would, I would, I would pay three.
 Oh, the whole house.
 The whole hat is middle fingers.
 Because it's all birds.
 It's a bunch of hat middle fingers.
 See, it fools you.
 Oh.
 That's a nice cozy hat to wear to a protest in Minnesota right now.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 That's exactly it.
 Okay.
 So, I'm going to guess that I would, I would do five Yarn and Sticks hats for that Pikachu.
 I mean, that's good.
 Oh, easily.
 Good trade.
 Good trade.
 I don't know what the little sets are going for.
 Now, the big set is actually priced to move at $650.
 God damn it.
 I know.
 And this is the thing, right?
 Like, Pokemon is very much a kid-oriented brand, or it was for a time.
 And Lego also, kid-oriented brand for a time.
 But this is a, this is a specific product based at adult collectors.
 Yeah.
 And so, you could, they even asked in like an AMA, and people were like, is this a Lego
 set for kids?
 And they're like, nope.
 This is for adults.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 So, they, you know, they acknowledged it at least.
 Adult collectors.
 Yeah.
 No, no yucking anyone's yum.
 No, you know, kink shaming, no whatever.
 But like, if you bring a possible lover back to your house, and they're going to touch
 the thing, you go, no, no, no, no, no, no.
 That was $650.
 Like, I feel like, I feel like the date is over.
 No, I think the date might be over if that's the reaction.
 If you don't care that they touch your $650 Charizard, I think that makes you cool.
 who oh that was like because i have a lego i have a lego batmobile on my bar at the at the house
 yeah yeah and uh and you're always going
 but like a friend we were having we had people over one day and uh one of our friends was over
 and they had one of their kids or they had their their son here with them and uh their son was you
 know of course uh super polite kid great kid uh young kid goes can i can i play with the batmobile
 on the bar of course yeah take it down hand it to him put on the floor walk away i just got like
 some little moving parts and stuff on it and i come back over there a few minutes later and the
 kiddo and his dad are both there and the dad is holding the batmobile and he goes he was he was
 twisting a thing in here and now it won't work to twist it anymore i think he i think he might
 have broken it uh so sorry
 i was like oh i freaked the fuck out i was like no no i'm not i'm very happy that your kid is
 playing with the batmobile and i don't care if it's it's a lego like it come here kid you broke

 installment i'll send you a venmo request don't worry about it don't worry about it don't worry

 they still have some on ebay uh you know it's big money but you know you can you can you're
 gonna be out like 1200 something like that yeah well that is the other thing too is matt you you
 make the point you know of of someone's sees that in a possible partner's yeah yeah a social
 situation and what's their reaction but you have to also know that lego
 as an investment have appreciated at a rate greater than even gold and that is true
 the evaluation of lego is greater even than gold in the last what else is the last like 15

 of listeners yeah apparently he's really really good so oh no he's fantastic of course might have
 also exposed some some some racism in this nation uh what what what what are you talking about
 look let's just eat regular hamburger buns and talk about it wait would you say this nation you
 mean this one this nation wherein my own citizenship might be in jeopardy what are you talking about
 i'm just gonna ignore matt and whatever craziness he's talking about and just move on to culture
 for 600 god damn it andy byron and kristin cabot are best known for the role they played in this
 2025 event
 andy byron shit i don't know pass matt andy byron and kristin cabot cabot i said cabot but i don't
 know c-a-b-o-t this is culture played in this yes event uh new year's eve i know that's i'm like
 uh the west virginia
 state house elections pass paul a pass let's see coldplay kiss cam couple oh yes
 infamous infamous coldplay kiss cam couple matt infamous um culture 800 please let's see
 after thieves stole 102 million dollars in jewels from the louvre in paris
 france it was reported the password for the museum surveillance system was blank damn it i knew
 all the factors that laid out in the question and then then i knew i knew it was jules the amount in
 the louvre but i think that's it matt the password no it was password no the jewels well it might be
 password it's either password or louvre i think ah that's it
 that's it is the password
 um or or password it's one of the other i'll pass you can take home all the money oh no i don't want
 to try guess i don't know i think it's the louvre but i'm not 100 now now you got me guessing
 i think it was louvre it was sticky going lou it was sticky cheese if the eye was a one
 and the keys and the cheese were three let's see
 i heard it was the louvre
 i gave you i told matt i told matt it was the louvre
 paul you got music for four six or eight hundred one of them's a daily double and that one could
 fuck you up well i guess i might as well go out big with 800 please music for 800 in may 2025 the
 song wasted love performed by jj and written by him along with tedora spirit and thomas turner
 won the eurovision song contest for which country oh that's uh
 oh shoot who won the eurovision i don't pass i don't know oh that passes to me there was
 a uh large amount of conversation this year about eurovision at work uh with all of the
 europeans and everybody that i was there really there was a ton of conversation about this event
 oh i didn't listen to any of it i also did not follow the story at all um
 is my final answer pass good austria that's right i didn't remember that austrian went yodeling
 that's right that's me i got music for 400 or 600 matt has 400 i have 200 paul has 2000 so i'm
 probably not going to catch paul uh let's see i'll try to try to get some points on matt here and get
 second place music for 600 name any of the eight artists that were nominated for best new artist at
 the 2025 grammy awards
 shit
 is my answer to that question ice spice uh i don't think that's even this year
 um
 um yeah i don't know pass matt i don't know paul pass
 chaperone was this year oh motherfucker benson boone sabrina carpenter oh this is all i i would
 have thought that several of those well that's because the grammys are behind the fucking time
 i was gonna say sabrina carpenter's been around for a minute yeah that's dochi's been around for
 a minute i feel better about not getting this question right now i'm not gonna get this question
 right now yeah i recognize at least most of the teddy swims yeah he oh no we're back from our
 technical problem uh oh yeah none of his guests on that one oh our matt closing out the category
 end the game that paul is definitely winning and matt is gonna probably get second place it's a
 daily double we'll have to get this so i get third place so there's stakes here oh that's true yeah
 we got stakes this song began 2025 at number one on the billboard hot 100 and fun fact it is the
 number one song on the day i am writing this scoopity 12 10 25 that's not a helpful hint at
 all well it means it was number one for either a long time or twice billboard hot 100 oh i know it
 is this a sabrina carpenter song i don't think so i think this is a song that comes around
 in december oh oh oh uh uh uh amy winehouse is no uh
 amy winehouse is they try to make me go to rehab and i say merry christmas
 i could go to rehab i gotta wrap presents and no no no um pariah carries all i want for christmas
 all i want for christmas is you matt that's right and that is the game
 ball wins with 2 000 points matt's insane with 800 i'm in third with 200 that's from rum raisenberg
 and that was 2025 in retrospective that's a great scoopity good job nicely done rum raisenberg
 uh how much we don't remember but uh you know like you know maybe i'm i'm a little embarrassed
 that i've never heard of the best picture winner that's yeah i hadn't heard of it either
 although i'm not as embarrassed as they should be well 2020 was famous
 this is why i listen to my showbiz podcast is that like it was famously hampered by the
 this is still the echoes of the writer's strike uh or the actor's right so they couldn't get
 enough stuff into production so movie theaters were pissed about how little product was coming
 to the pipeline in 2025 it was a bad year for tv too um it's just like everything was so delayed
 from all the strikes great year for keeler though that pluribus is just taking off he's doing great
 hey i see paul chambered up there i don't think he's paul a full proper shout out
 but i had a i had a uh a corporate gig in south bend and he basically lives he lives in south
 bend not basically he lives in south bend um but he basically stepped up as my advanced man
 he he oh wow he helped get stuff to to the venue that need to be he was there at the venue before
 i got there he introduced himself to the person running the venue and like he had me all set i
 like walked in and everything was like set up for me because paul did everything and it was really
 great it was it was awesome and just oh awesome further proof that just our podcast audiences are
 amazing

 their already cheesy burger so do you steam the bun is enough what are you talking don't get him
 having delicious food you don't want to ruin their palates is that it you want to keep them american
 he don't want to shovel butter and salt into their mouth uh all the time which does make
