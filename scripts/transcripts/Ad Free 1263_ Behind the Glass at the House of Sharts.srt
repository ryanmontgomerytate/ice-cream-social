1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
 When I play pickleball, I don't want anybody to know that I'm playing pickleball. It's more like knuckleball

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:14,880
 It's time to thank you the ice cream truck drivers. Thank you so much ice cream truck drivers out there

10
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,840
 Maybe your own

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,880
 Jacob are we on twitch?

12
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,320
 We're not but we're about to be because I forgot to here we go

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,180
 Hey, Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social? Yeah, I'd love to great. Let's go

14
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,080
 Its time for Matt Mattingly's ice cream social sitting over in Pittsburgh. It's Paul Mattingly sitting in Las Vegas

15
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,080
 It's Matt Donnelly also in Las Vegas. It's me Jacob the audio guy. We're preaching fun. We're preaching fun

16
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,080
 That's what they say everybody. That's what they claim

17
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,680
 That is what they claim fun preaching

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,280
 the fun all the time

19
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:47,920
 Did you guys read the story about they're going nuts that a wolf figured out how to pull in a crab trap have we seen this

20
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,500
 Yes. Yes, this is great. So tell us a wolf has

21
00:01:52,500 --> 00:02:01,680
 Basically saw a wolf saw humans set a crab trap into a lake and then and then when the hunters went away or the

22
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,740
 Hunt the hunters. They use the great crab hunters

23
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:12,460
 Their cage of little meat there's a there's a bar right on East Sahara called the great great crab hunter

24
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,100
 The bar in front of the flamingo was called the crab hunter

25
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:32,320
 When the crab trap setters walked away

26
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:41,000
 The wolf went over and then started pulling in the rope and brought the trap up and the meat that was set inside the crab trap

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,080
 Some scientists are going nuts being like this is a wolf using tools

28
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,460
 Right, and I was skeptical about this being significant news

29
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,720
 until

30
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,160
 My cat Shmi ki

31
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:06,160
 Figured out how to open the cat door that we close at night the dog. Oh

32
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,320
 Yeah, so like we put a little slide down the thing to seal off the

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,240
 Cat door. It's really a doggie door, but we've repurposed it for cats by not having dogs and having cats

34
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,240
 By having in a cat store and

35
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:29,460
 We were hearing this noise whatever we thought was just playing for something downstairs getting fixated on something, you know, like the like cats do

36
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:36,440
 No, Shmi ki had figured out how to push up the the seal of the cat door enough to sneak out

37
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,760
 middle of the night

38
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,800
 To kill birds

39
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,760
 That's probably to kill birds and it was not yeah in the chat. They're asking that you sure wasn't smokey

40
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,520
 That's that's the hard part if my money would have been on Shmuki

41
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:55,000
 She's the more devious ninja of the cats. She's certainly the most lethal of the cats

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,360
 but no is a

43
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,360
 Shmi ki want to go outside and so

44
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:06,960
 Now it's all right Shmi ki. Yeah, and so now I'm thinking between that wolf story and my cat story

45
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:14,440
 Maybe our time as as as apex predators on this planet is is is you know, there's one time we weren't right, you know

46
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,820
 Right historically our species would hang out wait for the bigger predators be done

47
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:25,520
 Then we'd go in and pick the bones and drink the bone marrow of leftover victims and and then and then we figured out tools

48
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,280
 And and now oh wait, is that what we're supposed to be doing waiting on to suck the bone marrow?

49
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,600
 I think about that all the time, you know fancy steak house all these homeless dicks for no reason

50
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
 You totally misinterpreted

51
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:47,760
 Boy is there egg on my face that's I think about that whenever you're at a fancy steakhouse they offer that marrow

52
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,880
 Like a marrow and bread appetizer. Yeah

53
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:57,720
 I'm like man, what would like hundreds hundreds or maybe I guess it's thousands of years ago with thousand years ago

54
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,060
 Just think about like here. We are like almost like laughing at the fact that this is all we used to do

55
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,820
 Yeah, now it's just an appetizer. We dip our bread in

56
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,520
 over fancy clothes

57
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,540
 Bone marrow

58
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:21,400
 Anyways, I think these cats I think I think animals are just gonna start figuring it out. Yeah, we've had a good run

59
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:29,000
 We can be done with this as I'm for one. I'm ready to push eject. Yeah, let's let's run for the hills

60
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,140
 Let them do the best new apex predator or raccoons best apex animal on the planet raccoons

61
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,600
 Good love

62
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:44,440
 Would love it would love it raccoons cuz they're almost there. Their hands are almost there. Yeah, it's very close

63
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,720
 They're getting domesticated as we speak. I can easily see

64
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,720
 Raccoons like you know, just a raccoon city

65
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,840
 That you don't want because that leads to Resident Evil

66
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:03,640
 Manatees that's where that's where it all goes down in Raccoon City. Oh

67
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,800
 Don't you know your Resident Evil lore

68
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,520
 Sadly, I'm lacking. Oh man

69
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,120
 Resident Evil was it that was it. God damn when that game came out

70
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,840
 Oh, and then you had to get the second version to do with the dual stick. Oh my god. Oh, oh, oh

71
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:26,720
 Every time I see the videos or the the video of somebody like handing a raccoon cotton candy

72
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,280
 Next to a stream and they wash it it goes away. So say breaks my heart every time

73
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,040
 It's the saddest thing ever and but you have that raccoon some some food that can be washed

74
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,600
 Yep, shame upon all those people that do that. We had to lose a tree yesterday. Oh

75
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:49,000
 Yes, I see it. Well, I thought it was in the yard and then all of a sudden and like it just no

76
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,680
 We had lawn service come out cuz it was starting a suckle took our tree

77
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:01,480
 It was starting to crack and get real rotty. It was already rotty and we knew it was gonna go at some point

78
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:07,600
 But also it was already dead. But yes, but at the last last couple of months it started to straight-up crack up top

79
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,920
 Yeah splint and if that thing would come down on a pooch. I'd never let myself

80
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,600
 Forgive myself. So

81
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,440
 We got the pros in to come in and do it and we left a four foot tall stump

82
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:25,520
 Or so four foot tall stump so we can fart around and put birdseed on top of that or maybe a little you

83
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,480
 You left that on purpose on purpose. Yes, we left a four foot and we left all the wood

84
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,180
 so we've got logs and logs and logs and sticks and twigs and

85
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:39,240
 Ted is having a field day and he's out there getting a new chew toy every every other would precariously on a shelf

86
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,840
 That's rickety that could collapse and kill one of his dogs. Yep

87
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:49,120
 All the logs are safely on the ground they're part around with them though, but now we're gonna use that to

88
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,120
 Re-border the garden in this springtime and

89
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,600
 we're gonna chop up the twigs even more for mulch and for birdies to use and then the

90
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,400
 Little sticks we're gonna figure out other uses for it

91
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,560
 But it's great and the fact that and so into the gardening stuff

92
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,640
 We could just have them leave all the wood and not just chuck it in their truck and chip it

93
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,720
 I'm like, yeah, just leave it. We're fine. So do you have a fireplace or a fire pit or anything like that?

94
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,720
 We don't but our

95
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,320
 Relatives do so if we wanted to if you set that wood on fire, you could you could have one done

96
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,720
 We could just set it on fire and burn a patch in the yard and done and done

97
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,980
 We could do that. I don't trust my dogs not to

98
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,480
 Burn themselves. They're dumb jump into the fire

99
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,480
 I wouldn't jump into the fire, but they would fart around with it and they get in trouble

100
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,240
 One of our dogs is fascinated by fire

101
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,880
 Look our little lily dog is fat

102
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,520
 Like I will have a fire going and she will just sit and watch it

103
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,240
 She will get close to it. She won't she won't like get get dangerously close to anything

104
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,560
 But she will just sit and watch it with this fascinated look on her face. That is some way that is some ancient

105
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,120
 Breeding in there, right? Like like how many out of me? Well, I mean, that's it. How many no, no, no, no

106
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,160
 No, this is Lily's been going the dispensary when Jacob's not home

107
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:09,640
 Getting that sticky like look inside the flames

108
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,600
 It speaks to you

109
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:20,080
 Also wolf cuz I'm a dog Lily is that girl with the balloon at the concert

110
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,200
 Jason is gonna be holding the balloon in her mouth

111
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:36,960
 You know what I'd be in I'd be in so yeah, there was a fancy

112
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,160
 Starbucks barista cup that came out. I

113
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:47,640
 Saw this I have already lodged a formal complaint and since cease and desists to all Starbucks

114
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,120
 Good. Yeah, cuz our IP

115
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,920
 Not our IP our our IP should stand for something

116
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:01,840
 Alright, our IP basically. Wait, what is that? What is it called? It was a barista. It's a glass

117
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,000
 Cup that's a it's like it looks like a honey jar

118
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,720
 but then it's got a little beanie hat on top and a straw and

119
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,920
 This thing sold out immediately. I think it was 30 bucks

120
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:22,920
 Okay, of course, it's going for like multiple hundreds online. It's already a collector. People are insane. Yeah, as they were very

121
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,720
 shortly stocked right, of course

122
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,200
 engineered scarcity is the new normal in the dying days of capitalism here and

123
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,400
 so

124
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,320
 As you can imagine

125
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,960
 That's it. I

126
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:44,080
 Don't think it was the one with the sombrero, but it was one of the beanie hat, but as you can imagine

127
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,640
 people being people don't understand that

128
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:56,200
 Workers at the Starbucks don't really have any control over how many or where or who has bought the bear already. Ah, sure

129
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:05,240
 So I will keep this I will keep this as vague book as possible. Okay, but I will say that within

130
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,840
 The tri-state area an

131
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,160
 incident occurred

132
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,040
 where a woman

133
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,560
 Physically attacked a store manager for not having the bay. Oh

134
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,400
 my god

135
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:27,880
 Pushed her against some fucking shelves and shit like out-of-hand bullshit behavior from this customer

136
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:35,200
 Yeah, we got sorry just carry more tasers on us I think just making that more common

137
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,120
 Something man. It's just getting stupid. Well, I mean

138
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,960
 Forget it your hands to yourself

139
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,440
 It's just yeah, and then the manager

140
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,080
 Bear cups and keep your hands to yourself. No Leon

141
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:53,660
 They did not retaliate as is the way and we can't really it's just awful. Yeah

142
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,800
 Anytime I hear those stories. I try to picture that person

143
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,800
 Telling like they went home that night right or they went and met a friend later, you know

144
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,160
 And then they're like like you think they have friends. I don't think they have friends

145
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,960
 What I'm trying to get it. It's like what the hell is that version of that story where they're like, what's right?

146
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,580
 They have the nerve to not have a grizzly barista mug

147
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:22,240
 And so I attacked her. So I attacked it. They're like good for you, man

148
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,800
 Stand up for yourself

149
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:33,060
 Like the only thing that I see that's similar is the magic and Pokemon card stuff working retail now

150
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,560
 That's just the craziest. I

151
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,720
 was lucky they would we got a restock and I was able to grab a couple of booster packs to like a normal human being and

152
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,420
 That's the limit you're supposed to be able to get and you know

153
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:50,660
 The new Pokemon cards came out and I grabbed a couple booster packs and then you know the next day everything's gone

154
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:57,280
 You know hundreds and hundreds of cards everything but it's it's all scalpers. They just come in and grab it all up and

155
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,320
 Hock it on the internet for a crazy money. It's just nuts

156
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:06,360
 Briar horse fans. They don't just fight they joust. They actually will take up a long

157
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,560
 Spear from the ends of the room and they will gallop towards one another and fight. That's right fight for Briar horse

158
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,320
 Now the Briar horses are the little miniatures, right? Yeah the miniature the collectible miniature horses

159
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,120
 Yeah, they don't have they don't have horse beans. They have little horse English peas

160
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:30,360
 Mushy peas, that's right. That's right. Look at the horse beans and this one's cock. I'll pay $50, please

161
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,160
 Yeah, so my nod knock scoop is saying I saw a pic of someone weighing Pokemon packs

162
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,100
 I guess depending on the weight some are more viable than others. Yes

163
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:44,360
 That is what it's come to the scalpers go into the stores and they want individual packs to see which ones are heavier because that

164
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,320
 Indicates a you know a coating of some kind with a metallic shine or something like that

165
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,740
 And that's how they get the greater value cards for what they're buying man

166
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:59,160
 When I was a bartender people asked for like all drums or all wings for their buffalo wings. I would get pissed at that

167
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,160
 I can't imagine

168
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:08,480
 Forget it forget it and that's just it like retail don't pay enough for people to be babysitting these 40-year-old motherfuckers

169
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:15,520
 A guy got in the habit of coming in asking for all drums and like we didn't know what to do

170
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,080
 So we kept accommodating him and Billy Tierney was in one night. He goes wait

171
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,560
 Are you the guy ordering all drums? He goes he goes no stop. We can't do it. You get whatever ways you get

172
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,080
 It's done. Hell. Yeah

173
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:33,060
 Tierney is my hero. There are arguments to be made that flats are superior to drums. Yeah. Well, I do like a flat

174
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,320
 Well, we knew the person was a you know, a knuckle-dragging ogre. We knew that already

175
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,720
 Yeah

176
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
 No taste

177
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,280
 Right, right, right, but

178
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:49,280
 Yeah, I did get a nice card out of one of my packs which was cool. I got a

179
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,800
 The managers of that store. So this guy has a scale has to be like get out

180
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,080
 No

181
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,200
 No, they should be is what you should be but but no, but no, but who cares

182
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:08,720
 Ultimately, who cares if they're buying this shit? I mean, it's it's frustrating. It's awful, but it's the end of the world man

183
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,840
 All bets are off

184
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,960
 Nobody's got it. No, who's got a dog in this fight?

185
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,320
 You're gonna stop this guy from earning an extra $20. Fuck it, man

186
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,840
 If that's what he's chosen to do if he's really chosen to go, you know what you know what I'm gonna do

187
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,120
 I'm gonna fuck over every kid and collector that I know and

188
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,080
 I'm gonna get five dollars

189
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,280
 or

190
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,880
 $20 for all this headache and bullshit. I'm gonna go to how do they do it?

191
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,360
 If you said that there's a limit on how many they can buy

192
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,040
 How do they how do they go in and buy a bunch of transactions Jacob multiple transactions?

193
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:48,120
 What yep different cards different shit they just

194
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:54,640
 You just shed on my point and being like no you can't do that and then you just went off about how these people are

195
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,780
 Dickheads anyway, which one is there? Are they should we should?

196
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:04,560
 I'm saying they're dickheads. Anyway, it is not in your favor to try and stop their dickish behavior. I don't think yes

197
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,320
 It is in my store. It is I don't want to take your dickheads. I want to store. Okay. Okay, man

198
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,800
 You're saying you're saying in your store. What is this your store you're talking about?

199
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:19,920
 Elaborate your store. Tell me thank you for asking and I'm glad you guys could all be here

200
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,840
 Did you guys know that Pokemon cards are a six billion dollar a year industry in sharks?

201
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,040
 You can get it on the ground level

202
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:35,160
 With I what I call house of shards house of shards is my card store. All right house of shards

203
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:42,280
 Yeah, and and basically in there everyone has to get be I have a good attitude in the store

204
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:48,440
 Or I punch them in the intestines until they shart in a game of death in the doorway. So it's fair

205
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 So it's a gentleman's game

206
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,220
 We're all in for a gentleman's game in the store. Great. Okay in your store

207
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,360
 Yes, you have the ability to say fuck you get out of here. Behave yourself

208
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:07,040
 Don't be but also I promise you all of your product is behind glass and weigh the fuck away from their fingers in

209
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,240
 Always that what's gonna have to happen

210
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,560
 Are these fucking cards gonna have to get put in the glass cases and many are already open them up many are

211
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:21,240
 Oh, of course they are and most of them are spiderwebbed up with those, you know magnetic steely deelys

212
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:27,280
 Oh, so they can't pocket them. Yeah. Yeah, and what well in the end all kind of stuff and they got you know security stuff

213
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:34,560
 but the stuff is going for crazy money out the gate now anyway, like even just basic basic prices for bundles or get are

214
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,160
 getting very close to $100 for a box and

215
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,840
 certainly over a hundred for a box of

216
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,440
 Packs, but even just a basic box with like nine packs in it. It's like eighty five ninety dollars. It's nuts

217
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,240
 so what you're saying is that this is happening at like target or

218
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,960
 Walmart Walmart. Yeah, that's where it's really Walmart's really cracked down

219
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,180
 my Walmart has everything behind a register like there's one register at the end of the wall and it's like

220
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:08,680
 Tobacco products on register porn magazines trading cards. That's it. It's all the very

221
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,860
 Porn magazines behind those registers

222
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:20,400
 The day we have eight dollar long sleeve fake Budweiser t-shirts go steal those get out of here

223
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,080
 Over there

224
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,520
 So much

225
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,560
 So much better stuff to be stealing. It's just terrible. It's just terrible. It's also

226
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:34,520
 So the experience is I walk into a Walmart. They've now put these cards behind glass

227
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,900
 I have to like push a button for one of the Walmart workers to come over with a key

228
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:43,700
 Oftentimes. Yes, it is oftentimes and even then that person with a key they go. Hold on. I'm actually gonna weigh them before

229
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,920
 Sometimes these motherfuckers are trying way. I'm yeah. Yeah, and then

230
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:55,480
 If you're the guy with the key you have to just say like no here you're here you're - that's if that's what you want

231
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,320
 That's what you gotta get. That's what they try and they try and do that somewhat

232
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:04,880
 But also I went to my Walmart with a bathroom scale and I asked the person opening the glass to step on the scale

233
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,880
 And he said you you misread the article that you read sir

234
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,320
 You're you're not supposed to weigh me. You're supposed to weigh the packs of cards

235
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,080
 So that's what you see you have him stand on the scale and hold his hands out

236
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:27,920
 Okay, all right just hold so I gotta get a good read here, you know, they bring the little the little you know iron chef

237
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,760
 I should have brought a digital bathroom. That's what they have this analog bathroom scale is not working

238
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:38,480
 Well, they have the tiny little iron chef. I bought I brought a seesaw and some dumbbells. This is really not the way

239
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:48,120
 Just this scale I'm gonna stand here blindfolded holding this thing out you tell me where the two sides are

240
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,760
 Yeah, you're gonna just do two packs at a time and see which one's heavier and and then keep going on

241
00:19:52,760 --> 00:20:01,040
 Ridiculous yes chaotic points on chat that I used to do a trick with weight and I was clearly just trying to find the

242
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,920
 graphic audience members versus the regular audience members

243
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,360
 Need those hollow foils, baby, you know eat them we need them

244
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,400
 Yeah, but I pulled a $25 card. Just grab me a couple packs. I wasn't you know looking for anything. You're rich

245
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:21,760
 You're always exactly you're always looking for stuff, but you know, just grab a couple but what evs it's crazy

246
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,240
 The whole thing is crazy, but I have a box of a figure like a rich person of

247
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:33,280
 Pokemon and magic cards. Is there someone who like you like who like you follow on Instagram because they take their jet

248
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,600
 Is who is there a Warren Buffett of Pokemon cards? Yeah, kinda Logan Paul

249
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:44,760
 Okay, have you seen his entrance? I was okay with the question. I'm disappointed with the

250
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,040
 When he was doing his boxing, I guess his brother has continued with it more

251
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,380
 but when he started off with his boxing and stuff and his entrance stuff he had a

252
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,600
 Oh, that's right. He had a first edition charizard on a gold chain around his neck

253
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:06,800
 His big fucking flex the other person I get such on the magic side Paul brothers if they're fucking crazy

254
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:12,160
 There's only funny I think they're so evil but

255
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:22,000
 That's really funny to come out with Charizard it is funny and then they're good at being the bad guy wrestlers in real life

256
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,120
 I guess when I say I'm conflicted by the Paul brothers, I mean starting now starting this, okay

257
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:33,160
 There's the first thing that I was like, oh, that's actually kind of funny. Well, you know post Malone

258
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:41,040
 He's a giant magic head did you know that I did know that yeah

259
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:46,220
 Yeah, he bought the one ring from the first Lord of the Rings

260
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:51,780
 Special set that came out. Oh man. He spent like two million dollars to buy that fucking card

261
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,960
 That that's a card. Yeah, I thought you mean like he bought a movie proper. No, no, no, no

262
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,320
 no, they made one card of the one ring some guy found it in a pack and

263
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:08,520
 Oh, they only made they only made one because it was the one ring and they only made one car to that whole set and

264
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:15,320
 Post Malone was like I'll take that please and he bought it. So he owns that he is crazy, but posty at least

265
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,640
 Plays there's a lot of there's a couple channels

266
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,120
 I follow easier time explaining to SJ that you spent two million dollars on the card

267
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:30,360
 Or you beat up a manager at Starbucks because they didn't have the mug you're trying to buy which would need to get a manager

268
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:35,120
 The manager nope that the manager would be a much easier explanation to SJ

269
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,920
 Should be like you're an idiot and you're and you're gonna go to jail for like 30 days now

270
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,400
 I'll see you when you get out and you're still dumb if I did the card thing

271
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,060
 I think she would be so confused while she was divorcing me

272
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:55,160
 Like

273
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:00,000
 Does that person feel like they were like this the manager secretly had it was hiding it from them

274
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,200
 Like like like they know you've got more of these cups like taking a person like oh you won't sell me the barista

275
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,440
 You're waiting for the the nice. Yeah, or they think that the employees get first dibs or some shit

276
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,940
 it's fucking crazy, which they do but

277
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,220
 But they're not gonna know but they're not gonna spend

278
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:26,600
 Two hours worth to pay for a fucking bear cup most of the time, right?

279
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,920
 I remember a certain collector shit came in to the Starbucks. I worked at we actually couldn't get it

280
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:35,680
 We actually weren't allowed to buy stuff or we went on to buy it with a customer discount. We had to buy it right price

281
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:41,720
 Yeah, oh I see. Yeah, there's all kinds of rigmarole around it. It doesn't it's not enticing for

282
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:49,560
 Employees to nab the super juicy exclusive. That's why I had a house of shards. You'll see a specific section of Starbucks collectibles

283
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:57,360
 Fantastic behind the glass obviously always behind the glass and I won't let anyone who weighs more than 200 pounds go into that area

284
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:04,600
 Justice is happening

285
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:11,920
 I'll tell you who else loves a good house of shards and that is the following sponsor today's show is brought to you by

286
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,800
 a

287
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:21,040
 Guy who really guy who's really into women's beach volleyball try to convince you it's because of the sport not anything else

288
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,360
 That's from the gorilla dentist in the Bjork video in 2025

289
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:30,760
 It's guy who's really into women's beach volleyball try to convince you it's because of the sport and not anything else

290
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:36,880
 Hey, man, come over this weekend watch a little watch a little game. Yeah. Yeah

291
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,480
 Yeah, yeah, though. It's a

292
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,720
 Saratoga versus the renegades

293
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:49,200
 Uh-huh. Yeah, it's gonna be watching you're watching college beach volleyball bash on the beach, baby

294
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:56,040
 This is the big one. This is the big one. Uh-huh. Yeah, this is the one where those those college students are in tiny little bikinis

295
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,280
 Right. I mean, that's why you watch that. Hey

296
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:03,160
 This girl's very aerodynamic when they're up there getting ready for the spike. That's what I'm saying

297
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,840
 It's kind of like swimmers. They got to wear the right kind of stuff

298
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,600
 They got to shave their pubes and stuff, you know, so there's no less drag, you know

299
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,840
 You know what pubedrag I

300
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:20,700
 Wasn't aware of the pubedrag factor and oh man, it's it's it can cut fractions of seconds off your time

347
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:35,080
 It's the day before Thanksgiving is the deadline the drawing is on Thanksgiving. Therefore. You have to set up for Thanksgiving. All right

348
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,560
 There you go

349
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:45,320
 American Thanksgiving American Thanksgiving Canadian Thanksgiving. That's a good November 27th. No, you have to set up by November 26th

350
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:50,860
 That's how it works, that's how them dates work what what?

351
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:56,640
 15,000 is the number of

352
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,240
 reports that went into the Nevada DMV

353
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:07,040
 Snitches line. Oh in the first month of the of the website being active

354
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:12,700
 So people who don't know Nevada DMV has a snitch page on their thing

355
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:18,280
 If you see a car without a registration or without current registration, you can report them

356
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:24,360
 You can report your friends and neighbors. I know this is not this doesn't tie into any history at all

357
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,020
 Just just report snitch on your friends and neighbors our friends

358
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:32,280
 Multiple news outlets are reporting on this so they're getting the stats out

359
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:39,440
 But they are not saying what's driving it like I they need to find some snitches and interview them

360
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,600
 I need to know what is driving the snitchery

361
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,840
 Because here's the other thing that people don't know about Las Vegas. We're famously we don't have

362
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:56,760
 High taxes, you know no income tax that kind of stuff. So the only way the state makes money is off the DMV

363
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,040
 So our our registrations are super expensive

364
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,640
 crazy high and so

365
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,720
 But our personalized license plates are cheap. Yes. Oh, that's true. That is true

366
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,480
 I tried to get one out here and I was like sticker shock. No, thank you

367
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,320
 So this is basically like a citizen driven tax hall for the state

368
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,320
 Yeah, this is the weirdest thing. Oh

369
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:27,920
 Ten scoop in the chat says to be fair fourteen thousand nine hundred eighty seven of them were just him fucking with me

370
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:38,900
 This is never that explains all of the certified letters, but for example all of the downtown Las Vegas parking

371
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:47,520
 Is already up on this like if you go into a parking garage and your cars are registered you would

372
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,100
 The someone from the city will come into that parking garage and ticket you

373
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:56,480
 Within it within a half hour. It's some bullshit and like I

374
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:02,040
 That's basically how I get my $75 reminder that I haven't forgot to renew my car registration

375
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:08,000
 Once every so often and it always happens by going downtown to do something or see something. Oh, yeah

376
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,920
 It's always going to the bucket showed at the majestic round. We do a bucket show it cost Matt 75 bucks

377
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,960
 Yeah, that's all we don't do them every week anymore we can't do we cannot do a bucket show every week

378
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,720
 It's a loss leader and that's yeah

379
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,800
 I

380
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,700
 Ran it to our friends Scott and Hazel the other night

381
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,840
 No, no scooper Nova girl

382
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:39,240
 It's not $75 for the registration the ticket that they give you is $75 and then you have to go pay for your registration

383
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,080
 Yeah, the ticket saying hey, you're not registered. I'm like a new car if you get like a new car

384
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,720
 It's based on like how old your car is and how valuable it is

385
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,880
 Yeah, but a new car in Las Vegas will be like five or six hundred dollars for a registry

386
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,440
 Oh, no, it's more than that. What's going on? Yeah. Yeah

387
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,040
 When we got cuz we got two new cars

388
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:00,400
 This year. Yeah, it was about two thousand dollars to register both of them

389
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,000
 each of them

390
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,320
 Right now for both of them. Okay, it was about it was about it was about a grand a piece

391
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:14,840
 Yeah, it was it was like six hundred something for the van when we got the van but yeah for the for just the year

392
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,280
 Just a year. Yeah, just regular registration

393
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,840
 That's oh, no, it's crazy. That's why it's such a drive

394
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,800
 That's I'm saying like that's what that's what in terms of people listening to the story when we talk about it

395
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:30,040
 Like what is driving this is that this is how Nevada makes money. This is not Nevada

396
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:36,760
 This is how Nevada makes up for its taxes. This is a Nevada tax. Yes is what the DMV registration is. Yeah

397
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:44,080
 So, uh, I went to the party in Las Vegas, oh good

398
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,800
 Uh

399
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,000
 so

400
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:56,060
 speaker world's newest show is over at the Casablanca and it's just in what used to just be the walk-in bar area of

401
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:59,200
 Opium

402
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,760
 the little

403
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,820
 Little side restaurant area in between the old showroom and the Superfica restaurant

404
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:11,680
 Mm-hmm, and they have put together this really cool dinner and

405
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:18,840
 It's a three course for course technically for course. You can't bread and olives as a course and as you know, that's my favorite course

406
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,760
 Why wouldn't I count it?

407
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:26,000
 Nope, no bone marrow with the bread and olives. No, no, it's an upgrade. It's an upgrade. You got to get the upgrade

408
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:33,600
 But if you're at House of Sharks, the charcuterie board just comes with bone marrow. It's included. Boy your store your store is on his top-notch

409
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,640
 That's a nice door. Yeah, I really want to go to this store

410
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:42,200
 And everyone is just so nice

411
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:49,000
 You know, it's like we set the bar it's like it's cheaper I think and

412
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,720
 It's about it's still like, you know, it's 150 bucks, but

413
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:59,720
 You pay that for tickets on this town to most things anyway without food. Yeah. Yeah, and honestly

414
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,160
 It's the other part where you pay that for food in this town without entertainment

415
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:09,000
 Right. Yes, so you're getting one of those things at a deep discount. Yeah, and so it's just really intimate space

416
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,940
 I think the place holds maybe like 60 people and it's all like that

417
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:20,160
 I think it's like dinner is and it's all like little little tables and booths and I was sitting at the bars one little bar area and

418
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:27,440
 The stages is like right there. I love this stage. Actually, it's like it's like heightened and right on the top there. Yeah, and

419
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,320
 and

420
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,000
 you see like

421
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 eight variety acts and

422
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:40,360
 You get a three course meal and it's like super casual like it's actually like that you you actually get break

423
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:45,200
 You're getting breaks with both right you stop watch entertainment then you get food and you have friends there like we had other friends

424
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,560
 We're just oh, that's cool. We were just you know each course

425
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:52,920
 So you could talk in between and then shut up while the show's happening back and forth. Yes. That's great. That's great

426
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:58,800
 That's smart, especially nowadays, right? Give them a minute. Talk about it. Yeah. Yeah, like it was very much like it

427
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,360
 but I was funny was so we went and saw it and

428
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,880
 you know, it's speaker world so there's access some of these amazing acts and so the first two acts was the

429
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,160
 This great bubble act that's famously been in their shows for forever

430
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:17,560
 Where they have a person blow all kinds of different kind of crazy bubbles and make different shapes with smoke and stuff and it's beautiful

431
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,920
 It's beautiful

432
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:24,080
 Heart-touching act and then our friend Lindsey better. I think it's Howard Noddy. I think it's Howard Noddy's

433
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:28,280
 Or one of it one of his students kind of brought to Spiegel world

434
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,600
 Tin scoop reminds us that $150 is the price of a tuna sub at this subway in Orleans

435
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:38,520
 These are that is a party sub though. That is a party sub

436
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,200
 So you get to wear a hat why you eat it

437
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,240
 Your version of a party sub

438
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:52,620
 It's a regular foot log, but it comes with a hat and a hat says I spent $150 on a tuna sub

439
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,000
 so

440
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,640
 Next up was Lindsey better who headlined our VIP night

441
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,960
 Doing a shorter version of that same act a book of lights

442
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:09,140
 Remarkable at it right and especially she juggles the balls in the dark to that beautiful piano music the whole bit or whatever

443
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:13,920
 So these are both nice acts very nice partner in it as well still no

444
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,800
 No, it's just it's just in the short version. It's just Lindsey. Okay. No, Gary. No, Gary

445
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,400
 And

446
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,520
 So then the next course came out was a little break and the mater dee I guess sensing that we were

447
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,520
 Entertainment people or something. I don't or he says this to everybody

448
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,760
 But he's like, oh, don't worry. It gets weirder. It gets crazier

449
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,520
 Which so that was like some bizarre warning

450
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:48,120
 Was like wait what but he wasn't kidding

451
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:58,720
 He was correct, okay have a drag act of a person dressed as a sexy cow

452
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,640
 Yeah

453
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,840
 And then the cow does a full on

454
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:08,280
 Like dance throughout the entire room and then does an elaborate

455
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,160
 striptease of

456
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,480
 slowly

457
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,480
 Revealing its utters

458
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:24,480
 What are they what are they sequestered under like like like like like lace like lingerie and then like first like a like like

459
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,240
 It was just looks like a regular like it looks like it's one piece like it's one

460
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,800
 It's like utters that are are in like spandex or something like that

461
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,080
 Then the spandex comes off and they're like a lacy udder on the cow

462
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:42,680
 And then boom it's revealed both of the four udders and people just you know

463
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:48,580
 Know how to cheer for burlesque so the people place goes wild when the others are revealed. Yeah. Oh, yeah, and then he shoots

464
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,000
 milk

465
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 all over the like just

466
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,120
 starts shooting milk all

467
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:01,360
 And at one point singles on a guy just like blasted in his mouth for like 15 seconds. Oh my god

468
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,360
 It's milk leg all over again

469
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:08,320
 I

470
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:15,000
 Was dying laughing. I thought it was hysterical. That's great. This month is hosted by Eddie's

471
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,920
 She's filling in for the main host and

472
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,680
 One point she just

473
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,720
 Walks around with an accordion asking people for her vices and just does crowd work and just basically

474
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:34,340
 Just narrates all the sexual tension in the room with everybody and their tables

475
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:42,000
 Singing a song to an accordion and I just was like I love this act. She could do this anywhere. She could do this everywhere. I

476
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,040
 Just was like get get get scoop fest tomorrow. Let's go. Yeah

477
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:53,960
 accordion just walk around the strolling accordion fucking with people and it was like my favorite thing and one of my favorite things in

478
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,960
 the night very Judy Tanuta

479
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:01,460
 Yes, our IP. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that is the thing like there are people that we know

480
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:05,360
 There's there are several different acts that we could point at that we that we know of over the years

481
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:11,360
 Where the act is just the excuse for this talented person to be on stage. Yes

482
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:17,840
 We just we just need this talented person to be out there with a microphone on so that they can be out there and do things

483
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:22,000
 We need a reason for it. Here's an accordion. All right now go

484
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,040
 And in this tiny room, they were very inventive with like finding a way to put like an aerial act in it

485
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:33,800
 But they use like a side of the floor instead of the stage for it, but it's still like well lit and compelling

486
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,680
 cool

487
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,240
 Our friend penny is in it and she does this penny ran penny ran

488
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:46,600
 There's the fabulous penny run who I always knew was a comedic burlesque artist. She does a very not comedic a very intense

489
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:52,960
 Dance burlesque number in it that I was like, wow, this is a different side of penny. It was really compelling really cool

490
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,280
 Penny is an excellent burlesque performer and in all in all

491
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:03,460
 Types of it and like I think I don't want to speak for I think that she enjoys the comedic side of it

492
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:08,540
 Maybe more than the kind of the classic side of it. But I mean, she's got those classic chops for sure. Yeah

493
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:15,920
 It is also just like I was like this is one I left because being around speaker world in the in the

494
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,800
 2000s and the 2010s

495
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:27,880
 Boy, did the CEO really love the idea of dinner being served with acts like just kept finding every different anniversary or some kind of

496
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,960
 Celebration need be like why don't we bring in chefs?

497
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:39,120
 Get me food with entertainment, please and so I cannot this entertainment is great, but my fingers aren't greasy. You know, I

498
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,500
 Can't feel like this is just a dream come true for him

499
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,360
 But I actually love it like I think it's so smart for Vegas to have something like this

500
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:50,760
 It is is everything everything that looks like it needs to be there's a couple things happening

501
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,920
 I was like, oh these are things to note for like surviving the modern Vegas landscape and this is one of them

502
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,120
 Combining the dinner entertainment experience in a place. That's the price that you would have paid for one of those experiences

503
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:07,160
 And and then what happens is I guess the main host who at least is filling in for

504
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:15,500
 Actually meets everyone before the show like hosts everyone in the little room pants out champagne and actually memorizes everyone's name

505
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,480
 So throughout the show, that's a gimmick

506
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,520
 She just turns and will while she's doing an act like actually say the person's name like in you Tom

507
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:30,160
 You know like and just talk to people and I was like, oh wow, and then also our friend gypsy

508
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:35,140
 Walks around with these like cards that make people ask personal questions to each other as couples

509
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:39,920
 During the dinner parts of the show great and I was like again just that's it

510
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,760
 That's a small thing

511
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:48,400
 but it's a huge thing and that like we don't get to focus on ourselves during a show and this is you are making that happen and

512
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,120
 Those are two things with this happening. I was like those two small touches

513
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:56,560
 I think mean a lot for how to differentiate itself from well from Las Vegas and that is

514
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:03,460
 Part and parcel to the modern media landscape and the attention spanscape and all that kind of thing

515
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:08,560
 You know, we're all we're all dipping into our phones every five minutes. I'm as guilty of it as the next person and

516
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:14,280
 This lets you do it whilst not being rude. I think a phone dip everybody phone dip

517
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:22,780
 My phone's not even turning on what the hell? Oh, there it goes. Yeah

518
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:25,800
 I've gotten a couple of new emails

519
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,200
 None of them look important. Okay, I'm back

520
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:32,480
 Alright, I got a message from Brogan that I'll have to get back to them

521
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,280
 Leaving it on red

522
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,320
 I get it another thing. I'm very curious about

523
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,680
 Because it's way outside of my taste

524
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,520
 but I get it is

525
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,440
 the Vanderpump casino

526
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:57,480
 What a focus? Yes. Yes. See the Cromwell is turning into the Vanderpump

527
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,720
 Really? Yeah, holy shit

528
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,680
 and I'm curious if it will work because for instance one of the things like

529
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:13,180
 Vegas has been notoriously dead. It had a big spike this past weekend because of BravoCon. Oh

530
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:17,720
 Yes, so all those shows that are on Bravo

531
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:22,200
 They had a gigantic convention in town and a lot of people came to town for BravoCon

532
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:27,880
 It was really was like one of those newer conventions that took over the town. Oh cool

533
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,360
 and so like I'm curious if

534
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,440
 like niche

535
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,880
 fandom like niche community fandom

536
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,680
 can

537
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:45,520
 Fill hotels on a regular basis instead of a convention like right. Well, right is the Vanderpump reach

538
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,560
 Such that those people will like to because basically treat themselves to the experience in the hotel

539
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,000
 Of course the Vanderpump will be at the hotel, you know

540
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,480
 like will that be enough of a niche thing to

541
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,520
 Fuel because it's the only innovation I'm seeing in the casino space

542
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:08,000
 It's I mean that one specifically might be because there there are already I think three or four

543
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,840
 Large Vanderpump bars in casinos. There's one in Caesars. There's one in the flamingo

544
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,840
 That one in Caesars has been there forever and it is always busy

545
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,800
 Yeah

546
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,680
 It used to be a different thing and now it's been Vanderpump for quite a few years now

547
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,280
 And yeah

548
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,080
 I mean even just this like yesterday when I walked past it

549
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,360
 There was just a giant line out the door of people waiting to get into it

550
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,000
 Yeah, it is not slowed down. There's one in Paris as well

551
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,380
 So I mean there are a couple of those and I know they're always busy

552
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:43,400
 So it really might be and and the brand is just kind of like nice decor and good food

553
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:51,160
 Good drinks and luxury. What a brand what niche products. Do you think could bolster a full casino Matt?

554
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:55,560
 What niche fandoms do you think could hold up a whole casino like that?

555
00:45:55,560 --> 00:46:01,400
 I mean, I'm telling you right now if Magic the Gathering is popular as it is and Post Malone is as popular as he is

556
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:06,920
 If Post Malone were to somehow do one of these like David Blaine like residencies

557
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,400
 and

558
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:16,040
 And tie that in with Magic the Gathering events and you had to just simply come up with events outside of Post Malone's

559
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:22,480
 Weekends, I bet that would do well enough for a small casino. I should point out that the Cromwell is a small casino

560
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,880
 The Cromwell is on the great location

561
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:33,080
 And it certainly could use something. The Cromwell was not itself an overachieving casino. It basically was just drays

562
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:38,680
 Just drays. It just was a nightclub. It was that it was the casino that was underneath drays. Yeah

563
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:44,720
 Yeah, no, San Diego Comic-Con super Nova girls mentioning SDCC was thinking of moving to Vegas

564
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,860
 Well, I know Evo thrives in Vegas

565
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:51,080
 Evolution the evolution fighting championship, you know, that's it

566
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:55,320
 I think I think some kind of if you could properly umbrella nerddom

567
00:46:55,660 --> 00:47:02,840
 Right because that's actually what you're also trying to innovate is not just going out to Vegas, but staying in that space, right?

568
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:07,000
 But are you looking for a year-round kind of attraction? That's what I'm curious about

569
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,520
 Oh, yeah stuff makes sense to me as a convention standpoint

570
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:13,960
 But this Vanderpump thing makes sense for it because the Vanderpumps are always there, right?

571
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:18,060
 Well, there was that talk of the Atari Hotel that fell through right? Yeah

572
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:21,840
 So something along those lines, I think a video game based

573
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,760
 property could work

574
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:29,920
 Yeah video game fandom like you could be it could be like one floor would be all fighting games

575
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,960
 one floor could be shooters one floor could be

576
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,240
 competitive COD

577
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:40,040
 What I'm really kind of poking is like what what that is a great way to buy floors of fortnightly

578
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,120
 Go against the grain of what's currently

579
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:47,280
 One of the factors is currently hurting Las Vegas, which is people are feeling

580
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:53,380
 Totally nickels and dimes right price. Yeah, absolutely priced out. They don't feel like the value is there and

581
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:58,280
 Also, like because we are so feast and famine with these crazy events

582
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:04,120
 So like if you wanted to say come to Vegas just to check out, you know a couple of you know

583
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:09,820
 Area 15 a couple of museums or you know meet some friends for a bachelor party or whatever

584
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:16,760
 And if it's the same weekend as a Raiders game, you're fucked if it's the same weekend as a Taylor Swift concert

585
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:22,860
 You're fucked because every hotel raises their rates for these marquee events f1, right?

586
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:28,880
 Like you you and so now like and people people aren't planning their personal events around those kinds of things

587
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:34,800
 No one's gonna be like I want to my bachelor party in April. Oh, wait, there's a there's an event. I should move it

588
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:40,520
 They're gonna go somewhere else. They're gonna say not Vegas, you know, by the way having Monday night football

589
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:45,960
 Then a week of f1 then a Sunday football game at the Raiders Stadium

590
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:51,800
 Along with everything else that's already going on is too much stuff

591
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 It's too much stuff. I agree

592
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,740
 We found it. It is way too fucking much

593
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:03,920
 I'm working for F, you know, I'm working for Spiegelworld for f1 this year. I'm hosting

594
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:09,000
 Their ski lodge with Casey Wilson. Oh great into the show. So Casey and I have been hired to be

595
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,920
 hosts

596
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,520
 for the ski lodge

597
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:17,040
 Which is a an additional attraction within the Mercedes tent for people by the Mercedes experience

598
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:21,160
 And so we've been working on that all day and I've been I went to the track yesterday

599
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,940
 And I'm going to the track again today and we're commuting from the office to carpool and it's just a nightmare

600
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,920
 Yes

601
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,880
 Get in and out and I try to race home and there's a Raiders game and I was like, oh, I said

602
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:38,400
 I'm like really good at finding back roads, but the back roads were slammed because of the Raiders game and I was like

603
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,400
 Oh my god this town

604
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,320
 And of course, it's a monsoon this week here as well

605
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:48,920
 So we were we had to go yesterday for really? Oh, yeah

606
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:52,560
 it's been hard hard rain for four days and

607
00:49:52,560 --> 00:50:01,040
 The the lodge itself is a the attraction is not a roofed thing. It's an open air thing

608
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:08,000
 So we we we then Casey never confused like no, they still want us to come in to the track and I was like, okay

609
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 Okay, and then we so let me have a huddle up in this one area that there was still kind of building the whole

610
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,440
 There's still building the whole thing at one point Emily Wendler

611
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:22,920
 Who's who's one of the one of the writers on it was like it feels like the race up Thursday more should be done

612
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,920
 Then what's I'm seeing?

613
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,760
 Still very much putting together

614
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,020
 One of those things where they all come in at the last minute you go

615
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:36,520
 Just then they're done. That's it. I think you're confusing it with the pit crew

616
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:39,200
 No, the pit crook is the ones who build the whole thing, right?

617
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:45,600
 They set everything up and then finally the pit crew comes in and just like oh, yeah sure

618
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,200
 Done

619
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:55,960
 So we're in this one area and we're working and the power goes out because of the rain is just everywhere

620
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:02,520
 And then as we're doing boom like a leak like a big stream of water leak just burst through one of the

621
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,440
 Shit

622
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,560
 This town

623
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:12,400
 Time there is a major rainstorm. It is just hilarity

624
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,680
 Yeah, and it's not even I I would love to say that it's people's fault

625
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:20,240
 I really don't think it is because it's so dry and so hot here all the time

626
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,640
 So all of the seals like they dry out and rot and everything

627
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:27,240
 Yes, listen that dried out

628
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:33,240
 Seal can you hold any water back at all or you to dry it out?

629
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:40,320
 Is that what happened to his face

630
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,800
 Hold back the water got it right out

631
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,920
 Yeah, no, it's been it's been a lot. It's been a whole lot this week. Yeah

632
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:54,100
 But I can't wait. I have more story about wait till after the weekends over to tabulate all my stories for

633
00:51:54,100 --> 00:52:00,020
 It's been a really funny event to work. It's had some friends outside. They've been

634
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:06,040
 Setting up speakers for for the whole event there. They run the sound systems for for the whole event and

635
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:10,540
 Yeah, they were I was texting with him yesterday. They were trying to

636
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:18,040
 They had found a roll of clear plastic and they were trying to clean it. They're this queen. Okay

637
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:25,580
 They had found this role of this queen and they were trying to waterproof their golf cart so they could get from site to site

638
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:29,320
 Absolutely soaking wet

639
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:35,320
 Try to clip up this queen on the front of the golf cart to be turning it into a windshield and have doors

640
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,280
 Yeah

641
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:41,000
 We're leaving the track and then like one of the carts came pulling up one of the guys working F1

642
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,720
 Was like pull up and he slowed down he goes. So don't worry

643
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:48,020
 I'm not gonna get you wet and then keeps driving and I was like, well you can give us a ride

644
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:52,120
 You could also not leave us walking in the rain

645
00:52:52,120 --> 00:53:01,120
 Like I'll take you're not splashing us as like a bare minimum courtesy and I appreciate it but

646
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,760
 Maybe also drive us to the parking lot

672
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:23,840

678
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,880
 yes

679
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,900
 it's in their ability to cover their coughs and

680
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,320
 Just they just don't do it. No

681
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:06,400
 Well, I'm hoping to stay well during this holiday season, but I've been busy as a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest

682
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:12,960
 It's awesome though. My classes have picked up. I just started my second level one this Monday

 Locked in starting next week next Tuesday. So I'll be teaching two classes a week moving forward

 You know what I mean? Well now that it is truly getting into the cold times

690
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:59,360
 Yeah, I think I'm gonna have to just hand sanitize a little more here and there and you know, I bring water

 Staggering I feel energized after class is not drained. It's crazy. It's crazy

695
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:27,640
 I won't I won't think I'll ever do it again. I don't think I can I don't think it's I think it's unethical at this point

696
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,640
 It's just not even right to do

697
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,960
 Talked into it a few times

698
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:39,120
 Yeah, and after one I was like literally like just like bleary-eyed like like just like oh god

699
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,120
 and it was like an hour and a half and

700
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:45,840
 After they're like the team says that was great. Are you right? Of course?

701
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:51,720
 Yeah, because they just fucking vampires your whole soul. Yeah, cuz you have to give like I mean

702
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:55,400
 I give a lot in my classes, but Jesus to get it through the screen is like oh

703
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,240
 God damn it

00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:08,280
 I'm about to set up the invites for that as soon as I can figure that out

706
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:13,140
 Exactly, which levels I need to send the invites out to and how nice that which is the right ones

707
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:15,140
 I'm thinking day after Thanksgiving

00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:27,460
 Mm-hmm. All right while I was out of town. I really missed my bidet. Oh

 I just might I was like, oh now I have to take a whole shower if I want my asshole to get clean

713
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:45,640
 I am still waiting for that day that glorious day when I can get a full-on Japanese toilet installed in this place

714
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,800
 Yeah, I really want one with all the bells and whistles

715
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:52,240
 That's gonna be that's gonna be when I know I've made it that and a pinball machine

716
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:57,480
 Those are the great thing about having all the bells and whistles on there is that everybody in the house knows when you're taking a shit

717
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:00,880
 Who cares they can because they can hear all the bells and whistles. Yeah

718
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:10,280
 Paul shit again, well mine's a Japanese toilet, so it doesn't sound like that. It sounds different

719
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:21,780
 I'm a Japanese toilet. I don't sound like this. It's just take one. It's just one big gong when you when you drop the main load

720
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:32,980
 Oh, I would like that a lot

721
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:40,640

01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,040
 Pull the garden hose in through the bath

726
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:14,560
 Yeah

727
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:17,680
 You do not want to do that on a cold day

728
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:28,960
 Before you get around there be everywhere you kink the hose you kick the hose there at the very end

729
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:36,080
 Kicking that hose that's for sure

01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:44,000
 Yeah, you just put your thumb in there and just direct that right on up kink hose and club

 I'm gonna clean my asshole with a thumb on the end

733
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:58,400
 Squirt and all that water up my bum. That'll do it kink hose and club

734
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,520

 Jacinda art Ardern became just the second elected head of government to give birth while in office

 Are you Canadian? Yeah, it's right. I'm from Canada

 4 program with its workers

922
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:10,100
 That's a 10 hour workday

923
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:13,240
 For four days a week. Oh

924
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:19,340
 I see. Oh, I've done that before I did not like that a friend of mine used to do did it with his company

925
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:23,020
 And it's doing very well. I don't think this is I bet it works better for companies

926
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:26,620
 It doesn't work well for entertainment. We didn't for 12 back when we did our

927
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:32,840
 Alien stuff because it took so long to get into the makeup and oh, yeah, it helped keep

928
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:37,400
 Yeah, it was good. It worked for us. Yeah. I know there's some places in other countries they do

929
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:41,080
 720s but

930
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:43,480
 720s yeah

931
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:47,800
 Come coming to us a state near you I'm afraid

932
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:54,540
 Um, I Google

933
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:59,240
 Target oh

934
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:05,860
 It's not the 10 hours four days a week thing when a customer is within 10 feet display welcoming body language

935
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:12,880
 Was within four feet verbal greeting or offer personal assistance. Yeah, that went over like a lead balloon. I can tell you everybody

936
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:15,680
 Everybody was like eat shit

937
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:22,200
 First of all, is there any onboarding and by that I mean so like what are you gonna get like a tape measure and start?

938
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,200
 Like make sure when there's nothing I mean

939
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:30,620
 Yeah, I mean that just it seems like a bad idea all it's not as though

940
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:36,480
 The the current directives are like scowl at everyone entering the store

941
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:42,180
 You know, it's it's nothing. It's not it's all common-sense shit, but then also

942
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:51,760
 It's very clear that they have no idea what's going on on the ground level of their stores or they're just really trying to

943
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:59,000
 Shine some shit up for the investors cuz boy. Oh boy things is a rocky road a rocky road

944
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,120
 Oh great. Well, that's only change the scores Matt's ahead with

945
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:04,840
 Sorry, I just didn't want spoilers. I'm a target

946
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:11,800
 Stockholders and I have a meeting coming up. So great. No spoilers Paul. I want to leave it all for the call

947
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:16,840
 Okay, I'll keep it for the call Matt does like those investment calls

948
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:23,600
 Score check Matt has 1600. I'm down to zero now after that daily double and Paul has a negative 1200

949
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,200
 But it's Paul's turn Paul. You have multiple choice for 800 1200 to 2000

950
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:29,560
 I gotta go 2000 to get back into the positive baby

951
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:33,520
 Which college town is famous for its pepperoni rolls?

952
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:39,800
 Manhattan, Kansas Morgan town, West Virginia Stillwater, Oklahoma or Tuscaloosa, Alabama

953
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:46,760
 Well, I know it's a big thing here. It's a big thing here and we're close to West Virginia. So I'll go with okay

954
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:48,760
 All right. Let's see it

955
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:57,240
 Morgantown West Virginia is absolutely correct similar to a stromboli but smaller and less cheese mid-atlantic market has the best ones. I

956
01:20:57,240 --> 01:21:03,600
 Do not care for pepperoni rolls get out of my zone leave my zoom. Okay

957
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:07,000
 Up Paul has left Matt. You're up

958
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:12,360
 Let's see here if I I can seal the victory with 1200

959
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:15,040
 That is true. I'll do 1200

960
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:19,440
 All right, multiple choice for 1200 from Sesame Street's inception in

961
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:23,160
 1969 until his retirement in 2018

962
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:30,000
 Carol Spiney played what two Sesame Street characters Big Bird and Oscar Big Bird and Grover

963
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,280
 Count and Grover or Grover and Oscar. Oh

964
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:38,600
 Man, let's see. I believe he played Big Bird for sure

965
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:44,800
 Okay. So now is it Big Bird and Grover or Big Bird in Oscar?

966
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,880
 Mm-hmm

967
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:54,080
 Now if I get this wrong that I'm dumb that I put myself in second place. I'm a fool. I should have an 800. I

968
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:57,560
 Don't think this is why you're dumb. Oh good point

969
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:03,240
 I'm going to say

970
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:14,480
 Grover Big Bird and Grover be be Big Bird and Grover is

971
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:18,040
 Incorrect

972
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:24,960
 That is why you rarely saw both of them at the same time that was my lots of for picking Grover

973
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:31,640
 Let's see here Paul has 800 Matt has 400 I have zero

974
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:36,240
 There is a multiple choice question for 800 left and it's mine for the tie

975
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:39,300
 What global news company was started in?

976
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:45,960
 1950 when it developed a prototype news service using homing pigeons and electric telegraphy

977
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:49,120
 to transmit messages between Brussels and

978
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:51,280
 ancient

979
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,520
 Bloomberg

980
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:54,960
 routers Sky News or UPI

981
01:22:54,960 --> 01:23:00,640
 Ah

982
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:03,080
 Let's see news company

983
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:09,240
 They used homing pigeons. That's got to be Sky News, right? Let's go Sky News. See it's a good guess

984
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,520
 It's a wrong one Reuters

985
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:16,200
 And Penn loves this fact

986
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,960
 There you go according to this. Oh, there you go

987
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:27,680
 That is the game Paul wins with 800 points Matt's in second with 400 and I'm in third with negative 800 that comes from

988
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:30,440
