 Stands on cool

15
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,440
 I actually have something

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,640
 Okay

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:24,960
 We're preaching fun I had a friend's mom

18
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,240
 Buy my kid cologne for his birthday. Oh, oh

19
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,120
 oh

20
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,760
 And your kid is 11 12. I

21
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,840
 Mean that's the age

22
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,760
 Cologne that is that is dracon war age

23
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,380
 That is I went through a brute phrase not dracon war

24
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,440
 Jacquard noir

25
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,360
 was definitely the cologne of choice when I was in high school I

26
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,800
 Grew up thinking that cologne was an old-fashioned notion like when I hear the word cologne

27
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,800
 I picture like, you know

28
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:05,240
 We don't use cologne. I've never used cologne. You don't use a scent

29
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,360
 No, no, neither of you. No

30
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,040
 so I went to Walmart yesterday with my lovely wife and

31
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:20,960
 Your anniversary trip our anniversary trip. No, we're going and getting our stuff, you know, and every time I'm in Walmart

32
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:27,280
 I make a point to go over to the perfume aisle and there is generic CK one. It's called you and

33
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:34,000
 I always grab a bottle of you because that is the scent I've been using for damn near 30 years and

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,480
 I use it every day and it's just been my scent of choice and it's cheap ish

35
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,240
 I always like CK one because I started with CK one and it's just what I chose and it's been my thing

36
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,240
 But I I don't go without it and I'm out as soon as I step out the shower. I hit a little something

37
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,560
 spritzle on the clothes

38
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,480
 rub the old

39
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:01,040
 Hands together boom boom boom freshen up you said hands and you showed wrists, which one is it wrists wrists wrists wrists? Yeah

40
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, just putting colognes in your hands is really weird. That's gross. Yeah

41
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,760
 Right on my hand

42
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,800
 Fridge everything just like everything you grab just what I like that Paul's coffee cup just reeks of cow

43
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,680
 No, no, here's the thing you two have spent an inordinate amount of time with me

44
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:29,000
 And you've never noticed some overpowering odor coming from me. That's correct. I've never what I've noticed

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,080
 I don't have the greatest sense of smell but that's not to disqualify you not being a stinker room

46
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,040
 But but but on the other but I mean not all not me be a stinker room

47
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,120
 But not even me like I'm not sent forward like you don't go

48
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,560
 Oh

49
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,440
 Because there's people that wear cologne and you're like they were here five minutes ago, or maybe they're on their fucking way like you can

50
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,760
 Famously we called, you know a Wayne Newton had a crazy Lord had a crazy billowing

51
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,280
 Yes, pink pin style

52
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,240
 It's like a choo-choo the Wayne train came through

53
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,960
 And that's it when I hear cologne I think of like old-fashioned parties. I was dragged to in Monmouth County, New Jersey

54
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:16,840
 Where all the men put on dinner jackets and and had very their own stinks on them while they drank a lot of alcohol

55
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:23,340
 And I got well, that's it. It's a it's a disguise for stinks and I don't have to use much because I don't stink

56
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,320
 And I don't drink and I don't smoke. That's the other thing too

57
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,080
 If I drank and smoked it'd be I'd need something more powerful than CK one because that does not hide shit

58
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,240
 Right, but I'm curious like I just I just personally never thought to

59
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:46,000
 Ever where my wife never mentioned it. She doesn't do a lot of perfumes either. She might get a little bit of something

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,340
 She just nice lotions and things like that. Sure, like we and then I use like

61
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,240
 a pleasing natural musk

62
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:59,680
 Always say about your wife. That's what she says. That's all that people talk about to her. It's just her must

63
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,280
 Pleasing natural much. Yeah, she's like it when I tried when I tried talking about her must she's like get in line

64
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,640
 So many people just talking about my musk all day

65
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:14,400
 If you send me an email is she selling her urine for hunters boots, is that what's going on now? Yes

66
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,760
 Attracting attracting dancers in the wild that they can yes the bow and arrow. No, it's hunter Biden

67
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:29,080
 She's she's putting her piss on hunter Biden's boots go to hunt hunting boots piss Vegas and you'll see my wife's website right there

68
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,560
 Or

69
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:40,420
 But I'm curious if like what I'm curious about the people if if you know, I'm in my late 40s, right?

70
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,880
 So we do late 40s early 40s late 30s

71
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,720
 It is more or more people wearing cologne in general

72
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,860
 Like or am I like am I wrong and thinking that was an old-fashioned notion because to see it come back with younger kids

73
00:05:53,860 --> 00:06:00,160
 Is interesting to me, but maybe I'm just wrong and a lot of people were column

74
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,000
 I want to know in the chat. We have enough people here. I wear cologne

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,800
 Paul's a cologne guy

76
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,080
 Jacob even you you get spritzed up when you go out to you don't never thought you never think to go cologne

77
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,080
 No, I never do cologne. I'll do like maybe a little aftershave or something

78
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:24,060
 Okay, but even even that like I don't want I don't want an aftershave that smells. Yeah, I don't like having a scent. Yeah

79
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,560
 Like in high school there were times that I had cologne like there were there. I definitely put cologne on in high school and stuff

80
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,140
 I think by the time I was in college though, I was done with cologne

81
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:40,240
 So sounds like there are some three guys have chimed in they all wear a little cologne like a very like they're talking about Paul style

82
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,440
 Oh very little a little amount of all right a little dabble. Do you?

83
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,560
 Do you do the clown you walk through the cloud?

84
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,560
 I use it. It's honestly it's kind of like aftershave

85
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,280
 So, you know cuz you know, I dry shave

86
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,600
 Yeah, I'm not dry dry by use a little bit of water

87
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,780
 I use a little bit of water and all razors now have a little lube strip on them

88
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,100
 So it's not really dry shaving but nobody likes a lube strip more than me

89
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,960
 Yeah, so, you know a little bit of that and I basically after out after the shower. It's almost like

90
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,200
 aftershave, you know

91
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:22,520
 Something keeps the bumps chill and whatnot. And yeah, and I spray it right on. I don't I don't do the cloudy walkthrough thing

92
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,440
 Okay, according to to this Gen Z is big into cologne. Yeah, well, that's what I'm saying

93
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:35,280
 It's definitely the young people it's back in for sure. So it's just a generation perhaps. That's it. That's it. I'm wondering

94
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:42,920
 And also this is talking about having a fragrance wardrobe, which is apparently a popular thing

95
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:51,360
 Which is multiple fragrance fragrances in your collection and you select the fragrance that you feel is most appropriate for that that day

96
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,840
 Well, I was like something that but that feels like something that happened to me. I never get one of anything

97
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:03,160
 I definitely feel like maybe you could do a little laughter what I was like I have like eight beard oils

98
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,400
 I don't use in my house different places

99
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,320
 Cuz I like go get the go get the purple bottle off of daddy's smell shell

100
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,840
 You haven't gotten into the beard oil habit yet. My wife didn't like it

101
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,400
 I kissed her once with beard oil on and she was like pissed off and I was like, all right

102
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:23,680
 Well, it was it too much. Yeah, it's easier to have beard dandruff than it is to to put accidental beard stink on my wife

103
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,360
 So I like doing the beard oil when my beard is a little longer

104
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,520
 I don't like when I've got I've got my beard trimmed very short right now

105
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,400
 I like it when it's when I've got it a little fluffy and then I like the beard oil

106
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,240
 That's part of my daily regimen to

107
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,320
 Sebastian Menescalco. Am I saying the name right? The special medicine. I'll go I think is that stand-up comedian? Oh

108
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,760
 He did a live episode on Amy Poehler's podcast. It's really great highly recommend

109
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,960
 and

110
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,680
 he wears

111
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,900
 Two colognes one on the front and one on the back

112
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,300
 Sebastian come on

113
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,280
 So this is what I want to talk about like this is coming and going I can't imagine

114
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,880
 I mean, that's a lot of work to build up a cologne

115
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,560
 wardrobe because

116
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,240
 Wardrobe because everybody's body chemistry reacts differently to sense

117
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,720
 So you got to find the one that that hits home and for me one just doesn't

118
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,360
 Doesn't rock the boat like whatever I oh whatever I got going on

119
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,840
 Jives with ck1, but there have been times when I've tried a little like Burberry and whatnot

120
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,880
 And it just it's like the vibe is off kid. Yeah, I

121
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:38,800
 Think I'm gonna start just taking tiger snake whiskey and using it as aftershave and just letting that be my my musk

122
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,620
 That's not wrong. Do is take a drink of it, and then it will just ooze out of your pores

123
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:51,520
 Fucking how much that fucking Duke Cannon shit that I stock on the target shelves every day

124
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,760
 Yeah, it's all bourbon barrel infused shit. So you might as well

125
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,100
 It's all bourbon. This is another another cologne. It's it soaps. It's it's aftershaves

126
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,660
 It's a shame. I was gonna say same with a beard oil as well. Yeah, all of it all of it is

127
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,240
 oakwood bourbon

128
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,420
 Barrel infused shit. Yeah, everything smells like a basement in, Kentucky

129
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,320
 Kind of does it kind of does you know?

130
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:26,840
 Yeah, well, that's interesting. So do you are you are you encouraged by your son getting into scents now?

131
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,700
 Or no, I was way too early fucking 12 fuck off. No, I

132
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:37,680
 Too much you hate it because it's your kids growing up mice exactly. My son was starting to look so adults

133
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,880
 Yeah, and then he had to get braces and I literally picked him up from the orthodontist and I was like, oh, thank God. Oh

134
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:49,520
 He looks like a kid. Oh, thank goodness. He was literally just starting to just look like just a

135
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:56,400
 Just a man. Yeah, it was yeah, really really that had me up. I know it's inevitable insurance the other day

136
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
 Well, he's been doing that since eight

137
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:05,300
 I guess first he convinced me that my current insurance was not was not good enough

138
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,880
 Healer is there he is unlicensed and and that is not FDIC insured just so you know, but

139
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:20,280
 Like the FDIC is gonna be existing in like your son will pay out though

140
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,960
 Automobile accident. I feel like your son's gonna take care of that's true. That's true

141
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:35,160
 Gear a scoop has said braces the puberty and virginity extender

142
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,040
 Certainly helped in my situation. Oh boy

143
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,800
 It does not seem to be a deterrent

144
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:50,720
 Socially at all not anymore. Yeah, I don't think so. No, that's everybody like all kids now have braces

145
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,780
 No, yeah, they do most kids do and I feel like it's a much more common thing now

146
00:11:54,780 --> 00:12:00,480
 It wasn't completely outrageous for me. You know a lot of people still had braids. Oh, they're also doing them younger

147
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,560
 Yes, that's for sure. Yes

148
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,280
 It's very rare that a kid in high school has braces now. They do them all in the middle school years

149
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:13,320
 Yeah, they do that because younger gums it works faster. Yeah

150
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,720
 Yeah, Oh

151
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,720
 Garry scoop is saying our braces

152
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,800
 smaller than they used to be

153
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,640
 Maybe you're scooping the chat is saying that braces are super tiny and minor now. I think they're asking

154
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,700
 The things that they're able to stick to the teeth

155
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,640
 That day yeah, they seem smaller to me. I just got a big gold grill

156
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:40,440
 It's just a big it just holds those teeth and just move it. I have you seen those people that wear their grills too long

157
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,440
 And it fucks up their teeth forever

158
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:50,680
 It's the nastiest thing they just keep they keep them in it's like months and it's because it's a visible version of Invisalign

159
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,800
 Oh, no, but it's not even no not invisible. It's like just not they're not

160
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,740
 No, that's what I'm saying is the grill is acting like just a visible

161
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,800
 Invisalign, but it's just not even helping anything

162
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:11,080
 Gross doing what braces do but in the wrong direction

163
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:19,420
 Galactic president scooper star McScoops a lot has a great question in the chat

164
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:25,800
 Did the boys convince you or did the HOA convince you to do anything about the giant skeleton in your front yard?

165
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,160
 Giant skeleton is still up in my front yard

166
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,800
 And that's the way on the with we keep joking that we're gonna put a Santa Claus hat on it

167
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,920
 I've been HOA will not approve of that

168
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,960
 Most of the problems can't ask permission you can't ask permission. Oh, no, we're not gonna ask permission, but I just

169
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,880
 I think we just still get fine. That's what I mean

170
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:54,260
 The skeletons head is bigger than mine, so I have some big Santa Claus hats, but not big enough for the skeleton

171
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,480
 So I got I got I gotta go out. I'm sure it's just a quick search on

172
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,840
 The internet will get me a giant Santa hat for the for the head

173
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,080
 But plus I think a little saccharine is on this back there

174
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:13,040
 But the problem is simply that it's a two-person operation and my wife and I first I was away and then my wife's so busy

175
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,600
 That like we literally we literally just huddled up right now for like just to finally have an hour to play out the next two weeks

176
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,120
 I have no idea what we're gonna

177
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,320
 Right. Oh good news

178
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,700
 Home Depot sells a Santa hat to go with that skeleton. Yeah, there's no doubt. There's no doubt

179
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,640
 What about putting in the pool? I did a Google search for giant skeleton hat and and that popped right up

180
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,640
 Could he just live in the pool?

181
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:46,600
 That's pretty great, yeah, that's pretty great

182
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:54,080
 Yeah, those bones will probably dissolve in the glory. You think maybe I don't know. It's probably not

183
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:01,300
 It's probably not good for the or it'll activate the spell that lies within the skeleton and he will simply grow magic

184
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:08,600
 An animated one way or another something's going down. Yeah, it's not one way or another. It's not gonna be safe

185
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:16,600
 It's gonna be unfortunate. Well, I got through yet another round of eyeball testing. Oh

186
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,280
 And it was kind of crazy

187
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,740
 Went in. Yep. This is an eyeball. And yeah, I'm certified eyeball and

188
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,240
 We've done every test that we can except for the dye test

189
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,160
 So he was like you wanna just do the dye test and get it done

190
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,800
 I'm like great so they could detect any possible swelling or whatever. I'm like sure

191
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,200
 Yeah

192
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:43,320
 So they had to put dye in me and then quickly get a bunch of pictures of my eyes and then we looked and no

193
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,200
 There's no swelling. Okay, so everything's everything's written off except I have

194
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,540
 Crummy veins and there's really nothing I can do about that

195
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:59,900
 Until things go take catastrophically wrong. So I'm going back in in seven weeks to see if things are better or worse the yellow dye

196
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,900
 Yes, it was very low

197
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:08,580
 So as you know as they're doing it and everything they're like so you're gonna notice discoloration in your urine and stool

198
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,560
 That's gonna last a day or two. I'm like, okay cool

199
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:17,400
 but then I'm getting ready to go back to my car and I might well better hit the head before I go and

200
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,140
 Swear to god. It was the secret of the ooze

201
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:31,040
 So it was fluorescent fluorescent that's what it's supposed to be it was fluorescent I was like

202
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,720
 Cooler shoot now your urethra

203
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:42,840
 Yeah, yeah that well and I'm afraid of no ghost it was well, okay

204
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:51,420
 Actually, I share this is this this is too much. Wait a minute. Hold on the things that you shared without this question is been

205
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,080
 Paramount to this podcast. I can't believe whatever you're about to say

206
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,720
 seems

207
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:11,900
 I've been peeing for a day basically and it was still pretty bright and I was like

208
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,220
 Well, this is this is throughout. Yeah, this is this is corrupting everything

209
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,880
 so in the in the in the

210
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,360
 interest of science I

211
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,520
 Had to bust one out and see what was going on

212
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:35,140
 And I'm here to tell you that permeated

213
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,160
 I literally fired off some straight up

214
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:55,360
 My no-no-no-no video my no nut November was done done a while back

215
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,240
 But but I also thought I also thought not only in the interest of science

216
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:05,920
 But also I thought probably good to get this out of every part of my system that it could be lingering. Yeah time to flush, right?

217
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,320
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so that's what you know, just general maintenance

218
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,480
 What's going on?

219
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:21,860
 There's a thing as I'm doing this as I'm thinking about it how many times

220
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,560
 Have because guys are the worst

221
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,820
 How many times have guys had a die?

222
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,840
 situation and

223
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:38,520
 Then had a romantic interlude not long after and what does that do to the possible children conceived?

224
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,800
 let alone

225
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,560
 the kind of

226
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,520
 Intimate moment you're having like oh, I thought you I didn't realize that's where you're going with this

227
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,760
 I thought you were concerned about the fluorescent pearl necklace that I was giving

228
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,800
 After getting my I died

229
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:03,680
 I thought I thought you were worried about your gym socks glowing in the dark when you try to go to sleep or something

230
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,520
 Here's the thing

231
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,580
 Yes, so this is this is the other thing too. It's like

232
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,160
 is this dangerous and

233
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,440
 If it's not that dangerous

234
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,360
 Then I think we've found a weird

235
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:23,900
 Porn subculture thing here, maybe a kink. Yeah, right people who fire

236
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,840
 Upside down spider-man

237
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:35,280

 You leave me there for a week and then I start to reek

 You spent on to me

 Long story short several months later. A coffee cup was found. Oh

 Wasn't even gonna try to remember his name. He was amazing. So I was

303
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,800
 This is a abracadabra spoiler. So I but I guess you know, we're here

304
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,520
 That is the reason why you don't see me on this season of

305
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,720
 I was in the chamber as an emergency guy

306
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,440
 we lost a couple of people to do for different reasons and

307
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,880
 I was being

308
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:19,000
 Primed up to do some kind of version of my card stab or ring trick routine for fool us and then all of a sudden

309
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,460
 It was like no, never mind. We got this guy and of course, I was like

310
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:30,840
 You know and I think he came out and he was he just killed he just killed so yeah, he was there just as a friend

311
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,600
 Helping out John Carlos Scalia

312
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,440
 Who's who aired an earlier episode this season and they used to have done a two-person show with each other in Spain

313
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,720
 And so it was another thing. It's like the same way they got

314
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:50,160
 Danny D or tease on they simply said like you're here. Like you're right here. What are you? Why are we not doing something?

315
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,800
 Just do it. And so he showed him a couple stuff. And yeah, he went on there and fooled the shit out of him. So yeah

316
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:00,420
 And so did John Carlo. So and I've worked with John Carlo a bunch on the Princess cruise ships

317
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,420
 he's the nicest guy and

318
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:08,480
 As someone said on abracadabra, maybe the only person who can just totally successfully use charm as misdirection

319
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,480
 Just just totally can just be so

320
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,120
 Charmingly goofy and whatever that you just you just take your eyes off of everything he's doing. Yeah with his hands

321
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:21,880
 It's it's really they're they're both just killer killer guys. Yeah, they're great

322
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:27,640
 Yeah, he was amazing. Yeah, this is a good the episodes. I've seen a fool us this season, man

323
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:32,560
 They it is it is a good season to fool us. It is we don't know what the future holds

324
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:37,800
 You know, we they took the season and split it in half, right?

325
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:42,400
 So the air 10 episodes and gave like a big four-month gap and then now they're airing the other 10 episodes

326
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:50,940
 The reruns get the same exact ratings as the new episodes, which is usually a bad sign for TV things

327
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,580
 We've done over 140 episodes

328
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:58,980
 so there's certainly enough to syndicate to the end of time and that includes getting rid of three seasons of

329
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,400
 The kovat seasons, which they don't seem to rear as much

330
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:08,320
 Studio audience. Yeah, I think those episodes are now covered with the last two seasons

331
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,760
 And so I don't know and also what is CW in this modern media landscape?

332
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:23,040
 Is anything it's it's a really weird is not been gobbled up by any of the major streamers. It's still its own app

333
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,000
 It's still a network television show which means it still airs on rabbit ears

334
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,160
 and

335
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:33,400
 So I don't I don't we don't we don't know so we so it's all it's all up in the air

336
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,000
 I I just don't I don't know what anything in TV means anymore

337
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,760
 No that point now. We're like all of our experience in in television entertainment

338
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:50,800
 Doesn't mean anything at all. The models certainly aren't there anymore that we now came up with. It's so strange

339
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:57,480
 It really is a very strange time specifically for television and and yeah, it is it is weird. And so yeah

340
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,240
 You know

341
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:06,440
 Would Penn and Teller wants to do another season would would they want to maybe try a new show somewhere else?

342
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,040
 I don't know, you know that kind of stuff. So I mean we did

343
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:15,360
 11 seasons and secretly like 13 and a half seasons if you do it by a regular episode count

344
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:22,480
 And so that's just a whole lot of TV and a whole lot of cool stuff. So I I don't know and how

345
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,360
 It's that many seasons over how many years now?

346
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,200
 gosh

347
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,020
 It's over a decade. Yes, it's definitely over a decade. Yeah. Yeah, I'm trying to think when I started well

348
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,020
 Yeah, so my kid was born

349
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,920
 Yeah, it's been a decade. It's been a decade. Oh, there you go

350
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,120
 Yeah, yeah, so my kid was born my second kid was born during the first season. So oh, yeah

351
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,640
 They're a supernova girl season one was 2011. Yeah

352
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,000
 There you go

353
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 Yeah, so I mean it's that's

354
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,680
 That's a run. Yeah. Yeah, he's coming over

355
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:59,360
 I'll talk about the original season of air in England too. So season two is where I kind of start the American

356
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:05,880
 Season all right, it's been ten years since it was refired up in season two and goes on. Yeah. Yeah

357
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,880
 Are they thinking about a new show man?

358
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,980
 There always are they always are they always are

359
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:16,520
 Yeah, the new show that they're talking about doing it. It's not gonna be as difficult to get a trophy

360
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:21,800
 It's just fool Matt Donnelly. Yeah. Yeah, it's just just gonna be like if you don't get one

361
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
 It's gonna be like what's wrong with you

362
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:30,040
 Injured piff, yeah

363
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:35,500
 No, it's strange it's strange to be busy enough that I don't need it, you know

364
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,560
 I think I think that was always like the weird thing of like all right any time full scale. I was like, oh good

365
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,560
 That was always a nice nice thing

366
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,120
 and I think also like

367
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,780
 I've really gotten like it like I heard I

368
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:52,200
 Heard me something about another magician. They're gonna put they're putting together TV special for a magic

369
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:59,760
 Okay, and I'm not necessarily on this magician's radar, but like people around him are and I am actually like I

370
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:08,680
 Think because we're gonna show like I have I understand magic for TV versus magic for magic sake pretty well

371
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:14,340
 And it's like probably true and I was like I should be at least get a phone call from one of these people, you know

372
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:19,520
 It's like and so I am a little bit like oh wait if this shows over I need to figure out how to put

373
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,160
 Myself out there more as a possible right like, you know

374
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:28,860
 Lower level producer. Yeah. Yeah, cuz of like I really do I did learn so much

375
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:35,720
 Sure show and I think I could help a lot for something like that. But yeah, yeah, we'll see

376
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,720
 I bet you could buy the CW

377
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,600
 It's on the block

378
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:47,260
 Yeah, my improv classes are going great. I just got done with my first

379
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,160
 level one

380
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,880
 four-week class and nice

381
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:57,640
 I had a couple students who were so jazzed that they wanted me to keep teaching and go on to level two and

382
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:03,280
 I was like, well, I don't have a level two class scheduled right now, maybe next year and they were like nope

383
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,360
 Let's get this going and so they contacted

384
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,720
 and and made a made a

385
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,720
 thing and and and got

386
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,520
 got things moving forward and

387
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,480
 holy shit

388
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,560
 Justin was up for it and

389
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:27,360
 They've got five students registered so far out of my class and they're gonna get a couple more hopefully and oh good

390
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,800
 By the this next month. I'll be teaching two classes a week. So whoa

391
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:39,400
 Yeah, I'll be doing a level one. I'm still doing on my level one again and a level two. So it's great

392
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,700
 So we are doing what I was hoping to do which is build out

393
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:51,720
 Improv community in Pittsburgh. It's gonna take some time, but it's gonna happen. I believe we'll see. Oh nice

394
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,120
 Yeah, so that's going really well

395
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,080
 Thank You bossy. Yeah, it's uh

396
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:04,560
 it's just a you know, it's what I've been hoping for and I'm still teaching the occasional free class over there at the

397
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:10,240
 Pduty network, so that's gonna happen. So I'm gonna go do that next Tuesday

398
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:18,480
 Then the Tuesday after that provided everything's lined up will be rocking and rolling with the Tuesday classes, too. So

399
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,520
 very encouraged with that

400
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:29,960
 Let's go. Yeah making some more headway with getting getting further away from retail gigs and more and more into

401
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,440
 this thing, although

402
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,520
 today

403
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:39,760
 today we went and bought some stuff for Anne's garden and in the

404
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:47,280
 Complex where we ship in no, we did I know the complex where we went. What do you know?

405
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:55,000
 There's a brand new bricks and minifigs store opening up and I'm like, oh shit

406
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:02,760
 So for those of you who aren't familiar, this is a chain a franchise that actually deals in used Legos and repurposed leg

407
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,800
 so

408
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:09,080
 Uh-huh. So I think they're not gonna open till summer next year

409
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:14,360
 It says or or spring at least so I'm gonna work like I'm gonna try I think

410
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,440
 Might as well right if the if the compensation is comparable

411
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:25,360
 What the fuck? Yeah, I could spend all day fucking around with Legos and hosting kids Lego parties rather than

412
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,560
 Shoveling coal, you know, this is gonna be like Ellsroth at the weed place

413
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:35,360
 You're just gonna rise up there without trying and you're just a king, right? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, man

414
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,380
 Did you hear about the weed stuff though? That's that was if my first thought was Ellsroth today. What happened?

415
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,540
 No, they have our Congress has decided to outlaw weed again

416
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:48,680
 Nationally what? Yes

417
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:54,880
 Couldn't possibly be a distraction from other things. But yeah, that's what they put in that fucking

418
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,000
 Open the government back up bill that weeds gonna be illegal nationally in 26 again

419
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,560
 I know right. Yeah, why?

420
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:09,080
 Why indeed it's almost as though they're trying to sabotage the country

421
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:14,320
 It's almost as though they're trying to just bring it to the brink of no, I mean, I mean like, okay

422
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,560
 Sure, because I can't I've

423
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:22,320
 It's a weird time and Paul's more right than wrong about this crazy shit, but

424
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,320
 Like

425
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,840
 Like okay, why isn't the government bill is what I mean?

426
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:33,240
 So in other words, why was it allowed to be part of the opening up of the government again?

427
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:40,760
 Like is it helping prisons? Is it helping? Yes. Do you know what I mean? That's exactly it. It's helping private prisons getting private

428
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:46,600
 Yeah, getting more people because private prisons are complaining that they're not getting enough people so they need something else criminalized again and

429
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,480
 the liquor industry wants their

430
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:56,340
 Liquor money back from the people who are have found out that weed doesn't make you want to kill your family as much as

431
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:59,200
 alcohol does

432
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,400
 Feel like I still want to kill my family as much I don't know man

433
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:09,400
 But you're like, oh the knife's all the way over there and my family's all the way over there

434
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,520
 I'll do it tomorrow either of them next to chips

435
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:17,160
 Oh my god, Mike or my family

436
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:24,080
 Totally calling me out said I can't work at the bricks and minifigs place because I kept saying Legos when it's just Lego. Oh

437
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:30,160
 No, it is true. They are they are pedantic about that. Although bricks and minifigs

438
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,120
 So I don't have to say fucking Lego at all. I just bring your bricks and minifigs. How about that?

439
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,720
 Figs is a weird. I've never heard that term

440
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,160
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah

441
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:47,040
 Yeah, bricks and minifigs many figures. Yeah, many figs. Yeah bricks and minifigs is a like I said, it's a it's a franchise

442
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,880
 So yeah, that's what they call the minifigs

443
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:56,040
 Any Lego figures? Oh minifigures figs is for figures. Yeah. Yeah minifigs. Yeah

444
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:03,480
 Not when you said bricks and minifigs at first I was picturing some like tawny like upper middle class place for like bricks

445
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:09,040
 Like brick brick like masonry. Oh how funny trees and like beautiful things like that

446
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:15,500
 Nope, I'm talking about tiny lot of cologne a lot of tiny tiny little Lego men

447
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:20,440
 That's all it is teensy little Lego men. These are looking at this stuff here

448
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,680
 I don't know if this is about weed as much as it's about hemp

449
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:30,420
 Well, it's saying THC products. So it's no products that contain a certain amount of THC

450
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,320
 or

451
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,180
 or what's the other active thing that's going on to the

452
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:42,000
 Any of it, but anyway last night the Senate passed a continuous CBD CBD. That's it along with oh, there you go

453
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:49,280
 Yeah along with three appropriation bills one of which an agricultural appropriation bill effectively shut down the US hemp industry

454
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,880
 well

455
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,800
 That's one way to put it

456
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:59,280
 Growers use the the plant cannabis sativa to produce both hemp and marijuana blah blah blah. I

457
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,160
 Don't know this weird. It's fucking weird like I'm looking through it now

458
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,480
 I can't really read through the whole thing on the air right now, but like I'm looking through it right now and good

459
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,640
 That's true. I guess

460
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,440
 We are nothing if not a marijuana forward

461
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:33,080
 Thing like I I am the least smoky of all of us as in I have never I have never imbibed and even a gummy

462
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,740
 You know, I'm just not a drug dude

463
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:41,120
 But I I am very much an advocate of of all of it because you know

464
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:45,380
 I've seen the good effects it can have on people and it can make people feel good and

465
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,920
 mitigate pain I

466
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,180
 first of all that once lived in the Virgin Islands, so we're going to go over my partaking of weed, but

467
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,960
 What in the Virgin Islands?

468
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,880
 You know, you know, you don't live in a tree house in the Caribbean and not smoke weed

469
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:09,540
 Residents you lived in was constructed of help

470
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:16,560
 Was just weed just weed. Yeah, just lived in weed. Yes

471
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:23,760
 It like literally like in a movie like washed up we went I'm at a giant garbage bag of a wash up on shore

472
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:31,000
 Everybody was it just like Christmas we made oh that ended up leading because it wasn't good weed

473
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,560
 So then leading to my friend Colin making what I called instead of weed cookies

474
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:41,880
 He made weed briquettes is what I call them. They came out green. It was like it was like your it was like your gym

475
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,880
 Sock Paul. It was neon green

476
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:51,300
 And they were so strong people accused him of lacing them with other illicit substances

477
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:56,240
 Which is hilarious just because he was Rosseferian and like really just believed in like just it was just skunk weed

478
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,420
 He's like no, it's such a density cooked into the cookie. It was like sugar. Yeah

479
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:08,900
 We were there was more weed than sugar. You're just feeling the power of jaw. It was weeks of the craziest behavior

480
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,480
 Pandemic

481
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:23,240
 Company but I bet nobody nobody got hurt nobody gotten a brawl

482
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:28,840
 People got people got paranoid and I'm stuck on like a little island key like a story island

483
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,100
 Like for like hours because they were afraid to go back in the water

484
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:40,920
 They were worried about their ability to swim to shore so there was an incident there was an incident of survival nobody was hurt

485
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,000
 It's it's you know, and like you said, I hate that I'm the diet of exposure on that island

486
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,920
 Injured before dying. I hate that I'm more right than wrong on this stuff

487
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,680
 but I think you know weed is such as such a good calming effect on a lot of people and just chills folks out and

488
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,280
 Alcohol just get some amped and people are gonna turn to whatever substance they need to

489
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,580
 Day, I actually thought like I thought I thought

490
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:10,960
 Legalizing weed in Nevada wouldn't be that big of a deal wouldn't change things and it right was I wrong?

491
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,240
 Like it changed things everything you can't walk down the street without smelling it exactly

492
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,640
 I don't enjoy the effect that weed has had on Vegas

493
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:26,600
 But my answer to that is not jail my answer to that is not and let's get also nice involves

494
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,760
 But also the it's capital punishment. That's that's a kill people

495
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,200
 Yeah, the fact that you can't walk down a Las Vegas Street without smelling weed

496
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,380
 Tells you if you're not brain dead that oh fuck

497
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,720
 They are selling tons of this shit

498
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:46,120
 This is an industry the stereotype of old cab drivers as they would take

499
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,680
 Whatever

500
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,760
 Yeah, but they would you know, not the one you asked for but the one that paid the cabbies the most

501
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,960
 Yeah, right and that has now changed to weed dispensary. Yeah

502
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:03,240
 Yeah, well remember how we were talking even before like we there's before I moved there was still a real

503
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,320
 Possibility that we could have been really fun

504
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,200
 dispensary

505
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,200
 Entertainment right? Yeah, there's gonna be the easiest job in the world

506
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,240
 exactly

507
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:24,000
 A couple of places here have tried the the cannabis lounges and nobody has figured it out yet

508
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,360
 Yeah, how to do the lounge? Yeah, what's the time?

509
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:34,580
 I'm just like hanging around and getting high somewhere else. It isn't that appealing to people. It's not it's not it's not working with stand-up lineups

510
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:41,560
 That's for sure. Well, I suppose if if one of the major side effects is paranoia, you don't want to be in a strange place

511
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:46,040
 well, this is that they have all these different strands now that one can you know, the

512
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:52,640
 Paranoid man, this is just gonna give you a real mellow trip. Yeah

513
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,400
 Yeah, and it tastes like ice cream. So let's go. I just saw a video

514
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:05,840
 Some cannabis celebration and somebody had rigged up an apparatus where they had a giant

515
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:13,040
 Stack of weed inside what amounted to a stovepipe and that stovepipe was directly

516
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:18,400
 built on top of and Jerry rigged to and taped up to a leaf blower and

517
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:27,120
 So somebody lit all the weed with a blowtorch in the top. Oh, yeah, the stovepipe they turned on a leaf blower and it just

518
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,960
 For like two minutes straight just billowed weed smoke

519
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,080
 It just looked like a haunted house

520
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:41,360
 We call that the dandy isn't that dandy? It's the dandy is that it was

521
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,080
 Crazy, it was crazy

522
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:50,320
 It was wild to see and just people just getting face full of weed smoke from a blower

523
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:55,680
 From a leaf blower. The whole room was just coated. Yeah. Yeah

524
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:02,520
 So but yeah that real that really bummed me out this morning and my first thought was Ellsroth because he has found something

525
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:07,880
 He's exceptionally good at he's enjoying the shit out of it. He's trying to entrepreneurialize with it

526
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:15,800
 All right, he's become a true character man. Right and this is the machine, right? This is exactly why I'm like that's America

527
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:23,360
 That's fucking capitalism true. That's that's get it done and they're just putting a kibosh on it

528
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,640
 Then I guess I guess we should fuck. I'd be curious. He's probably working which why he's not here, but be curious

529
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:35,560
 But that's what they're saying what Ellsroth saying what they're saying at his work. I'd be good. Well, we've got a day here

530
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:39,800
 Maybe we can try and get him on tomorrow because we're doing it again tomorrow

531
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,560
 Yeah, maybe we could get him in to chime in cuz yeah

532
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,320
 I would love to hear the initial cuz and I'll give it a day to stew cuz it just hit today

533
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,880
 So, uh, yeah, let's let's hear it. Let's hear it

534
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,940
 Speaking of hitting today

535
00:43:53,680 --> 00:44:01,620
 So the the new federal funding legislation moving through Congress is expected to impact the sale the sale of hemp driven THC products

536
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:06,720
 But not state regulated sales of recreational metal medical marijuana

537
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:12,840
 Medical yes, it's CBD

538
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:20,760
 It looks like though from this from this other article that I'm looking at over here from the cannabis business times comm

539
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:27,660
 Oh, you can't sounds that they sound very CBT. Let's not let's right you can a business. It's right there

540
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:34,840
 Can a business times it should be candid times and it's definitely looking at it again. I was wrong

541
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:38,500
 No, it's cannabis business times. It's right there. You got a guy got to make some calls

542
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,040

 No, I only take my news from this time. This is Hannah the times of cannabis business weekly

545
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:55,980
 Times of cannabis business weekly is out of the that's out of the realm. You know, I'm pretty leftist

546
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:59,160

547
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,040

00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,560
 Yeah, this looks like it might be

553
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:29,120
 according to the what should be the cannabis miss times

554
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:35,640
 Would prevent the unregulated cell of intoxicating hemp based or hemp derived products

555
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:41,360
 Including Delta 8 from being sold online in gas stations and corner stores while preserving non

 That's the thing. Is it just stupid? We've gotten to this point. We've gotten this we don't we've had nothing but wild success

 By the way, Matt, it looks like next our media group already owns the CW. Oh

589
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:25,680
 Okay, we already owned

590
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:32,640
 They they own the biggest chunk of it and then like paramount and a couple of other

591
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:40,600
 Groups like that own like 12 percent stakes here and there. Oh, no. No, I think I understood that they're yeah

592
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:45,560
 I mean, I knew they had some organization behind them and next are I didn't know was next are but yeah

593
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:49,980
 They're already the big dog, but but doesn't but it's sure that they're there's still an independent

00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:55,020
 Independent. Yeah, there's still an independent streamers. It's really important was on pointing out and right

595
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:59,900

596
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:04,160
 yeah, it seems like they would already have been looped into other things that their

00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:10,040
 Owners own right and they're not that's weird and they're not which like the facts

598
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:16,020
 They're not already part of the paramount plus or peacock or something like that makes it kind of weird

00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,620
 He likes to sleep so much that we need to pester him every few hours to feed him

609
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:18,880
 Then he feeds for about an hour straight until he falls asleep in the cycle repeats

610
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:24,920
 That's a baby after my own my days off exactly that is my life

611
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,360
 Most days are good, but the little one is getting the hang of being a human

612
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,920
 So other days are a little more challenging overall

613
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:37,280
 We are very happy the experience as a first-time parent is interesting to say the least

614
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:45,400
 Honestly, the broken sleep is not the worst part for me dealing with other people's bullshit comments and opinions are the real test on my nerves

615
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:52,320
 Since your advice is always impeccable. I come to you for solutions on how to deal with the worst offenders

616
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:59,160
 I love these questions. Oh boy starting strong with questions about the baby's circumcision status

617
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:04,560
 I don't think it's appropriate to talk about my baby's gonna tell you at all, but I guess I'm the weird one

618
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,640
 What do I even say to that?

619
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,640
 Then how do I shut down the comments about the next baby?

620
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:17,680
 There will be no next baby and it genuinely made me sad hearing these those remarks only one week postpartum. That's

621
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:25,320
 Insane. That's the same you about the next baby while you're still healing from getting the first one out of you

622
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:30,280
 Well for the first question you can tell them straight up say no Microsoft got rid of Clippy

623
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:39,280
 They faced Clippy right out yeah Clippy is gone. So that's just not a not an option anymore. Yeah

624
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:44,240
 Yeah, okay talk about their genitalia

625
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:49,960
 I'm just gonna say the short clippy answer is you know, like why are you thinking about getting one?

626
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:59,440
 The the the bold one is to say like are you asking me about my child's penis is that what we want to talk about

627
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,680
 right now

628
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,000
 right

629
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,760
 Yeah, how about we just talk about other aspects of their genitalia instead of the tip of their feet?

630
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,960
 Let's talk about the shaft. Oh, it doesn't have to be your child

631
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,480
 Turns out they're gonna take any kid to the oil and they'll just don't just nip the tip

632
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:22,680
 I remember once I'm having a guy, you know, whatever being like no, don't circumcise. I think I think it's circumcised

633
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:29,080
 I end up having to get circumcised at 12 because of an issue or whatever and I regret you know

634
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:33,300
 I wish I wish we didn't get it done or something like that and I turned to the person I said

635
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:40,780
 You think it's you didn't stop fucking did you and then he laughed and I was like, it just seems to me like

636
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,680
 People try to compare it to like the oppressive like

637
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:50,200
 Circumcision of women that happens in like different countries that's a little sure. It's a it's a lot

638
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,400
 It's a lot different than that. It's a lot different

639
00:52:53,400 --> 00:53:02,200
 Yeah, for the most part it is a sanitary thing but also like it's nobody's fucking business

640
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:08,800
 Yeah, yeah mind your business. This is exactly this exactly goes right to this

641
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,880
 marijuana stuff

642
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,880
 mind your business and

643
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:19,080
 Let business mind its business. It's outrageous the stuff the talking out of both sides are fucking heads with this

644
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:25,000
 We want we want business to rock and roll and we're gonna fuck with business constant so stupid

645
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,360
 I mean, yeah, though a nice response to it is

646
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:34,320
 You know as much as I would love to talk about my baby's dick with you. Why don't we talk about anything else? I

647
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,320
 I've

648
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:42,200
 Say this, you know, this is the thing that this is like a life lesson from improv that I moved to real life

649
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,920
 Which is don't get stuck having conversations. You don't want to have right?

650
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,860
 So like if you're on stage in a scene and you and you see partner don't feel like you're enjoying the scene either one of you

651
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:55,480
 Do anything to change the subject until you are talking about something you want to talk about and the audience will be relieved

652
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,480
 right and so I

653
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:02,720
 Had if you simply go like oh, I don't want to get into this at all

654
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,120
 Yeah, if you just say that and then just beat silence

655
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:11,240
 That person will not pester you about it. You they will change. They do

656
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:16,440
 Get him out of there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but simply sound like oh, I don't want to get into this with you at all

657
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,040
 Not right now. I don't feel like talking about it, you know anything along those lines

658
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:23,280
 Just just shut the person up, you know

659
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,360
 But you owe it to yourself to like do not have conversations

660
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:31,800
 You don't want to have if you don't want to talk about your child's genitalia to somebody you do not talk about it

661
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:39,160
 and if you're confident and calm and almost quiet about it that person will just freeze up and

662
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,840
 Yeah, you one of you will move on

663
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:51,600
 Right, right. Yeah, like somebody will continue the conversation or the conversation will end and either way I feel like that's fine

664
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:59,980
 So also the people are asking about the next baby a week after the this baby they're asking about the next baby

665
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:07,440
 Are you gonna pay for it? I have another baby. You're gonna you're gonna pay the bills for that, baby

666
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,260
 Yeah, I don't know. I'm reading in chat. Are you worried about my kids? I'm reading in chat same

667
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:14,440
 My brother's wedding was just two weeks after my son

668
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:20,300
 Two weeks after I had my son and everyone had a comment about not circumcising him

669
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,120
 and

670
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:29,300
 My aunt kept saying well, my husband was so I'm like not gonna talk about my kids or husband's penis

671
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:38,360
 Yeah, yeah, like I like it's really like they'll never be able to follow up on their hypothesis, right? Right?

672
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:42,120
 No, they have no medical background

673
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:45,960
 Idea for this for whatever they're bringing up. They have no

674
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:52,200
 Factual basis for it at all. You know what can be really funny. Tell them you're having it added on to

675
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:58,760
 Tell extending. Yeah, tell them you're adding four inches. My baby is gonna have a five skin

676
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,880
 We're doing like a chip clip with like fishing weights on it and we're just

677
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:12,400
 We're gonna stretch this thing out it's gonna be like the bungs of the rungs of the Notre Dame Bell up there

678
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:17,240
 It's gonna be like being really really really they're not gonna be able to circumcise my kid because it would be a major

679
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:23,300
 Surgery based on how much they'll be removing the tip of his cock is gonna look like the ladies lips at Mar-a-Lago

680
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:27,800
 What I mean to say is like most people are concerned about it from the sake of like

681
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:36,480
 sensitizing the children that the kids miss or that the person is gonna be made fun of or ostracized for not having it done, right, right, right and

682
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:43,960
 Those people have that opinion of a child that young are not gonna remember to check in 15 to 18 years from now to be like

683
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:44,860
 Hey

684
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:47,680
 How's the fucking going with your kids like they're not?

685
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:55,240
 Can't follow up you're never gonna get an answer to your hypothesis. You're only going off of your own personal shit

686
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,500
 so it's just as like yeah, but

687
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:02,120
 It's it's madness that people think, you know

688
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:08,520
 Cuz they go to this with like C sections versus natural birth and stuff like that the amount of shaming that people do to each other's

689
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:14,000
 Children and stuff like that. It's just and and it just comes what does it matter?

690
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,680
 Well, it just comes from people not being confident in their own life decisions

691
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:25,160
 that's what it comes down to people do not have the confidence to just live in their own decisions and they need validation and

692
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:29,240
 They need conformity from others to make them feel like oh, I did the right thing

693
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,780
 It's like fuck you you did the right thing for you

694
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:37,640
 That doesn't mean it's the right thing period and it's not necessarily the right thing and you gotta learn to live with decisions, man

695
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:45,160
 Also, how much happier would everyone be if they just didn't know all this shit about everybody else? Oh, god's sake

696
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:50,760
 Like I feel like no about anybody else's kids genitals to live my life. I don't know

697
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:56,840
 I think it's important that people realize I fired glowing jism out of my cock earlier this week

698
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:03,080
 I think that's an important that is important. That's important. No, no, we mean car. We have carve-outs in these rules

699
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:07,560
 That's it. You should go. Hey, I don't know if I want to talk about my kids peace through right now

700
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:11,960
 But you know what I second them out most people have some form of herpes. What form do you have and how you deal with it?

701
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:15,720
 It's true. It's true. It's universal, baby

702
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:21,240
 The old pissing disease what other aspects of my kids genitals?

703
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:25,400
 Are you gonna want to talk about later so we can just knock all these conversations out, right?

704
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:29,480
 You should be like actually the truth is I'm teaching a class on circumcision

705
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:33,460
 And I need you to give me a hundred dollars right now or I cannot talk to you about it

706
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:36,840
 Yeah, I didn't get him circumcised, but I got him a Prince Albert

707
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:49,240
 Make the choice a couple years later if he wants to keep it he's got it if he wants to get rid of it

708
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,240
 He's got a pull tab. You can just

709
00:58:51,240 --> 00:59:05,400
 Misses since he scoop is saying that people then followed up asking about the birth

710
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:11,520
 How do I convey that that's an incredibly personal moment? I probably don't want to talk about it. You just say that

711
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:15,700
 We kept the foreskin, but we clipped his balls. So he's a

712
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:23,140
 We were asked to choose we flipped a coin

713
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:31,600
 Two-faced style like of like a Batman villain and just thought well either we're gonna give him a circumcision or no nuts

714
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:38,720
 We were we were too busy debating how we're gonna handle the fact he was born with three buttholes to figure out

715
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,920
 My son is essentially a boy worried about his tail my son is

716
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:51,980
 Bowling ball with a tail so you tell me where to prioritize lady

717
00:59:51,980 --> 01:00:01,000
 Well the half-grown twin in his ass cheek that would like a word or two

718
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:08,920
 Psychic conjoined twin he's got a he's got a guano in his left but saddle so yeah

719
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:16,260
 You know prior I got around to the circumcision talk. Yeah, we're still we're exercising the the ass guano first

720
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:20,520
 Lastly any tips on how to raise my baby gay

721
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:25,680
 I think you just start engaging in all of these conversations about the their genitals

722
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:33,960
 People it's conversed about their genitals as you can and that's how that works. We've been doing our best. We have a gay agenda

723
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,960
 we're trying to raise our kids gay and

724
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,100
 Believe it or not these ages. They just figure it out on their own. It's the weirdest thing. Yeah life finds a way

725
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:51,280
 Gay porn around the house. We have nothing like our Christmas decorations are just like different dirty decks of cards with hot dudes

726
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,660
 So we just hang the cards. So yeah, yeah this tree

727
01:00:53,660 --> 01:01:00,800
 They're really getting a full mouthful of it. We only serve phallic fruits and vegetables for dinner

728
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:06,220
 You know, I heard this really interesting thing

729
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:14,520
 And I may have said this before on the podcast table, but we're talking about you know, how a lot of your hardcore

730
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:21,400
 Religious types want to talk about sexuality as a choice. Yes, right and

731
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:27,680
 What this person said was for them

732
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:36,280
 It is a choice because they've had to choose to repress their natural sexuality their whole life and they don't realize that it's not a choice

733
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,260
 It's just interesting

734
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:45,320
 But they've had to make the conscientious choice to say no to their instincts to their basic human nature

735
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:48,720
 They have they have had to make a choice their whole life

736
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:52,320
 So they see it as everyone has to make this choice, right?

737
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:57,880
 Like I made this choice. Everyone must have made this choice somewhere along the lines like now man. It ain't a choice

738
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:03,760
 It's just the cards you dealt with those people. They're in that zone. They don't understand that

739
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,160
 I'm not going down to the fucking bath house. It's not a choice

740
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:13,160
 It's because I'm choosing every day to not go down to the back out bath house. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

741
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,120
 Yeah, but it's just your name

742
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:21,000
 But they don't understand that they can't see that and especially if they've been indoctrinated in a very small community that has the whole

743
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,460
 You know, so I thought that was a really interesting look at it

744
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:30,080
 It's like you would think it's a choice because you've had to choose to repress your own nature your entire life

745
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:36,160
 Thank you for all the laughs and creating such an awesome community Murray is still a great name for a baby

746
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:42,240
 It sure fuck yes on it because it doesn't work in Portuguese. Okay, fucking you in the face with a boob full of milk

 Wait, wait is it from there's another note here? I want to bring up Rebecca and Chad say I oh, yeah

759
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:48,000
 I had two kids one and disposable diapers formula fed hospital born

760
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,040
 The second kid was born at home breastfed and diapered in cloth

761
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:56,520
 You wouldn't know they both turned out fine and I'm sorry people sell all this dumb stuff to you

762
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:02,640
 That's that's exactly what we're talking about. Is that like yes, we are the children you are you are worried about, right?

763
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:07,920
 So look at all of us which ones are which was a formula fed which ones have circumcisions, which ones, you know

764
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:14,160
 We did die. It's like you can't tell you can't tell babies survive, right? They find them in freaking

765
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,160
 dumpsters crap and they all live babies are

766
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:21,440
 Amazingly resilient. I put those babies in those dumpsters

767
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,960
 Absolutely with the intention of them dying and they won't

768
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:30,480
 No, and Jacob still walks free. Why prom night dumpster, baby

769
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:35,320
 Prop that dumpster baby and I'm taking a stroll

770
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:37,880

772
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:48,760

773
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:52,560
 In hopes to hear this New Zealand theme scooperty while on my trip

774
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:57,560
 Apologies to the real New Zealand scoops for what is a tourist take on what?

775
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:02,480
 I'm sure I'll discover to be a lovely country definitely less cunty than their neighboring land

776
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:08,500
 Mass hole of a continent and a country across the water now that I've probably insulted two wonderful nations

777
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,500
 Does that give me honorary American status?

778
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:16,800

 Not sure why he went back to that island multiple times can't be the money. I

785

 Don't know which one of those guys was in all the Jurassic Park movies

809
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:41,880
 Is it isn't Queensland?

810
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:46,600
 Hey, I don't think so a Queensland. That's a

811
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:50,040
 Australia. Yeah

812
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,440

01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:56,320
 I

815
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,560
 Don't know I can't think of it. Oh

 Wait, this is Matt's turn what how's this Matt's turn? I don't know. It says Matt's turn on top

 Wait, that was my turn. Okay. All right. Oh

 Continuing the game under protest. I'll go to New Zealand cities for 400

826
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:41,680
 Although I didn't get Auckland so I don't know why I'm going other New Zealand cities because that's the one that I knew

827
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:45,440
 Located on the South Island. This city is nestled between Lake

828
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,720
 Walk it

01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:14,300

01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:48,080
 Sadly, we just lost this giant of directing talent to Parkinson's disease known for his great work on once

841
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:55,200
 We are once were warriors the edge along came a spider and the James Bond film die another day. Oh

845
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,960
 Richard Attenborough

846
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,400
 Richard Attenborough is correct. It's not

847
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:36,520
 Lee Tomahawry. I knew it was gonna be gone too soon from the

848
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:39,560
 Maori, but I didn't I didn't

849
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:46,460
 Matt you're up. God. We are killing this. I'll look at us with our own New Zealand. Now. It's not gonna know Zealand

850
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:50,040
 Currently I am winning with zero

851
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:58,160
 I will do New Zealand actors for 400, please

852
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:01,880
 This actress born in Winnipeg

853
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:06,200
 But raised in New Zealand shared her Oscar-winning debut with fellow Kiwi

854
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:12,720
 Cliff Curtis in the piano and went on to famously play women with powers a mutant and a telepath

855
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:16,840
 Okay pass

856
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:20,960
 Okay, that passes to me I

857
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,920
 Watch the piano at least once a week

858
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:32,160
 Once I actually know this one Jacob if you want to pass it to me. Oh, that's that's good because unfortunately

859
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:37,440
 I've never paid attention to the actress from New Zealand in the piano

860
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:41,060
 I purposely don't pay attention to her at all while watching the piano

861
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:46,360
 So I will just watch Harvey Cattel's wiener and a pack one and a pack one

862
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:51,080
 She went out when she was in a pack when she was a baby. That was a very young age to win an Oscar

863
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:57,500
 Oh, it was very very young to get the Oscar then. Yeah. Oh that changes the score completely now

864
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:02,800
 I am still in the lead with zero points Matt is still in second place with negative 200 points

865
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,120
 But Paul is now still in third place with negative 1,000

866
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:11,280
 Thousand good grief. I don't know because you lost points. I don't know how these games work

867
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:15,160
 Do you do you lost the daily double on the New Zealand? Oh, that's right

868
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:22,120
 But does it turn into 1600 what no and I guess wasn't no you would miss the other ones - okay

869
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:28,200
 There you go. I'll go to New Zealand actors for 600 known for her TV success. This actor has starred on iZombie

870
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:35,760
 Once upon a time and most recently ghosts an actor by any other name would smell as sweet. Okay

871
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:41,320
 Rose McGowan

872
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:51,160
 Rose MacGyver, oh look at that you all you had three-fourths of it. I did I had more of that name that I thought I was

 Wilder people Deadpool 2 and how to train your dragon

878
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:19,760

883
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:46,680
 Just on context clues

884
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:50,200
 Great, I'll guess Julius Rodman motherfucker

885
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:54,040

 The capital of New Zealand this city is nicknamed windy on account of the strong winds of the cook straight

922
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:58,100
 Not sure if it's famous for its beef, too

923
01:16:58,100 --> 01:17:00,960
 hmm, I

924
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:03,200
 Thought Auckland was the capital of New Zealand

925
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:07,840
 Huh

926
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:13,080
 Hmm Auckland Auckland doesn't lend itself to any beef related anything though

927
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:19,320
 The instance it sounds like it's trying to say the name is Chicago, but I don't think that the capital city of New Zealand, Chicago

928
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:22,400
 right

929
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,840
 Capital is really funny if it was though, and we just didn't know it

930
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:30,360
 I have beef experience

931
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:34,080
 Yeah, if only I had a little more beef experience

01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:39,400

 Wellington beef Wellington

935
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,960
 I don't know how the windy is part of that, but okay

936
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:54,440
 Well, I guess it's just windy in Wellington. Oh, it is windy. Well, it's Nick. Okay, Wendy Wellington. I don't I dated Wendy Wellington

937
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:57,360

 This two-time Oscar-winning director has directed the follow women in leading roles Kate Winslet Meg Ryan Nicole Kidman Holly Hunter and

941
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:19,040
 Kirsten Dunst

943
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:26,880
 I watched an outtake of the first spider-man movie with Kirsten Dunst in it the other day and

944
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:32,480
 it was just over and over again this one crowd scene where she's in front of the crowd and

945
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:37,800
 The the director is just trying to get this one extra to stop doing something

946
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:43,560
 Yeah. Oh, that's every time like they'll cut the director over the speaker will be like great great great

947
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:49,040
 You were doing this don't do that Kirsten is doing that. So don't do that thing that you're doing

948
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:52,920
 Oh, man, let's go again. And then they'd go again and the extra would just do it again

949
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:55,960
