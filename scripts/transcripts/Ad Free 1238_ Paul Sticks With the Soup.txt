 Mattingly sitting in Los Angeles that's Matt Donnelly sitting in Las Vegas it's
 me Jacob the audio guy we're preaching fun hey guys very exciting very exciting
 stuff guys yeah happened I'm being sarcastic but no I'm in LA doing a
 little run at the Magic Castle nice nice have you already started that or
 is that coming up soon no I started it did Wednesday night and Thursday night so
 far and what room are you in the Peller theater okay which is funny because the
 theater that features duos so people think Peller is a combination of pen
 and teller but it's not true just by coincidence the guy who pwned it up the
 the cash to make it happen was a guy named Albert Peller got the theater
 named after him and yeah it's but you know the interesting thing about Albert
 right did you know Albert no I don't know if you knew Albert or not but he
 actually changed his name to represent Penn and Teller he was such a big fan of
 Penn and Teller that he changed his name to celebrate Penn and Teller and then by
 coincidence that theater was named after him originally his his last name was
 Angel Field and but then he he found more magic people that to change his
 name to so
 but yeah and so I'm playing with my buddy Nick Paul a very funny guy and one bit
 we always do in the show is we say we have an improv background and so we do
 improv during a magic trick where I basically just try to mess with him
 while he does I love I still haven't seen this idea live I love this idea it's
 really fun it's really fun and so yeah last night I was messing with him and
 actually messed up the trick good you got into it so you're playing the bit
 too hard exactly I'm honestly not interested in you fucking with him
 during the set if you've never fully messed up a trick while small fucking
 with him no and I had this I just I did this bit during my magic live show so
 when I messed up and he really had to reset I go don't worry I can handle this
 I'm an improv guy a master of crowd work sure I mostly work cruise ships but
 crowd work is universal hands up who's celebrating their 50th wedding
 anniversary crowd work is the same no matter where you go quick where are my
 people who are turning a hundred right now
 hey there they are there's always a group of them no matter where Arthur
 Peller 110 there he is yeah yeah yeah how old is he he dead little is known
 about him little is known about he's an enigma is that right it depends on how
 wide you want the scope to go no one of this show knows no one no one playing
 the pillar theater this week knows that's what I know yeah but we're doing
 the show I have a new bit I put a new bit in the show with with Ryar Ryar
 Applethorne's fine craftsmanship again oh nice but I'm not gonna give too much
 away because I'm gonna perform it at scoop fest so okay I will talk about it
 after I'm sure we'll be talking about it after scoop fest so there you go but
 look at us we're talking about it now but super fun it's a super fun bit yeah
 it's been a great run so far it's always fun to be back out here nice yeah I've
 had a comic booky week mm-hmm you've got exposed to radiation and now you can
 turn green at will well I told you guys I saw Thunderbolts yeah oh yeah didn't
 really like it I just saw Superman which would better what did you get the soup
 or the man I stuck with the soup I don't regret it
 waiter there's a man in my suit Superman
 has that been done before I know it's my brain was in the same exact thing it's
 like wait that's a good joke that's just a simple turn that has to be done before
 but it's really I have to have been done before by somebody yeah yeah yeah that's
 Superman oh it's all right it's okay I'm not I'm a Marvel guy not a DC guy I was
 gonna say that thing people are some people are finding it very emotional
 seeing that movie really yeah the the last the last couple minutes the old
 James Gunn heartstring machine oh that's right it is a James Gunn one isn't it it
 fires up on full cylinders in the last couple moments but so I feel the movie
 there's like a baby raccoon that they're torturing brother crying it's a it is he
 throws baby's dog squirrels everything your emotions throws everything at the
 fucking screen he hates automatically the motions no no no it's fine with your
 school and chat with a bold opinion that this man was a lot better than the
 Snyder one wow the famously bad Snyder Superman I'm gonna say so is so is
 everything yeah telling you about Superman Jesus so bad but yes is all
 right you know but no I don't know I don't see I don't see how they're gonna
 build the franchise off all this but we'll see now we'll see I yeah I don't
 care about that though James Gunn's in charge of making new DC films fact this
 yes this supposed you know the Superman has to be responsible for every single
 movie that's going to come out after this I think it's just not something that
 has to happen okay all right I think the DC is fucking up timing wise bigger than
 bigger than just will they be able to do a sequel or universe around this I think
 everybody is ready to take a break from superhero movies I think that I think
 yes the majority of people around are ready to just be done with superhero
 movies for a little while I know which which I know leads me to why DC is such
 a terrible company the best movie they've made recently is just too little
 too late yeah it is like a good superhero movie everybody's tired of
 watching superhero movies shit and it it really is a matter of timing like you
 say Jacob and I think it's more to the point of at least for me my personal
 self not only am I a little bit done with the whole onslaught of superhero
 there's a lot but I think more more for me I feel like I can't even I can't even
 believe in this shit at all at this point because no one's stepping up to do
 shit when did you believe in the end the Superman oh I don't believe in the
 Superman I believe in the spider-man but just leave sticky webs everywhere
 everywhere that you go but I don't know it's just it's just hard to to get your
 gumption up for that you know truth and justice stuff when truth and justice is
 under such direct attack name one place that it's not the way you think the
 fucking Smithsonian yeah I mean it's it's preposterous that's the thing and I
 just kind of like well this podcast know that I was trying for a while to have a
 no sarcasm rule when I was talking about yes and it's just too overwhelming I
 can't agreed I can't read 100% agreed I can't know we went all the time people
 you don't want to hear us speaking earnestly about this yeah and I don't
 want I don't want to speak earnestly about it at this point but I want to I
 want to make my opinion known to a point but I mean yeah hold on I'm gonna take a
 moment and just speak earnestly about it you know burn I'm really tired of the
 Smithsonian getting changed around to show what other people are that's right
 burn I'm super tired of it I'm gonna say over Christmas and go to jail burn I
 went to the convenience food mart the other day and they done changed it up
 they called the Supergulp the big sipper and they're racing our history burn
 anyone young listen to our podcast just did a very good Jim Varney pull there
 Jacob I like that yes Ernest goes to camp was a thing yeah and then Ernest
 does anything became a thing where he got electrical superpowers Ernest goes
 to Camp Crocodile that's the new one I remember watching Ernest goes to camp we
 would have different different different families would step up sometimes take
 care of take care of us you know give my dad a break when he was just a single
 dad and I remember being at the Chadwicks they were lovely family that
 would take care of my little brother and I for a weekend and they had a daughter
 who was like eight years older than us she was look out she was gorgeous and
 taste of like you know whatever and so you were all in love with her yeah
 exactly and everybody was in love with the daughter and we're sitting there at
 you know 11 and 12 being like what I wanted to hang and I remember I remember
 torturing her as me loving and pointing out every single joke I loved and Ernest
 goes to camp to her like she was trying to like just for minutes on him be like
 wait wait wait watch exactly yeah she was trying to leave the room and I was
 like no no the golf cart came back that's the same ghost golf cart from the
 beginning amazing that's amazing that daughter name was Sarah low name was
 Saint Mother Teresa I mean all she's thinking is like these poor kids with
 their dead mom I guess I can sit here listen to the fucking breakdown of
 earnest goes to camp this way dead moms do to kids brain I can turn them onto
 this Jim Varney Christ he got mushed out in the head real quick either
 volunteered as well boy soup kitchen or I guess listen to this drivel for an hour
 let's damn it well Saturday keeping on my comic book theme my local guy he's
 moving soon and he's having a he's having a big sale on a bunch of his
 dollar books and what what have you and so he's got his cheap bins and then he
 made him all his dollar books he sold him for a dime a piece for this one day
 sale yeah that's less than a dollar I got a hundred and sixty some books like
 sixteen bucks it was amazing that's awesome so yeah I had a real good sweep
 there got a bunch of X-Men and X-Force and a bunch of little knicky knacks all
 kinds of weird stuff some somebody swooped in before me you got all the
 spider-man but that's alright I've got a lot enough spider-man but yeah so it's
 been very very comic book heavy week for me here which is nice and then I went to
 and let me go to another comic book shop we went together out at the Pittsburgh
 Mills the Pittsburgh Mills have I told you guys about the fucking Pittsburgh
 Mills no baseball team so the Pittsburgh Mills is an almost abandoned mall okay
 they've got it's a dead mall but it's got like three stores still left in it
 and currently it has a spirit Halloween a Macy's and a giant comic book shop and
 that's about what it's good then and I say giant comic book shop I mean giant
 comic book shop it is huge takes up like five storefronts ginormous anyway when
 because there's also a lot of eateries right there around the Pittsburgh Mills
 mall that's where we go to Chili's sometimes if you were gonna go if you do
 a Google search for the Pittsburgh Mills mall the first thing that comes up is
 why did the Pittsburgh Mills mall close yeah and it's and it exactly this mall
 is closed go ahead and look up Pittsburgh Mills mall potholes because
 as soon as I suggested let's drive out to the mills and Anne agreed I said I'll
 drive if you're not gonna give me guff about the potholes and she's like I'll
 drive because there are god-sized cracks in the earth that await await your
 vehicle and Anne just can't she's like anytime I hit one the wrong way it's
 like forget it she will drive around the whole parking lot so the the the place
 closed quote-unquote the mills closed and everything's in this weird litigation
 space right and it comes down to the stores that are renting they're quick
 timeout aren't just clear you said I'll go if you don't complain about the
 potholes and her answer was I'll drive yes so yes and was like no no I'm going
 to complain about the puddle so I guess I should drive that's it like yeah she's
 like I'll just I'll just drive you know you can't put that on the table I would
 veto that right away if I don't complain about the potholes I suppose I'll do the
 drive that's what she said and I'm like okay fine now no I heard that I heard
 that conversation happen I accepted it and I moved on because I have been a
 part of that conversation word-for-word absolutely and to to her credit she's
 been having to go from store to store all around this district right yeah so
 she goes there's a cup there's a store out by the mills that she goes to so she
 knows these streets so she knows where the killer potholes are so she has some
 sense of the navigation of the streets and I don't knows the streets and don't
 ever question I like it don't ever question that Anne McPheeters knows the
 street it was like I think it's called like a harbor pilot or whatever but
 basically oh yeah when you bring big ships into ports they take a small boat
 they shepherd out a guy who knows how to navigate yeah the tugboat that gets you
 away from the rock yeah I like that they could fucking use that out there and as
 the harbor pilot of potholes getting to this thing like no no we're gonna look
 we're gonna go sideways here we're gonna drift for a while the Pittsburgh Mills
 mall is currently experiencing a significant pothole problem with a
 recent lawsuits filed by the mall's owners and even by neighbor neighboring
 businesses due to the poor condition of the roads on the private property yes it
 is terrible we we finally got and went long ways around to go to the Chili's
 and then when we finally got out of the Chili's we we had our dinner and then
 we're heading out of the Chili's she waited for traffic to stop to be done
 they were still in the the mall complex she pulled out into the wrong side of
 the street drove down the wrong road side of the road for about 90 feet I know
 these I know these streets like the back of my hand she's just like she's like
 we're not even I'm not even playing that game today and the dance we have to do
 all around it's insane you know like it was like they'll tell like some of you
 know if someone's as late with their their pregnancy like that like that like
 they're nine months and it's just so oh no they'll tell you to go getting on a
 rough road I'm saying we should we should monetize this on the rough road
 they say going like a hay wagon ride you're right the Pittsburgh Mills
 pregnancy popper call it the labor maker labor maker the labor maker tour the
 Pittsburgh Mills pothole baby bringer tour the baby popper router my god I can
 only imagine driving around writing in a wagon being pulled in that parking lot
 yeah you would you would injure your spine yeah I would not come out of that
 without serious injuries yeah you know who else is willing to rattle babies out
 of mothers and that is the following sponsor today's show man manly's ice
 cream social is brought to you by roll dolls guide to writing about abnormally
 large objects that's right that's from Boson scoop pronounced Boson scoop in
 2023 that's when he gave it to us this is raw roll dolls guide to writing about
 abnormally large objects hello it is I famed children's author and a rock on
 tour roll doll you may remember me from such wonderful child's tales as James
 and the giant peach well that was my final draft after I experimented with
 several other large objects before I landed on James of the giant peach there
 was Kevin and the gargantuan grapes there was also Stephen and the abnormally
 rotunda orange I also wrote one called Bethany and the big old snowball and
 Catherine finds a fucking huge quarter that last one turned out to just be a
 silver dollar the dumb lady she was just a dumb person she was a dumb person I
 went on to write more dumb stories later but finally of course I landed on James
 and the giant peach yes now if you want to come up with your own person and the
 large thing story I encourage you to do so but don't you dare use the name James
 don't you dare use the adjective giant don't you dare use peaches those are my
 intellectual properties hi I'm Jimmy the large nectarine and I would like to tell
 you guys a sort of tale go ahead Jim I Jimmy the large nectarine yes that's
 right I feel you may be dangerously encroaching upon my IP in what way in
 what way rolls how do I say well I saw how do I say your name say it how you
 want I'll see you in court listen you're what you've done is you've you've gone
 around my idea of having an individual involved with a large object yeah no I
 have become the personification of the object yeah so you have anthropomorphize
 that would be like me having a book called James the giant peach I'm just
 hearing dollar signs that's all I'm hearing that's absurd and you are you
 profit the giant nectar that's right
 originally it was me and the giant nectarine but but the the book not to
 spoil it is about us fighting a device that combined us into the giant object
 you see before you like the fly yes like like the modern adaptation of the fly
 yeah so you're Brendan Jimmy yeah yes oh I like this say would you like to come
 to my writing cottage oh I have out in the back of my house sure but just you
 know there's a lot of odd things to being a giant nectarine that maybe your
 house is not prepared for what do you mean I every time I sit down I squeeze
 juice everywhere oh yeah do go on oh that seems like a feature of the book do
 you ralt oh oh oh we're about to have some sweet sweet times I think you and
 I James mr. Jim mind if I dip a finger in that peach pin of yours my gosh my
 gosh sure he scoops a check out mine if I put a finger in your navel orange that's
 just upsetting yeah just upsetting nectarines I went to a music gig the
 other night and there was a fan there there was a woman who is a fan of this
 music group and I guess follows them around from different gigs and had made
 them all baked goods and made the entire band baked goods the fan cake says the
 fan cakes if piff likes but I mean brought them a veritable buffet of baked
 desserts it was so much like it was so many cookies there was a cake it was all
 this stuff and yeah I was like that I am a little jealous of this right now there
 is there's a fan of this band who brought in enough baked goods for at
 least ten people oh wow dedication yeah well what were the things did you eat it
 what's going on oh I eat something for sure I definitely ate something you know
 me I eat the fan cakes you know I know but there wasn't you you there were
 cookies jealous there were brownies I can be jealous I can be jealous of what I
 want to be jealous of you got the benefit it was like lemon bars it was
 really good oh yeah good lemon bar oh yeah real good lemon bar can be great we
 got the Wagner's market right up the street from us right on an unrelated
 note my stomach is completely pregnant now oh no swallowing so much sperm I got
 a I got only pancakes oh god only pancakes well you know what we got to do
 Jacob we gotta get you on a wagon we got to get you on a wagon in the
 Pittsburgh Mills parking lot real quick get that get that cake baby out of you
 that same night I discovered that several of the Fremont Street performers
 are now trying you know when they when they shut all the lights down on Fremont
 Street and they do the shows on the canopy they do like the video shows on
 the canopy above there right so I guess several of the street performers have
 now instead of taking a break while the canopy does its thing they try to dance
 along to it okay because I guess they're not allowed to do their act while the
 canopy is playing but they can just dance along to the canopy and so they
 stop doing several people stop doing whatever act they're doing on Fremont
 Street and just start awkwardly dancing along with whatever is happening on the
 big Fremont Street canopy and they expect people to continue tipping them
 and or stay at their location to watch the show restart after the canopy stops
 doing its thing that's like y'all have the wrong idea on what to do with this
 situation this I appreciate y'all trying something this isn't it my heart goes
 out to those poor motherfuckers oh my god that is the worst gig on planet Earth I
 think I didn't stop yesterday and watch a street magician though on my on my
 stroll of the strip yesterday there was a street magician in front of Bellagio
 and so I saw that guy oh maybe he yeah he made my faith in humanity disappear
 he wasn't that bad no no no no no I'm just saying in the general that the poor
 performers had to be out there oh huskin and buskin oh man oh Jeff Lumis points
 out but the top five Fremont Street performers pull in some bank there is
 sure there is a real cottage industry that happens in Las Vegas with the
 street performers especially down at Fremont Street yeah we don't know whether
 the guy used to get paid 20 bucks get kicked in the balls we don't know whether
 he stopped that for medical reasons or whether he's now retired to a lavish
 island we don't know yeah I think or they did some kind of ordinance on it I
 think they actually I think that guy that Matt's talking about died oh we all
 the nut kicking guy from a nut kick I someone kicked his nuts into outer space
 just fucking Thanos did just ah the legend of moon nuts your testicles are
 like planets boom no I think I don't I don't I don't know I don't remember
 anything about him dying but I did think that I think they stopped him doing that
 yeah oh you think they probably died because he had because he stopped that
 was the only thing keeping his balls from growing out of his heart every time
 let's see it was the only way he could keep his balls from becoming so big that
 they would keep him in his house they found him in his house he woke up one
 morning like Kafka and he couldn't get him like he's like Gregor Samsa and he's
 like oh shit it happened the balls got too big I can't get out the door and I
 left my phone in the kitchen like what would you do if your balls were too big
 to get through the door yeah and you left your phone in the kitchen you're
 dead yeah yeah you're over you're not gonna what are you gonna pull your balls
 off Jacob no no you're right I'm dead sure but if I make a living kicking men
 in the nuts I'm a sex worker quote unquote right well someone was a savior
 for that man to keep his balls in check because otherwise the they were gonna
 just keep going yeah oh according to chat GPT the the guy
 on Fremont Street who got kicked in the balls has indeed passed away Wow oh no
 yeah but we don't know what from what I don't know what from yeah yeah particular
 torsion that's it I passed away after hospitalization according to a social
 media claim no mainstream this is a good time to mention the zoom chat if you are
 a patreon supporter of this show you are eligible to come join us in the zoom
 chat for this show you could be in here with us people have the chat going all
 the whole time and people have something to say they can say something in the

 patreon's they support us over at preachy fun calm and you can too
 thanks Jacob cloud on a brothel and the chat is pointing this out now I can't
 let's see it either he was really thrown because your Las Vegas hat if you look
 at it differently that logo the LV can look like a 47 and he thought you were
 wearing a Donald Trump oh yeah totally it totally can look like a 47 it really
 does I don't see it at all so look where the L and the V connect that can be the
 four and then the that's a four outer crop of the V cover up be a seven up
 the far side of your of your set of your V okay her about the far side of your V
 there you go you see the four okay oh yeah yeah see the four okay yeah and then
 he said if you let that go you see that one's got the little thing of this so it
 looks like a seven oh and that looks like a seven it kind of does look like a 47
 another reason to be in the zoom chat I can't unsee it now that's really fun who
 said that first got cloud in a brothel who is the person that I'm angry at man
 I like this how to all you got to do is black out that little dot at the top of
 the V all I've got to do is put a piece of tape over the hat not wear it ever
 again all I've got to do set this cap on fire easy peasy living squeezy nothing
 nothing that kerosene in a match can't fix no shit you know show up and ruin
 things that I previously liked and that's the following sponsor today show
 met madly as ice cream social is brought to you by Cory the camels bail bonds from
 James T scoop in 2021 that's Cory the camels jail bonds hey everybody it's

 call it the the crossbar motel huh the the the stinky place where you go when
 you're in jail what's the other nicknames for the jail dr. Hassan
 Pfeffer's fart box you know those classic classic nicknames oh I am going
 to dr. Hassan Pfeffer's fart box oh well then you're in need of my services I am
 if you end up in dr. Hart in a house and peppers firebox all you got to do call
 me and I'll get you out lickety-split oh I don't like it out oh you want to go in
 there you've been trying to get into dr. Hassan Pfeffer's fart box for a while I
 love the smell yeah a lot of people do it's the hottest club in town I can
 vouch for I can vouch for the bail bondsman Corey here I thank you I was
 true story I wrapped up in a Las Vegas sexting rig and as an Israeli citizen I
 got bailed out and then just got in a plane and flew the country all right and
 that was shortly before he became president of Israel another success
 story everybody but last week in Las Vegas wait a minute all right commercial
 over also dr. Hassan Pfeffer's fart box that's a great costume idea is that's
 open to interpretation has to be a Dutch oven costume on Amazon no there was a
 child sex ring arrest they rested like eight people in connection with a child
 sex ring here in Las Vegas there's a big children eight people eight it wasn't
 ice kids are still running the streets yeah but yeah so one of them was an
 Israeli citizen and they put his bond at like yeah I don't know I don't know the
 amount but it was a low amount so he just paid it he just paid it and went to
 the airport got on a plane and just left the country okay you know he probably
 didn't realize that he wasn't technically allowed so there's a bit of a
 dust-up over you know with all the people involved like how the hell did
 you let that happen controversial story here local is saying this was not just
 an Israeli citizen but a government official ah so that makes it a little
 more sticky and I don't guess we have any kind of extradition deal there oh
 you know if anything Israel does it's played by the rules so holy an Israel
 government official was arrested in Las Vegas earlier this month on charges of
 luring a child for sex yeah like full-on yeah like with a straight-up fish and
 pole yeah candy bar a bobber and everything Wow know what I mean bird
 never make bobber jokes it was Lake Mead we a lot of people stock their ponds with
 fresh fish we we stock Lake Mead with children hungry children let's see oh he
 had a $10,000 bail yet a $10,000 bail he posted that that standard amount for the
 charge didn't appear before the judge was not required to surrender his
 passport and returned to Israel two days later on a pre-scheduled flight they
 could have just the chat flights he already had scheduled the chat is
 filling in the mad details here winter scoop says we do have an extradition
 treaty with Israel they're claiming he wasn't the right guy they're claiming and
 and then Newman comes in and says this is an earnest Lexington Kentucky native
 well this guy was from Kentucky oh this is really government official but he's
 from Kentucky he's originally from Kentucky apparently well that's what
 Newman's saying yeah right well I trust Newman I you know if it comes if it's a
 Kentucky history thing Newman knows it that's what we know that is true well I
 mean we know how to fish for children right
 speaking of children it's a good segue right so I was recently haunted with what
 what you know nature versus nurture genetics versus whatever as one of my
 children one of my children started wearing a gold chain around his neck huh
 oh you took the kids out of Jersey but you can't take the Jersey out of the
 kids I liked I bit my tongue because I want to be like oh my god you look so
 Jersey right now you you fucking t-neck reject if you shit off of you have you
 seen the South Park where one of the boys finds out he's originally from New
 Jersey and the mother goes full New Jersey for him oh my god I was doing a
 show last night and I brought up San Antonio and the crowd all cheered for
 San Antonio and I said are you all from San Antonio and they go no or whatever
 like they're just for cheering whatever just a nice place next girl gets up she
 says she's from Jersey and no one applauds at all not not a single clap one
 boo from the back I was like wow we just love hearing the word San Antonio that
 we just burst into applause but you know Jersey just kills it kills the mood I
 get our rule I get it there are rules and then my other child this is really
 daunting wait younger younger worse than a oh you're still a gold chain oldest
 where the gold now wait oh yeah what chain great what else is there anything
 on the gold chain no that's that's what makes it simple and elegant yeah slow

 Las Vegas walking around in the in the very short dresses with the with the leg
 tattoos like the leg sleeve Oh leg sleeves showing off the leg what do you
 call the leg sleeve tattoo is there a name for that somebody in the chat tell

 Gamm Glam actually the answer sob Gamm Glam that's it okay Gamm Glam Glam Gamm Gamm Gamm Gamm Gamm Gamm yeah yeah yeah a mistake the mistake and my youngest son we have
 like this is you know this is gonna sound a little bougie guys but we have we
 have okay we have toaster tongs do you know toaster talk yeah they're like
 basic wooden to take your thing out of your toes yeah like wooden like little
 wooden tongs they're smaller than like classic tongs they're wooden yeah they're
 almost like like people who can't use chopsticks you know use fake I got you
 it looks like it's like I got you wouldn't but why would they go with wood
 does it doesn't for a hot thing doesn't conduct electricity yeah so if you jam
 stick that all the way down the toaster and not kill yourself yeah I see yeah
 okay and there's two because I one time used it to get food out of some other
 object and my wife got angry that I used the toaster tongs on another food object
 on the improper thing so I was never in the toaster and a bit of like you know
 20% rage 50% sarcasm bought a second pair of toaster tongs good okay to be
 like I'll use these however I please and my son spontaneously grabbed both
 toaster tongs and started moving around my kitchen like a crab oh no and I was
 like it was like I saw a ghost I was like what what do you have you if you've
 never done that for no right he does not know my my that I was the crab at
 Starbucks when I went to Starbucks I used to move around the whole store and
 cower into a corner with the two pastry times nurture versus nature that that
 memory straight up came out of your boss that's just yeah it's science your tongue
 yeah it is science well you know they're finding out more and more of that crazy
 shit how much yeah how much DNA memory there is and how much and I mean you
 know cuz like like with with women they're born with easy now we're gonna
 be in a Sarah Ross clip right now we're three guys talking about women right
 right right right how about female presenting individual okay go for it
 okay representing individuals see our are are born with stop the even me and
 microphones ovum that that you know that's from there you know they have
 them in the womb all right I mean yeah like as the as the zygote develops yeah
 yeah no zygote develop into babies into a fetus yeah like early on you've got
 that genetic material that's gonna make the next generation and they're
 discovering more and more that events that occur during pregnancy to the
 mother can translate genetic information habits different stuff like like they
 did a study on like groups of people who are experiencing famine and how their
 progeny were affected by that and not even that first generation that second
 generation sometimes - I don't know it's interesting it is interesting I mean I'm
 always blown away by animals learning behavior right or like also all these
 animals like no like crows in a certain region all know how to like navigate
 traffic lights and things like that right or like all right yeah things with
 it and the light over them that but by the way that's how they navigate the
 traffic lights that yeah yeah whereas crows of the past would just slide right
 into them right right they've evolved but did you did you see not they are
 evolving now Jacob did you hear about they are I'm being stupid but I know
 it's actually happening too no no no no did you did you read this article Matt
 about the the crows that have all gone mute no yeah so there's this whole
 region of crows that have gone completely mute and the scientists are
 looking for the cause I killed Jacob I killed Jacob everyone I'm sorry I'm
 sorry there's just sad emojis coming in just depression let's just go live
 feedback in the chat you got some LOL some laughing faces you got but you get
 one sigh what Andy said I murdered that one so thank you and you have three sad
 faces this is looking like a 60% hit of a joke we've got it we've got to see you
 at the cone which which hey man I'll take 60% any day that joke is for the
 birds yes I'm raving about it to my wife see now we're rolling now we got it
 going oh mr. head scoop thought that it was a real fact coming through yeah mr.
 head scoop that is your fault I hate to blame the victim on this but that is
 your fault Brogan says 60% of the time I'm funny every time yeah that's generous
 thank you Brogan that's generous I I don't give a flock at any rate I will
 submit my my youngest son for genetic studies for comedy good oh my god that's
 so crazy I've never been a prouder dad I've never been a prouder dad that's
 pretty amazing that's pretty amazing yeah has all of the the strife about you
 you getting the wrong thing out of the with the toaster tongs is all that been
 settled or is there still tension in the house I don't know I never see my wife I
 don't know I don't know oh I saw yesterday she was she was mad about
 something I couldn't tell what but she was hot about something but yeah yeah
 yeah you should do Cisco's the tong song oh tong to tong tong tong yeah yeah oh
 someone already memed you Paul slaking fool it's not a murder of crows on the
 list there's probable cause there you go oh slaking classic now I'm mad at you
 too now I'm mad at you so one of my kids is now a middle school ah they start
 middle school at 7 a.m. because they hate you that's it wait a minute they say
 they say cuz the bus schedule so like grade school starts at 9 a.m. and middle
 school starts at 7 a.m. they say it's now busing this is this is something
 where I legit have beef with the way they do it because there are tons of
 studies that say this is terribly detrimental and it's especially
 detrimental to children in that age range I know what beef is I have had beef
 experience I know adolescence need more sleep they've proven that man it's
 fucked up oh I I agree it's a real I know you do I know it's not on you it's
 a real game changer I would be so awkward if this is where Paul found out
 that Matt was the one who set that rule up the one son of a bus never forgive
 you this podcast is finished was even worse she was over there not looking at
 her kids is middle school they had signups for cross-country and so my
 sign up for cross-country and it is a hundred and five degrees out right now
 yeah and so I figured they can't be they must have them inside of the gym or they
 must like you know take it easy or do something different and I go to pick up
 my kid from after cross-country and his face is just bright red like a tomato
 like absolutely no your son is a fair skin young man yes also anyway yeah he
 is porcelain skin yeah and it was a bright red tomato and I was like I said
 is that sunburn or from exhaustion of running and he says ice combo he says I
 don't know that I don't I honestly don't know probably is the answer probably oh
 this is like I don't know why I look like I'm a tomato right now that's
 horrible I said why are they having you run what is above a hundred and five
 degrees they said oh cuz you know we're part of the national program and so we
 have to we have to compare what we're doing to all the other schools who are
 doing it and most schools don't are in a hot area like ours and so it's like a
 false sport on the national oh I got you I said that's not a good enough answer
 for me just so you're just so we're clear I don't care how I don't care how
 you fair nationally my child I don't care yeah I don't care how you fair
 nationally in this thing that I already don't care about I don't care about
 children's cross-country running so why would I care about how you line up
 against other kids from Milwaukee yeah I just I was like what are we doing and
 even my youngest son was like we did recess indoors because the principal
 said we won't we won't go do recess outdoors if it's if it's a hundred and
 two or above and I saw somebody at the school has figured it out but I said a
 hundred and two who gave that two-degree variance to like I was thinking a
 hundred degrees easy that's the official number math that's the number that you
 want to pay attention to is the 102 and that's really crazy
 amateurs pay attention to a hundred professionals pay attention to 102 it's
 it's a hundred one boys roll out the soccer balls let's go yeah I got an eye
 on the thermometer if it takes up to 103 we're heading inside and it's madness I
 mean there are the soccer practices start next week and I'm like it is still
 August why are we pretending like it's not August in Las Vegas why are we like
 why are we doing this yeah cargo cults of education programs it's still October
 it can still be October in Las Vegas and be that hot oh my god that's all yeah it
 is it is ridiculous that that is why when I joined the cross-country bear
 jamboree aha I didn't fuck around I just I just did the the animatronic junk band
 you signed up to become a robot high school guitar player I was I was an
 animatronic jug band fat bear that sat down I was like can I just sign up for
 cross-country bear bear jamboree Paul ran cross-country a couple of times in
 the suit it didn't end well no that was awful yeah I have an update for some of
 the scoops who told me basically there's a there's a k-pop Disney show where they
 do k-pop versions of different Disney songs and stuff because my kids have
 ever since they went to that concert I've not stopped listening just cannot
 stop listening to the soundtrack to zombies and descendants movies oh so
 you're trying to switch it up on them so they said some people said the music
 from the k-pop ones actually pretty good and so I try to turn my kids onto that
 and they saw it coming a mile away and they were like no no no thanks have you
 tried black pink I was like hey I heard this like a k-pop show in Disney maybe
 we should watch that tonight and they're like no nice try narc concert footage on
 YouTube and stuff I bet they'll like that all right yes I think killers of
 the age where I think black pink will turn his head yeah black pink is good
 he'll be like and they are and they are legit good music too yeah yeah you'll
 like they are they're really all right I'll do my best I'll do anything to stop
 listening to throw on black pink and throw on some fucking babymetal dude
 like it's a babymetal concert footage is awesome as you know early in the summer
 you know we took him to MJ the musical so Michael Jackson was pretty prominent
 and the thing now we have mixed emotions about Michael Jackson's legacy but
 separating artists I don't mind some Michael Jackson music in my car his pro
 profile from Michael Jackson Michael Jackson no longer played at all alive no
 longer alive but also no longer play to my car and I guess I can't complain it
 like I what happened I want my kids listen to Michael Jackson I can't really
 can't really can't really pound that no chaotic clumsy if Jacob could wear a
 47 hat you can listen to Michael Jackson what has this podcast so man that does
 just look like a four
 god fucking damn it Jacob are you like now retroactively looking back at a
 couple weird thumbs up you've gotten walking to Caesars you know walking a
 lot of people just yelling things about like January 6th peaceful protests am I
 right high five yeah oh shit let the protesters out of jail a lot of people
 say that to me fuck the Smithsonian oh yeah yeah that's come up a lot and wait
 make sense now wait like okay here's what that's like seriously we've lost
 the plot we cannot yeah can not care about a Cracker Barrel logo we just can't
 no you just can't we can't we can't right away how weird was it that I
 called this weeks ago when I was in Mesa Arizona I made a joke that it was gonna
 be just called barrel after yeah and and I predicted a dust-up with with MAGA and
 and crack the barrel of course just just of course the Simpsons we predict
 everything they're trying they're looking for anything to distract from a
 certain dead pedophile
 like it wasn't even like they changed the name to something like it you know
 like General Mills and the answer my mind all other stuff like they changed
 they changed stuff they just took off the weird guy that you couldn't really
 see that kind of looked like a shotgun but kind of look like a person leaning
 against so here's the thing it just says that yeah with that logo as a kid I
 always thought that that was a big strapping man man spreading you thought
 he was straddling a barrel I thought he was straddling side straddling a barrel
 yeah only in my later years I really looked at it he's got it's it's not it's
 not one leg it's both his legs and they're withered they look like it looks
 like you straddling my god you're right I always saw him as a straddler yeah yeah
 no he's he's he's an old grandpa he's a withery old grandpa with both his legs
 on one side and so taking right taking away the weird old white dude you can't
 quite see just going with the actual name of the company created chaos I
 mean they lost as it should the company lost hundreds of millions of dollars
 shit really yeah yeah and people are just mad but you know what but you know
 what also that shit is just fucking straight-up stock manipulation yeah yeah
 when you get right down to it all this shit is just they're just playing these
 games okay I work for a certain company that has several concentric circles
 around it that the head of that company just stepped down yeah oh right this the
 CEO just step oh that's right yeah yeah but but he didn't leave the company he's
 gonna pull works for the Olympics several circles yeah he works for he
 works he still works there he's just in a different role so it's all just optics
 and games man it ain't nobody lose enough exactly I got over that woman was
 like we the viral clip with woman saying look you got a lot more in common with
 these immigrants being picked up off the street that you do with the billionaires
 causing this mess oh hey baby that's the goddamn I'm stepping down you won't hear
 me anymore I'm gonna be right over there that's why guys so you cannot talk to me
 I'm gonna be look yeah I've been doing this role shitily for 11 years I'll take
 my golden parachute now thank you very much and continue to work here that's
 just trying to make what two bucks off of Brogan that's it yeah yeah yeah yeah

 investigate the mysterious shit in her shed toilet I'm a little behind in on
 episode 1234 there was a proposal to add see what the cone as a sign-off this
 reminded me that I hadn't actually written in to propose an alternative use
 of cone my partner's work life doesn't allow him to be a scoop however he's
 very supportive enjoys the bits and stories from ICS that I curate for him
 and he knows a few of the running gags what do you mean your partner's work
 life doesn't allow him to be a wait a minute what's going on what's the
 conflict of interest we present we pose your partner's work doesn't allow your
 partner to listen to podcasts well I don't know what's going on there yeah he
 also enjoys meeting scoops everyone will be known for known or met thus far has
 been amazing kind and fun as my partner supportive and scoop adjacent I have
 taken to referring to him as my cone in a few of the scoop gatherings that we
 have been a part of I would like to pose the cone be used for a non scoop
 supportive partner and that the new sign off be one of the following see you in
 the parlor wink and tap on nose optional or see you at the soda fountain jerk
 optional handshake like pulling a soda fuck you in the face that's about the
 fountain jerk I like to see at the set of fountain jerk it's good yeah I like
