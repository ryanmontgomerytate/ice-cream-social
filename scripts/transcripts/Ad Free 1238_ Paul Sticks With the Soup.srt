 stuff guys yeah happened I'm being sarcastic but no I'm in LA doing a

18
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,620
 little run at the Magic Castle nice nice have you already started that or

19
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:58,920
 is that coming up soon no I started it did Wednesday night and Thursday night so

20
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,840
 far and what room are you in the Peller theater okay which is funny because the

21
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,440
 theater that features duos so people think Peller is a combination of pen

22
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,760
 and teller but it's not true just by coincidence the guy who pwned it up the

23
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,040
 the cash to make it happen was a guy named Albert Peller got the theater

24
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,840
 named after him and yeah it's but you know the interesting thing about Albert

25
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,560
 right did you know Albert no I don't know if you knew Albert or not but he

26
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,440
 actually changed his name to represent Penn and Teller he was such a big fan of

27
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,060
 Penn and Teller that he changed his name to celebrate Penn and Teller and then by

28
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:43,120
 coincidence that theater was named after him originally his his last name was

29
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,520
 Angel Field and but then he he found more magic people that to change his

30
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,280
 name to so

31
00:02:52,280 --> 00:03:06,040
 but yeah and so I'm playing with my buddy Nick Paul a very funny guy and one bit

32
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,840
 we always do in the show is we say we have an improv background and so we do

33
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,000
 improv during a magic trick where I basically just try to mess with him

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,680
 while he does I love I still haven't seen this idea live I love this idea it's

35
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:27,200
 really fun it's really fun and so yeah last night I was messing with him and

36
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:34,320
 actually messed up the trick good you got into it so you're playing the bit

37
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,920
 too hard exactly I'm honestly not interested in you fucking with him

38
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,080
 during the set if you've never fully messed up a trick while small fucking

39
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,760
 with him no and I had this I just I did this bit during my magic live show so

40
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,080
 when I messed up and he really had to reset I go don't worry I can handle this

41
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,440
 I'm an improv guy a master of crowd work sure I mostly work cruise ships but

42
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,200
 crowd work is universal hands up who's celebrating their 50th wedding

43
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:14,680
 anniversary crowd work is the same no matter where you go quick where are my

44
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,400
 people who are turning a hundred right now

45
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:28,360
 hey there they are there's always a group of them no matter where Arthur

46
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:39,880
 Peller 110 there he is yeah yeah yeah how old is he he dead little is known

47
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:49,720
 about him little is known about he's an enigma is that right it depends on how

48
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:57,120
 wide you want the scope to go no one of this show knows no one no one playing

49
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:07,320
 the pillar theater this week knows that's what I know yeah but we're doing

54
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,280

55
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:41,680
 it's been a great run so far it's always fun to be back out here nice yeah I've

56
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:49,080
 had a comic booky week mm-hmm you've got exposed to radiation and now you can

57
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:57,200
 turn green at will well I told you guys I saw Thunderbolts yeah oh yeah didn't

58
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,880
 really like it I just saw Superman which would better what did you get the soup

59
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,080
 or the man I stuck with the soup I don't regret it

60
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,280
 waiter there's a man in my suit Superman

61
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:24,680
 has that been done before I know it's my brain was in the same exact thing it's

62
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,720
 like wait that's a good joke that's just a simple turn that has to be done before

63
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,320
 but it's really I have to have been done before by somebody yeah yeah yeah that's

64
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:43,960
 Superman oh it's all right it's okay I'm not I'm a Marvel guy not a DC guy I was

65
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,000
 gonna say that thing people are some people are finding it very emotional

66
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,840
 seeing that movie really yeah the the last the last couple minutes the old

67
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,640
 James Gunn heartstring machine oh that's right it is a James Gunn one isn't it it

68
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,800
 fires up on full cylinders in the last couple moments but so I feel the movie

69
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,840
 there's like a baby raccoon that they're torturing brother crying it's a it is he

70
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:19,800
 throws baby's dog squirrels everything your emotions throws everything at the

71
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,840
 fucking screen he hates automatically the motions no no no it's fine with your

72
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,400
 school and chat with a bold opinion that this man was a lot better than the

73
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:37,080
 Snyder one wow the famously bad Snyder Superman I'm gonna say so is so is

74
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:46,240
 everything yeah telling you about Superman Jesus so bad but yes is all

75
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,960
 right you know but no I don't know I don't see I don't see how they're gonna

76
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:57,520
 build the franchise off all this but we'll see now we'll see I yeah I don't

77
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:06,160
 care about that though James Gunn's in charge of making new DC films fact this

78
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,120
 yes this supposed you know the Superman has to be responsible for every single

79
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,560
 movie that's going to come out after this I think it's just not something that

80
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,840
 has to happen okay all right I think the DC is fucking up timing wise bigger than

81
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,520
 bigger than just will they be able to do a sequel or universe around this I think

82
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,800
 everybody is ready to take a break from superhero movies I think that I think

83
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,000
 yes the majority of people around are ready to just be done with superhero

84
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,200
 movies for a little while I know which which I know leads me to why DC is such

85
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,480
 a terrible company the best movie they've made recently is just too little

86
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,240
 too late yeah it is like a good superhero movie everybody's tired of

87
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,360
 watching superhero movies shit and it it really is a matter of timing like you

88
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,200
 say Jacob and I think it's more to the point of at least for me my personal

89
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,440
 self not only am I a little bit done with the whole onslaught of superhero

90
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:10,680
 there's a lot but I think more more for me I feel like I can't even I can't even

91
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:16,960
 believe in this shit at all at this point because no one's stepping up to do

92
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:23,220
 shit when did you believe in the end the Superman oh I don't believe in the

93
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:29,600
 Superman I believe in the spider-man but just leave sticky webs everywhere

94
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,680
 everywhere that you go but I don't know it's just it's just hard to to get your

95
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,920
 gumption up for that you know truth and justice stuff when truth and justice is

96
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:45,160
 under such direct attack name one place that it's not the way you think the

97
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:51,160
 fucking Smithsonian yeah I mean it's it's preposterous that's the thing and I

98
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,400

99
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:01,480

 as soon as I suggested let's drive out to the mills and Anne agreed I said I'll

154
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,560
 drive if you're not gonna give me guff about the potholes and she's like I'll

155
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:25,360
 drive because there are god-sized cracks in the earth that await await your

156
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,480
 vehicle and Anne just can't she's like anytime I hit one the wrong way it's

157
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:38,200
 like forget it she will drive around the whole parking lot so the the the place

158
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:43,520
 closed quote-unquote the mills closed and everything's in this weird litigation

159
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:49,080
 space right and it comes down to the stores that are renting they're quick

160
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,800
 timeout aren't just clear you said I'll go if you don't complain about the

161
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:00,640
 potholes and her answer was I'll drive yes so yes and was like no no I'm going

162
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,200
 to complain about the puddle so I guess I should drive that's it like yeah she's

163
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:12,900
 like I'll just I'll just drive you know you can't put that on the table I would

164
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:23,560
 veto that right away if I don't complain about the potholes I suppose I'll do the

165
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:29,000
 drive that's what she said and I'm like okay fine now no I heard that I heard

166
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,120
 that conversation happen I accepted it and I moved on because I have been a

167
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,920
 part of that conversation word-for-word absolutely and to to her credit she's

168
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,280
 been having to go from store to store all around this district right yeah so

169
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,640
 she goes there's a cup there's a store out by the mills that she goes to so she

170
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:54,960
 knows these streets so she knows where the killer potholes are so she has some

171
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:00,640
 sense of the navigation of the streets and I don't knows the streets and don't

172
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,080
 ever question I like it don't ever question that Anne McPheeters knows the

173
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,440
 street it was like I think it's called like a harbor pilot or whatever but

174
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:14,000
 basically oh yeah when you bring big ships into ports they take a small boat

175
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,840
 they shepherd out a guy who knows how to navigate yeah the tugboat that gets you

176
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:24,600
 away from the rock yeah I like that they could fucking use that out there and as

177
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,840
 the harbor pilot of potholes getting to this thing like no no we're gonna look

178
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:38,560

205
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,840
 and the giant peach well that was my final draft after I experimented with

206
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:29,600
 several other large objects before I landed on James of the giant peach there

207
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:41,440
 was Kevin and the gargantuan grapes there was also Stephen and the abnormally

 silver dollar the dumb lady she was just a dumb person she was a dumb person I

211
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:28,800
 went on to write more dumb stories later but finally of course I landed on James

212
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:37,960
 and the giant peach yes now if you want to come up with your own person and the

213
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:47,040
 large thing story I encourage you to do so but don't you dare use the name James

214
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:55,440
 don't you dare use the adjective giant don't you dare use peaches those are my

215
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:03,320
 intellectual properties hi I'm Jimmy the large nectarine and I would like to tell

 around my idea of having an individual involved with a large object yeah no I

221
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:46,920
 have become the personification of the object yeah so you have anthropomorphize

222
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:54,200
 that would be like me having a book called James the giant peach I'm just

223
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,120
 hearing dollar signs that's all I'm hearing that's absurd and you are you

 Pittsburgh Mills parking lot real quick get that get that cake baby out of you

255
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:33,760
 that same night I discovered that several of the Fremont Street performers

256
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,640
 are now trying you know when they when they shut all the lights down on Fremont

257
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,600
 Street and they do the shows on the canopy they do like the video shows on

258
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,160
 the canopy above there right so I guess several of the street performers have

259
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:53,400
 now instead of taking a break while the canopy does its thing they try to dance

260
00:26:53,400 --> 00:27:00,000
 along to it okay because I guess they're not allowed to do their act while the

261
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,480
 canopy is playing but they can just dance along to the canopy and so they

262
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,000
 stop doing several people stop doing whatever act they're doing on Fremont

263
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,200
 Street and just start awkwardly dancing along with whatever is happening on the

264
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,600
 big Fremont Street canopy and they expect people to continue tipping them

265
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:25,040
 and or stay at their location to watch the show restart after the canopy stops

266
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:33,280
 doing its thing that's like y'all have the wrong idea on what to do with this

267
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:39,040
 situation this I appreciate y'all trying something this isn't it my heart goes

268
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:45,040
 out to those poor motherfuckers oh my god that is the worst gig on planet Earth I

269
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:50,240
 think I didn't stop yesterday and watch a street magician though on my on my

270
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,680
 stroll of the strip yesterday there was a street magician in front of Bellagio

271
00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:02,400
 and so I saw that guy oh maybe he yeah he made my faith in humanity disappear

272
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:08,600
 he wasn't that bad no no no no no I'm just saying in the general that the poor

273
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:14,680
 performers had to be out there oh huskin and buskin oh man oh Jeff Lumis points

274
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,520
 out but the top five Fremont Street performers pull in some bank there is

275
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:23,760
 sure there is a real cottage industry that happens in Las Vegas with the

276
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,040
 street performers especially down at Fremont Street yeah we don't know whether

277
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,080
 the guy used to get paid 20 bucks get kicked in the balls we don't know whether

278
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,400
 he stopped that for medical reasons or whether he's now retired to a lavish

279
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:39,360
 island we don't know yeah I think or they did some kind of ordinance on it I

280
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,320
 think they actually I think that guy that Matt's talking about died oh we all

281
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:52,160
 the nut kicking guy from a nut kick I someone kicked his nuts into outer space

282

 just fucking Thanos did just ah the legend of moon nuts your testicles are

283
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:11,880
 like planets boom no I think I don't I don't I don't know I don't remember

284
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,880
 anything about him dying but I did think that I think they stopped him doing that

285
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,080
 yeah oh you think they probably died because he had because he stopped that

286
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:27,040
 was the only thing keeping his balls from growing out of his heart every time

287
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:31,280
 let's see it was the only way he could keep his balls from becoming so big that

288
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:37,200
 they would keep him in his house they found him in his house he woke up one

289

00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:50,720

343
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:17,840
 true story I wrapped up in a Las Vegas sexting rig and as an Israeli citizen I

344
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:27,040
 got bailed out and then just got in a plane and flew the country all right and

345
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,440
 that was shortly before he became president of Israel another success

346
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,880
 story everybody but last week in Las Vegas wait a minute all right commercial

347
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:50,720
 over also dr. Hassan Pfeffer's fart box that's a great costume idea is that's

348
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:57,800
 open to interpretation has to be a Dutch oven costume on Amazon no there was a

349
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,920
 child sex ring arrest they rested like eight people in connection with a child

350
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:13,720
 sex ring here in Las Vegas there's a big children eight people eight it wasn't

351
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:32,200
 ice kids are still running the streets yeah but yeah so one of them was an

352
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,880
 Israeli citizen and they put his bond at like yeah I don't know I don't know the

353
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,360
 amount but it was a low amount so he just paid it he just paid it and went to

354
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:46,360
 the airport got on a plane and just left the country okay you know he probably

355
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:51,400
 didn't realize that he wasn't technically allowed so there's a bit of a

356
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:56,760
 dust-up over you know with all the people involved like how the hell did

357
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:03,920
 you let that happen controversial story here local is saying this was not just

358
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,920
 an Israeli citizen but a government official ah so that makes it a little

359
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:13,260
 more sticky and I don't guess we have any kind of extradition deal there oh

360
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:21,960
 you know if anything Israel does it's played by the rules so holy an Israel

361
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,960
 government official was arrested in Las Vegas earlier this month on charges of

362
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:34,360
 luring a child for sex yeah like full-on yeah like with a straight-up fish and

363
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:42,200
 pole yeah candy bar a bobber and everything Wow know what I mean bird

364
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:51,120
 never make bobber jokes it was Lake Mead we a lot of people stock their ponds with

365
00:37:51,120 --> 00:38:01,780
 fresh fish we we stock Lake Mead with children hungry children let's see oh he

366
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:10,360
 had a $10,000 bail yet a $10,000 bail he posted that that standard amount for the

367
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:14,040
 charge didn't appear before the judge was not required to surrender his

368
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:21,760
 passport and returned to Israel two days later on a pre-scheduled flight they

369
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,680
 could have just the chat flights he already had scheduled the chat is

370
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,520
 filling in the mad details here winter scoop says we do have an extradition

371
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:35,600
 treaty with Israel they're claiming he wasn't the right guy they're claiming and

372
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:40,440
 and then Newman comes in and says this is an earnest Lexington Kentucky native

373
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,840
 well this guy was from Kentucky oh this is really government official but he's

374
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:50,720
 from Kentucky he's originally from Kentucky apparently well that's what

375
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,200
 Newman's saying yeah right well I trust Newman I you know if it comes if it's a

376
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,680
 Kentucky history thing Newman knows it that's what we know that is true well I

377
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:06,080
 mean we know how to fish for children right

378
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:18,200

380
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,800

00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:27,080
 object and my wife got angry that I used the toaster tongs on another food object

454
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:33,520
 on the improper thing so I was never in the toaster and a bit of like you know

455
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:40,480
 20% rage 50% sarcasm bought a second pair of toaster tongs good okay to be

456
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:49,480
 like I'll use these however I please and my son spontaneously grabbed both

457
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:56,200
 toaster tongs and started moving around my kitchen like a crab oh no and I was

458

00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:18,280
 cower into a corner with the two pastry times nurture versus nature that that

462
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:26,760
 memory straight up came out of your boss that's just yeah it's science your tongue

463
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:32,960
 yeah it is science well you know they're finding out more and more of that crazy

464
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:38,840
 shit how much yeah how much DNA memory there is and how much and I mean you

465
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:46,120
 know cuz like like with with women they're born with easy now we're gonna

466
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:52,160
 be in a Sarah Ross clip right now we're three guys talking about women right

467
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:57,760
 right right right how about female presenting individual okay go for it

468
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:04,320
 okay representing individuals see our are are born with stop the even me and

469
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:10,760
 microphones ovum that that you know that's from there you know they have

470
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:16,680
 them in the womb all right I mean yeah like as the as the zygote develops yeah

471
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:22,520
 yeah no zygote develop into babies into a fetus yeah like early on you've got

472
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:27,760
 that genetic material that's gonna make the next generation and they're

473
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,780
 discovering more and more that events that occur during pregnancy to the

474
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:41,560
 mother can translate genetic information habits different stuff like like they

475
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:48,560
 did a study on like groups of people who are experiencing famine and how their

476
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:53,280
 progeny were affected by that and not even that first generation that second

477
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,280
 generation sometimes - I don't know it's interesting it is interesting I mean I'm

478
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:03,480
 always blown away by animals learning behavior right or like also all these

479
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:07,760
 animals like no like crows in a certain region all know how to like navigate

480
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,180
 traffic lights and things like that right or like all right yeah things with

481
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:15,000
 it and the light over them that but by the way that's how they navigate the

482
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,120
 traffic lights that yeah yeah whereas crows of the past would just slide right

483
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:28,920
 into them right right they've evolved but did you did you see not they are

484
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,400
 evolving now Jacob did you hear about they are I'm being stupid but I know

485
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:37,880
 it's actually happening too no no no no did you did you read this article Matt

486
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:44,200
 about the the crows that have all gone mute no yeah so there's this whole

487
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:50,320
 region of crows that have gone completely mute and the scientists are

488
00:50:50,320 --> 00:51:17,160
 looking for the cause I killed Jacob I killed Jacob everyone I'm sorry I'm

489

502
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:56,720
 you getting the wrong thing out of the with the toaster tongs is all that been

503
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,680
 settled or is there still tension in the house I don't know I never see my wife I

504
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:09,680
 don't know I don't know oh I saw yesterday she was she was mad about

505
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:16,560
 something I couldn't tell what but she was hot about something but yeah yeah

506
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:25,400
 yeah you should do Cisco's the tong song oh tong to tong tong tong yeah yeah oh

507
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:30,660
 someone already memed you Paul slaking fool it's not a murder of crows on the

508
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:37,160
 list there's probable cause there you go oh slaking classic now I'm mad at you

509
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:50,200
 too now I'm mad at you so one of my kids is now a middle school ah they start

510
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:56,120
 middle school at 7 a.m. because they hate you that's it wait a minute they say

511
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:02,440
 they say cuz the bus schedule so like grade school starts at 9 a.m. and middle

512
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:06,680
 school starts at 7 a.m. they say it's now busing this is this is something

513
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:11,920
 where I legit have beef with the way they do it because there are tons of

514
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,800
 studies that say this is terribly detrimental and it's especially

515
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:22,200
 detrimental to children in that age range I know what beef is I have had beef

516
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:29,440
 experience I know adolescence need more sleep they've proven that man it's

517
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:35,400
 fucked up oh I I agree it's a real I know you do I know it's not on you it's

518
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,640
 a real game changer I would be so awkward if this is where Paul found out

519
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:47,560
 that Matt was the one who set that rule up the one son of a bus never forgive

520
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:54,880
 you this podcast is finished was even worse she was over there not looking at

521
00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:01,360
 her kids is middle school they had signups for cross-country and so my

522
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:08,720
 sign up for cross-country and it is a hundred and five degrees out right now

523
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:13,840
 yeah and so I figured they can't be they must have them inside of the gym or they

524
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:18,520
 must like you know take it easy or do something different and I go to pick up

525
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:23,120
 my kid from after cross-country and his face is just bright red like a tomato

526
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:31,760
 like absolutely no your son is a fair skin young man yes also anyway yeah he

527
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:37,280
 is porcelain skin yeah and it was a bright red tomato and I was like I said

528
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:43,480
 is that sunburn or from exhaustion of running and he says ice combo he says I

529
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:49,320
 don't know that I don't I honestly don't know probably is the answer probably oh

530
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:52,960
 this is like I don't know why I look like I'm a tomato right now that's

531
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:58,880
 horrible I said why are they having you run what is above a hundred and five

532
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:03,840
 degrees they said oh cuz you know we're part of the national program and so we

533
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,640
 have to we have to compare what we're doing to all the other schools who are

534
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:12,320
 doing it and most schools don't are in a hot area like ours and so it's like a

535
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:17,640
 false sport on the national oh I got you I said that's not a good enough answer

536
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:21,680
 for me just so you're just so we're clear I don't care how I don't care how

537
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:27,360
 you fair nationally my child I don't care yeah I don't care how you fair

538
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:31,680
 nationally in this thing that I already don't care about I don't care about

539
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,240
 children's cross-country running so why would I care about how you line up

540
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:41,760
 against other kids from Milwaukee yeah I just I was like what are we doing and

541
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,000
 even my youngest son was like we did recess indoors because the principal

542
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,840
 said we won't we won't go do recess outdoors if it's if it's a hundred and

543
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:55,880
 two or above and I saw somebody at the school has figured it out but I said a

544
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:00,560
 hundred and two who gave that two-degree variance to like I was thinking a

545
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:04,640
 hundred degrees easy that's the official number math that's the number that you

546
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:08,840
 want to pay attention to is the 102 and that's really crazy

547
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:15,360
 amateurs pay attention to a hundred professionals pay attention to 102 it's

548
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:22,000
 it's a hundred one boys roll out the soccer balls let's go yeah I got an eye

549
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,720
 on the thermometer if it takes up to 103 we're heading inside and it's madness I

550
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,800
 mean there are the soccer practices start next week and I'm like it is still

551
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:35,720
 August why are we pretending like it's not August in Las Vegas why are we like

552
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:40,760
 why are we doing this yeah cargo cults of education programs it's still October

553
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:46,600
 it can still be October in Las Vegas and be that hot oh my god that's all yeah it

554
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:53,200
 is it is ridiculous that that is why when I joined the cross-country bear

555
00:57:53,200 --> 00:58:00,440
 jamboree aha I didn't fuck around I just I just did the the animatronic junk band

556
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,360
 you signed up to become a robot high school guitar player I was I was an

557
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:10,120
 animatronic jug band fat bear that sat down I was like can I just sign up for

558
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:18,000
 cross-country bear bear jamboree Paul ran cross-country a couple of times in

559
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,560
 the suit it didn't end well no that was awful yeah I have an update for some of

560
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:26,840
 the scoops who told me basically there's a there's a k-pop Disney show where they

561
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:31,320
 do k-pop versions of different Disney songs and stuff because my kids have

562
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:35,160
 ever since they went to that concert I've not stopped listening just cannot

563
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:39,880
 stop listening to the soundtrack to zombies and descendants movies oh so

564
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,760
 you're trying to switch it up on them so they said some people said the music

565
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:47,560
 from the k-pop ones actually pretty good and so I try to turn my kids onto that

566
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:53,200
 and they saw it coming a mile away and they were like no no no thanks have you

567
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:57,320
 tried black pink I was like hey I heard this like a k-pop show in Disney maybe

 YouTube and stuff I bet they'll like that all right yes I think killers of

570
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,560
 the age where I think black pink will turn his head yeah black pink is good

571
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:24,120
 he'll be like and they are and they are legit good music too yeah yeah you'll

572
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:28,240
 like they are they're really all right I'll do my best I'll do anything to stop

573
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:34,360
 listening to throw on black pink and throw on some fucking babymetal dude

574
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:39,360
 like it's a babymetal concert footage is awesome as you know early in the summer

575
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:42,680
 you know we took him to MJ the musical so Michael Jackson was pretty prominent

576
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:46,560
 and the thing now we have mixed emotions about Michael Jackson's legacy but

577
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:53,560
 separating artists I don't mind some Michael Jackson music in my car his pro

578
00:59:53,560 --> 01:00:04,520
 profile from Michael Jackson Michael Jackson no longer played at all alive no

579
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:07,920
 longer alive but also no longer play to my car and I guess I can't complain it

580
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:13,440
 like I what happened I want my kids listen to Michael Jackson I can't really

581
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:19,220
 can't really can't really pound that no chaotic clumsy if Jacob could wear a

582
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:29,960
 47 hat you can listen to Michael Jackson what has this podcast so man that does

583
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,560
 just look like a four

584
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:38,320
 god fucking damn it Jacob are you like now retroactively looking back at a

585
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:44,520
 couple weird thumbs up you've gotten walking to Caesars you know walking a

586
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:52,600
 lot of people just yelling things about like January 6th peaceful protests am I

587
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:58,200
 right high five yeah oh shit let the protesters out of jail a lot of people

588
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:04,160
 say that to me fuck the Smithsonian oh yeah yeah that's come up a lot and wait

589
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:09,200
 make sense now wait like okay here's what that's like seriously we've lost

590
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:15,800
 the plot we cannot yeah can not care about a Cracker Barrel logo we just can't

591
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:20,240
 no you just can't we can't we can't right away how weird was it that I

592
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,840
 called this weeks ago when I was in Mesa Arizona I made a joke that it was gonna

593
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:30,800
 be just called barrel after yeah and and I predicted a dust-up with with MAGA and

594
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:36,000
 and crack the barrel of course just just of course the Simpsons we predict

595
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:41,800
 everything they're trying they're looking for anything to distract from a

596
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:46,160
 certain dead pedophile

597
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:54,080
 like it wasn't even like they changed the name to something like it you know

598
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:57,600
 like General Mills and the answer my mind all other stuff like they changed

599
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:02,080
 they changed stuff they just took off the weird guy that you couldn't really

600
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:05,680
 see that kind of looked like a shotgun but kind of look like a person leaning

601
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:11,760
 against so here's the thing it just says that yeah with that logo as a kid I

602
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:19,800

 life doesn't allow him to be a wait a minute what's going on what's the

640
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:50,480

656
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:13,420
 achievement in improvisation here's the scenario my wife and I had been married

657
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:17,160
 for a little while now and we have been meaning to update our wheels I came home

658
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:21,120
 one day Kevin carrying heavy grocery shopping bags and walked straight past

659
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,960
 her into the kitchen to dump them on the table my wife followed me into the

660
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:29,720
 kitchen and from behind said in a bright and proud voice hey honey I got my new

661
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:36,120
 will signed off and finished so now you will get everything before she could

662
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:41,340
 even finish her sentence I turned on her and used a piece of produce to pretend

663
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:46,600
 to stab my wife directly in the heart somehow she didn't see the funny side of

664
01:07:46,600 --> 01:08:01,480
 this and I was sleeping on the couch that's Andy oh no Andy good bit good bit

665
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:05,800

666
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:15,600
 mad at your ass yeah well was it a banana oh maybe a cucumber celery

667
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:22,320

668
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:31,480
 just no produce a flatly old chicken I challenge you to a duel and you smack

669
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:41,320

01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:47,360
 where Homer goes around slapping people and challenging them to a duel gets in a

671
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:54,040
 gunfight well that's what we used to do on this show now we just do jock vs.

674
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:34,960
 let's see Matt Matt the Magnum scoop us wrote this price of sprite for us said

675
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:40,840
 that they know that Matt really hated all of the jock vs. nerds where there

676
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:45,320
 were the infinite wrong answers so we made the price of sprites apparently

677
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:49,600
 Magnum scoop has made this price of sprite specifically so that Matt would

678
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:54,520
 hate price of sprite by the end of this game as well Wow Wow let's see what

679

 law of thermodynamics it isn't for what do you I'm first I don't even know what

681
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:17,200
