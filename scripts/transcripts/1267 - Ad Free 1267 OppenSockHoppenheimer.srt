Hey, Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social? Yeah, I'd love to great. Let's go

16
0:01:07 --> 0:01:09
50 fun years old

17
0:01:24 --> 0:01:26
Barely sitting because of me issues

18
0:01:27 --> 0:01:33
And I'm taking the audio guys we're preaching fun. Yeah, wait, you have any issues. I have a bum need right now

19
0:01:33 --> 0:01:36
Yeah, I think there's something going on. It's my right knee is just acting a fool

20
0:01:37 --> 0:01:38
I don't know why

21
0:01:39 --> 0:01:44
It's just been the last five days the lefty. So we have a different disease entirely. Absolutely

22
0:01:44 --> 0:01:49
Absolutely different. It's be careful fellas. It's spreading completely different shit. I don't know

23
0:01:49 --> 0:01:54
It's just you know, I think it's possibly the change in the weather combined with the fact that I

24
0:01:55 --> 0:01:58
Worked my ass off three days straight. I don't know

25
0:01:59 --> 0:02:05
Who knows whatever it's you know, what's fucked up, but good it gets better the more I'm up and on it

26
0:02:05 --> 0:02:11
So I guess that's weird. It's when I sit down that it starts to get really bad. Oh, it's like tightening up

27
0:02:11 --> 0:02:16
Yeah, I don't know so I'm having to stretch a lot more and all that kind of thing which eventually is good

28
0:02:16 --> 0:02:18
I do need to do more stretching and all that kind of thing

29
0:02:19 --> 0:02:24
What's happening with your knee Matt? I?

30
0:02:24 --> 0:02:32
Just heard it playing in the soccer game with adults versus kids soccer game. Oh smart. Oh, yeah smart play

31
0:02:32 --> 0:02:35
Okay. Oh, hold on one second guys. I gotta hit this button

32
0:02:41 --> 0:02:43
Because my knee hurts too

33
0:02:45 --> 0:02:51
And what I'm finding is that I am a restless sleeper. Oh

34
0:02:51 --> 0:02:54
I tossed in turn so what happens is I

35
0:02:55 --> 0:03:01
Feel better and then I wake up and my knee hurts the next day because I've you've been jerking around leg around all

36
0:03:01 --> 0:03:06
When I like okay, so I worked yesterday early in the morning

37
0:03:06 --> 0:03:12
You know had a full day and stayed up past my normal bedtime, which I was I had three days in a row

38
0:03:12 --> 0:03:14
So I was getting to bed at like five o'clock

39
0:03:14 --> 0:03:18
So I wouldn't play I wouldn't play any games and sick as a dog

40
0:03:18 --> 0:03:24
So I was trying to take care of her a little bit and not get sick myself and so far so good

41
0:03:24 --> 0:03:27
Yeah, I got a little stuffy head today, but not too bad, but

42
0:03:30 --> 0:03:36
When I stay up late like I did last night past my normal bedtime my

43
0:03:37 --> 0:03:39
Legs start to get real

44
0:03:40 --> 0:03:40
antsy

45
0:03:41 --> 0:03:44
And they start they start to hurt and they get jittery

46
0:03:44 --> 0:03:48
And I have to like shake my leg and twist my leg all evening

47
0:03:48 --> 0:03:51
It's like go to bed go to bed go to bed. Okay fine

48
0:03:52 --> 0:03:56
But yeah, I was up pretty late. I mean I wasn't up that late. I was like 930, but

49
0:03:58 --> 0:03:59
Well, I

50
0:04:00 --> 0:04:06
Forgot that I'm here. I'm at sea. I'm in the ocean. Yes. I'm actually actually off-shore some rando

51
0:04:07 --> 0:04:08
island at princess zones

52
0:04:12 --> 0:04:14
But I've seen it and I

53
0:04:16 --> 0:04:19
Forgot to pack a knee brace because I found it was helping my knees

54
0:04:19 --> 0:04:22
I was going to sleep with a knee brace, which doesn't help me sleep better

55
0:04:22 --> 0:04:28
It just helps my knee feel better the next day. I sleep worse. I sleep more restlessly wearing a knee brace

56
0:04:28 --> 0:04:31
Okay, right because I wake up. Oh, it's got me

57
0:04:34 --> 0:04:40
Something's grabbing my knee. Oh shit. I'm watching alien Earth. I assume some alien has gripped my knee

58
0:04:48 --> 0:04:49
They do

59
0:04:49 --> 0:04:55
By the way, I hate the modern TV show where like you you kind of like slow burn

60
0:04:55 --> 0:05:00
Middle episodes to like to like peak almost peak boredom and then they and then they really stick the landing on the final

61
0:05:00 --> 0:05:03
Two and a half episodes and you're like, yeah, all right

62
0:05:04 --> 0:05:09
You did pick it up and I it's like I'd rather watch the show that I just watched at the end the whole time

63
0:05:09 --> 0:05:17
Are they I hate it too and what makes me crazy is in our day. We had 24 25

64
0:05:19 --> 0:05:21
Now they can't even get fucking eight. Yeah

65
0:05:23 --> 0:05:28
Well, yeah, I think we look back at the quality of those 24 episodes. We're not gonna be like nail them

66
0:05:28 --> 0:05:32
I think yeah, I think you'd be surprised. I think you'd be surprised

67
0:05:34 --> 0:05:40
Well, here's the thing here's not nailed them. Take a look take a pause recording. Let's all go watch Hill Street Blues

68
0:05:40 --> 0:05:41
And let's come back

69
0:05:43 --> 0:05:47
Let's all go watch in the heat of the night. I mean my my base dog is

70
0:05:49 --> 0:05:54
We're gonna sit down everybody and all watch a different world. Let's do it

71
0:05:54 --> 0:05:57
I just think they're trying to get rid of more episodes

72
0:05:57 --> 0:06:00
Where I want to agree with you

73
0:06:01 --> 0:06:05
It's just money. We just we're spending movie money on television now

74
0:06:05 --> 0:06:08
And so you can't afford to make more than eight episodes, right?

75
0:06:09 --> 0:06:09
but

76
0:06:11 --> 0:06:17
Compelling drama that can resolve in an hour. That's where you're talking about that's what you're talking about Paul is

77
0:06:18 --> 0:06:23
These episodes are these these modern TV shows are secretly just super long movies. Yeah, which is gross, you know

78
0:06:23 --> 0:06:26
Yeah, they're a lot of movies. They have some

79
0:06:26 --> 0:06:28
They have some kind of arc

80
0:06:28 --> 0:06:29
Yeah

81
0:06:30 --> 0:06:31
But they

82
0:06:31 --> 0:06:37
They're slow burning the shit. Well, that's the thing like Trek is sort of

83
0:06:38 --> 0:06:43
Responsible for all this too because it was season three where they did

84
0:06:44 --> 0:06:45
You know best of both worlds

85
0:06:45 --> 0:06:48
That was the first true

86
0:06:49 --> 0:06:54
Season to season cliffhanger that had ever been attempted in syndication

87
0:06:54 --> 0:06:59
Oh, I see it was it was the end of a season and then the season break. Yes

88
0:06:59 --> 0:07:03
Gotcha, so half of the season half of the cliffhanger was at the end of the season

89
0:07:03 --> 0:07:08
then you had to wait four months five months before the next one started up again and

90
0:07:09 --> 0:07:10
you know

91
0:07:11 --> 0:07:17
Tantalizing but it was the one where Patrick Stewart became the other thing that the when he became a cutis. Yes

92
0:07:17 --> 0:07:22
That is are the what's the Borg that's the Borg that became the cutis of Borg

93
0:07:22 --> 0:07:28
Yeah, and that is that was the model that they then went forward with from then on out with all

94
0:07:28 --> 0:07:34
The Trek series all the Trek series had season cliffhangers. I

95
0:07:34 --> 0:07:39
Still remember as a kid not knowing how like I didn't necessarily like we didn't get like TV guide to the house or anything, right?

96
0:07:40 --> 0:07:45
And different strokes. Yeah, they snuck under the set of Knight Rider. I remember that

97
0:07:46 --> 0:07:50
They were hiding behind he was with that kid from Terminator

98
0:07:50 --> 0:07:54
Not the main kid from Terminator the other redhead kid from Terminator

99
0:07:54 --> 0:07:59
Well, I think was also on salute your shorts. Yeah. Yeah, the little punk that was him and and

100
0:07:59 --> 0:08:02
Arnold hid what happened they hid and they almost got killed

101
0:08:03 --> 0:08:08
They hid the hit in the set and it's that was gonna be exploded, right? Yeah. Yeah, and everybody goes

102
0:08:08 --> 0:08:15
The audience goes well and I was like all summer being like I have to remember to watch the first

103
0:08:15 --> 0:08:16
comes back around

104
0:08:16 --> 0:08:18
What happened?

105
0:08:19 --> 0:08:20
Yeah, he was wondering whether

106
0:08:23 --> 0:08:29
Dead and explosion like they start the series like so sorry every character is dead. They all do well

107
0:08:29 --> 0:08:32
It wasn't every character. It was just Arnold dead space

108
0:08:32 --> 0:08:37
The cast on to the set of a James Cameron movie James Cameron murdered them

109
0:08:38 --> 0:08:45
Was gonna happen in terms of that like Arnold's death. Yeah, I don't

110
0:08:45 --> 0:08:49
In a set explosion in the Simpsons in the first season

111
0:08:49 --> 0:08:54
A child was killed. There's that classic episode in the first season Simpsons are all classics

112
0:08:54 --> 0:08:58
But that one where Homer finally goes to try sushi and

113
0:08:59 --> 0:09:05
He fucking loves it and then he decides he wants to go for the forbidden sushi the Fugu

114
0:09:05 --> 0:09:10
Which is the blowfish which if not prepared properly can be poisonous and deadly

115
0:09:11 --> 0:09:16
And yes, so the whole premise was will Homer die

116
0:09:16 --> 0:09:21
Eating this poison sushi and the commercials that you didn't get TV guide

117
0:09:21 --> 0:09:26
I got TV guide and the TV guide commercial was a little blurb a little picture

118
0:09:26 --> 0:09:32
With Bart coming up to going. Yeah, right like they're gonna kill the main character of a

119
0:09:33 --> 0:09:36
Show in the first season and you know

120
0:09:37 --> 0:09:42
So it really was you know, it was before Game of Thrones. They were do that back then

121
0:09:42 --> 0:09:47
They were always on their ear. They were always putting stuff in a thing. What then I also saw

122
0:09:48 --> 0:09:52
Damn, I just saw a tick to talk to me. So say I'm not gonna talk about it. Anyway, I

123
0:09:54 --> 0:09:57
Wanted to say before we go any further. I

124
0:09:57 --> 0:09:59
Wanted to say thank you to Matt and Jacob because

125
0:10:00 --> 0:10:06
Guys, I don't know if you know, but they always come through when it's my birthday and sure enough here

126
0:10:06 --> 0:10:07
We are recording on my birthday

127
0:10:08 --> 0:10:14
And they did it. They gave me permission to use my sound box throughout this episode

128
0:10:16 --> 0:10:20
Happy birthday, buddy. There we go. So that's what you have to look forward to

129
0:10:21 --> 0:10:24
Wait, is zoom is zoom cutting off the

130
0:10:25 --> 0:10:32
The fart box it didn't let the sound go through. Let's see if I can get one to go through the recording will hear it, but we won't

131
0:10:36 --> 0:10:41
Zoom as a thing where it cuts out like weird weird weird noises of it's part of it's part of it's

132
0:10:41 --> 0:10:45
Noise canceling things that you'll meet here. What a bunch of shit

133
0:10:48 --> 0:10:49
Correct that it is going into the

134
0:10:52 --> 0:10:55
Okay, that's great. Well, so it'll be really funny

135
0:10:56 --> 0:10:58
That it will you know

136
0:10:59 --> 0:11:00
It'll come up only in the episode

137
0:11:01 --> 0:11:07
So that'll be a whole surprise for later. Yeah, that's right. So yeah, but a couple of people said it

138
0:11:07 --> 0:11:10
I already had it pulled up to I'm sorry Paul

139
0:11:11 --> 0:11:14
Star Trek didn't do it first. Who did it first?

140
0:11:14 --> 0:11:21
Dallas who shot J. R. Oh, I guess you're right. Yeah, ten years ten years earlier Dallas was 1980

141
0:11:21 --> 0:11:23
Star Trek did it in 1990

142
0:11:24 --> 0:11:28
Yeah, yeah, so they did the the season great who shot J. R

143
0:11:29 --> 0:11:35
I'm sorry Paul. You're precious Star Trek didn't do it first. Hey, look look I'm I am I

144
0:11:36 --> 0:11:40
Have no problem giving Brandon Braga less credit fuck that guy

145
0:11:41 --> 0:11:46
Dog good he can eat dig what a turd he's at Brandon Braga's a piece of shit

146
0:11:53 --> 0:11:59
Oh, man now my my computer's asking me if I'm playing music. No, I'm not playing music. You dumb thing. I

147
0:11:59 --> 0:12:04
Mean I played a tiny little piece of music. Well, now I can't really do it. It's not fun if I nobody can hear it

148
0:12:05 --> 0:12:07
Anyway, oh, I got a message for so

149
0:12:10 --> 0:12:12
Well, not only did I injure my knee playing soccer

150
0:12:13 --> 0:12:17
But we decided this year man. We did a whole

151
0:12:18 --> 0:12:19
Is it Nick Newman

152
0:12:20 --> 0:12:26
Totally influenced by whole family about Thanksgiving. It's basically this is the unit because he did our kids hate

153
0:12:26 --> 0:12:29
Thanksgiving food. Oh

154
0:12:29 --> 0:12:36
Would you do that's right? Your kids do not care for Thanksgiving food. They never have they do not they do not and

155
0:12:37 --> 0:12:40
Sarah's, you know, basically a vegan. Mm-hmm

156
0:12:40 --> 0:12:44
And so I rest that there's only one person the household that was looking forward to Thanksgiving

157
0:12:44 --> 0:12:49
It was me and I was like, well, I'm not gonna I'm not gonna, you know, be a fatty dick

158
0:12:49 --> 0:13:00
And so we blew it off I've never done it before my life we blew off Thanksgiving. Oh

159
0:13:01 --> 0:13:08
I'm so proud of you. I'm so proud of you. Feel so weird. I feel icky about it. No, no, no, what'd you have?

160
0:13:09 --> 0:13:13
Just normal. So here's what we did. We rallied a

161
0:13:13 --> 0:13:18
Kind of like friends friends with kids kickball game, okay?

162
0:13:19 --> 0:13:20
And

163
0:13:21 --> 0:13:26
We brought turkey and roast beef deli slices and croissants and right and some fixings

164
0:13:26 --> 0:13:35
Some hummus of penis peanut. I said Pia penis. I said penis. Okay, so we did we did our we did our new tradition of

165
0:13:35 --> 0:13:37
Dipping our penis and in hummus

166
0:13:37 --> 0:13:37
Good

167
0:13:40 --> 0:13:42
Mind the pine nuts and

168
0:13:44 --> 0:13:48
Uh, we have like a basic like half ass picnic

169
0:13:49 --> 0:13:52
Rich Cooper the jet says that's not a new tradition. You know what's weird matt

170
0:13:53 --> 0:13:59
You know what's strange about that tradition is I personally have never had anyone

171
0:13:59 --> 0:14:01
I've never paid anyone to penis on me before

172
0:14:01 --> 0:14:02
Uh

173
0:14:07 --> 0:14:08
Nobody's buying that

174
0:14:09 --> 0:14:11
You never paid a garbanzo to be

175
0:14:15 --> 0:14:19
They're paying a garbanzo to bean on me. Oh shit

176
0:14:20 --> 0:14:25
There's no evidence that built that built could never garbanzo'd on trump's bean. That's right. No, no

177
0:14:26 --> 0:14:28
But holy shit

178
0:14:30 --> 0:14:35
So then so we're playing kickball and both sarah and I

179
0:14:35 --> 0:14:40
Popped the hamstring playing kickball. Oh, damn it. That's awful

180
0:14:41 --> 0:14:47
I saw sarah that night and she was like this is terrible. This is the worst thing

181
0:14:47 --> 0:14:48
Sarah really

182
0:14:48 --> 0:14:53
Sarah really poppy she was going to run for a ball and you know like like it's like you like music professional dreams

183
0:14:53 --> 0:14:54
Whether they're running and they just stop and you go

184
0:14:55 --> 0:14:58
Yeah, like sarah's sarah's running and all of a sudden it was like nope

185
0:14:58 --> 0:15:02
And I was like, oh god like I was the one running. I could have ran

186
0:15:03 --> 0:15:07
To the next base and I stopped like oh god and then the very next play

187
0:15:08 --> 0:15:11
I popped my hamstring running from second to third. Oh god. So, uh, I just

188
0:15:12 --> 0:15:18
It's my brain subconsciously cannot let sarah have any more attention that she already gets good. I have to bear

189
0:15:18 --> 0:15:22
We have to do it. Well, we had we had inadvertently

190
0:15:22 --> 0:15:25
a similar situation at my home

191
0:15:25 --> 0:15:26
because

192
0:15:26 --> 0:15:27
uh

193
0:15:27 --> 0:15:32
the day before Thanksgiving and got terribly sick like

194
0:15:32 --> 0:15:38
Knocked down drag out sick still had to go to work still worked and almost dying

195
0:15:39 --> 0:15:44
And so I was like, okay. I better make at least some kind of backup plan

196
0:15:44 --> 0:15:48
So on the way home. I bought warm up mashed potatoes and mac and cheese

197
0:15:48 --> 0:15:53
So at least we'd have something that resembled a Thanksgiving day. Okay, okay

198
0:15:53 --> 0:15:59
And got home and sure enough. She was just out of it. We were done. We didn't get to go down to the the in-laws

199
0:16:00 --> 0:16:02
But we absolutely had

200
0:16:02 --> 0:16:05
chicken nuggets mashed potatoes cottage cheese

201
0:16:06 --> 0:16:08
That was that was Thanksgiving dinner

202
0:16:09 --> 0:16:10
That was it

203
0:16:11 --> 0:16:15
Wait, where's the cottage cheese is the cottage cheese of its own dishes to go on top

204
0:16:15 --> 0:16:19
I put mashed I put cottage cheese on the mashed potatoes. I can't I love that. That's my favorite

205
0:16:19 --> 0:16:25
Good lord. I this has come up before and I I still don't understand it. I talk about it all the time

206
0:16:25 --> 0:16:29
It's one of those things that just happened too. I love it just did a triple take up on his on his view

207
0:16:29 --> 0:16:35
I love it. I love I love mashed potatoes. God, it's cheese. I love it. I always have

208
0:16:36 --> 0:16:39
It's so good. Are you pregnant? Are you expecting? I mean

209
0:16:39 --> 0:16:44
By the looks of me you'd think when when's that fucking thing coming but uh

210
0:16:45 --> 0:16:46
No

211
0:16:47 --> 0:16:48
no

212
0:16:49 --> 0:16:50
Uh

213
0:16:50 --> 0:16:55
I let's see nick see nick newman top baked potatoes with cottage cheese. I think it's a southern thing

214
0:16:55 --> 0:16:58
I think there's some kind of weird

215
0:16:59 --> 0:17:02
You and nick will not represent the entire

216
0:17:02 --> 0:17:09
No, okay, okay, but oh i'm say katucky fine. I'll say katucky because I my mom

217
0:17:10 --> 0:17:14
My mom used to make lasagna using cottage cheese instead of ricotta

218
0:17:15 --> 0:17:19
So I that's I prefer cottage cheese and lasagna to ricotta

219
0:17:20 --> 0:17:21
Any day of the week. Yeah

220
0:17:22 --> 0:17:26
But I just really love a little cottage cheese on my mashed potatoes

221
0:17:26 --> 0:17:29
According to the google. It's not a uh, it's not a southern thing or

222
0:17:30 --> 0:17:32
It doesn't have a particular area of origin

223
0:17:33 --> 0:17:39
It is uh touted though as a a nice higher protein version and a little healthier version of mashed potatoes

224
0:17:39 --> 0:17:42
If you're not doing like all the yeah, if you're not doing like the

225
0:17:42 --> 0:17:48
Loaded mash sour creams and bakings and all that now. I just do a little just a little cottage cheese

226
0:17:48 --> 0:17:53
Just a dab of potatoes and some cottage cheese in there little salt and pepper. Yeah, sure

227
0:17:53 --> 0:17:56
Yes, little salt and pepper some kind of sure every doctor be proud

228
0:17:57 --> 0:18:02
Proud of you switching the cottage cheese. Oh, I mean, it's the healthy lifestyle choice of the generation as you can tell

229
0:18:03 --> 0:18:05
It's done wonders for me

230
0:18:05 --> 0:18:06
It's really moved the needle

231
0:18:07 --> 0:18:11
I mean it got you to this birthday. It did. I mean, hey, I made it to 51

232
0:18:11 --> 0:18:12
Better than a lot of people do

233
0:18:13 --> 0:18:16
I bet it's better than half the population does

234
0:18:17 --> 0:18:17
So there you go

235
0:18:19 --> 0:18:23
RFK approved. Don't be saying that lemur creamer lemur creamer in in in the chat

236
0:18:23 --> 0:18:26
Well, it's an event that took out all those horrible dyes of the cottage cheese

237
0:18:27 --> 0:18:30
Turned out that cottage cheese is actually

238
0:18:32 --> 0:18:34
When it's with the mashed potato

239
0:18:36 --> 0:18:37
Brings out the body

240
0:18:40 --> 0:18:40
Oh

241
0:18:40 --> 0:18:43
Paul you RFK we can't hear you, but I know it'll be on the broadcast

242
0:18:48 --> 0:18:55
I killed my wife. I drove into suicide and I write horrible fuck poetry

243
0:18:56 --> 0:19:00
He's so nasty. We're not nasty. He wrote he's so nasty

244
0:19:00 --> 0:19:03
I would pay

245
0:19:04 --> 0:19:08
$14.99 for a book of RFK's poetry. Oh god

246
0:19:10 --> 0:19:13
Don't say that he'll publish it. He'll do it. He'll he don't give a fuck

247
0:19:15 --> 0:19:16
Only if it's an audio

248
0:19:18 --> 0:19:19
He does sound a little like

249
0:19:19 --> 0:19:24
Yes, the kickball we all ate sandwiches and hummus and uh

250
0:19:24 --> 0:19:29
It went home and I had we had leftover pizzas from the day before because we had all the a bunch of kids over

251
0:19:29 --> 0:19:30
if we all saw wicked

252
0:19:30 --> 0:19:31
okay, and

253
0:19:32 --> 0:19:37
So it was so it was leftover pizza was the other Thanksgiving course that we had and then uh,

254
0:19:38 --> 0:19:39
And it was off to mac kings for dessert

255
0:19:40 --> 0:19:40
That's pretty great

256
0:19:41 --> 0:19:43
That sounds like a really nice day

257
0:19:44 --> 0:19:48
Uh, it was super fun. It was it was it was really nice not to take Thanksgiving that seriously

258
0:19:48 --> 0:19:49
And it was like gosh

259
0:19:50 --> 0:19:52
I really have to figure this out

260
0:19:52 --> 0:19:53
It's a really good idea

261
0:19:54 --> 0:19:56
To not stress out of the whole Thanksgiving

262
0:19:56 --> 0:19:56
Um

263
0:19:59 --> 0:20:06
I performed at in the max Thanksgiving variety show nice good

264
0:20:07 --> 0:20:08
Um

265
0:20:08 --> 0:20:14
He asked bread sure would and I since paul couldn't make it paul was invited. Um

266
0:20:14 --> 0:20:17
To do a some kind of improv song bit. Oh fun

267
0:20:18 --> 0:20:23
And then I called spedoni and spedoni was available. So we had spedoni there beautiful

268
0:20:25 --> 0:20:26
And then

269
0:20:27 --> 0:20:31
After arranging all that I got a text from brad saying you got a minute and I was like, oh, no

270
0:20:31 --> 0:20:38
He's gonna fail. Uh-huh, and then I I call him and it is not him bailing. He's like, hey, I said a wild idea

271
0:20:39 --> 0:20:42
He's like, what if all right, what if

272
0:20:42 --> 0:20:46
what if we do uh, uh do it all in shakespeare

273
0:20:47 --> 0:20:51
And uh, you do magic tricks, but I play like your hype man like your producer

274
0:20:51 --> 0:20:55
And I'm just blown away by all the magic we're doing and I just narrate everyone's thoughts

275
0:20:55 --> 0:20:59
I like this

276
0:20:59 --> 0:21:02
and I said, um

277
0:21:02 --> 0:21:08
The one thing that mac king's show has is magic. Yeah

278
0:21:09 --> 0:21:12
And arguably lousy with it

279
0:21:12 --> 0:21:13
and

280
0:21:14 --> 0:21:20
You know, we were specific guys to do music. Yeah, it goes. All right. Why don't we do it as a musical?

281
0:21:20 --> 0:21:20
Oh

282
0:21:21 --> 0:21:24
Yes, and motherfucker

283
0:21:26 --> 0:21:28
So we did uh

284
0:21:30 --> 0:21:37
Uh, we we did what we call the uh, the prom Shakespeare repertory presents much to do about magic the musical great

285
0:21:40 --> 0:21:42
Funny that's cool

286
0:21:44 --> 0:21:49
Uh, it was so well that some people thought it was written which is always the best

287
0:21:50 --> 0:21:50
Exactly

288
0:21:52 --> 0:21:54
And brad and I want to do it again beautiful

289
0:21:54 --> 0:22:00
That we want to find a way to like we we were not satisfied with just the the ten minute hunk that we did

290
0:22:00 --> 0:22:06
We want to do it again. This is the trick, right? Like we're finding these new ways to expand on improv like, uh

291
0:22:06 --> 0:22:08
Collin mockery is doing

292
0:22:09 --> 0:22:09
the hypnoprov

293
0:22:11 --> 0:22:14
Yeah, brad works with collin a lot, so

294
0:22:15 --> 0:22:22
I imagine he's seeing the bold new adventures that can be like what else can we use improv to mine

295
0:22:23 --> 0:22:24
Well

296
0:22:25 --> 0:22:25
Yes

297
0:22:26 --> 0:22:26
so

298
0:22:26 --> 0:22:28
brad and collin perform

299
0:22:29 --> 0:22:34
Uh, i've been performed together for 15 something years or more than that maybe okay

300
0:22:35 --> 0:22:41
So so anytime you see hip-prov performing that's collin not performing with with brad

301
0:22:41 --> 0:22:42
Ah

302
0:22:43 --> 0:22:49
It's just I think that's the the most uh delicate way I can say got it. Yeah. Yeah fair fair

303
0:22:51 --> 0:22:57
So yes, collin has discovered that trying to sell the hip hip-prov thing they tried it in vegas

304
0:22:57 --> 0:23:03
It was too soon. It was a mistake and there's also bad timing. Yeah, um and and uh did not

305
0:23:03 --> 0:23:06
Did not get a lot of positive show reports from that hey, man

306
0:23:06 --> 0:23:13
Experience, where did they do that? Muppet improv didn't hardly fucking work in vegas. No, it's it's fucking tough

307
0:23:13 --> 0:23:18
Muppet didn't work in vegas for a different set of reasons. Oh fine, but it's still it's still

308
0:23:18 --> 0:23:25
Improv with awesome shit not working. So yeah, there's the crazy cocaine habit of all those puppets that really did it in

309
0:23:25 --> 0:23:27
That's that they really do

310
0:23:28 --> 0:23:31
Good lord those felt line straws. They are just

311
0:23:32 --> 0:23:33
hoovering it

312
0:23:38 --> 0:23:40
They are Paul they are

313
0:23:40 --> 0:23:46
I'll tell you who else is sucking up a lot of cocaine into their felt lined noses and that is the following sponsor

314
0:23:47 --> 0:23:50
Which I have in my hand right here. Oh

315
0:23:51 --> 0:23:55
There we go. Sorry. I've heard do more than I usually have to um

316
0:23:55 --> 0:24:02
This is paul's emergency toilet paper socks paul's emergency toilet paper socks from a scoop of montecristo

317
0:24:02 --> 0:24:05
Uh this year that was this year

318
0:24:08 --> 0:24:10
We've all had the horrible embarrassment of

319
0:24:11 --> 0:24:12
having to shit

320
0:24:14 --> 0:24:14
In a place

321
0:24:15 --> 0:24:16
Without a bathroom

322
0:24:20 --> 0:24:21
When it happens

323
0:24:21 --> 0:24:22
Not if

324
0:24:23 --> 0:24:23
but when

325
0:24:25 --> 0:24:27
Will you be ready for the challenge?

326
0:24:28 --> 0:24:30
Of the necessary ass wipery

327
0:24:32 --> 0:24:39
Because that's the real challenge of going to the bathroom without a bathroom the cleanup

328
0:24:41 --> 0:24:41
introducing

329
0:24:42 --> 0:24:45
paul's emergency ass wipe socks

330
0:24:46 --> 0:24:50
Paul's emergency ass wipe socks are equipped with a double layer

331
0:24:51 --> 0:24:52
one for absorbency

332
0:24:53 --> 0:24:54
and one

333
0:24:54 --> 0:24:55
to be discarded

334
0:24:56 --> 0:24:57
and then used again

335
0:24:58 --> 0:24:59
for absorbency

336
0:25:00 --> 0:25:03
That was two number ones. There are two number ones

337
0:25:04 --> 0:25:09
Yeah, but one of them's four number two when you have the paul's emergency shit socks on

338
0:25:09 --> 0:25:11
You technically are wearing four socks

339
0:25:13 --> 0:25:16
The first outer layer is the more absorbent layer

340
0:25:17 --> 0:25:18
And that is the one to be used

341
0:25:19 --> 0:25:21
upon first blush if you will

342
0:25:21 --> 0:25:23
getting the most

343
0:25:24 --> 0:25:24
liquid

344
0:25:25 --> 0:25:27
Out of the system

345
0:25:28 --> 0:25:33
The second is less absorbent but no less important

346
0:25:34 --> 0:25:38
But we advise you go ahead and employ both socks

347
0:25:39 --> 0:25:43
Use the second sock's first layer of absorbency

348
0:25:44 --> 0:25:48
To make sure that the rectal area is clear of all juices

349
0:25:49 --> 0:25:49
Then

350
0:25:50 --> 0:25:54
With the third sock, which is the first sock second layer

351
0:25:55 --> 0:26:00
Go ahead and do what we call the check it tab

352
0:26:01 --> 0:26:02
Tab it up there

353
0:26:02 --> 0:26:05
Take it back out and check it

354
0:26:05 --> 0:26:06
Where are we standing folks?

355
0:26:07 --> 0:26:08
Did we get everything?

356
0:26:08 --> 0:26:10
If we didn't

357
0:26:10 --> 0:26:14
Invert the third sock, which is the second sock of the first sock

358
0:26:15 --> 0:26:17
I'm sorry paul, I can't believe the war is happening

359
0:26:20 --> 0:26:20
Finally

360
0:26:22 --> 0:26:23
After the check

361
0:26:24 --> 0:26:25
You go ahead

362
0:26:26 --> 0:26:30
And you use the fourth sock, which is the second sock of the second sock

363
0:26:31 --> 0:26:32
That one of course

364
0:26:33 --> 0:26:34
Is rounded up

365
0:26:35 --> 0:26:35
And tucked

366
0:26:36 --> 0:26:37
As a muffler

367
0:26:37 --> 0:26:40
To prevent any further seepage

368
0:26:40 --> 0:26:41
Interhase goops and check out

369
0:26:42 --> 0:26:44
It just makes too much sense

370
0:26:45 --> 0:26:50
We gotta figure out the zoom thing because everyone's turned off their cameras and so we can't see if anyone's laughing

371
0:26:54 --> 0:27:01
I saw a few or maybe everyone turned off their camera just to vomit I saw a few I saw a few laughs. I saw a few laughs

372
0:27:05 --> 0:27:05
Just

373
0:27:05 --> 0:27:07
Just in time for christmas

374
0:27:08 --> 0:27:10
Just in time for christmas

375
0:27:10 --> 0:27:18
You can hang them by your you can hang them by the fireplace, you know, uh, I mean you gotta drive out somehow. Yeah

376
0:27:18 --> 0:27:27
Have you been if you guys been watching this show physical asia on netflix

377
0:27:28 --> 0:27:31
Is that the one with the really strange?

378
0:27:31 --> 0:27:33
uh, japanese

379
0:27:33 --> 0:27:35
Uh, olivia newton john impersonator

380
0:27:38 --> 0:27:47
Yes, yes, that's that's the show that i'm alluding to right now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the japanese olivia newton john impersonator physical asia

381
0:27:47 --> 0:27:53
Yeah, that was it was really odd, but I mean, you know, yeah, let's get physical

382
0:27:53 --> 0:27:54
in asia

383
0:27:55 --> 0:28:00
Oh, that's so much better than the the japanese person singing physical that I thought you were about to do

384
0:28:00 --> 0:28:03
I didn't do that. That was bad. I know you did

385
0:28:04 --> 0:28:09
Uh, they so it's it's a uh, it's a crazy reality competition show

386
0:28:10 --> 0:28:15
Where they do, uh, these insane like physical tasks and everything and it's different, uh, asian countries

387
0:28:16 --> 0:28:20
Uh, participating uh competing against each other also for some reason australia

388
0:28:21 --> 0:28:26
So it's like all these asian countries because olivian john and australia because of olivian newton john, of course

389
0:28:29 --> 0:28:31
So i'm watching it last night

390
0:28:32 --> 0:28:36
And they they do it's all uh overdubbed all of the language is overdubbed

391
0:28:36 --> 0:28:41
Which is kind of neat, uh, just as a side note all of the teams competing against each other

392
0:28:41 --> 0:28:46
Uh in the overdubbing watching watching the show it just sounds like they're all speaking english to each other

393
0:28:46 --> 0:28:49
Which of course they are not they're all speaking their native languages to each other

394
0:28:49 --> 0:28:53
Which means nobody else can understand them in the competition

395
0:28:53 --> 0:28:59
So they can just work together and talk to each other in their native language and the other team can't understand their planning

396
0:28:59 --> 0:29:02
And it's it's really kind of a neat twist

397
0:29:02 --> 0:29:11
But the thing i want to talk about was the overdubbing because they do all of these crazy physical things where they're like grunting and yelling and everything while they're

398
0:29:11 --> 0:29:15
While they're doing it and they overdub all the grunting and yelling

399
0:29:15 --> 0:29:17
Oh, that makes no sense

400
0:29:18 --> 0:29:21
It's so goddamn funny that makes no sense

401
0:29:22 --> 0:29:28
That's really strange. It is the best thing to watch once you realize that that's what they're doing and like

402
0:29:28 --> 0:29:33
Oh, right. That's not the uh, that's the same overdubbed voice that is now yelling

403
0:29:33 --> 0:29:36
Which is not what that person actually sounds like

404
0:29:37 --> 0:29:37
Yeah

405
0:29:38 --> 0:29:39
It's so good

406
0:29:40 --> 0:29:41
It's so good

407
0:29:41 --> 0:29:43
What are some of the physical challenges they have to do?

408
0:29:43 --> 0:29:45
They do shit like

409
0:29:45 --> 0:29:48
I mean, it's it's really insane stuff

410
0:29:49 --> 0:29:53
The the first one they do is like a king of the mountain type thing

411
0:29:53 --> 0:29:58
Where they have these these each team is six members and they're all like

412
0:29:58 --> 0:30:01
MMA fighters and uh wrestlers

413
0:30:02 --> 0:30:05
Uh track stars. It's it's quite a few former olympians

414
0:30:06 --> 0:30:09
Uh all this stuff. I mean it's it's the battle of the network stars

415
0:30:10 --> 0:30:16
Kind of but in like a hard core way. I mean it's it's a ball of the network stars was hardcore

416
0:30:17 --> 0:30:18
I'm telling you paul

417
0:30:22 --> 0:30:26
Meatloaf could not have gotten through the first leg of the first competition on this show

418
0:30:26 --> 0:30:28
He would have died in support

419
0:30:29 --> 0:30:33
I was wondering we're going to present a vigorous defense for battle of the network stars

420
0:30:33 --> 0:30:34
I will I will

421
0:30:35 --> 0:30:36
It's paul's birthday matt

422
0:30:36 --> 0:30:41
Of course, we're going to present a vigorous defense of battle of the network stars

423
0:30:41 --> 0:30:45
You know, I also saw jacob. I don't know if you're aware of this new show that they're doing

424
0:30:45 --> 0:30:48
They've gone in and they're doing this whole retelling

425
0:30:49 --> 0:30:53
Of the guys who came up with the atom bomb

426
0:30:54 --> 0:30:57
Uh, but it's set back in the in the 50s

427
0:30:57 --> 0:30:59
So it's like it's like a future backwards

428
0:30:59 --> 0:31:04
So it's like it's all it's the it's the the the scientists that made the atom bomb, but they're all

429
0:31:05 --> 0:31:08
Uh high schoolers in the 50s

430
0:31:08 --> 0:31:15
Right, okay, so it's up up and hop up and sop up and sock hoppinheimer is what it's called

431
0:31:15 --> 0:31:16
Uh

432
0:31:17 --> 0:31:18
Sock hoppinheimer

433
0:31:19 --> 0:31:24
If you can't say the title of the show on the first three tries the title is too complicated

434
0:31:24 --> 0:31:26
Up and sock hoppinheimer. I said it there

435
0:31:26 --> 0:31:31
Up and sock hoppinheimer and it's also starring

436
0:31:32 --> 0:31:33
olivia newtron john

437
0:31:35 --> 0:31:39
It all comes together that's how it works. Yeah

438
0:31:40 --> 0:31:41
Uh

439
0:31:41 --> 0:31:46
The show was a bomb. I'm assuming it's that's pluto tv and it's pluto tv. It's a pluto original

440
0:31:47 --> 0:31:50
Good call man. Good call pluto original

441
0:31:51 --> 0:31:52
Oh

442
0:31:53 --> 0:31:55
There I said it again

443
0:31:57 --> 0:31:58
Two out of eight

444
0:31:59 --> 0:32:05
Say up and sock hoppinheimer five times fast. Good luck. No, I'm not trying to watch pluto tv

445
0:32:08 --> 0:32:08
I

446
0:32:08 --> 0:32:10
No, they do these insane challenges

447
0:32:10 --> 0:32:14
Like they they do stuff that if the three of us tried to do

448
0:32:14 --> 0:32:19
Oh, god single one of these games we would die. Oh, I can't play kickball

449
0:32:19 --> 0:32:27
Oh, the first thing I heard about on thursday night was how injured you and sarah were

450
0:32:28 --> 0:32:29
And

451
0:32:29 --> 0:32:35
I see sarah and sarah's like oh matt and I are so hurt and keeps watching these

452
0:32:36 --> 0:32:43
These tick tocks with these physical challenges. Have you seen some of these where the couples do these extreme physical moves?

453
0:32:43 --> 0:32:46
With each other they do like these very gymnastic

454
0:32:46 --> 0:32:48
They'll see a gymnastic move and then they they're like, okay

455
0:32:48 --> 0:32:53
We can we can do that, you know, and they're they're in there like a little home gym and they're trying to do it

456
0:32:53 --> 0:32:55
And sometimes they fuck it up and some of them. Well

457
0:32:56 --> 0:32:57
over Thanksgiving

458
0:32:57 --> 0:33:03
She found this one where these guys are doing a new tradition right after the Thanksgiving meal the men

459
0:33:04 --> 0:33:09
Grab the their wives and hoist them on their shoulders and run a race

460
0:33:11 --> 0:33:14
And and it's the beats of strength. Yeah, and was laughing her ass off

461
0:33:15 --> 0:33:20
And I was like, I could do it. Let's do it. She's like, no, no, you couldn't I said I could do it

462
0:33:20 --> 0:33:23
Come on. I'm picking up. Let's go and I can't try to pick her up

463
0:33:23 --> 0:33:29
And she wouldn't she wouldn't work with me at all which is probably trying to convince and to let him pick her up

464
0:33:30 --> 0:33:33
Is the video that we all need to see she wouldn't do it. She would not do it

465
0:33:33 --> 0:33:35
She's like, no, no, no, I was like, I can't do it by myself

466
0:33:35 --> 0:33:39
You gotta give me a little jump so I can you know get it going here

467
0:33:39 --> 0:33:43
But she would not she would not commit to the bit but to be fair

468
0:33:43 --> 0:33:49
She was also coughing up a fit because she was still uh very very sick, but uh, I don't get picked up like that

469
0:33:49 --> 0:33:53
That's right. She doesn't get picked up like that and she didn't get picked up like that because I didn't do it

470
0:33:53 --> 0:33:55
But she was she was ridiculous

471
0:33:56 --> 0:33:59
I could have done it, but uh, yeah, I see all these things

472
0:34:00 --> 0:34:05
Jacob, did you ever see the the japanese one with the wall and the shapes?

473
0:34:06 --> 0:34:09
The wall and the shapes. Yeah

474
0:34:09 --> 0:34:18
So did I see a television show made in japan that had a wall and some shapes is your question

475
0:34:18 --> 0:34:20
Yeah, so what happens is

476
0:34:21 --> 0:34:27
Yes, good job. You're standing. You're standing. Yes. I saw shogun paul. You're standing in this you're standing in this

477
0:34:27 --> 0:34:29
hallway, no wait paul before you go on

478
0:34:30 --> 0:34:32
I'm trying to think of a show that doesn't have a wall and shapes

479
0:34:33 --> 0:34:34
any of them

480
0:34:36 --> 0:34:41
What happened is the outdoors set shows like the bear grill site things where he's surviving in the wilderness

481
0:34:41 --> 0:34:46
I guess I don't have no walls. There's plenty of shapes though. They have shapes, but no walls

482
0:34:47 --> 0:34:52
The the wall has a shape cut out of it of a silhouette

483
0:34:53 --> 0:34:59
Uh-huh, right a person's physical silhouette. Okay in some sort of stance

484
0:35:01 --> 0:35:05
Oh, and the wall. I think I have seen this actually the wall moves towards you

485
0:35:05 --> 0:35:10
Yep, and you must assume the stance to wily coyote style

486
0:35:10 --> 0:35:15
Fit through the silhouette as it you have to pass through the wall or it smacks you

487
0:35:15 --> 0:35:21
Yes, you have to it's called hole in the wall. There you go, buddy's on it. It's called hole in the wall

488
0:35:21 --> 0:35:23
And so I thought it was called any port in the storm

489
0:35:25 --> 0:35:26
Any port in the storm

490
0:35:27 --> 0:35:31
It depends on what region you're watching it in some of them is called any port in the storm

491
0:35:31 --> 0:35:32
Some are called hole in a wall

492
0:35:33 --> 0:35:35
I've watched every episode of any port in the storm

493
0:35:37 --> 0:35:42
So that's what happens and the wall keeps going up and then either you get through it or you get smushed

494
0:35:42 --> 0:35:47
They're gonna do a two person version of that paul. Have you seen that? No, what is it called death in the doorway?

495
0:35:47 --> 0:35:48
Oh, it's a gentleman's game

496
0:35:52 --> 0:35:55
Any port in the storm also has a lot of smushing as well

497
0:35:55 --> 0:35:57
A lot of smushing

498
0:35:57 --> 0:35:59
A lot of smushing

499
0:36:02 --> 0:36:05
There was the cocaine addicted muppets

500
0:36:06 --> 0:36:10
Was uh, they had a solo show with miss piggy called any snort in a perm

501
0:36:11 --> 0:36:12
And she was just out there hoovering

502
0:36:13 --> 0:36:14
Hoovering cocaine

503
0:36:17 --> 0:36:18

531
0:38:33 --> 0:38:40
I was just saying look at you went all out on thanksgiving. Oh, we did we did we tore it up from the floor on up

532
0:38:40 --> 0:38:43
We had uh, I don't know 15 20 people

533
0:38:43 --> 0:38:50
Over at the house had a had a big old turkey on the smoker had we had we had house guests in town that week

534
0:38:50 --> 0:38:51
So they were they were around

535
0:38:52 --> 0:38:53
We had a ton of people

536
0:38:53 --> 0:38:56
It was great though several people even commented on it

537
0:38:56 --> 0:39:00
We had no stress the whole cooking of the of the meal and everything

538
0:39:00 --> 0:39:07
We were just walking around having a nice time. That's how you do it, baby. No stress at all. It was great. Everything just worked out

539
0:39:07 --> 0:39:11
Uh, we had a nice big spread set up outside in the in the yard

540
0:39:12 --> 0:39:14
Uh, yeah, just so so so nice

541
0:39:15 --> 0:39:18
That's beautiful because I this the only adjustment I should have made just

542
0:39:18 --> 0:39:21
I should I should have come by your house after kickball is the only adjustment

543
0:39:21 --> 0:39:22
I should have made yep

544
0:39:22 --> 0:39:25
You could have you could have limped over to the house after kickball and had some turkey

545
0:39:25 --> 0:39:29
Because that's the nice pack from you. Yep. Yep. I want to help you out with a nice pack

546
0:39:30 --> 0:39:30
also

547
0:39:31 --> 0:39:35
The best thing happened that I doubt I'll ever be able to repeat

548
0:39:36 --> 0:39:40
That is what's that we we had the big spread set up. We had all the people

549
0:39:41 --> 0:39:44
Uh, a couple hours later. I had to go to work. I'd do shows that night

550
0:39:44 --> 0:39:50
Uh, that's where I saw the uh, the injured sarah that night and we we talked about the kickball game of doom and uh

551
0:39:51 --> 0:39:55
I got home a couple hours later. There were still about five people at the house

552
0:39:56 --> 0:40:01
And the first thing that sj said to me when we when I got home was hey, there's no leftovers

553
0:40:02 --> 0:40:03
Everybody ate all of it. Wow

554
0:40:04 --> 0:40:05
Oh, wow

555
0:40:05 --> 0:40:11
Oh, my we did it. We did it. We got the exact right amount of food

556
0:40:11 --> 0:40:16
It got grazed on after the after the meal was over and it's just all gone. That's great. This is magical

557
0:40:17 --> 0:40:24
I took about like I you know grew up with uh with four brothers and a sister and uh

558
0:40:24 --> 0:40:29
We you know, I I am I am the shortest of my not by a lot, but I'm the shortest of my brothers. Uh,

559
0:40:31 --> 0:40:32
So, uh, never

560
0:40:33 --> 0:40:34
Never had leftovers. Yeah

561
0:40:35 --> 0:40:39
Never no no meal no meal leftover. Yeah, that checks out

562
0:40:40 --> 0:40:43
Y'all we're like leftovers. What is this? What is this concept?

563
0:40:47 --> 0:40:47
Uh

564
0:40:49 --> 0:40:55
Yeah, my mother-in-law does this thing where she insists on trying to make like a turkey soup with the turkey carcass of the

565
0:40:55 --> 0:40:57
turkey thing

566
0:40:58 --> 0:41:03
And like it's this it's this whole it's the thing that takes up the whole next day. Right, right

567
0:41:03 --> 0:41:03
Uh

568
0:41:04 --> 0:41:09
All that all that started was to make sure that sarah and I stopped cooking turkey. That's all that happened

569
0:41:09 --> 0:41:10
because that we just don't we just

570
0:41:11 --> 0:41:12
were like

571
0:41:13 --> 0:41:17
We don't want to spend the whole other day making soup and we don't want to spend the next four days eating that soup

572
0:41:17 --> 0:41:20
Yeah, uh, it's just not just not the world we live in

573
0:41:23 --> 0:41:25
Um, but uh, yeah

574
0:41:25 --> 0:41:30
But look I saw on instagram. It looks like you had a fine spread at your house there, Jacob

575
0:41:30 --> 0:41:34
Oh, yeah, no, it was it was so nice at uh, yeah, we had a we had a ton of people over and everything

576
0:41:34 --> 0:41:39
It was great. I love Thanksgiving. I don't know what y'all are talking about. I love doing the the whole meal

577
0:41:39 --> 0:41:42
I love doing all of it. It's it's great time

578
0:41:42 --> 0:41:45
I did too. I think it's my favorite holiday really

579
0:41:46 --> 0:41:51
I I promise I'm making a very good turkey. Yeah, um, I just wasn't simply alone in my house

580
0:41:52 --> 0:41:57
Uh, uh, as as nimble and famously said all Thanksgiving food tastes like napkins and that's what my kids think too

581
0:41:57 --> 0:41:58
So there you go

582
0:41:58 --> 0:42:04
And it was it really was this show that changed my perception. So at first I was like I have to as their dad

583
0:42:05 --> 0:42:09
Keep making it until they like it because that's the way it works and there's only on this show

584
0:42:09 --> 0:42:13
I found out so many listeners hate Thanksgiving food also as adults

585
0:42:14 --> 0:42:14
Oh

586
0:42:15 --> 0:42:22
You should show your boys. Do you ever watch uh, garen the guy out of ireland? He's very funny. He's gonna say

587
0:42:23 --> 0:42:24
Thanks for watching. I'm delicious

588
0:42:26 --> 0:42:27
You ever seen him? He's really funny

589
0:42:28 --> 0:42:32
No, no, he's he's really really funny. You should look up some of garen's stuff, but he did

590
0:42:33 --> 0:42:34
from ireland

591
0:42:35 --> 0:42:41
Just a couple days ago. He cooked his own version of a traditional american Thanksgiving dinner

592
0:42:42 --> 0:42:46
And uh, I was very surprised by what he liked and what he didn't like

593
0:42:47 --> 0:42:50
So he was okay with the turkey

594
0:42:50 --> 0:42:51
Okay, um

595
0:42:52 --> 0:42:56
He hated craft macaroni and cheese box dinner

596
0:42:57 --> 0:43:02
The box fine, which I mean, I guess yeah, that's not really Thanksgiving food. Anyway, well mac and cheese

597
0:43:03 --> 0:43:07
Mac and cheese is a Thanksgiving food. And that's what people I suppose so sure people getting shit

598
0:43:07 --> 0:43:10
You're you're bringing a very fiery debate. Yeah, there are people that

599
0:43:10 --> 0:43:14
That insist that mac and cheese is not a Thanksgiving food people says that it is

600
0:43:14 --> 0:43:19
I don't think it was a Thanksgiving food, but I'm not upset if I see it show up. I love it. I love it

601
0:43:19 --> 0:43:23
Uh, mashed potatoes. He made his own mashed potatoes. He has a special recipe for the mashed potatoes

602
0:43:23 --> 0:43:27
So he wasn't expecting the mashed potatoes to be anything but delicious. They were

603
0:43:27 --> 0:43:31
He made kind of a cheese that he put in his mashed potatoes. What kind of cheese?

604
0:43:31 --> 0:43:35
What kind of white cheese does he put in there? Oh, no, he does not do the no no

605
0:43:35 --> 0:43:36
He doesn't do the cheese

606
0:43:38 --> 0:43:41
It's just curds and way it's barely even cheese. It's like halfway done

607
0:43:42 --> 0:43:42
um

608
0:43:43 --> 0:43:46
So, uh, then he had the green bean casserole

609
0:43:47 --> 0:43:49
Which he was very suspicious of

610
0:43:50 --> 0:43:51
But he liked

611
0:43:52 --> 0:43:55
Yep, I like a green bean casserole and then he made pumpkin pie

612
0:43:55 --> 0:43:59
Which they don't do pumpkin pie in ireland at all apparently

613
0:44:00 --> 0:44:03
No, they do potato pie. Yeah, but I mean they don't mash potatoes

614
0:44:03 --> 0:44:05
They don't do pumpkin pie at all

615
0:44:06 --> 0:44:09
And he was really super suspicious about it all

616
0:44:10 --> 0:44:14
But he made it and he really liked it. He was suspicious of the pie

617
0:44:14 --> 0:44:18
He was suspicious of the pie. He did he he was took him

618
0:44:18 --> 0:44:22
Some time to get over the he's he was like, oh, it's got this vegetabley

619
0:44:22 --> 0:44:26
Uh mush to it. I'm not used to like a dessert

620
0:44:26 --> 0:44:31
And he says and then I went on and I watched all your fucking videos of all your fucking celebrations

621
0:44:31 --> 0:44:38
And I saw how all you got all you only got these these yam potatoes all these sweet potatoes with fucking marshmallows on top

622
0:44:38 --> 0:44:45
So many fucking marshmallows get fucked. I don't want marshmallows anywhere near my dinner. That's bullshit

623
0:44:45 --> 0:44:50
I do agree with that. I don't want the marshmallows. I agree with that too. He says he says I know a lot of you say it's great

624
0:44:50 --> 0:44:51
I don't know

625
0:44:52 --> 0:44:56
More power to you keep those fucking things away from me. It's secretly deserting early

626
0:44:56 --> 0:44:57
That's what I don't like about it

627
0:44:57 --> 0:45:01
Yeah, it's like what's it because what I have marshmallows and sugar and brown sugar and cinnamon on something

628
0:45:01 --> 0:45:05
I'm like well now I don't want to eat savory things anymore. You you shift my gear to dessert

629
0:45:05 --> 0:45:09
Right. It's unfair. Yeah, it's like it's like a hip it's hip prop

630
0:45:09 --> 0:45:14
Like we do we do the uh the the sweet potatoes we do the sweet potato casserole

631
0:45:14 --> 0:45:18
It's got brown sugar and pecans and everything. It's not healthy. It's not it's not a uh

632
0:45:18 --> 0:45:22
It's definitely still a dessert masquerading as uh as a dish

633
0:45:22 --> 0:45:25
But uh, it doesn't do the full on swing over with the marshmallows

634
0:45:27 --> 0:45:29
Sweet potato the masquerade

635
0:45:31 --> 0:45:31
Um

636
0:45:33 --> 0:45:33
Uh

637
0:45:34 --> 0:45:36
Galactic president scooper star McScoops a lot

638
0:45:36 --> 0:45:43
Stuffing on a waffle iron. That sounds amazing stuffing on a waffle iron is legit. I saw that earlier. I've seen that before

639
0:45:44 --> 0:45:46
It's a that's a fucking idea

640
0:45:46 --> 0:45:50
Do you put a little gravy on it and then kind of sear it all in is that how it goes?

641
0:45:51 --> 0:45:53
I think your gravy afterward though. You have like a little

642
0:45:53 --> 0:45:57
A little I suppose you're right. Yeah. Yeah, you just make it

643
0:45:57 --> 0:46:02
I think you want the hot gravy. Yeah, nice hot gravy then pour it on after you waffle iron it

644
0:46:02 --> 0:46:06
Because when you get something that has crispiness and moisture, that's the key. Yeah, right

645
0:46:06 --> 0:46:10
So that's that's that seems really good. That sounds fucking good

646
0:46:11 --> 0:46:15
But paul wants the hot crispified some gravy, which is also ambitious

647
0:46:16 --> 0:46:17
As long as it has a skin

648
0:46:20 --> 0:46:22
Give me that give me that skin

649
0:46:23 --> 0:46:25
Give me that gravy skin. No gravy skin is not

650
0:46:26 --> 0:46:27
Not no, that's no good

651
0:46:28 --> 0:46:29
How dare you

652
0:46:29 --> 0:46:32
No, I'm just uh, I'm just upset because uh

653
0:46:33 --> 0:46:36
Well, I'm I'm not I'm not I upset is the wrong word

654
0:46:37 --> 0:46:38
disappointed lightly

655
0:46:38 --> 0:46:46
That I can't just go get the food that I want on my birthday without driving an hour and a half out of my way

656
0:46:46 --> 0:46:51
Yeah, like it's literally an hour and a half drive for me to get even fucking panda express

657
0:46:52 --> 0:46:53
It's like

658
0:46:54 --> 0:46:59
This conversation for me must be what it's like when the topic is football for other scoops

659
0:47:03 --> 0:47:05
You're horse racing. Yeah

660
0:47:07 --> 0:47:10
Yes, not so express you're absolutely right rich

661
0:47:10 --> 0:47:15
Yes, it takes way too fucking long so I and that's the thing it's by the time I get back home

662
0:47:15 --> 0:47:16
I'm like, oh, well

663
0:47:17 --> 0:47:19
I drove an hour and a half for panda express

664
0:47:20 --> 0:47:23
You might as well just give fucking mcdonald's. It's just it's turned into

665
0:47:24 --> 0:47:25
Shit at that point

666
0:47:26 --> 0:47:27
I mean that's the same thing, right?

667
0:47:28 --> 0:47:35
Kind of panda expressing mcdonald's or it didn't even say it's all owned by the same company, right? Well, we're thinking of uh

668
0:47:35 --> 0:47:37
Maybe going to cost go on wednesday

669
0:47:38 --> 0:47:39
I'll get that good old hot dog

670
0:47:40 --> 0:47:44
That'll be my so what did you guys what did you guys think of wicked too? Didn't see it

671
0:47:45 --> 0:47:50
What? No, I didn't see you didn't rush out to see the sequel. I did not I've only seen it seven or eight times

672
0:47:50 --> 0:47:54
Uh, so I I don't really have a fully flushed out opinion on it yet

673
0:47:58 --> 0:48:03
I know it's really cool when they breakdanced to save the car wash

674
0:48:03 --> 0:48:05
I thought it was really amazing

675
0:48:06 --> 0:48:09
Have you seen that is that what you're talking about that?

676
0:48:11 --> 0:48:12
no, there's

677
0:48:13 --> 0:48:15
There's a bit I'm talking about the plot of break in two

678
0:48:17 --> 0:48:20
Okay, well, I'm gonna blow your fucking mind to show you some shit that you

679
0:48:22 --> 0:48:24
You're not gonna show me anything, please

680
0:48:24 --> 0:48:30
Show us something ball. It's an audio program. I'm gonna tell you about it as it's happening

681
0:48:31 --> 0:48:33
You're gonna narrate it to us. Oh good

682
0:48:35 --> 0:48:39
First it's like a long time pulling up though. I don't know if I have the plot right from break in two

683
0:48:39 --> 0:48:41
I'm not looking it up. I'm just we're just moving on

684
0:48:42 --> 0:48:45
No, all it is is it's the old donnie and marie

685
0:48:45 --> 0:48:46
Uh

686
0:48:46 --> 0:48:51
Or the osmonds that's what it or no no wasn't the osmonds. It was a fucking money call. It's a brady bunch

687
0:48:52 --> 0:48:54
Uh, the break you remember the brady bunch had it had a

688
0:48:55 --> 0:48:56
They're providing show. Yes

689
0:48:57 --> 0:49:02
Yeah, yeah, where um one of the kids I forget which which kid one of the kids got replaced on it

690
0:49:02 --> 0:49:05
Because they couldn't get the whole original cast back together

691
0:49:06 --> 0:49:10
That is correct. I think it was one of the young kids. It was just like a new kid

692
0:49:10 --> 0:49:14
Oh jan. Thank you. You like the president. Yep. They had to replace the jan

693
0:49:14 --> 0:49:18
Well, what you just and jan sickly stuck upstairs. She was cutting

694
0:49:18 --> 0:49:22
Ropes to see different obviously would fall from the top of the theater and there's a cliffhanger

695
0:49:22 --> 0:49:24
The first cliffhanger ever

696
0:49:24 --> 0:49:27
What you just joked about matt happened

697
0:49:27 --> 0:49:33
And it happened with none other than rip taylor as the cowardly lion

698
0:49:34 --> 0:49:38
And the rest of fucking brady's dressed up like the people from os

699
0:49:39 --> 0:49:45
Doing the theme from car wash. They're doing car wash at the car wash. Yeah, and

700
0:49:45 --> 0:49:53
Fucking greg brady dressed up like the scarecrow and rip taylor is the lion to be in as flamboyant as he can be

701
0:49:53 --> 0:50:01
Just out of hand and I thought this would be really funny for somebody to slip into a copy or one of the edits of

702
0:50:01 --> 0:50:08
Uh os 2 or wicked 2 wouldn't it be really funny if this showed up? I'll uh, you know, um

703
0:50:09 --> 0:50:11
Somebody's just like watching that on tv in the background or something

704
0:50:11 --> 0:50:17
No, no, it would you know, what's the on tv in the background? I don't know tv. No, what's uh

705
0:50:17 --> 0:50:23
Fight club like in fight club. Remember how uh, he would always slip in little snippets of pornographic stuff

706
0:50:24 --> 0:50:26
And all the movies if you could put this in

707
0:50:27 --> 0:50:29
And just make everybody upset

708
0:50:30 --> 0:50:36
That is true. That is true. We gotta do that. That is quite a fever dream as none of the elements make sense at all

709
0:50:36 --> 0:50:38
No, it's fucking bizarre

710
0:50:39 --> 0:50:45
And and rip taylor evolved a rip. Yeah rip taylor of all people you think like if you you'll never get rich

711
0:50:45 --> 0:50:47
But it beats digging a ditch

712
0:50:50 --> 0:50:56
I think I said you guys the funny the me my song which is that uh, don't worry glinda and alphabet will be back in avengers

713
0:50:56 --> 0:50:56
Uh

714
0:51:06 --> 0:51:06
That's awesome

715
0:51:06 --> 0:51:08
Tick-tock and

716
0:51:08 --> 0:51:09
The guy

717
0:51:10 --> 0:51:17
He's a madham madham. What now madham mova or whatever name is, you know, there's dolls of all these figures, right?

718
0:51:17 --> 0:51:22
There's dolls. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, sure. So he's got all the dolls stacked up

719
0:51:22 --> 0:51:24
And then madham mova

720
0:51:25 --> 0:51:28
Comes in and it's playing that that song from the drag race stuff

721
0:51:29 --> 0:51:35
And here comes the hurricane bitch Katrina Katrina Katrina Katrina Katrina. She's not getting

722
0:51:37 --> 0:51:39
And the bow comes down and crushes

723
0:51:42 --> 0:51:49
It's fucking funny Katrina Katrina Katrina here comes the hurricane bitch yelling Katrina. It's funny

724
0:51:50 --> 0:51:54
It makes me laugh. So what what did you really like it? Did you not like it?

725
0:51:56 --> 0:52:01
Oh, that was fun. That was good. That was good. Would you be able to watch it all in one sitting?

726
0:52:02 --> 0:52:02
Yes

727
0:52:03 --> 0:52:09
That's that's that's my only takeaway is they added three songs to it and those three songs aren't on par with the actual

728
0:52:10 --> 0:52:15
Chorus soundtrack. Yeah to basically strike to basically make the second

729
0:52:16 --> 0:52:18
Movie fill out. Yeah. Yeah

730
0:52:19 --> 0:52:25
Is it they're not terrible. There's not there's just there's nothing to is it closer to the book or the

731
0:52:26 --> 0:52:27
Musical do you know

732
0:52:28 --> 0:52:29
I wouldn't know

733
0:52:29 --> 0:52:32
Because my wife wouldn't know either my wife loved the book

734
0:52:32 --> 0:52:38
And we went to see the musical and she was so upset because the ending is oh really

735
0:52:38 --> 0:52:44
Yeah, the ending is so different and just all had to carry her out of there like it was a Thanksgiving day prank

736
0:52:44 --> 0:52:47
I threw her on my back and she laughed the whole way home

737
0:52:50 --> 0:52:51
It was crazy

738
0:52:52 --> 0:52:54
It undercuts the meaning of the whole

739
0:52:55 --> 0:53:02
Story the ending scooper nova girl in the chat says that it's the musical on screen nothing added from the book. Well, that's unfortunate

740
0:53:03 --> 0:53:08
For an yeah, because that musical did did so poorly, but um, no, I don't like the musical

741
0:53:08 --> 0:53:10
No, the the ending of the musical is

742
0:53:10 --> 0:53:13
bupkus deus ex machina bullshit

743
0:53:14 --> 0:53:17
That's everything now though. I guess you're right. There's so much

744
0:53:17 --> 0:53:20
People are coming movies for happy endings, dude. Yeah

745
0:53:20 --> 0:53:20
Yeah

746
0:53:20 --> 0:53:26
I'm not worried about that. Like there's so much of that any tv show I watch any movie

747
0:53:26 --> 0:53:30
I watch like half of them now at least have the have the uh

748
0:53:30 --> 0:53:32
God from the machine. Yes the deus ex machina

749
0:53:33 --> 0:53:37
Just some kind of supernatural thing or somebody comes in or something

750
0:53:37 --> 0:53:40
But something off-screen happens and the plot resolves itself

751
0:53:40 --> 0:53:43
Do we know do do our do our audience members?

752
0:53:43 --> 0:53:45
I think most of our audience members know deus ex machina

753
0:53:45 --> 0:53:49
But you know where that really comes from from back in the day in early theater

754
0:53:49 --> 0:53:54
There was actually a hand. Yeah, the greeks. Yeah, the greeks had an actual hand of god

755
0:53:54 --> 0:53:56
That would come down from the top of the

756
0:53:57 --> 0:54:03
The thing and touch characters or zap characters and that was a way to resolve plots by actual

757
0:54:03 --> 0:54:09
Divine intervention. Yeah, they would they would just say like, uh, you know medea is doing all of these things

758
0:54:10 --> 0:54:17
Uh off off stage right now, right and then the gods intervened intervened and and now it is this

759
0:54:17 --> 0:54:19
And now here comes everybody to bow. Yep

760
0:54:20 --> 0:54:23
Yeah, there you go. Uh, yeah, I was told that people kind of get all off script

761
0:54:24 --> 0:54:29
And kind of go haywire with stories and stuff and and and so like that was a way to like just clean everything up

762
0:54:29 --> 0:54:32
Yeah, yeah, and uh, somebody did 10 minutes of uh, shake spirit magic

763
0:54:32 --> 0:54:37
I can tell you we can go haywire fast. I'll bet you go haywire. I'll bet it go lose. He lose. You know, you

764
0:54:37 --> 0:54:38
ought to do that again

765
0:54:40 --> 0:54:40
No, we're gonna

766
0:54:41 --> 0:54:43
Paul might have to take a flight. We might have to do a thing

767
0:54:43 --> 0:54:49
I would I honestly think I would fucking I want to I want to I want to see brand schedule, but I want to submit it for uh

768
0:54:50 --> 0:54:52
Uh fallout fringe. Oh, oh, yes

769
0:54:53 --> 0:54:54
That'd be really fun. Yeah

770
0:54:56 --> 0:54:56
um

771
0:54:57 --> 0:55:01
So I you know for people going to see the movie. I don't want to you know, it's a good movie

772
0:55:01 --> 0:55:03
I don't want to pass the whole thing. Uh, yeah

773
0:55:03 --> 0:55:09
There's just one part that really stuck out to me that I was really really like like really laughing because it almost took me out of it

774
0:55:09 --> 0:55:13
So this whole thing's like basically family friendly pg ish pg 13 ish

775
0:55:14 --> 0:55:15
story

776
0:55:16 --> 0:55:17
but there's a part where

777
0:55:18 --> 0:55:24
The prince has got to get it on with somebody they they they they they run off and they they they're finally by themselves and they're gonna

778
0:55:24 --> 0:55:27
There's there's a hookup that's going to happen. Oh, yeah

779
0:55:28 --> 0:55:31
And it is the weirdest shot

780
0:55:31 --> 0:55:32
thing

781
0:55:33 --> 0:55:37
Ever it's like this weird like it's like it looked like an old chris isaac music video

782
0:55:37 --> 0:55:39
Like everything from one room to another

783
0:55:41 --> 0:55:42
And like

784
0:55:44 --> 0:55:49
It took me out of it completely. I literally was like almost laughing. I was like, what is the scene?

785
0:55:50 --> 0:55:53
Because I can't like just show them getting it on right? So there's

786
0:55:53 --> 0:55:57
Wicked games the title of the song is wicked games

787
0:56:00 --> 0:56:01
That's what it must have been

788
0:56:02 --> 0:56:03
That must have been

789
0:56:07 --> 0:56:14
You don't know the wicked games video listeners do yourself a favor and google the wicked games video

790
0:56:15 --> 0:56:20
So it's like the characters from one room to another like taking off clothing, but then also putting on clothing

791
0:56:20 --> 0:56:22
Like that's great. Bizarre

792
0:56:22 --> 0:56:28
Someone said big ups to modern love whereas someone puts on a sensible shawl to have sex

793
0:56:31 --> 0:56:32
Oh gen alpha

794
0:56:33 --> 0:56:35
The sex card is now I think

795
0:56:35 --> 0:56:39
Matt I don't want to frighten you but if you back up just a little bit

796
0:56:39 --> 0:56:42
Back back your head up just a little bit. There you go. Perfect. Stay right there

797
0:56:43 --> 0:56:44
Everybody in the chat

798
0:56:45 --> 0:56:45

799
0:56:46 --> 0:56:50
Is it me or is the shadow of the babadook behind him?

800
0:56:53 --> 0:56:58
Am I crazy? Is that the shadow of the fucking babadook over there? Yeah. Yeah

801
0:56:58 --> 0:57:00
It's the babadook

802
0:57:03 --> 0:57:04
The little top

803
0:57:08 --> 0:57:13
Why are you worried about a giant shadow of a big cartoon great day behind me?

804
0:57:13 --> 0:57:14
You know, they talk about

0:57:17 --> 0:57:22
He's gonna get you they talk about they talk about you know within

806
0:57:23 --> 0:57:26
Spooky stuff ghosty stories that they talk about the hat man and all that kind of thing

807
0:57:26 --> 0:57:31
Babadook definitely qualifies as a hat man. Yeah, that's pretty scary. That's kind of creepy

808
0:57:33 --> 0:57:41
All right, well have a good night sleeping tonight with the babadook uh in there. Yeah, no babadook is now a gay icon

809
0:57:41 --> 0:57:42
So I think you're safe

810
0:57:44 --> 0:57:49
It truly is babadook has now been taken over by the gays, which I think is awesome. Oh good. Yeah

811
0:57:50 --> 0:57:55
The gays do good work. They fucking do they rehab the babadook of all of all critters

816
0:58:07 --> 0:58:14
Greetings you fabulous face fuckers of whom I have met too. Oh, it's been about a month since the wedding

817
0:58:14 --> 0:58:18
Casey and I have returned from our honeymoon and life is returning to norm

818
0:58:19 --> 0:58:22
The story of matt and paul being the surprise entertainment at the rehearsal dinner

819
0:58:22 --> 0:58:28
Is a hit among friends who weren't there and I'm so happy that in the month since I've met you any new listeners

820
0:58:28 --> 0:58:34
Uh from the wedding have heard about paul shitting himself and ejaculating tie-infused jizz

821
0:58:36 --> 0:58:39
So all of his wedding guests have heard all about paul

822
0:58:39 --> 0:58:44
Shitting and jizzing on himself. Well, I mean not the hero we need but the hero we deserve

823
0:58:44 --> 0:58:49
I'm staying on brand. I'll tell you I've been turning on a lot of my new students to the podcast

824
0:58:49 --> 0:58:53
And and they're still on board they they're you know, all right

825
0:58:53 --> 0:58:57
I I'm coming yet. I preach truth in comedy. So here we are

826
0:59:00 --> 0:59:03
The surrealness of how I came to meet you two is starting to wear off

827
0:59:03 --> 0:59:04
Of course you two were at my wedding

828
0:59:04 --> 0:59:07
Of course I have pictures with the two of you with kasey and the kids

829
0:59:07 --> 0:59:11
And of course all three of your names are on the guest list for any future parties

830
0:59:11 --> 0:59:14
Which brings me to jacob. Oh, no

831
0:59:14 --> 0:59:18
I am so sorry you weren't at this one not just because I'd love to meet you in person

832
0:59:18 --> 0:59:25
But because you missed out on two amazing dinners and two open bars. I do love good dinners and good open bars

833
0:59:26 --> 0:59:29
Vegas is on the list of places that kasey and I would like to visit

834
0:59:29 --> 0:59:32
Hopefully there's a chance to buy you a drink on one of those trips

835
0:59:32 --> 0:59:34
Absolutely for this first non

836
0:59:35 --> 0:59:40
For this first groom update scoop mail. I have a question for the boys

837
0:59:40 --> 0:59:46
Did either of you two hear the airplanes leaving the italian airfield as you were driving away from the wedding

838
0:59:47 --> 0:59:54
Yep, that's right. We had ourselves a bit of a slow burning medical themed air show over the course of the next day

839
0:59:56 --> 0:59:57
First oh no

840
0:59:58 --> 1:00:05
The planes collide at 2 30 in the morning when my stepson son wakes up to tell me that he's not feeling well

841
1:00:05 --> 1:00:10
Only to then yell I've just thrown up. Oh, no

842
1:00:10 --> 1:00:11
Oh, no

843
1:00:11 --> 1:00:13
So there I am cleaning up vomit in the middle of the night

844
1:00:14 --> 1:00:16
Kasey and D were able to fall back to sleep

845
1:00:16 --> 1:00:18
But I'm awake until about five in the morning

846
1:00:18 --> 1:00:24
Second the burning jet fuel lands on me at six in the morning when I am woken up by a text message

847
1:00:24 --> 1:00:28
My sister texts to tell me that she's on our way to the doctors

848
1:00:28 --> 1:00:34
Due to some distressing medical symptoms and will keep me posted as to how she's feeling. Oh, no

849
1:00:35 --> 1:00:39
Honestly for the grand finale of the flaming wreckage hitting the crowd

850
1:00:39 --> 1:00:45
I get a call from my father at eight that evening saying that my stepmother is in the emergency room

851
1:00:45 --> 1:00:46
Jesus fuck

852
1:00:47 --> 1:00:53
Long story short. She ended up face planting onto cement and looked like she'd been hit in the eye with a baseball bat

853
1:00:53 --> 1:00:55
God damn. Oh my god

854
1:00:56 --> 1:01:03
This italian air show ultimately becomes an ontario business meeting though as both my stepson sister and stepmother are fine

855
1:01:03 --> 1:01:06
No long-term damage and everyone is healed up fine

856
1:01:06 --> 1:01:10
The new running joke is if you party with us, you better have

857
1:01:10 --> 1:01:15
Uh, you have a better than zero chance of ending up in the hospital. Absolutely

858
1:01:17 --> 1:01:23
Hope everyone had a great fucks giving and a merry christmas to all an early christmas present for kasey

859
1:01:23 --> 1:01:28

We will run this experiment to see if we could be better at being billionaires than the current ones. Yeah. Yeah

888
1:03:37 --> 1:03:42
Well, I think this is a good experiment people. You know, I'm a proponent of doing things for science

I decided to complete my trilogy of scooperties and like the third entry in any trilogy

926
1:06:19 --> 1:06:25
It was slapped together in record time with minimal effort and is sure to ruin all of the goodwill that its predecessors have fostered with

927
1:06:25 --> 1:06:29
Uh thoughtfulness and craftsmanship. Okay, please enjoy

928
1:06:30 --> 1:06:32

931
1:06:41 --> 1:06:44
All right, let's try uh, I'll open it up with 80s sci-fi for 200

932
1:06:46 --> 1:06:49
Commonly known as the film where john landis killed vick morrow

933
1:06:49 --> 1:06:53
This anthology mostly just reimagines tales from the classic 1959 tv show

934
1:06:53 --> 1:06:59
It shares a name with for real though. Fuck john landis. I'm sure his son is a really cool guy though

935
1:06:59 --> 1:07:01
People don't like john landis. What's wrong with john landis?

936
1:07:01 --> 1:07:06
Because of this because he killed a guy. Oh, oh, yeah fine. Uh twilight zone

937
1:07:08 --> 1:07:09
Yeah, there you go

938
1:07:10 --> 1:07:17
Matt you're up. Um i'll do um 80s action 200

939
1:07:18 --> 1:07:25
About that action even with a stiff neck. Mr. Mom is surprisingly bad ass when he kicks jack torrance's ass

940
1:07:25 --> 1:07:31
In this thrilling 1989 film that spawned three sequels each better than the last

941
1:07:33 --> 1:07:36
This is batman. Yeah the batman

942
1:07:36 --> 1:07:41
It is of course the batman jack torrance is just in a different movie

943
1:07:46 --> 1:07:53
Amazingly all over he's great. I remember as a kid seeing him in that movie and I was like this man is delightful

944
1:07:54 --> 1:07:57
I don't know what is happening here. I'm going to get jack nicholson

945
1:07:57 --> 1:08:01
I'm going to get jack nicholson. He's gonna be the joker. I'm gonna show they should have cast me as the joker

946
1:08:01 --> 1:08:07
That's what i'm gonna do every scene that this movie that I'm in i'm going to audition for the joker paul

947
1:08:09 --> 1:08:11
Uh 80s horror for 800, please

948
1:08:12 --> 1:08:12
Oh

949
1:08:12 --> 1:08:20
In this 1984 king adaptation sarah connor and her husband are the targets of a rural cult of children run by cousin it

950
1:08:20 --> 1:08:24
And hands clopech looking to sacrifice them to their god

951
1:08:24 --> 1:08:29
He who walks behind the rose that's nebraska for you. Uh children of the corn

952
1:08:30 --> 1:08:32
Children of the corn

953
1:08:32 --> 1:08:34
Yes, children of the corn

954
1:08:35 --> 1:08:36
I'm surprised that was $800

955
1:08:37 --> 1:08:42
Children of the corn in the fields. They're born in the fields. They're born

956
1:08:42 --> 1:08:45
Have some corn on the morn

957
1:08:46 --> 1:08:49

1:08:50 --> 1:08:55
I'm the corn your cows will graze while the natives call it maze

959
1:08:56 --> 1:08:57
Children of the corn

960
1:08:57 --> 1:09:02
I get it this daily double there is a parentheses

961
1:09:02 --> 1:09:04
Then a zero

962
1:09:05 --> 1:09:06
then another parentheses

963
1:09:07 --> 1:09:10
And then another zero and then a closed parentheses

964
1:09:11 --> 1:09:15
Then another zero then a closed parentheses or then another zero and then a closed parentheses

965
1:09:16 --> 1:09:17
And that is from

966
1:09:18 --> 1:09:23
I believe that is referencing the film total recall with arnold schwarzenegger total recall

967
1:09:24 --> 1:09:30
Yep. Wow. Uh, yeah, I know it came out in 1990, but it's an 80s film my heart and this is a half-assed scooper

968
1:09:30 --> 1:09:35
That's cool. Yeah, great. What's that? Uh, is that something he sees when he gets a message?

969
1:09:36 --> 1:09:41
It's the three tinnies all the three boobies. Oh, it's the alien with three boobies. That's right

970
1:09:42 --> 1:09:43

1:14:46 --> 1:14:48
Wait, is this okay?

1035

1036
1:14:52 --> 1:14:56
Oh, got you got you. What do you buy is the thing in the first one? I don't whatever. Yeah

1037

The sequel is great. Uh, also you should watch the sequel to gremlins

1038
1:15:02 --> 1:15:05
You should watch gremlins 2 and then after you get done watching gremlins 2

1039
1:15:05 --> 1:15:11
You should uh on youtube pull up the key and peel sketch about the makings of gremlins 2

1040
1:15:12 --> 1:15:20

I don't I don't understand this question. I don't understand the the plot that I'm supposed to decipher

1068
1:17:11 --> 1:17:14
So is this is someone saying I gotta tell my neighbor's a vampire?

1069
1:17:15 --> 1:17:16
Is that what that is?

1070
1:17:18 --> 1:17:23
Jack Skellington is a vampire. Yeah, so somebody thinks that their neighbor is a vampire in this movie

1071
1:17:25 --> 1:17:28
