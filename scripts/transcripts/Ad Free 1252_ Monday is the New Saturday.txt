 headphones on it is a it is a bigger deal than people realize for for large
 headed individual a hood on a hoodie that actually fits our head and same
 would goes with those you know I use real headphones because the little ones

 that's a jet I think we're gonna be done by so soon I'll go back inside why this
 is great radio apparently there's a drawback to doing the show outside you'll
 never convince me hovercraft I'm just gonna keep I'm just playing an old
 sound effects CD spike Jones bit they're invading Normandy right behind Matt we've
 got airplane helicopter next comes a slide whistle and a cymbal crash the
 chicken squawking so I was supposed to be at sea today yesterday we're supposed
 to spend the day in Maine and one of the things that's interesting about Virgin
 is that they basically when you go to ports that you can't dock at because
 your ship is too big you have to take boats little boats from your ship to the
 to the shore right okay those are called tender boats I prefer dinghies and it
 was really interesting because I didn't know that and I was like oh we're gonna
 tender can we tender tomorrow are we gonna tender or how do we tender and I
 was like what is going on you didn't understand the lingo eh I was like I
 brought plenty of actually let's do this rock and roll I'm an open-minded
 individual I assume my wife is as well but either way she's not here if she
 wanted she wanted me to do it she want me to do a tender that's what that's
 what you know if I know her so then we were in Maine and the seas were too
 too rough the current too strong to tender boat from the from the ship to
 the shores in Maine oh no so that means no none of their excursions got to go
 through right so excursions are over that kind of stuff and then also met
 that like for the time being we were just spending a sitting and looking at
 the shores of Maine was it kind of rocky even while you were docked no not too
 bad no because you're you're lassoed in pretty taught yeah yeah cuz it's also
 more of a current issue and currents weren't affecting the anchorage gigantic
 boat interesting but it's different when you're at sea and you're moving you're
 like oh it's a sea day but here we're going it's everything when you're at sea
 day you're like we can't go there and we're gonna sit here right and bless
 their hearts I'll say it bless their hearts over there at Virgin they made
 some calls and like about two hours into everything being canceled they're like
 hey we're going to Boston like right now so we're supposed to be in Maine go at
 sea for a day then be at Boston in the morning and they're like no we're gonna
 haul ass right now and go Boston right now and so you're gonna have an overnight
 two-day Boston excursion and and so I thought those pretty heads up on their
 end it caused chaos and entertainment department shows going if the if the
 boats moving you gotta have shows going right well yeah I mean also at the show
 if we're at sea your your show is a primetime show right if we're going
 overnight in Boston it's the only overnight of the journey boy is no one
 going to your show right where did you fall I thought I was not on either either
 way I'm gonna get until Monday so I don't have to worry about it but yeah so
 I'm off and out speaking of that how is your life of leisure going between your
 your one and a half shows a month I'm going fucking nuts okay so now it's time
 for you to get a handheld console of some kind that's your next move I don't
 I just think yeah yeah I'm all cut up on my boom beach of nailing yeah you got to
 get a proper Gameboy or some kind of yeah yeah we got to get you a modified
 Gameboy that's got like thousands of games on you far from I watched some
 weird way with Wyatt Russell in it I watched I'm binging task which is not a
 real heart-warmer not really doesn't really warm the soul and and I and I
 bounced off of that on the first episode we got 30 minutes in she was like no I
 can't do it it's dark oh that's yeah it was that I single part of that show that
 looked that interested me enough to even turn it on well it's just so it's so
 depressing yes and just said straight up she's like there's enough happening I
 don't need more made-up pressing I'm good yeah no no when you're when you're
 living as a little cabin boy with room service looking at looking at people
 living in a total hellscape with no hope is really really makes those eggs taste
 as extra delicious speaking of Matt sitting and living as a little cabin boy
 and other people living a hellscape I saw Matt's wife the other night after we
 get done recording poor poor hellscape I'm doing four shows in two weeks and my
 wife is doing like she is handling the speaker world pride parade yep today she
 is hosting auditions for a showgirls musical at Troy's theater uh-huh she is
 running an after-school program for the children uh-huh she's also basically
 some sort of manager of the disco show some sort I don't know her exact position
 but she's she's a she's a she's a managing member of the disco team sure
 sure and there are people down at absence and so Sarah is filling in for
 two people and covering everyone's shifts over at absence right now doing
 all the shows and getting my boys to soccer practice and band practice and I
 have to do four shows in 14 days I feel like such an asshole I saw her on
 Wednesday evening and she comes over we're chatting and somebody also asked
 how you were doing and she went oh I think he's doing actually she looks at
 me you saw him this morning how's he doing I said he's fine he's a little
 stressed about just sitting in the cabin while you're running life here and she
 gave me the biggest eye roll that I have seen come out of oh boy I'm familiar
 luckily for you though luckily for you it was her birthday and I'm going on the
 first day the show it was on her birthday but everyone at the show was
 just coming up to her and telling her happy birthday and singing to her so
 everybody at the show went really out of their way to make sure that your wife
 had a good birthday evening no I think I think that was I think that was really
 good that was that was a good ending of the day especially for Matt Donnelly who
 was it some of Amy Poehler's interviewing a woman she's in that Leo
 Leo DiCaprio movie that's out right now Paul Thomas Anderson oh cool who's that
 lead actor I forget her name and she was joking she was like you know every man
 in their marriage says their wife is their best friend but if you ask the
 wife of the best friend is they have a list of friends she's like men don't
 have friends she's like well women have friends
 my husband and said good thing that you have this podcast because you've got male
 friends my wife was was showered with with cards and gifts and people take her
 out to lunch and all that stuff and I sent some vegan dark chocolate gift
 baskets from far away oh yeah I want to thank you for that that was really good
 oh shoot I wasn't gonna mention anything I saw that dark smudging all around your
 mouth hole I thought that's probably chocolate but I don't want to you know
 put him on blast mostly chocolate it's 85% chocolate Jacob have ass we'll eat
 it Smith
 Brogan there's your sticker oh my god I'm straight-up delirious today from work I
 just oh yeah yeah just work just makes me delirious at this point is it all
 Christmas stuff now you're dealing with we're about to hit Christmas yeah we
 were getting we're getting Christmas scented shit meanwhile yeah exactly we're
 getting like pine needle glade plugins and we're getting fucking leaves leaves
 an autumn soap hand soap like today like we got the Christmas sense before we got
 the autumn sense is weird and that doesn't make horse sense no make a damn
 lick of sense what does oh boy so yeah and then just being up so early today
 but then I couldn't sleep today because I had stuff to take care of at home so I
 haven't got my nap in so I'm kind of just in that and then that's true well
 then right before right before we record at about a half hour ago and calls me
 says hey can you look over this resume I put together and do some you know edit
 you know just edit and copyright not copy copy any resume it was a it was a
 Tinder program resume so she sent me a resume and so I really sorry I'm just
 refilling from my recently refilled vase of drinking water you've got a fucking
 fresh carafe fresh carafe oh my god life is tough man cruise life is tough I've
 been there I had the exact same or similar situation but mine was even
 crazier because I couldn't get off the boat for four or five months oh yes so
 like major life events would happen and I was just stuck no you have and I could
 only call Anne once a week sometimes once every two weeks though there are
 people that are on here like that for like forever right and so I heard things
 like I just get the burger the day just experience something different I don't
 care whether I like it or not I just get the burger the day yeah yeah yeah I know
 it's got pear on it it doesn't sound good I'm interested some vinegar dipped
 pear gruyere oh Jesus it looks really pretty in the picture I know it's not
 gonna taste that good but I'm gonna try it has got something a little different
 bar foe that's so you were you were tasked with punching up a resume yes I
 was tasked with doing a quick you know what do you call it cop not what editing
 editing yeah copy copy copy they're doing like copy editing a resume and then they
 went and whatnot and I think a copy edit and I did a I did a bang-up job if I say
 so myself yeah as long as the words copy edit didn't have to be in there
 anywhere thank God thank God she's not a copy editor I barely am you know I agree
 Paul you are barely a copy was it her resume or someone else's resume no is
 her resume so yeah so exciting things I was gonna say I was like enter inter
 company okay okay everybody keep your fingers crossed for he's applying for
 the role as ICS host yeah she's come she's coming on I would I would cross my
 fingers Paul but I have so much to do I have so much going on I get it I'll get
 around to it okay oh he's halfway there this is good yourself I don't want a
 rush job happening if it's if it's hurry what quality yeah finger-crossing over
 quantity finger-crossing but so yeah I was just doing that right up to the end
 and then you know shifting the dogs around because I got I got to run the
 giz and adora warden so I got to switch them oh yeah one has to be away while
 the other gets to roam free and then back and forth back and forth you got a
 balanced yard time they still don't get along no oh I thought it was like I
 thought there's like a temporary growth like no no no this is a forever thing
 this is not something that I would be okay with as a pet owner it's a it's
 aggro simply not be okay with some of my pets be like no no fuck you but now
 Agra leaving yeah it's agger damn bait and that's for sure either she is on my
 lap next to our next to Anne okay or she is put away or one of the other one is
 put away but so yeah I spend no all the time no babysitting is making sure gives
 is there and safe and then and then she'll start going because she needs to
 go out or want some water or whatever then I had to go and lock up a Dora and
 then put her out and then take her back and get a Dora back out and when Anne's
 home you have to put her up to right oh forget and adore I don't get along
 forget it they are vinegar and water just I think that's right is that right
 vinegar vinegar and water and also that's gonna be on the new burger of
 vinegar and water does not sound good I mean it is gonna be on there it will be
 something water vinegar and vinegar I don't know why not oil and vinegar it's
 you know it's the reason these oil spills are a problem is because they
 don't mix and not snow as your copy editor but I ask if you want to do oil
 oil and vinegar instead of water and vinegar he doesn't know what copy editors
 mean I do though I do I just don't remember what the phrase is right but it
 was yeah no boy so well yeah fingers crossed for whatever she should she will
 crush whatever it is yes yes I only you know shake my head in disbelief anytime
 she's passed over for anything because fools fools they know not the power of
 Anne McPheeters yeah that's right get shit done she gets to put Matt and I
 down as references okay I'll do that I'll do that I'm sure she'll do that I'll
 face time with weather wearing wearing this sweatshirt oh I'll be ready where
 where the fish head miss McPheeters we were gonna hire you for this we called
 one of your references he was sprawled nude on a cruise ship balcony during
 the entire zoom call that we had with it we couldn't really hear him over the
 helicopters yeah it's just a lot of helicopter sounds and we couldn't use it
 was from an actual helicopter or just the way he was rotating his wiener he
 was harpooned by someone in a lifeboat to make sure that he jumped it seemed
 effective it's a defective tender that man I'll tell you who else wants to get
 tendered and that's the following sponsor today's show Matt manley's ice
 cream social is oh come on now brought to you by you without the internet's
 come on oh I thought I thought you read something scary no no no no what could

 thought of putting propeller hats on small Welsh corgi dogs and I started
 doing that and they let me you want to know how I got these hats let me tell
 you well spoiler crazy Jeff was eventually gonna go totally crazy in
 that yeah too long a fuse for your jake of the audio guy for sure for sure he
 was you know he was coming off as relatively sane Jeff for a pretty long
 while yeah so yeah I saw so those show their production shows here on board oh
 good oh yeah those are always a trip what's what is the title of one now this
 was one's called out of time oh good is that is that banking on the whole
 musical musical ization of back to the future I see why you would think that
 Paul it's actually a Jersey Boys style musical about Huey Lewis in the news
 yeah I would Huey Lewis on an arena stage don't take money don't take fame
 don't need no credit card right on this train hey hey you know I'm saying it's
 very sudden it could be cruel sometimes but it might just change your life they
 say that all in love is fair yeah you don't care you know Joe Pesci is also
 in my musical yeah well you know what they do when it gets hold of you with a
 little help from above you'll feel the power of love it's not that Joe Pesci
 knew all musical stars before they became famous he's also he's actually a
 key component into making anyway no so Paul Paul's right it's a it's about a
 time machine thing the time machine thing oh oh it is just about a time
 machine yeah it's raiding the rock vault it's raiding the rock vault was still
 conceptual and had a giant Mayan temple those of you who don't know as
 astronauts invading a giant Mayan temple and discovering ancient hieroglyphs of
 rock federal archaeologists yes they were talking about the federal
 archaeologists that was when they were having auditions and our friend who is
 our friend SJ Brandon got in Brandon anyway someone told me I had no audition
 right away and I said I'm in LA with my family and I said well they're always
 I was in I was in fucking California do the same time we were both fucked for
 the day yeah I so I flew home yeah to make it to the audition time and he said
 oh just kidding they're not seeing anyone else today and I was like okay
 time thanks for having me leave my family in California and fly home to do
 this audition thanks buddy our friend our friend our friend Brandon yeah our
 friend later on it was like hey can you get pen and tell no not Brandon Brandon
 didn't do Brandon actually got the gig eventually oh yeah okay yeah no no wasn't
 Brandon sorry yeah Ryan Ryan yeah right right yeah Ryan was in it for a long time
 right had me fly home and said just kidding and then and then later on was
 like hey can you get pen and tell her to do this thing and I was like you know
 what I can't know you know I can't you know what give me give me give me 180
 bucks back and maybe we'll talk dollars and some time with my children which has
 a price let's be honest it does people it does I'm sitting in a cabin the price
 is here the price is right motherfuckers prices right my little golden bottomed
 glass of water matches there with magic fish scaring housekeepers too much too
 much rating the rock vault is finally closing this year and in Las Vegas yes
 I think I think just like a couple years past for this might be the year we're
 talking about a lot of shows closing but yeah my sincere some touring but yeah
 they're gonna they're gonna close at the old Hard Rock Cafe here in Vegas finally
 at the end of the year after I think like 12 years my sincere hope for rating
 the rock vault goes to the old wrestling adage how can they miss you if you never
 go away I agree and I really think that maybe three years from now they can come
 back really well let's see 2028 provided things are still intact she's shaken out
 in a certain way let's say 2028 maybe yeah okay just as a just as a arbitrary
 possible gotcha yeah okay I'm not picking that date for any specific reason
 no a little Vegas in parking whether they're trying to do a couple things or
 some because you know so you're like not gonna charge for parking for locals other
 people try deals and the whole point is just like man Vegas is a town of bold
 swings so if you kind of inch back little things and expected to have a big
 impact you're a fool yeah Cosmopolitan I just got an email about three minutes
 ago a report about Cosmopolitan they are doing a new special to try to entice
 locals and quote-unquote industry people to come to Cosmopolitan and what they are
 doing is they are offering free parking to these people every single Monday
 Mondays Monday is going free parking to locals on Monday when I was in my 20s
 and Monday was my night off after I worked on Saturday and Sunday yeah I
 started a thing with my friends called Mondays the new Saturday and we would go
 nuts on Monday nights I'm not even saying that I won't take advantage of
 this ever I'm just saying it's a dumb promotion as it worked in a very small
 group of friends in the 90s and 2000s early 2000s I would like you and that
 group of friends to hang out at the Cosmo on Monday nights going well I
 believe what let's see how long this going what the Cosmopolitan is missing in
 this calculation is there need to be industry people employed in Las Vegas
 for the discount to apply and if all the people are getting let go here's an
 example of what I think would would would be fun okay free parking and free
 valet again because it used to be free valet when you first came here right for
 an entire month if all of November it was just free parking and free
 valet because that would make people I think from Los Angeles and stuff go like
 oh maybe funders roll in there and toss the keys and go into Vegas for a weekend
 or whatever like they might like that would be something that would at least
 make people go like oh shit you know like you know like there you go scoop
 Jesus has got it no fee November I was gonna say no pay no Ben November to go
 along with no nut November as we all celebrate of course yeah I'm getting a
 jump on it that was low-hanging fruit that's why I can't resist touching it
 boy yeah that's a good idea Matt it does need to be a big move right silly or
 stupid it needs to be like oh like oh what like it needs people go like whoa
 like it needs to like make people go like oh shit cool Vegas is back that's
 what that's like so like these little inching things of like oh well you know
 we're not charging for this over here we give this much and maybe that will get
 enough people in the door to move the needle a little bit yeah but we won't
 change too much yeah yeah but they won't do it well I don't want to give away too
 much production stuff here but I feel like our dealings with the Orleans
 reflected very much sort of zeitgeist of what's going on in Vegas and I see this
 quoted by local Vegas and Las Vegas locally and and you know some of our
 favorite Twitter bloggers and whatnot how you know this vicious cycle of oh
 shit we're losing money because no one's coming let's charge everyone for
 everything right every little thing because everything that used to be free
 now are our charges things that used to be just considered complementary now our
 charges things that we used to be able to make a deal on now we can't negotiate
 a fucking penny you know and then that gets even worse because you start to
 tighten the strings on the people who are actually paying to utilize your space
 and then they don't want to utilize your space and then it's like yeah yeah sorry
 I wasn't listening what you could you start from the beginning again so I
 don't want to give too much away here regarding our yeah you wouldn't talk
 about the oh he's talking about Vegas as a whole so Jacob I had both leaned in
 and leaned out yeah no I didn't want to give too much away oh I don't mind
 telling the audience that we had a very fucking hard time dealing with yeah yeah
 no they were tough this year yeah and I think but I mean I think it's part not
 just for us I talked to what to other people that had right events there and
 and everyone had exactly the same complaints and I think it's in no small
 part due to that whole effect of the tightening of belts all the way around
 and the rejiggering of employment employees to where there's all people who
 aren't familiar with their now prior roles you know and if you don't want to
 give too much away here but we actually had kind of a hard time dealing with
 your liens this year okay I don't want to spill all the beans but this year our
 relationship with the Orleans was strained that was yeah yeah yeah yeah
 but not to give too much away let's keep some cats in the bag here but let's also
 say so far as us go into the Orleans that was tough this time around that was a
 real dick kick there's a really there was a free place for me to park on
 Mondays then it would all be better then I'd hang out on the strip some more yeah
 and yeah and they get a whole casino full of people wearing our robes and
 pheasants good point Lori else Roth like we add ambiance to that win-win I mean
 I'll tell you who loves us at the Orleans is our bartenders the bartenders
 love us and the production guys love us yeah yeah yeah yeah but every day I would
 check in with the bartenders and be like how'd you do today and the bartenders
 would be like fuck me these scoops are awesome I'm telling you magic there it
 is I've seen the party ultimately those motherfuckers who are working those are
 the only people I care about actually making happy true I do want them to be
 happy that is absolutely true and and one of the brothers said it was like I
 can't wait for you guys to come back and we were like don't wait in one hand and
 not shit the other like one of the bartenders that he had been with us for
 our two previous show our two previous oh really so he made sure to get up here

 sitting on top of a rack that's spray-painted yeah it's a pushcart and you
 put stuff in it and then when the screens go all crazy and then they go to
 a different time oh and I was laughing cuz like it would like just like go you
 know went to like 1950 something and then it was in a diner and then like they
 had to get fuel each time they need to leave so the different fuel had to go in
 the microwave to to power the time machine to go to different okay I'm so
 in the diner one gigawatts and whatnot in the diner this is elaborate bit to
 like during a dance number like steal a cheeseburger because the cheeseburgers
 the fuel needed that was enough fuel to go and I it was like it's a diner just
 order a cheeseburg like you don't need to steal that one just order a burger
 like what are you doing right it's a 1950s diner your dollar will go really
 far and I was laughing is like you know it also goes it went to like you know
 10,000 not the spoiler for those of you who want to go see the show but it goes
 to like you know 10 million BC or something like that right laughing
 because yeah I was laughing is when it went to like very far in the past very
 future there are people around me that were like whoa

 story to note that like just be like whoa like it was blowing people away I was
 ready for time travel but not extreme time travel what they think of next I
 don't know the most logical thing did they do jungle love they did not do
 jungle love although yeah they do walk the dinosaur when when it featured
 tribal people it did go into more ethnic and rap songs oh no suddenly it's a
 Busta Rhymes video yeah that's kind of like maybe don't maybe don't put those
 two together like that you know what kudos to them for really addressing our
 troubled past everybody was definitely a lot of races all getting along and
 everyone got to sit wherever they wanted there's a chance I could add some real
 commentary what I would like to see on a cruise ship more a cheesy song and dance
 show where they're traveling through time or a show where they really examine
 all of the problems in America's racial history hey there daddy oh where'd you
 zip in from I'm from the future I'm from the future I'm from 2026 Wowzers what's
 that like well it's not too far off from the 1950s segregation but none of the
 prosperity fuck us right yeah how'd you build a time machine God knows why don't
 you want to stay here I'm ignorant I'm going back to where dinosaurs are
 because I've got a better chance of making a life for myself in the time of
 dinosaurs than I do in my time you're right I do want to see the educational
 show on the cruise ship yeah exploration it's Saturday night I'm gonna go to the
 Rosa Parks musical let's do it look man I'm a Tyrannosaurus Rex not a
 tyrannoracist Rex everybody gets along in my time unless you're prey but you
 could still sit anywhere you want in our dino diner
 oh the diner is still there oh yeah the diner is the through line show the dino
 diner it's always been a diner no matter what time
 period I would love to me you and Sarah and maybe even Jacob and SJ honestly all
 of us I think it'd be really fun to take a swing at trying to come up with a
 cruise ship show that we could put together a jukebox musical for cruise
 ships I think we could fucking crush it that might be the next episode of this
 show like seriously we could crush one the four of us all together with all the
 experience we've had like on both sides like Jacob could come at it with the tech
 stuff and we could come at it from a writing perspective and and you can come
 out from a performance perspective and it would just you know we could make
 something really interesting I think all right we're gonna stop doing this
 podcast from now on we're just writing cruise ship musicals step three profit
 all you need is one all you need is one it'll play like you know like you have
 these young people who are crazy talented right they have to get to do be
 if you do so many dance numbers and sing so many songs to get on these these
 things and they have like their songbook and they can like kick-ass choreography
 then you put them in these musicals that are so strange where every costumes like
 a million dollars and you're like I was gonna I was gonna showcase myself but
 instead of playing like a secret spy scientist wearing a dinosaur tail that's
 that's where I'm doing that's where I'm living my life but the money is yeah
 yeah but it was it was fun it was it was it was certainly worth seeing so did
 they go to the far-flung future eventually - yes they went back to like
 before the big bang no lightsabers yeah what indicated Jacob when they were
 hanging out before the big bang I was like where are you hanging out and where
 are you staying they went to before the big bang they went to before the big
 bang now wait a minute what they said that was it yeah the big bang that's
 where they had this a real soul-searching Paul it's where they
 really start to discover who they were and their feelings for each other well
 it's because they didn't have any lights because they just went to pitch black
 they're like oh this is where the big bang all matter actually how is it the
 one tiny particle I was like how was our sound traveling from my mouth to your
 ears before the big bang again with the big bang again I don't want to poke
 holes in a cruise ship musical I don't I just I was curious about it there's so
 much happening here before the big bang
 really a really great image of dinersaurus dinosaurs dressed up like
 line cooks pretty great
 well the diner it could be it's sort of like a hitchhiker's guide the diner at
 the end of the universe right yeah yeah yeah but how is this diner even here who
 knows before the big bang who the fuck knows we're all just hash brown cakes not
 before the big bang they don't exist yet we don't even have moons over Miami
 because there are no moons hey how are my hammy my hammy welcome to Miami Ben
 Vinito on me hammy how about the Giants equals last night in the in football huh
 that's pretty fun that's pretty fun what happened Giants beat the Eagles with
 with Jackson Dart I only bring the New York Giants look like the best team in
 the football league that's right that's what happened I only bring this up
 because Jackson Dart absolutely is the boyfriend of the daughter from land man
 like that's watching when a press conference I was like oh my god it's
 just the boyfriend from the show land man the football high school football
 player oh yeah he's totally the same guy and Paul went away but Paul I'm here he
 wears uh he wears like a black splotch on his cheek yeah he doesn't do the the
 black face paint below both eyes he just does like a big splotch below one eye
 and he does it because it's a tribute to Anakin Skywalker is it really he was
 playing in high school and he was inspired by Anakin Skywalker and then
 put a little black splotch on his cheek and some said look pretty cool so that
 became his thing from then on and it was so funny because Herb Street and Al
 Michaels and Al Michaels is like almost 80 years old he's done all like the
 greatest right you know called the mystery the miracle of ice in the 1980
 Olympics like and Herb Street's like of course it's a Star Wars reference Mike
 you want to take it from here because Al Michaels I guess Al you want to take it
 from here no no yeah you know I love me some Star Wars but no you go ahead Kurt
 you break it down for the audience Al Michaels was like do not make me talk
 about Star Wars wow well I mean you know that generation they really did love the
 prequels yeah you know it was very impactful for them that was their big
 movie going experience and I gotta say Hayden Christensen was doing a lot of
 heavy lifting he tried with that shit script that he had you know so props to
 him but I guess so the blotch is to indicate like when he got burned up in
 the yeah oh it's from it's the scar it's the scar okay yeah now I see I thought
 it was just on his cheek oh no it's the scar okay okay yeah he's like blacked
 out one eye yeah he gets a scar okay well he's a handsome little Hayden
 Christensen looking dude himself yeah yeah the quarterback of the New York
 professional football team is very attractive and is going to do just fine
 in his life yeah yeah he's gonna be okay he's gonna have some really nice Star
 Wars memorabilia I'll bet he already has some really nice Star Wars memorabilia
 New York transfer not not known for their looks Eli was never hold your
 tongue apparently he did he often would sit on the sideline and just hold his
 tongue I'm Eli Manning I throw ball I make I make touchdown go happen

 Eli Manning hold on tongue this one's about a good-looking Jackson Dart was that's all
 let's do some Scoop Mail
 boy I want here from bus driver scoop dear Matt Paul Jacob and the entire
 scoop community how does an introverted extrovert that is unbelievably damaged
 mentally by life express how incredibly loved and accepted they felt at their
 first scoop fest oh how does said person express the amount of confidence and
 self-worth they obtained simply by being in the presence of this community for
 four days I really do not know where to begin with the thanks the hugs the
 heartfelt face fuckings I really can't find the right words to tell each and
 every single person that I cross paths with that you are amazing and I am
 infinitely grateful not only for your existence but also for you for your
 acceptance into this spectacular group of humans thank you from the bottom of my
 heart for being all that you are love and licks that's Tracy the bus driver
 scoop oh yeah whatever that's a bad prank this is like that now this is
 wonderful this is wonderful yeah yeah we got us pass that on to JD for yet
 another scoop confessional or maybe it made it into a scoop confessional we
 didn't even oh yeah I don't know we aren't privy to any of that we don't
 know no I hope to see them at some point we got one from Masshole scoop dear
 gentlemen an episode 1244 you guys discussed the song darling Nikki by
 Prince the first time my mother ever heard that song was in April of 1985 I
 had been born in March of 1985 my name is Nikki Jacob gave a good rundown of
 the song on that episode but for context the very first lyrics are I knew a girl
 named Nikki I guess you could say that she was a sex fiend I met her in a
 hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine my poor mother was completely
 horrified she said that if she had just heard that song a month earlier there is
 no way in hell that she would have named her baby Nikki my name would have been
 Sarah and that would have been weird so I'm glad it all worked out
 people named Sarah are weird breaks in the same episode Matt talked about the
 band G love and special sauce oh yeah coincidentally they also have a song
 that references a girl named Nikki performing sex acts on the singer it's
 called kick drum and it's actually a really good song it is a good face
 that's a mass hole scoop who is a brand that's a brand new scoop name no
 fantastic yeah thank you mass hole scoop so that's another question for the ages
 and I'd love to get the popular opinion Matt Jacob what is your take on Nikki's
 actual physical situation during this scenario is she reading and perusing a
 magazine and did live the beam rolling up the magazine to some sort of phallus
 and inserting it you know Paul there by masturbating with a magazine I have to
 thank you Paul because I thought I was gonna have to ask that question and so
 thank you thank you for being one of the turtle burning questions Nikki actually
 doing with that magazine option B is eternally burning that's for sure and
 then ML Kennedy says the magazine was also masturbating right that's another
 reading on it it could have been joining in on the magazine's master magazine
 there's masturbating I think Prince forgot word for reading and replace it
 with masturbation you think he just did a search and replace better in a hotel
 lobby reading a magazine that word means I don't know let's replace it with
 masturbating reading too few syllables doesn't work linguistically also you
 would hope that that's a very glossy tone because if it's just straight news
 print oh he's gonna disintegrate you're basically she's gonna have a paper
 machine good check for paper luckily it was a glossy magazine yeah when you read
 the lighter notes is that do not try this at home do not utilize lighter
 notes for who high insertion when I read the lighter notes they were all smudged
 from being in my hoo-ha we got one from Trav hi I have over a decade of
 professional experience in kitchens not to mention my continued learning and
 growth in the 20 plus years of my adult life that I haven't gotten paid for
 cooking I say this to only say unfortunately Paul is right about
 microwaving hot dogs he's an absolute potato when it comes to
 microwaving bratwurst though you see cooking a hot dog just involves warming
 it up most of them you can eat it raw for the most part they're cured and
 fully cooked therefore the only thing that needs to be done is to make it hot
 to be tastier the traditional method for a ballpark hot dog is boiling cooking a
 hot dog in a microwave is essentially the same thing it's akin to steaming as
 long as you don't overdo it a microwaved hot dog is perfectly acceptable one could
 argue even efficient I'm not saying you microwave the bun never microwave bread
 it makes it tough now there could be arguments that grilling a hot dog adds
 more flavor and a bit of texture that's not wrong but that doesn't make a
 microwaved hot dog unpalatable it just makes those options better let's not
 pretend that a hot dog is some culinary masterpiece it is a way to dress up the
 leftovers and sell some cheap-ass shit love y'all fuck you the face that's
 Trav aka ID H a S in okay yeah it hasn't I don't know I appreciate that Trav
 thank you for coming to my defense yes I did say that you're a potato for
 microwaving bratwurst look I did it once okay I've learned my lesson potato yeah
 yeah it's just it's just a convenience thing yeah tell that to my intestines the
 science is tight on this it's not it's not the same the science is out and we
 got one here from Robert hi folks loved episode 1227 Rob's story about his
 heroin neighbors reminded me of our old family friend Tim he was about 60 at the
 time and this took place back in the 80s back in Poughkeepsie New York every fall
 Tim would wander into our woods and collect giant quote-unquote basketball
 mushrooms that not a nickname they were literally the size of basketballs I got
 he had the he had the foraging know-how to tell the good from the deadly and had
 sliced them like bread and fry them up said they were delicious we weren't
 brave enough to find out for ourselves then one year Tim just stopped showing
 up he was dirt poor and had no phone so we had no way to check on no our best
 guest he finally grabbed a wrong mushroom and joined the network in the
 sky years later surprise Tim reappears turns out he had gone to prison he went
 to prison he just went to prison for mushroom thievin who knows I like to
 think it was for mushroom thievin fast forward these turn things around got a
 place even a phone he calls my grandfather and asks if I the family's
 designated preteen tech wizard can help him set up a fax machine grandpa and I
 head to his sketchy apartment one of the in one of Poughkeepsie's less than great
 neighborhoods I plug in the brand new fax machine and ask if he has anyone to
 fax or someone who might fax him then we spend 20 minutes explaining what a fax
 machine actually does he seems surprised by the concept thanks for coming over I
 got something for you he leads us into the into the kitchen and they're stacked
 like techno Jenga are 50 brand new fax machines oh I decline no thanks I don't
 need one either Tim nods you're right I've got something better for a kid into
 the bedroom we go and now there's a stack of 50 boom boxes oh new shrink wrap
 still on I should grandpa look grandpa just shrugs we both left with a boom box
 yeah drain D batteries like it owed the energizer money money baby and that is
 from Robert that's amazing I think the best not stolen boom boxes in the 80s
 still drained those fucking D batteries like they were going out of style yeah
 it was crazy those things like you could not run them on batteries for very long
 you like five five or six good hours tops yeah yeah it's a shame Tim had to
 go to jail for a little while he was always such a fun guy yeah I wonder why
 well I asked him I asked him if it was for stealing mushrooms he said more or
 less you can't get a straight answer from that cat it's time for Jack vs.
 nerd truck ladies and gentlemen it is time! time for Jack vs. Nick! explosion of Jax and Darkface Pings!
