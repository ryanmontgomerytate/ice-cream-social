 sitting in los vegas it's matt donnelly also sitting in los vegas it's me jacob
 the audio guy sitting somewhere we'll figure it out later it's paul we're
 preaching fun yeah paul's not here uh you know it's funny we got a couple of
 uh compliments recently this thing our recent episodes have just been have been
 on a good in a good spot we've been there what better way to bring it to a
 screeching halt than simply not knowing where paul maddenley is on this earth i
 think it's maybe a good way to just uh just slow it down we'll show you but the
 chat is continuing to find different ways to portray boobs in emoji form in
 the chat which is very exciting lori else off the two sunny side eggs very
 nice very nice everyone's so creative oh uh just got a text from paul breaking
 news oh hey be home soon so it wasn't sleeping oh well we don't know that you
 might have been like on a park bench somewhere just just dozing just feeding
 the birds and just nodding off on a park bench in the middle of january in
 pittsburgh no problem it's so nice out it is freezing uh for las vegas right
 it's uh 44 degrees or 40 degrees uh it's dropped down to 38 which is celsius for
 our our foreign listeners is i don't know five i've we're terrible at
 converting fahrenheit celsius i have no idea uh but uh it's negative 30 i don't
 know yeah um but i go to the gym and i'm my gym right now it's just like our
 little community center because my actual gym gym closed my gym gym
 closed oh gym gym top of the morning to you my gym gym closed um so my uh my
 regular gym closed it's going to be taken over by a crunch gym eventually
 it's a coming soon what which is always so funny right like pizza places just
 become other pizza places right like gyms like what else are you going to do
 that space it has like it has a pool and workout equipment are you just going to
 so it's going to be another gym oh yeah i forget about the pool sure that makes
 sense the pool does it's why it's why i had joined that particular gym is
 because all right because you could go in there and and uh and and stare at the
 young ladies who were swimming exactly i mean you can go swim exactly but i have
 those glasses that look like eyeballs that are looking up and so therefore you
 can't tell that i'm staring at the spring ones yeah but i i taped them so
 they just look like they're looking up good smart so that way that way i'm not
 creepy that's right that's why he's the best folks
 that's why he's the best and i uh uh go so what i do is i go to the community
 center it's called the multi multi multi-gen multi-gen center multi-generational
 center right okay so they have you know kids camps they got swimming lessons
 they have like uh classrooms for uh to teach classes for adults it's a big it's
 a big big outfit over there and one of the houses is a gym and a walking track
 and a pool but a big like okay it's like where the where the competitions are
 where the swimming competitions are uh locally for for for the schools got you
 and so i go to the gym in the evening around like 5 30
 which means the sun has just gone down and it was super windy yesterday like
 really windy crazy breezy yesterday and i look out the window and there's a
 fucking swim meet happening
 i was like what fucking hell on earth why why it's it's still january i know
 we live in the desert but it's still january
 yes why on earth is an outdoor swimming meet happening
 i mean best case scenario in the pool and i assume an unheated pool in the
 desert in january it's not pleasant it's not nice
 no like without a breeze it's just it still was a cold day
 but it was like that means like you know like oh man when when you get wet
 and then there's a breeze i mean that's all right yeah
 i couldn't believe it's all these kids it's honestly the reason that i don't
 swim half the time i don't swim it's because
 right now i'm i'm just not swimming in case a breeze comes up
 i mean it's been a minute but i that story where i was hired to be a
 bathing suit model by accident i think i've told the story on air
 it's been a while it's been a while though but uh yeah so so they'd cast just
 off of headshots and then it was me three male models and four gorgeous
 women models and then a bunch of bathing suits that didn't fit on my fat body
 and then that's right i forgot they had the bathing suits
 so i stuffed into one of them like a sausage and then yep good
 we had to go do like a pool shoot and there's literally like two pools like a
 giant lap pool and this beautiful kind of
 circular fountain pool for like um hanging out and renting cabanas
 right and so they set this really fancy camera
 and they art directed me to the furthest place away from the camera
 they put a fake that that is good art direction
 they put a fake drink in my hand and put me literally
 200 yards away from the camera all right so they had the hotter people closer to
 the first pool i was just supposed to be decorative
 like background in the second pool here's what they did they put all the
 they put all the super hot people in the close-up pool
 and they put me behind the camera with a jib
 can you can you hold this this bounce this light bouncer
 this reflector can you hold it i don't think i'm even on camera over here no
 you are you are don't worry about it you're fine
 the look i remember still in the art dresser's face when i was trying to
 squeeze into a bathing suit and him just going like why
 why are you here what have i done to deserve this
 hanging out in the tent and listen to all the hot people talk about all the
 different things they have for their veggies vegetable smoothies and which
 blenders they use and stuff i was like i was like i know what a
 blender is
 i just put snakes in mine but it was freezing cold it was like a free it was
 it was like uh it wasn't as cold as today but it was it was probably like
 50 degrees still very cold to be in a pool and so
 i uh being the only person in pool b uh really took my time getting in trying
 to not even let it ripple it was like even if i just got up on my on my
 stomach like the wind was blowing and it would just freeze right
 so i was staying like perfectly still in the water to like not like to
 establish a level and not change it right that was yeah that's what i was
 doing and then at one point they want to shake
 things up i'm gonna shake things up and decide to move people around
 except me they said to keep me right where i was
 well they had taken the first shoot to uh build a wall
 but they set the wall up between me and the camera they told one of the hot
 guys pretending your friends with fatso back there right so they sent him back
 there and uh and you said that's not how you
 pronounce my name
 and uh and he was a big old beautiful dummy
 so he ran great and just jumped in the pool
 yes ran and just leapt into the pool and i was like no
 i've established i've established a level
 you're interfering with my level you're ruining it for both of us
 you're gonna be mad about this too and then he gets up he's wet and then we
 start staying still and pretending to talk and gesture one another while they
 do this right and uh and he is like man it sucks uh it's cold
 i was like yeah sure does buddy uh he was like because the wind's
 blowing i was like no one of us has already figured that out
 yeah the other of us knows which blender to have to make the best vegetable
 smoothies and the other knows how wind works on
 cold skin but we both got this gig didn't we
 we're both getting the same check buddy
 uh i still remember that shoot came out uh it was uh
 it was it was not uh i was not in the pool stuff
 i was in the uh at one point they like decided like
 center attention on me and like do things with like they were pushing me in
 the pool right and that was oh okay those were the those are the final shots
 the pool was me getting pushed in the pool
 while girls with their dad showed up like
 give us money and let us gamble go away
 the those those didn't make it because they probably looked over things like it
 just looks like we're picking on someone right now i was just fat this time i was
 still young so i didn't come off as their dad i
 just came off as like i don't know their gay best friend
 or you know someone they went to high school with you know that kind of a
 thing this is our cousin who's with us for the
 day this is a make-a-wish guy that said he
 wanted to hang out at the caesar's pool before he died i didn't know they did
 exchange students to the caesar's pool but i guess they do
 that'd be great like you're dying like you want to i want to you want to hang
 out with famous magicians now i want to know what it's like to
 get bottle servers and have models hang out
 that's my i want you to just buy me a table
 at omni oh i want to hang out at the craziest nightclub make-a-wishes like
 we can't i cannot afford this i want a poolside
 cabana at towel all right give it can we just buy you a pool
 we'll just buy you a pool uh someone in chat saying to try to
 distract me with their zoom background their zoom background is the
 crucifixion it's just it's it's three people on crosses
 on the hillside but i'm not sure if that's the real one
 i don't even know if they had cameras back then i mean
 you know not to put the car before the horse here but that's a beautiful
 sunset i mean it's perfect perfect sunset how can you see that
 sunset behind three people hanging on crosses and not
 believe in god wait someone said do you see the letters
 is there letters on there oh just says it says titties or tits
 oh good oh the crosses the crosses spell titties
 now i get it great boy did that take me too long
 and not help the audio version of this podcast at all
 um all right but uh yeah i think we're doing great
 hey when you were growing up jacob did saying the word
 sucks like that sucks was that considered like extreme
 oh that was definitely considered that was a that was a word we could get in
 trouble for yeah me too yeah my kids throw out like
 it's nothing all the time really yeah
 do you smack them just give them a one point give them a taste of the back of
 the hand at one point i was like you know i offer to
 make a breakfast whatever and they're like oh do we have it you know do we
 have waffles and look i was like no we're out of waffles
 and my youngest goes well that sucks and i i didn't go like hey time out
 let's hold up that was an extreme thing to say
 when i was a kid you guys throw it out like it's nothing
 and when you directed at me it's very jarring and it makes me really angry
 sorry i'm making you breakfast sorry your spoiled ass has done up waffles
 today mother right but uh yeah so my kids say
 sucks like no problem i hear other kids say it
 so i guess it's just okay to say sucks maybe maybe um
 i definitely have a memory of me saying something sucks to my dad
 and him stopping and just just looking at me and saying something along the
 lines of sucks what go ahead what does it
 suck
 you're like it was definitely something along those lines was like i put point
 taking titties dad titty
 uh yeah sucks saying something blows definitely couldn't say shut up
 although you can't you still can't say shut up
 my kids now just say shut up um we got in trouble when we were little for
 stupid if we if we called somebody stupid we got in trouble for that
 i remember really getting in trouble
 uh the first the first time i thought i had to like get caught cursing and had
 to confess to my dad i said up yours
 which i don't even think people understand
 i don't even think that's like even on the radar as an insult anymore
 that was huge i i said up your nose with a rubber hose
 paul mattingly is here paul mattingly everybody
 paul mattingly everyone paul mattingly hey guys
 well paul you're late so up yours buddy oh boy
 now i'm getting it now i'm getting it nose with a rubber hose
 you know what it's absolutely fair the boys told me we adjusted for the time
 i wrote it on my calendar uh for some reason this morning i woke up
 and i go oh yeah two o'clock podcast do do do do do
 fart fart fart just tootling around that was part of it
 okay the other part was i'm doing my morning business
 getting ready to take a shower uh-huh and i'm scrolling on my phone
 and what to my wondering eyes should appear
 but the local toy shop going out of business sale
 oh no yes oh we never had everything we never had everything must go
 the fact that he came back is just uh i'm honestly surprised he's here now
 i know no no i would tell it's only 10 minutes away from my house
 so uh i was down there it was basically the bad signal went to the sky
 yeah yeah i had no choice i answered the siren call
 and went to the toy store and just was zombieing out for an hour
 just oh what can i get you know i got i got a couple good little little
 trinkets nothing too crazy and go too crazy too crazy local toy
 stores also go get a business so pour one out yeah
 no this was uh this place this place is called toy land
 if anyone has ever thought paul isn't that selective with his rage
 okay no i this place is uh okay you guys have you guys don't have
 you guys don't have ollies on that side of the world all this
 was ollies so ollies for the us east coasters
 is this discount chain that's sort of like big lots was in its heyday
 i'm from the east coast so is it like a newer east coast thing i think so
 yeah okay so uh you remember big lots when it first popped off
 yeah you could get some really amazing as a kid
 you could get some amazing deals you could take five bucks down there
 and come home with something significant yeah you know
 oh yeah yeah so ollies does this they get warehouses full of
 old toys and things and put them at pretty deep discount and
 sometimes they you know clearance them out even there
 what this toy store toy land was doing was clearing out the best of ollies
 sales oh bringing them to their store and repricing them
 above and right at msrp or higher so i was kind of like well this isn't a
 business plan that can work i mean there you go so their business
 plan was take things out of the bargain bin
 mark them up and then try to resell them yes
 that's already called ebay i know i don't know why it's basically like an
 ebay but but not as many good items
 now occasionally i found some deals at the when stores start doing corporate
 dumpster diving uh things are bad all over things are
 bad all over and i hate to see a small business go under
 but i also know that they are straight up just resellers
 and they put everything at a price that no one could deal with
 and they were doing big time pokemon scalping as well
 so i'm just like man do you think it's possible that they're just faking the
 out of business sale and they're just going to be one of those stores that's
 perpetually going out of business that's just their new thing
 no uh i the owner was there and i heard you guys are listening to the last
 episode of matt and madely's oh shit see this is how it goes
 now the owners the owners were there and they were talking about
 the next chapter or whatever so clearly they've got some other scheme up their
 11 is the next chapter chapter 11 you're right
 you're right uh that's yeah there's two locations in the pittsburgh area that
 are going under uh wait again it it uh makes me sad
 but uh you know not that sad because it was a dumb model
 and i would go like i'd been there like four or five times they'd only been
 open about a year and i'd been there a couple times to
 try and support them and the last time i went i just walked
 right out with nothing because i was like there ain't shit here you know it's
 just sad did you ever talk to him like did they
 properly nerd out about toy products were they no it's not like that they're
 not in it for the love he's not in it for the love he's just a scalpy
 he's a scalpy scalp this is it paul needs some heart in there
 i imagine he has i imagine he has probably
 one fixation i don't know what that might be
 most when you come back to vegas you always go to the same toy spot around
 the corner from my house yeah ralph's name right well ralph's
 is the comic book shop okay oh right right and then and then
 ralph's just happened to have a new toy store
 rogue toys built a place right in that same slot
 that's a total nerd cave now man it's got rogue toys
 it's got that uh smashing grounds rogue toys has always been in that uh in
 that ballpark though they they've always like when they were downtown and
 everything they were always that like real nerdy
 spot like yeah no rogue toys is great i had
 wonderful i always i always knew that if paul got a divorce
 and then got remarried i could go get his remarried gift
 at that rogue toys you could you could buy
 half my collection i sold nearly four thousand dollars worth of toys to them
 and oh and that was at a loss for me so you know uh when i was moving i had to
 get rid of so much stuff but they were cool about it
 the only thing that really bugged me is i went back in and i'd sold them some of
 my uh mega blocks turtle stuff and i
 i let go of a piece that i came back and i was like what are you charging for
 that that i gave you for ten dollars jesus
 so yeah there were there were one or two things i was like go back and look again
 well i mean well that was the thing i went back and i was like oh look
 it's my entire collection on display uh that's what sj will do sj will do that
 when we go to concerts she'll like we'll be in our spot and then
 she'll i'll see her on her phone and then she'll be like hey what
 what did we pay for these tickets again i think we could have gotten cheaper
 no i mean what are you doing hey look no regrets you gotta
 if you're a collector you know collections come and go
 that's what it is you know it's it's just uh and i've i've been
 so fortunate to build back so much cool stuff here
 in the new space and i don't know i showed you guys last week last time
 the amazing uh uh enterprise that i just got which was you know alazlo i showed
 them the video uh of the enterprise that i've set up
 it's just it's a gorgeous so i've got i've got more
 collectibles and i know what to do with it's lovely you know it's just fun
 spending time so i apologize that uh my forgetful brain and my
 blindness in toys uh led me to be a half hour late so
 uh we all assumed you were dead and uh that's the right assumption to make
 you know and then we started a podcast anyway
 there will be a a wellness check at your door just the police will come knocking

 uh si one es biblioteca sure great
 one s biblioteca in the chat
 biblioteca looking motherfucker
 biblioteca looking ass you stack of books
 i'll knock you over like a stack of books i'll take you out like a stack of
 books fucking wand always looking like a
 biblioteca new fucking and rice collection looking son of a bitch
 you know in steven king novel section and then in the biblioteca
 looking so do we decimal have an asshole
 you card catalog located motherfucker
 do they even have card catalogs at the library more
 yes i don't know sure because we've all been to the library recently
 um i have why i was late to the podcast i have
 everything was 50 off i think i take i take my kids to the library but we
 rarely we don't usually use the dewey decimal system over there
 no i guess most of it's all been transferred to
 computer but i wonder if they ever i guess did they
 i know there's no reason to keep all that data i guess on cards
 uh i wonder what the i should look online i'm just asking questions into the
 fucking void but what can you consider a good repurposing
 of those dewey decimal card holders all those huge those huge like very
 specifically sized drawers well what would you imagine would be a good
 second use for those spice rack comes to mind a very large
 spice rack i mean for a for like a for like an industrial kitchen
 i don't i mean that's a lot of spices it would take up a lot it does take up a
 lot of space gun rack could you fit a rifle in some of
 those long boxes probably oh be kind of cool to just pull out a
 shelf of guns i've got it i've got it what do you got
 don't even move them out of the library turn them into beehives
 in the library just in the library beehives an apiary i mean they would
 work as hives i suppose yep no no i think that i figured it out
 canada library crystals saying business cards
 uh ravi saying storage of chinese medicine yeah that's how i think uh
 rhino penises would slide in there pretty good
 um well once you dehydrate them of course j i wasn't talking about non
 dehydrated rhino penises those are what you're always talking
 about hydrated rhino penises paul
 you won't shut up about hydrated rhino penis
 just because it was my band in college you'll have that one single we did have
 that one single it was good the shirt was the thing that
 kept us going we had a really cool shirt for hydrated rhino penis
 oh yeah yeah what was the three-dimensional aspect of it that i
 think people really appreciate it people liked it it was made of that
 remember that puffy paint that was such a rage back in the late 80s
 it was all puffy paint puffy paint shirts were terrible
 puffy paint dehydrate or hydrated rhino penis shirts
 were all the rage at my school
 modern day apothecary tables yeah that could be cool
 oh my god they could store pokemon and magic cards holy shit
 that'd be an awesome way to store your pokemon and magic
 card i like all these suggestions like we have a giant card catalog what could
 we repurpose this as oh a card holder i know i know it's dumb but it would work
 exactly right exactly okay all right yeah you're right
 all right what else what other thing could you do
 that i already said beehive already got the right answer what about
 a bunch of weird long ways aquariums
 but that would have to be just fish that like living in the dark most of the time
 or or he left the drawer oh eels eels that don't want to turn around
 drawers of eels and snakes that don't want to turn around
 eels that hate turning around
 oh my god oh it would be great for organizing lego
 yes would be awesome for that i keep waiting for paul to move on to
 anything else but he just keeps listing off things that people are saying that
 you can do with a card catalog i think it's a great topic we're not
 talking about enough because think about the thousands of
 libraries that are out in the country right now
 and think about the disused uh-huh dewy decimal card catalog holders
 i mean it's our universities those probably took up a room
 sure right sure and did this is the problem we need to be dealing with are
 we just destroying this furniture are we just throwing these out is that
 what's happening no they repurposed it a very long
 aquarium repurpose recycle reuse into very long aquariums for eels that
 don't need to turn right yeah or we could you need directional
 eels we could put uh beta fish they don't move around very much
 or is that just because people are cool to them the who kind of fish
 the alpha fish uh alpha fish don't don't aren't that's not real
 that the guy who wrote about the alpha fish regrets his paper about the alpha
 yeah but you got that whole gig you you got that whole gig teaching alpha fish
 how to talk to people i did i did but i misconstrued it and i
 thought it was part of the whole alphabet i thought it was a alphabet fish
 but you do love a bit i do yeah don't get me started omega fish
 the alpha fish oh mega oh mega me
 oh i can't believe i'm gonna move on from this but let's do some scoop mail
 message for you son you you can move on all you want i am continuing to come up
 with repurposing ideas for disused card catalogs
 and i'm continuing to use greek letters with aquatic animals
 next up zy dolphins
 zy dolphin sounds like a fucking new medicine for ed
 i would like to introduce everyone to this my epsilon seahorse
 i was like uh i got targeted on instagram for
 like basically like don't get the wrong ed meds if you have to pee urgently
 after you have an orgasm do you like do you sprint to the toilet after
 after you have an orgasm there must be there's a greater
 there's a greater scientific uh uh area of concern uh going on
 and i was like wait wait isn't that isn't that the whole thing you orgasm and
 then pee like that's the whole thing it's like
 it's that's your doctor paul that's your doctor it's just one continuous stream
 right you just wait for you for you guys orgasm
 and peeing is different
 wait what's happening the ad is like why is the world spinning
 do you think you're into golden showers you're not
 you have a scientific health issue that needs addressing
 oh no boy oh boy that the the amount of treatment for that shit
 i mean i guess it's whatever well no i know for me i was like wait i'm not
 i'm not even at step one of this medical thing yet so like why are we
 how did i end up how did you get on that targeting on the long end of the arc of
 that yeah that is that is very specific
 like yeah do you find yeah have you experienced slight green
 discoloration in your balls after ejaculating using this
 medication you might be using the wrong stuff
 you have food coloring you have food coloring you've been eating green eggs
 and ham we got an email from scoopy ramon
 hey gentleman of the churn and possible guest
 nope uh through a series of random mental connections not worth detailing
 here i recently found myself regaling someone
 with a story of enthusiasm over experience from my past
 it made me think that one or all of you might have a story that fits this
 category okay most of my most of my stories are
 enthusiasm over experience wait a minute are we are we insinuating
 that our enthusiasm outpaces our experience
 well when you when we say i love boobies what does that sound like does it sound
 like we have experience or does it sound like we're just enthusiastic
 enthusiastic yeah i mean we are enthusiastic
 in that respect my enthusiasm far outpaces my experience there you go
 so here's my example of enthusiasm versus experience in high school
 i first caught the acting bug by doing the school plays a friend of mine i'll
 call him chuck because that was his name had played an extra as a freshman and
 had told me repeatedly about how much fun it was and how many girls were in the
 school plays one of those two things convinced me
 to audition fast forward a bit and chuck and i are
 now both extras in the next school play the play was the crucible and as
 freshmen we were both relegated to extras in a
 scene where two or three other characters are talking
 chuck and i were to play jail guards or something but they were of course
 non-speaking parts but shouldn't we do be doing something
 dumbass attention starve 16 year old me asked that exact question
 fine just don't steal focus was the reply and thus in the production of the
 crucible in my high school there were two puritanical jail
 guards who so fervently believed that the rest of the world
 was too chill about armageddon and stuff to stay in england
 did their best to not make any noise as they shot dice in the background of the
 salem witch trials also i can't tell if it makes it better
 or worse that we uh all my calls check up i'm doing
 scoop mail there you go sorry i can't tell if it makes it better or
 worse than we fashioned our own dice out of play from the art room
 so that they would be period in hopes that the director would let us do more
 in the play that is way worse definitely worse but
 definitely hilarious that is hilarious period dice
 and there's no way no way those dice rolled true
 right so they could have rigged some kind of gambling scheme
 because they certainly always rolled you know six or something like you know
 right there's no way they built great evenly weight distributed clay dice
 probably you uh you guys want to get into my dice game here i got a i got a
 dice game going on over here i got a special homemade dice i just got to sell
 them hard on the whole you gotta sell them hard on the
 crucible thing and that these are you know era appropriate gambling
 that's right once once they pre-script me for a craftsman we could take them for
 all the money we have you remember how back in back in the
 day it was all dice in the alleys down those
 puritan streets that's why they were
 anyway ever get it over your head on something with enthusiasm
 for something that now you have some more experience and it was an obvious
 rookie mistake much love f-y-i-t-f-y-d-a-t-f-o-w-i-a-t-f
 that's scoopy ramone thank you scoopy ramone
 thank you and i appreciate this on a deep level
 uh i had this experience when i was in kindergarten
 and was in a school play and i was an elf
 sneaking onto the stage backing up and i was to bump into santa claus and be
 surprised and i insisted i insisted that i hold
 a toy and then drop it in surprise and shock
 i was like how about i tell you i was i was giving i gave myself business
 i was like how about i take a toy and i and i well
 when i bump into santa oh that's good that's good i dropped the toy
 and they were like fine whatever you know and i did i was obnoxious and i was
 you know 18 19 is my freshman year and only year
 of college um we did rosa krenz and gilbert also your senior year
 is it yeah uh we did rosa krenz and gilbert are dead
 yeah and i got cast as just polonius right it was just really
 in that show like not you know in hamlet and vital character but still like a
 you know like a a tertiary role kind of thing and
 rosa gilbert are dead i really just came in to illustrate that what's happening
 throughout hamlet right and i did so much business
 and i tried to get so much laughs for being like a baddie old man like i
 was obnoxious looking back i'm like so ashamed
 like if i if i were me now in a play with me then i would be like
 can you chill the fuck out and play your part can you just
 accept that you didn't get cast as rosen krenzer gilbert's turn
 can you just move on uh you know it was uh it was it was it was
 obnoxious i i got to bust out
 during my mad donnelly has a question that's correct that's exactly
 that's exactly the level it was at during my college freshman year i got to
 play roland maul in present laughter and i that character is just
 annoying and crazy and so i just got to go
 ballistic as a young ham and it was fucking glorious and i killed it it was
 it was really really really fun but then also i was like well
 fuck i that i was in a main production with all the graduate
 students i think i'm done here oh boy i was like i don't know
 seriously i got like third from the top billing like what the fuck
 what else what else is going on it's six more years to do this again
 no thanks i'm fucking out of here i really that was really one of those
 things i took away from that experience was like oh okay
 i can go do other stuff now
 and he did i sure did indeed go do other stuff and still is doing
 other stuff and unless he's died between the recording
 of publishing of this episode you never know
 and i'm still doing uh the uh more enthusiasm than experience
 when i got to do the the warm-up gig for p&t yeah exactly
 that was ridiculously crazy but it worked out worked out real good
 but that i was just very lucky right place right time
 and boy oh boy was that guy previous to me just tanking it
 i mean yeah you initially had like a different job right or whatever
 were you there when he got fired or yeah i was there as pen stand in
 yeah i was doing i was doing right yeah you were doing standing work yeah i was
 doing standing work and then i kept doing standing work and the warm-up
 right for that season that was wild that was a lot of work yeah it's fun
 though i think every job i've ever taken was
 definitely taken with enthusiasm over experience
 yeah yeah i mean at least up until i was
 35 right uh including including when matt called me and said you want to do a
 podcast i mean i would say that would definitely
 be enthusiasm over experience for all three of us
 except for me paul that well yeah i mean well but not not really
 i don't i don't have any experience i i had experience talking into a
 microphone that's about it oh i don't i still don't know diddly
 squad about putting together a podcast properly
 not true i mean i know a little bit but not not a ton
 i don't get on the feeds i don't when other podcasters ask us for advice they
 are disappointed often exactly
 like i don't know record it and throw it in the ether
 yeah release the episodes on time i don't know yeah right
 yeah i can't i can't don't show up a half hour late
 i can't start off my ted talk with be friends with pen
 why not it'd be a hard one to do
 it's not easy to execute advice but it is that it is advice that can be executed
 can be can be done we got an email here from
 anonymous uh here's a what would you do story
 so we had a little what would you do action it starts when i visited
 a dance scene that i hadn't gone to in about 15 years
 i hit it off with a guy i used to know and like a scene from a film
 we danced together for most of the late night
 blues party it was romantic and incredibly hot
 when we left he carefully asked i might be reading this wrong
 but would you like to have coffee sometime uh to reassure him on several
 levels i answered yes that is the perfect thing to say
 that is much better than my suggestion which was to go to my hotel room
 and fuck whoa it's a good answer it's a solid answer
 when we met for a date i was glad to find uh we were both vaccinated atheists
 he's 15 years older than me though which put me on edge because of a bad
 experience i had with an older guy i started worrying we wouldn't be
 compatible and saw a red flag when he mentioned a right of center newspaper
 still he was kind and empathetic and the chemistry was hard to ignore
 at this point what would you do at this point
 i could continue on the day you keep on getting to know each other right
 do we know the gender of our writer we don't okay
 i feel like gay or straight if an older man came to meet you if you
 wanted to say let's let's cut through the bullshit and go fuck i feel like they
 would do it well i think the writer was was saying
 that to be funny more than more than like an actual
 suggestion right the other person the other person they had been dancing with
 said like hey you know we've been dancing we're having a good time tonight
 would you be interested in going to get a coffee
 and they're like i we i am interested in getting coffee
 i was gonna say we should go fuck but yes let's go get coffee right
 so then the question is how we feel about if they started mentioning right
 wing newspapers all right yeah like kind of just where
 we're at at this point with it i guess so there's a little bit of a little bit
 of uh stuff that they're worried about a little bit of stuff that writers
 worried about age that made the newspaper i guess um
 but still kind empathetic and had good chemistry
 so yeah uh we did our best to be respectful and with full consent
 uh that it might be a one time only thing we spent the night
 okay uh turned out he's good in bed oh and and we have a kink in common
 so i got very excited at the potential to explore this
 which would be a first for me okay shipping right that's what i'm guessing
 toesucking shrimp let's go
 over the next weeks we spoke on the phone a few times
 in an impressive backfire of complimenting me
 he said he only wants to date women at least 10 years younger
 because women his own age look old what i called him out on this casual
 sexism and he apologized guys where's the empathy
 here so next know that i'll be breaking up with you in nine years
 yeah right i said good day
 don't get comfortable universal all women age the same
 all men don't don't worry about it uh wow no problem
 i called him out of this casual sexism and he apologized
 next it came out that he voted for a political party that i don't like
 but i don't want to be an i hate people who vote
 x person finally uh like he was quoting a sound bite
 he said it's hypocritical to believe in global warming
 and still fly yep he doesn't believe in global warming come on
 i got the feeling he didn't always think before speaking
 most people wouldn't call their promising sex partner a hypocrite
 with a cell by date uh oh with a cell by date right
 and this is all just making this sex hotter yeah
 you know like oh yes for sure that's the kink the kink
 it's just oh tell me more horrible opinions
 oh yeah shut up and keep fucking me you big dummy
 go having my first peri-menopausal mood swings i crashed hard
 and ended things spell dei with your tongue on my toes
 go
 hey that sounds like a good night
 uh having my first peri-menopausal mood swings i crashed hard and ended things
 damn it i get very uncomfortable with debates and didn't attack his beliefs
 i spoke my piece he listened and it and it didn't become an argument
 he apologized properly and was shaken by how much he had upset me
 it was the most respectful breakup call i ever had
 shortly after that time three people i knew got terminal diagnoses
 and depressing political stuff was happening at a low point i asked myself
 what would i do if i only had six months left
 my reaction was i would call that guy and tell him don't say anything about
 anything let's just have some fun
 this is really hard right it is this is really hard
 because it's hard to meet anyone that you're simpatico with
 in general yeah oh that kind of hard yes that's also hard
 and then to try and navigate especially currently
 just how polarizing opinions can be sure but what how important like we've made
 everything so important when i was uh
 single i remember being an atheist like factored faster than i thought it
 would like i was certainly willing to not give a
 shit about that person being christian uh and the early dating parts yeah and it
 just it kind of it would come to a head faster than i
 than i thought it would yeah time you know yeah well that's just a
 younger generation thing i mean they don't they don't view blowjobs
 as a thing that you need to wait on as much anymore
 but it's it's true in relationships if you you know if you find out that your
 partner is prone to magical thinking then
 it opens up other doors and if you find your partner is prone to saying
 off-color possibly bigoted shit there's probably other shit behind there
 too right like that's well also i mean maybe if you
 you know i think it's i think it's hard to examine like
 male loneliness uh white male loneliness has like its own
 thing but like the truth is like this is an example like
 wherever this guy is getting his echo chamber yeah there's no such as global
 warming right you're breaking up with him sends him
 back to that space right yeah but but yeah but i don't know
 yeah but it's not and it's not your job responsibility to save yeah it's not
 woman's responsibility to save all of stupid white male america
 like i mean you know i've been i've been uh i've been out of the game guys
 uh no but uh you know whatever we're all married
 but the thing we want we want i found a woman who would save me
 the thing that i do for my single friends is you know like write down
 everything you want in a man right so in this case if you
 wanted to say awesome in bed believes in science like
 you know like like what happens is like when you write that list down it is not
 crazy to look at that list that list is not like there's no one on earth who
 could fit this bill no not at all and like and i did i did
 that before i ended up uh dating and i made my specific list of
 things i wanted in a partner and it not only does it reinforce
 what's important to you but it narrows your field of vision
 and you don't just go wild off the handle looking at people who
 it just quickly nullifies possible bad choices
 right it sharpens your head man it's it's it's what i talk about in improv all
 the time too you know the the real key to improvisation is focus
 that's it where's your focus okay and so that that's it that's it it's
 really just focus like i can teach a lot of different stuff but focus is what it
 really a lot of what it really comes down to
 and with anything decide what's important
 decide what you're truly looking for get clear about
 goals and uh things that are important to you and
 the [ __ ] falls away yeah but it's hard to keep focus
 it's that and that's especially true now and that's why we see a lot of what's
 going on within our political spectrum it is designed to destroy focus
 sure yeah yeah for sure uh i don't want to i'm gonna go back to
 other point but what you're i don't want to yeah no no no please do yeah that
 point is valid but i think so many times like our ability
 to be flexible to be giving to want to
 put things on the line to like our willingness to possibly change to help
 to bend for other folks yes uh i think you can get lost in that ship
 yes and and then and then you combine that with the sunk cost
 fallacy uh yes good example my membership massage envy
 and you suddenly and you turn and you're like wait i've been i've been in this
 shitty relationship you're like i can't get three thousand dollars with the
 massages in a month i can't do it
 and and you you think you're gonna get out of relationship you're gonna be
 embarrassed you think your friends are gonna think oh my god you put so much
 time in your friends won't care at all uh uh you know uh it's it they don't care
 about you but they won't care that that that you put more time or less time in
 they don't you you anytime you take a step towards being
 healthier your friends are going to be grateful that you're in a better space
 no matter how long it took you to do it um that's worth saying on its own also
 uh if they're your real friends right and not your frenemies and that's it
 and that goes another saying saying that goes from what we're talking about also
 you can be you should be also be more selfish about your friends
 you should be you know if you if you have a dysfunctional relationship with
 your friendship group or you feel like you're
 you know not truly like uh jive on a mute it's not truly mutual
 with your friends group you should get new friends you should try to find it uh
 any kind of hobby any kind of club any kind of meeting yeah you're right
 any kind of bar oh there he goes here we go
 you know what he can do better than us paul jacob can do better than us and
 i'm glad he's gone i i wait a minute i i looked around
 i turned out i couldn't do better that's a double edge right there
 he could do better than that's what i'm glad he's gone i actually know that i'm
 saying i know that i'm saying as a guy who
 lives in like you know an urban and suburban
 environment uh you know we have numerous scoops right us you know
 where they have basically stayed in their religion longer simply because
 they would know they'd be completely alone in their community
 sure right become atheists like i understand that this is an uphill battle
 and bigger things uh i'm only saying in your heart
 don't think that like compromise compromising all of your wants is the
 only way you know right right i think you made the
 right choice in uh put the kibosh on it because fool me once shame on me shame
 on you fool me twice shame on on me and oh wait what do you what kibosh
 is has happened here well she she broke it off
 and the writer you mean they broke it off what
 uh i haven't finished reading this email yet oh i thought i
 i thought they broke it oh shit oh no oh oh no we've just got we've gotten
 sidetracked my friends there's more email ah fuck me in the bottom
 what would i do if i only had six months left my reaction was
 i would call that guy and tell him don't say anything about anything
 let's just have some fun oh no that thought stopped me crying
 i asked myself seriously am i that shallow
 and my brain said yes oh wow you asked what i want
 and i told you if you can broker that deal i'm in
 after a cooling off period i arranged to call him we agreed that being friends
 was a disaster and i said i had heard of the concept of
 sex clubs where apparently you don't discuss politics
 how would he feel about meeting as if we were at a sex club
 he said i can be there in an hour and a half
 he added if i turn up and you decide no i'll drive home
 and i'll not sulk about it which was a helpful reassurance
 oh so this this guy definitely had uh had has
 some reassuring uh qualities to him sure this is smart
 this is yes we had a better night than the first
 at the time of writing we meet every couple of months always checking we're
 still okay with it and enjoying it while it lasts
 we've had some amazing times and he's said and done some very kind and
 thoughtful things the kink exploring is going very well
 can't believe it took me this long to buy some sex toys
 i found he's a fan of uh tim mentions poem
 uh storm and of pennanteller's bullshit so he has critical thinking awareness
 it's just well behind the times and certainly not helped by the media and
 politics that he follows maybe some of my attitudes will rub off
 on him maybe some other things will rub off on him too
 as i try to avoid generalizing or being negative
 and i really try to understand rather than judge so
 am i naive liberated morally challenged making the world a slightly happier
 place or all of the above thanks for reading fucking with the
 faces in a private sex dungeon after a good spanking
 tied with easy escape cuffs that's anonymous
 anonymous thank you so much for sharing and being so open with us
 uh that's this is a lot of fodder here um to think on go through those options
 again am i go ahead jacob am i it was it was a b c and d
 do you remember uh let's see am i let me find it here
 uh as i try to
 uh as i try to avoid generalizing and or being negative and i try
 to understand rather than judge so am i am i naive
 you want to do one at a time yes am i naive no
 i don't think so no am i liberated yes yes you're liberated yes definitely am i
 morally challenged no no don't think so making the world a
 slightly happier place yes i think so yes yes that's it no like
 yes i don't think you're naive i don't think you're morally challenged i think
 you are liberated i think you i think you are making the world a
 slightly happier place both for you and your uh companion
 yeah the like look you said you have kinks and fetishes right like that's
 that's often a very difficult conversation to to broach on in a
 regular dating environment you found someone who fits the bill
 uh you want me to put this light bulb where and they agree to
 everything right you put out everything you wanted again you just did we just
 talked about without whether we got to it
 you were like if it could be this and not that and always this and never that
 and he said yes you both intelligently made an agreement
 will that get sloppy at some points or we end up in the conversation at some
 points sure sure but that happens in every relationship
 no matter what you're doing anyway so like what you did do was actually you
 literally came up with your most selfish list for this person to still be in your
 life and this person said they'd happily
 fit those parameters that's awesome you laid it out this person accepted
 and it seems like it's going okay because now you might meet another guy
 who's also dynamo in the boudoir and uh and and then decide i don't need
 to meet this uh this this right winger for for private
 sex anymore that might happen but you you've actually
 allowed yourself to leave that door properly open
 right right if you were dysfunctionally dating this person and you were going to
 meet someone and be like oh but i'm dating someone oh but it might get messy
 now you now you're fucked up right but you you have the exact sexual
 relationship you want with this person you want to use this person he
 says use me uh you're in that spot you've
 appropriately set expectations yes and now you if you would now encounter
 someone you could have a more fulfilling relationship with
 you'd be able to move on to that thing no problem
 right now i think this is a nice thing i think this is a nice thing anonymous
