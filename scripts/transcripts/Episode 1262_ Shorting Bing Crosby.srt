33
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,560
 standard bottle of cologne 20 bucks well I spent I spent almost nine for my

34
00:02:51,560 --> 00:03:04,040
 generic I'm ahead of you on this one what we have done is we have ordered

35
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:14,440
 ambergris in bulk and we're gonna do a DIY cologne kit in our backyard because

36
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,520
 it's cheaper to just order the whole whale eat the meat and get the ambergris

37
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,800
 out then to just buy the ambergris separately and plus that gives you oil

38
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,320
 for your your whale oil right if you like the home if you like the meat you

39
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,480
 might as well just buy the whole whale that's it why fuck the ambergris when I

40
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,520
 can fuck the whale for free wait is that how how does it go that's not an

41
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:44,200
 expression anywhere but yeah no I'm making in my new expression why smell

42
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:53,600
 the ambergris when I can fuck the whale for free there you go there you go yeah

43
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,800
 we're gonna put a bunch of vats in the backyard but like you know bourbon in

44
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,880

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,600
 make him smell more mature yeah smell like he just worked out I figured

58
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,160
 that's the way to get the ladies is like he wouldn't be wearing muscle cream

59
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,720

88
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,320
 much as a day we can do this the whole pod but I think you can continually find

89
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,320
 things that are too expensive in the perfume world if you keep searching the

90
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,960
 internet I didn't search very hard and it already gave me a lot just thought

00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,000

103
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,760
 I've had a couple of clips go maybe virals too strong of a word but my most

104
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:50,840
 popular clips clips I've taken off I get stats right and so these these one a

105
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,320
 couple of clips do well a couple comes do well and also I get stats that say

106
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,420
 you know 75% of people watching and commenting are not your followers right

107
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,280
 that's like a sign that's a sign that's what you want right right yeah external

108
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,040
 engagement and it's one where I'm handling a dickhead it's just two videos

109
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,400
 part one and part two I'm handling some dick at one of my shows this is the

110
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,920
 state of the world man all people want is crowd work and I and it's funny

111
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,600
 because when things go popular means I'm gonna get criticized right so there's a

112
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,880
 lot of like you're thin-skinned you're a terrible person that guy's making

113
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:45,760
 reasonable requests to a show that guy went to a show and then during the show

114
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,320
 opened his mouth and just had a conversation with the person on stage

115
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,200
 about what he wasn't doing these are the people who are on their phones the

116
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,140
 entire time that a movie is happening and we'll do some backstory I'm at

117
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:04,600
 Mystique dining and Folsom when with that clip right and they just have like

118
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,520
 a security camera and if you know basically for like liability purposes

119
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:16,000
 like his a magician loses it which I came close to so that's not my camera

120
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:27,840
 that's just the the don't get sued camera at Mystique dining so a couple

121
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,800
 things he's one in the first clip he's lecturing me about how he saw some other

122
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,040
 magician and he went to bed that night he figured out the card trick and he

123
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,960
 won't let me move on my show unless he tells me the story and Mystique dining

124
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:44,200
 is a parlor environment right so it's me at a table surrounded by 24 people in a

125
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,980
 room right and I perform at the is that a stage where the front row is 30 feet

126
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:53,040
 away so when you when you told me the story yeah there was more to the story

127
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,280
 than I went to bed and figured it out in my sleep there is more to the story in

128
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,840
 that like okay so what happens is I start going I said the first joke is like

129
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,160
 and no one cares right and it gets this it gets this big laugh from the audience

130
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,920
 and the reason why it's because the way Mystique dining works is you you go

131
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,600
 there and you have this opulent beautiful meal with everybody in the room

132
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,920
 before the magician comes out the magician is the last 45 minutes of the

133
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,120
 of the experience right so this gentleman had been the mayor of dinner

134
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,680
 yes so when he told me that story it was probably the fourth time the audience

135
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:35,320
 was hearing that oh my god and I'm hanging out right I'm back I'm on the

136
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,800
 backstage area waiting for the things so I know this I've already been told this

137
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,720
 guy keeps telling the story about how he figured out a magic trick and he won't

138
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,240
 stop telling people he told the he told the one waiter told the other waiter he

139
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,320
 told Steve the the emcee and Booker Steve Branham who runs the room told him

140
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:59,480
 and then interrupted my show while I was trying to start a card trick to do it

141
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:07,760
 and so it just been blitzing people the story the whole time so when I start

142
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:13,280
 laying in him I it's getting these huge laughs because they've freaking hurt it

143
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,600
 they're done with it yeah they're done with it now it's weird to have this clip

144
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:25,600
 take off for me personally like I I mean he's an old guy right it's like I am

145
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,800
 picking on an old guy right like I do feel bad like he's not he's not being an

146
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:38,200
 egregious drunk heckler you know he's just make himself mayor of the room yeah

147
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,760
 right and then the second clip is when I start to get into my card trick he

148
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,040
 starts busting my balls for not having a sealed deck to start off the thing with

149
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,840
 okay and some other magicians have chimed in going like it's a reasonable

150
00:14:52,840 --> 00:15:01,840
 request that is magician bullshit magician to magician abuse and you don't

151
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:10,840
 have to take it man man there's oh oh I feel you brother I feel you that is that

152
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:16,760
 is a nonsensical that is awful this business too long bullshit magician

153
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:22,200
 responses I've been performing for other magicians too long also is the only

154
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,580
 people that that would be reasonable from is another magician at like a magic

155
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,680
 conference or something like that or in a fool us type setup where they're doing

156
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,320
 any of that bullshit because what you're doing isn't doing you're not teaching

157
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,320
 people how to do fucking card tricks you're doing a show but not even that

158
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:42,840
 it's one of those things that speaks to ignorance because any magician worth

159
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,400
 their salt knows that sealed or not it doesn't really matter yes you can gimmick

160
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:53,800
 a deck to be sealed yes sealed it's an ignorant comment it comes from a place

161
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,840
 of ignorance and trying to be ignorant it's trying to wind up it's trying to

162
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,380
 want it one up no I don't even mad at some I dealt with some similar shit at

163
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:06,520
 the guy who disrupted the show I'm really angrier at the magicians who are

164
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:15,520
 defending I don't know in a in an improv way recently and it got me it sent me to

165
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:21,040
 11 immediately I'm just like shut your teaching no no no no no discussing

166
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:28,400
 discussing intros of all things oh and I was just like shut the fuck up you are

167
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,800
 you are just talking shit to talk shit now yes yeah it's just like the like

168
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,480
 devil's advocating on the fly to make it seem like you're being smart apps of

169
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:46,200
 fucking giving giving an exam oh my god my dogs are going crazy yeah no I was

170
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,400
 just I was talking about it too they're angry no no I want to I want to hear

171
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:55,840
 your opinion on this Matt so I was just talking about introing and one of these

172
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:01,880
 simplify an intro because we had previously done an interview and the

173
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:08,560
 interview got really dark and so at the end I grabbed your line which the this

174
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,880
 is all intended to be comedic in nature yeah yeah to get us out of that death

175
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,760
 spiral yeah and we and we were fine but I said hey in light of the fact that I

176
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,600
 don't think anyone has any fun stories to tell right now about their day-to-day

177
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:28,880
 yeah why don't we just go with song titles or rather song lyrics for a git

178
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,960
 right yeah and and I was describing the thing and this is the way I put it I was

179
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,600
 like so we'll get a song you know we'll get a lyric and I want you guys to just

180
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,600
 think about a lyric that you're gonna call out don't you know really pondered

181
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,160
 think about something that actually means something to you don't just shout

182
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,720
 out who let the dogs out just give me a lyric and you know what as a matter of

183
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,000
 fact give me a couple give me like two or three and I'll pick my favorite one

184
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:59,240
 let's see what we do and I got oh you don't want to be fishing yeah wait yeah

185
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:06,840
 someone is accusing you of trying to cherry-pick the most immediate just in

186
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,880
 the description of how we could do how we could do it not in doing it just in

187
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,920
 the description of saying hey no just give me three I'll pick my favorite and

188
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:20,800
 was saying oh we don't want to be fishing I'm like you are so wrong on

189
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:29,160
 this you couldn't be more wrong I know that that's and so I kind of laughed

190
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,880
 because I was mad to the point of explosion and I was like well you know

191
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,680
 there's burning kind of - we're burning the who let the dogs out yeah that kind

192
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,920
 of thing and and you know I did I couldn't in the moment get my head back

193
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:47,060
 around but like like even Liz the great Liz Allen has articulated to me you can

194
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:53,280
 do that you can pick you know it's not like you're not I'm not you know first

195
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,000
 of all look most of the time the audience shouts out a bunch of different

196
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,920
 suggestions at the same time anyway usually exactly you heard any yes so you

197
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:05,400
 end up you end up assessing the situation anyway the idea no but the

198
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,640
 idea is that you were you were disparaged that's what happened and it

199
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,280
 precisely and it made you so angry in the moment you couldn't get your words

200
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,720
 back around on you and I get that completely yeah but the idea that

201
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,480
 someone would use you of like you're literally trying to like you he

202
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,840
 literally just like made you into some kind of cheap cheaper artists some sort

203
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,320
 of hack yeah yeah meanwhile you're actually like trying to spread a wide

204
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:37,160
 net yeah that that would drive me crazy yeah I needed I needed some validation

205
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:44,280
 from a fellow it's not a quiz it's not it's not a test it's not like let's see who the

206
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:49,200
 best improper is by seeing who can tell suggestions the fact is it not and do

207
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,080
 this is a goddamn show no shit dude well that's that the ultimate the

208
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,120
 entertaining the that's the ultimate thing is like okay let's go around all

209
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,480
 this loop-de-loop and then the end of the day you're gonna you're gonna show

210
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,640
 me something on stage worth a fucking right it reminds me the time the

211
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,880
 emphasis brigade was on Conan O'Brien early days right so so they were on the

212
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:19,520
 the core for including Amy or Amy Poehler were on the stage and they go

213
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,960
 like Conan brought us out there cuz he you know we really love improv and I got

214
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,760
 hooked into this I was like oh they're gonna let them do improv on Conan like

215
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,640
 this is awesome and they go like oh can we just have like you know a setting or

216
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,400
 whatever and they're like oh the Swiss mountains they're like oh and then can

217
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,120
 we have like a character from fix you know history like Buddha and like oh

218
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,560
 and then we have like you know whatever something you might get it's like it's

219
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,960
 like cakes or whatever and like okay we take you to a mountain where Buddha is

220
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,320
 having a birthday cake and they make like noise in the curtain raises up they

221
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,720
 have a perfect set of the perfect set just made exactly for that thing right

222
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,800
 exactly so the idea like so this is you're like you're like oh wait let me

223
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:03,280
 see if I can get it close to my my right yeah yeah yeah I'm really hanging on to

224
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,620
 ain't no holla back girl soon as I get no holla back girl then I can strike

225
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:13,520
 because I've got a great I've got a great Gwen Stefani in the pocket like

226
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,080
 what the fuck I came here to do a Gwen Stefani impression and I'm not leaving

227
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,200
 until I do it it just made no fucking sense to me I'm just like you want to

228
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,320
 see what you're finishing what environment was this where were you I've already said

229
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:37,880
 okay okay it's a weird that's a weird one yeah so I should just say like more

230
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,740
 more on the the clip because I told everybody in the zoom there was more to

231
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:49,880
 it the clip goes on I do get it I do get a sealed deck so like right part of part

232
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:56,640
 of the things that I'm like grappling with as I take on the dumb internet

233
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:03,400
 comments is I think I'm being funny the whole time I know I'm I know that I'm

234
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,160
 I'm being upset but I think I'm being upset in an amusing way if I thought I

235
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,800
 was being upset in a way that wasn't amusing I would have stopped I would

236
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:17,080
 stop and that's the hardest thing to convey right like like if you look at

237
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,380
 the who dat goat episode that we did with the with the guys right if you go

238
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:27,800
 back and listen that episode on our feed I am the butt of that episode and I tee

239
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,360
 myself up for it numerous times you you open that door over and over again yeah

240
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:37,760
 but it's what the show needed right so I'm purpose and you served it yeah I do

241
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,040
 it right so a couple people came up to me and they're like hey man that was

242
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,280
 really tough up there I go what no that was exactly everything went exactly the

243
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,560
 way we wanted you know I'm addressing Robert Young shooting people like no you

244
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,680
 don't know what's going to go away stop talking to him like no I did what was

245
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,760
 supposed to be done in the show right I'm very happy and so it's very hard to

246
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:04,600
 convey that like I am taking the piss out of the guy I think he knows it a

247
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,640
 little bit I know it and the audience is going with it and so I thought the

248
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,040
 odds would go with it on the internet as well and for the most part they have

249
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:18,440
 right I'm pointing out the the few dicks but I will say what my social media team

250
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:23,320
 edited out what's me finally opening up a sealed deck which probably took forever

251
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,560
 because that's another thing about the that's the other joke about like why

252
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,440
 are you using a sealed deck the primary reason is that it is a pain in the ass

253
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:35,280
 open a fucking back of cards and I used to open sealed decks for my tricks and it

254
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,320
 would sometimes take forever and deal with the cellophane yes you got to deal

255
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,480
 with cracking the box yeah then you got to dispose how many just that cellophane

256
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,240
 the two tops and the two bottoms you have the two jokers on the bottom and the

257
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,280
 two cards on the top instruction cards yeah and then you got to shuffle them and

258
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,200
 else other stuff right and so I do I do I do oftentimes skip ago here's here's

259
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,680
 the deck I've been using from last night look they're all shuffled and I have the

260
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,920
 person look at them and I give them a quick shuffle or they can give a quick

261
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,040
 shuffle and it's just for time it's just for time yeah it's just but also

262
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:10,680
 if you look and you see that it's a real deck and if you're handing it to other

263
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:15,480
 people that's it's 99% of the time that's gonna be just a deck you're not

264
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,040
 gonna hand a gimmick deck to a person right there are tricks I do where I

265
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:29,640
 don't have the deck sealed but if they if they're looking at the deck and

266
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,320
 they're able to shuffle that deck and hand it back to you that is better than

267
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:40,360
 an un-freshly unsealed deck that is as clusterfucky as you can get mathematically

268
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,560
 right so it's so it's edited out as I finally get all the cards out and do

269
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,160
 whatever and I put the cellophane and the advertising cards and the stuff

270
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:52,080
 right in front of his face okay I go here I'm gonna shuffle while you inspect

271
00:24:52,080 --> 00:25:06,320
 this garbage I actually thought it was fun for the eyes to actually be annoyed

272
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,320
 but then follow through on all of his demands right so like I did I did I

273
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,720
 actually did yes and him and do my card trick under test conditions but that's

274
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,880
 not social media right so so that's the hard part is so I'm getting accused of

275
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,760
 like not playing fair with the guy and you're like no I actually if you saw the

276
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,520
 whole thing you did another guy goes I don't get it every every clip I see you

277
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:36,440
 and you're just some thin-skinned guy losing it and I was like that means you

278
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,000
 just saw two clips yes because my other clips don't show that my other clip

279
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:57,360
 don't have it at all so I was like all right Jesus it's called a brand so yeah

280
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,960
 I got the report like I have a tick-tock page I don't even look at that my social

281
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,720
 runs entirely goes that clip killed on tick-tock and I was like oh man this is

282
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:13,240
 not it's always the stuff you don't expect though right I know no I mean I

283
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,960
 put that up there thinking it was gonna be something I when I said the because

284
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,520
 like I said it's a security camp footage so I said right I said this is this is

285
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:25,440
 bad this bad quality but I think this will play and so I was actually right in

286
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:37,140
 that yeah I'll tell you else only wants to see seal dicks today's show Matt and

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:45,840
 tiktok and that'll be great as soon as tiktok starts to monetize I would tell

303
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,280
 you also the weird thing about it is because I've had some of those clips do

304
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:53,560
 well but they've not gained me followers this one's gaining me a bunch of

305
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:59,720
 followers which is a weird which is a weird moment as well and I can't chase

306
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:09,640
 this right you can't go like after oh I should start busting everyone's balls

307
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:15,080
 then you will just be a thin-skinned magician like we're gonna experiment with

308
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,600
 this company with our podcast right we're gonna give them a little month run

309
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:24,120
 and see what they do it and they asked me they're like is your brand on ice

310
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,800
 cream social like like similar to your brand as a magician like do they

311
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:39,120
 compliment each other and I said oh not at all no no I'm a relatively clean

312
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,920
 magician and I am absolutely filthy on this show so no it does not not exactly

313
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:50,680
 brand synergy now I started off as a magician I was filthy when I started

314
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:56,480
 there so originally it did it did compliment each other right right but I

315
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,000
 don't I was remembering that I used to ask for a borrowed iPhone by asking for

316
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,600
 a hand jobs machine right yes for the hands jobs machine I asked for the hand

317
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,360
 jobs machine I still haven't donated my Halloween candy I got to look for a

318
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:19,720
 place to do that still I got 20 pounds of candy download just send it with a

319
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:27,560
 Sarah to work she'll bring to work it'll be gone in 20 minutes European

320
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,440
 acrobats will eat the shit out of that candy we already got we already got snow

321
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,820
 up here oh no yeah yeah yeah we already got snow and it actually stuck to the

322
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:43,800
 ground so I'm very concerned about what's coming this winter yeah yeah yeah

323
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:51,440
 but I'm also pleased to say that my Christmas decorations went up at a very

324
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,040
 timely time because half the neighborhood is up and cooking now a week

325
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:00,720
 after I put my stuff up so it's it's all good you're a trendsetter buddy I was I

326
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,640
 was speaking of our regional news Jacob are you excited that the shuck era has

327
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:16,480
 begun down in New Orleans what's happening so is this a is this a ball

328
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,480
 player of some kind yes let me say some my kids are suddenly into football

329
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,200
 enough that they're curious about watching it when I watch it okay but part

330
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:35,760
 of was we were sitting around two quarterbacks came up one was Michael

331
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:45,600
 from Atlanta my kids literally were like does that say Phoenix and they were

332
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,520
 hysterical that someone's playing football has a robot penis called my

333
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:59,780
 called the Phoenix and we just made robot penis jokes if the Atlanta Falcons

334
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:04,880
 were smarter they would follow your lead oh yeah and then then there was the

335
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:12,680
 beginning of the Tyler shuck era in New Orleans and which my kids are really

336
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:17,600
 loving being part of the shuck era they don't give a shuck they're part of the

337
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,920
 mother shuckers they're ready to rock isn't his name pronounced show is that

338
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:29,720
 true I don't think it I don't think you say the C at all in his name oh I have

339
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,600
 only listened to anyone pronounce it Chuck is it pronounced is it

340
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:40,280
 mispronounced I thought it was Tyler show I don't know okay I just as easily

341
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:47,900
 be the person wrong here is it Patrick wah is that right yeah there's some new

342
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:52,680
 ones too there's a new rise out there are there more was there are there's one

343
00:32:52,680 --> 00:33:01,320
 who plays for Vegas now yeah but yeah no that's that's great and to answer the

344
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,760
 question you're really asking I can't get behind the New Orleans Saints this

345
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:12,120
 year at all they're just so bad I get I mean we're on we're on our own text

346
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,960
 message shades and everything so Matt sees that I get genuinely aggravated

347
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,640
 when New Orleans wins the game what are you guys doing we want the draft pick

348
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:28,920
 yeah stop it yeah are you guys sincere feelings now that the FBI has come out

349
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:35,040
 and said that all of all of organized sports is a psyop is there I guess you

350
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:41,100
 haven't really lost interest it hasn't changed my view on it in any way okay

351
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,800
 because there's not a single part of what they're saying that I'm surprised

352
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:50,920
 about right I don't know what you're talking about Paul oh that's a just you

353
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:58,060
 know the the corruption of bedding throughout all the coincides with the

354
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:02,200
 fact that like games are fixed and rigged and yeah fixed by the Mafia

355
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:07,080
 leaning in on on individual players so it's scarier than it being rigged like

356
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:11,800
 ha ha ha they wrote a book of football or something like oh it's scarier yeah

357
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:19,280
 but it's yeah but it's funny so what's crazy to me is specifically the

358
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:27,360
 pitchers indicted for throwing a first pitch ball on purpose right because that

359
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:31,240
 I know it sounds strange but the competitive balance of that is really

360
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,840
 funny to me because everyone's happy right so if you're betting the first

361
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:40,040
 pitch is gonna be a strike that's a really hard task for the pitcher right

362
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:45,240
 but but the batter also wants the first pitch to be a ball right and the and the

363
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,760
 other team wants the first pitch to be a ball so the idea that like I'm gonna

364
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,000
 throw a ball first the catcher is to just go like oh let me just stick my

365
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,320
 glove over here no problem like it's like the ease of everyone making money

366
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:03,080
 off of a first ball is hysterical to me it's like it was like great that's just

367
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,780
 easy and fun and for basketball and for basketball it's hysterical where people

368
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:11,840
 were betting unders mean that like I'm gonna go in and not rebound I'm not

369
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:18,060
 gonna grab a ball I like that to me is like hysterical and as you uncover the

370
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,640
 stories like these are people who are making a lot of money suddenly making

371
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:29,780
 money on like dumb bets that don't pay in the in the arena of the money that

372
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:35,200
 they're making right and so like one of the players it turns out like he just

373
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:41,520
 had never paid his taxes on his crazy NBA salary and had just a crazy ass tax

374
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:47,680
 lien that he was trying to get out of and so that's why he got into it people

375
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,920
 being roped into illegal poker games the poker game thing with like Chauncey

376
00:35:52,920 --> 00:36:00,480
 Billups and all those yes that's that's bizarre and what this one Paul no so

377
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,980
 it's literally like sports celebrities luring just other motherfuckers into

378
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:11,280
 playing poker games with them and then not playing an honest poker game yeah so

379
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,760
 so illegal poker yes I did hear about that illegal poker rooms and states that

380
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,620
 the guys gambling of the ice poker running illegal poker game so they're

381
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:22,200
 running these crazy rooms using celebrities basketball players to lure

382
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:27,520
 in people with money yeah and then using literally like microchipped cards and

383
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:33,040
 like technology I saw like right they had these glasses on and you could see

384
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:39,040
 every card like every card was clearly visible from the back like I knew what

385
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,600
 everybody had the whole time yeah it's wild and I was laughing at someone who's

386
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,960
 one of the sports podcast listen to is a big card collector and stuff he goes to

387
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,940
 card collecting conventions and he goes I mean I don't want to say nothing but I

388
00:36:52,940 --> 00:37:00,720
 was wondering why Chauncey Billups was at every one of these events why it's

389
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:06,640
 this active NBA coach and Hall of Fame basketball player finding time to go to

390
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:19,140
 every card event there he's getting paid like 50 G's each time yeah fucking job

391
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:24,320
 because coaches make the fucking donuts coaches make millions right so like the

392
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,520
 idea there's no way these card things are paying and like that's actually worth

393
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:34,840
 this time but yes they are in a way they are in a way yeah right yeah it's just

394
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:42,680
 free money that's crazy what's crazier is the argument so like what happens is

395
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:47,600
 this is this is a thing where both sides think they're totally correct right we

396
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,640
 should stop all this legalized gaming gambling on sports it's gonna mess with

397
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:55,480
 people's lives right and then the fucking degenerates that are like no no

398
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:01,160
 no by having the best out there and we and we're catching these these spikes of

399
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:06,840
 weird bets we're exposing what could be happening behind the scenes or off off

400
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:11,080
 books and smaller books other places like you want to keep it out in plain

401
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:16,000
 sight you want to get some I feel like that's a really good point I think it's

402
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,200
 a good point with all of them except for first pitch ball that's the only one

403
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:28,240
 that I'm like you just can't everyone's favor to do it like it's just everyone

404
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:34,120
 will take it it's the worst what do you think about the always go into game seven

405
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:39,520
 thing or often going to game seven thing oh I don't we've tried to rig that I

406
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,520
 don't I don't think those stuffs can be that on that level I don't think things

407
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:49,560
 can be rigged on that level I just don't that's tough I mean especially with this

408
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:54,700
 world series which was crazy great the amount of ones I went to extra innings I

409
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,400
 mean you can't say let's have one game go to 18 innings when they have to play

410
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,480
 the next day at 5 o'clock like yeah no one's no one's writing that right like

411
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,000
 no one's rigging that but the fact that three of the games that went went to

412
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,240
 extra innings I think in the World Series including including one literally

413
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,600
 literally a bonus game they literally did 18 innings they accidentally played

414
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:21,920
 yeah they doubled they played eight games so I think it's just I think it's

415
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,980
 it's just a testament to the competitiveness of you know these

416
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,880
 athletes are still athletes so they're still psychotic to be professional

417
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,080
 athlete you have to be a psycho like we have to remember right so I don't I

418
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,840
 think you'd only rig it so much football being the hardest one right like that's

419
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:43,560
 the one where like you you can't oh football is is just impossible to rig

420
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:49,440
 the full game without like truly cooperation well that yeah very level

421
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,920
 cooperation and if you like these real dumb plays where you're like oh that was

422
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,680
 an intentional fuck up but the thing is the thing is it's so precious right so

423
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:04,600
 like if you drop a pass on purpose yeah to underperform to pay a bet you you

424
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:09,700
 might get yanked out of a game for good like like like you're right it's so the

425
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:14,840
 marketing that ego for those guys too yeah like a team maybe scores four or

426
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:19,000
 five times you know an entire game you know they basically get like eight to

427
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,200
 ten chances at driving it's just not there's just not enough leeway for

428
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,880
 someone to purposely underperform and then not suffer dramatic professional

429
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:34,000
 consequences for it yeah it's just not it's just not the this is the I could be

430
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,680
 proven wrong I would be some of the stuff that's come out it's been baffling

431
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:45,560
 I reserved the right to be corrected but so far I mean look look at me like the

432
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,920
 Giants are trying the hardest and for three quarters they'll do well and then

433
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,000
 for the fourth quarter guess you could you could probably that's your best

434
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,160
 argument it's that the Giants are paid by the Mafia to stop trying in the

435
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:08,840
 fourth quarter there's really not a lot of evidence to support against yeah I

436
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:15,080
 again I have made good on my promise not to watch any NFL this season and I

437
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:20,960
 haven't but I do see the memes keep coming up in my feed because I am in the

438
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:26,040
 Pittsburgh area and you can't avoid it and it's just every week I see them I

439
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:35,080
 see Steelers shame themselves like stuff like that like Steelers embarrass and in

440
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:41,840
 prime time and I'm like of course you hired a schlocky freak to be your new QB

441
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:48,480
 they are a confusing team they're using team you ain't kidding why I'm glad I'm

442
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,920
 not watching this year because it's just every time they're like these guys are

443
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,640
 dirt they come out and they score like a thousand points and they look like a

444
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,320
 juggernaut and then right you go like oh I guess they're good and then they're

445
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:04,400
 like oh we can't score at all no no no 10 scoop says the Giants are great it's

446
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:12,240
 the damn game that's too long yeah you're right we've got that fourth

447
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,440
 quarter out yeah three-period game why don't we just if they just copied hockey

448
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:24,000
 to be under three quarters in my in my family in my family in my family text

449
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,960
 read my oldest brother said he doesn't trust anyone who dies their beard anyway

450
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:37,800
 and I said I feel attacked and then the goes right though and the coach got

451
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:42,040

 first week in November it wrapped up so that's the world was what was the big

551
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:27,360
 news what was the big scuttlebutt from the Breeders Cup last-minute scratches

552
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:33,160
 horses got all the way to the gate and they they were not allowed to participate

553
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:38,960
 because of due restrictions because one person is federally oversight it now we

554
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,240
 have federal oversight gate it got all the way to the gate and they were like

555
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:51,280
 no not you there's like leading horses off the track yes and it's like okay and

556
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,480
 then like owners just embarrassing it's really embarrassing when your horse has

557
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,200
 to be led off the track by the pony without a saddle on what were the

558
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:06,600
 reasons the differing reasons but but veterinarians seeing signs of soreness

559
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:13,520
 or or not okay unsound horses but oh okay the track that they run it at the

560
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:19,600
 particular track had a problem for a couple of seasons of an unusual amount

561
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:24,400
 of horse deaths not that particular track the okay the track you're thinking

562
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,520
 of is Santa Anita which is in Los Angeles oh yes you're right the track

563
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,640
 here I have to say has one of the highest safety ratings in the world it's

564
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:36,760
 it's it's San Diego got it okay okay I'm mixing it I'm mixing my West Coast

565
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:43,460
 tracks this track was built this and I'm Paul if you want to warm up this track

566
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:51,600
 was built on in 1939 on a loan taking against taking against the life

567
00:53:51,600 --> 00:54:01,560
 insurance policy of Bing Crosby that's true so somebody just bet against Bing

568
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:07,240
 living and won 100% they shorted Bing Crosby's life insurance to build this

569
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:23,600
 track it was a friend of his name Pat O'Brien fucking friend yeah boy gotta

570
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:29,680

575
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:20,480
 today I fell in the paddock I I should have cooked the dinner right I should

576
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:25,160
 have cooked the oats right oh you you don't know Bob Baffert like I do he can

577
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:32,920
 change I can change him everyone the other claim to fame of this of this track

578
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:38,800
 is that this is the place where Chris Jenner and Robert Kardashian first met

579
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:56,440
 oh so everybody brings it up like that's that's this boy is that what's going on

580
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:00,960
 I didn't hear you go ahead is is it an old cursed Indian burial ground as well

581
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,500
 as that what's going on with that fucking place God might as well be it was it was

582
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:09,680
 Shawnee ghost popping up in the middle race during World War two this track was

583
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:18,280
 used as a as a plane wing assembly factory where was the where was the fancy

584
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:26,720
 wing assembly factory really interesting Beverly Hills here in Del Mar that's a

585
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,360
 really interesting tidbit I wonder what they use Santa Anita for and then

586
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:37,240
 everybody immediately was like don't ask so then I looked it up and it's like what

587
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:45,000
 was it it was an internment camp yeah and I was like well that's not that's

588
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:54,960
 good not gonna be on the tour that they at least get to race the horses you

589
00:56:54,960 --> 00:57:08,860
 chipped neck up on that one Paul so what were the big horses that won and should

590
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:12,480
 we keep keep an eye on them for upcoming not for long episodes and then also what

591
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:18,000
 was the attendance like oh absolutely so the attendance was was was a like a

592
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,720
 thousand down from last from last year okay a thousand fewer guests which is

593
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:27,680
 hardly noticeable in a place like that you're talking about 63,000 people over

594
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:34,200
 two days okay okay okay okay okay and then the so your current world champions

595
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:39,880
 are the Japanese are the current world champions of horse racing oh they the

596
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:46,840
 the current world champion is a horse named forever young from from Japan okay

597
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:53,320
 did Japanese horses usually do well in these races so I last year they sent

598
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:59,560
 19 horses to this event and and they won none of the 14 races no that's a tough

599
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:06,720
 that's and I said they could have sent 19 hermit crabs and got the same result

600
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:12,480
 so this year guess who called Newman's bluff and sent 19 hermit crabs literally

601
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,880
 they can't they sent nine horses this year and just absolutely crushed oh wow

602
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:22,160
 okay okay all right well then that's exciting we'll have to look out for so

603
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:29,480
 they're figuring it out and then I I got to briefly talk to Mike Rapoli listen to

604
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:35,040
 not for long Mike Rapoli is a real character a real treasure so Mike on

605
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:46,840
 Twitter has named himself the Commissioner of horse racing as he walked

606
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:56,160
 by me we made knowing eye contact and I said a good luck Kamish three paths on

607
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:02,280
 the back and a smile so that's there you go he got so Frankie to Tory had

608
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:07,760
 himself a nice weekend Frankie to Tory this is the best thing if you again not

609
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:12,220
 for long podcast the show tries to make it crazy that Frankie's still racing at

610
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:15,600
 his age and then we find out that it's very common for racers to race at his

611
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:20,440
 age they say down those lock and he's just trying to clutch it any opportunity

612
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:23,600
 he gets and he ends up working with Bob Baffert one of the world's most famous

613
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:28,640
 trainers and they give him a horse and the Breeders Cup so it's like really

614
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:33,560
 that's the it's the last the last that's that hard Scrabble Road we're following

615
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:39,480
 with him he's just fallen on hard times but possibly due to his suspension and

616
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:45,320
 we will just say for legal purposes made up the fact that we also think he's a

617
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:52,760
 cocaine and so we often make jokes about that as well total fabrication we're

618
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:59,160
 just a comedy show we're just wacky guys we made Robin Lee to cut the maniac we

619
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:04,920
 just do these things and so we can't be held responsible for things that we make

620
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:17,880
 up Frankie Dettori's bread surrogate so Frankie he would never eat bread get

621
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:24,840
 real that man hasn't seen a carb in 30 years so Frank he did not he was not

01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:58,240
 the adults will fist fight over that horse right I can't picture someone

655
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:02,320
 getting their horses dolls hair done to present it to another person like huh

656
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:14,760
 oh you can't my world would do you show off the grooming of the hair of your

657
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:20,520
 figures it's all about customization yeah so you get your base you get your

658
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:24,760
 base bucks yo like this is your standard buck and then it's all about people who

659
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:30,720
 can trick these things out there's a guy I follow on YouTube his channel is mr.

660
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:40,080
 home arcade this cat has got money and he gets four of everything basically

661
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:46,640
 yeah and he also pays all these other awesome creators to send him customs so

662
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:54,080
 the stuff that he has is one-offs totally unique but really cool really

663
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:59,120
 well done but a lot of it is you take the base figure and then just build on

664
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:04,640
 it ah that yeah yeah true it's all about that base true or false Newman that one

665
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:07,720
 of the biggest briar collectibles is just a Katherine the great with her legs

666
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:15,880
 wide open yes the great playset would sell like hotcakes

667
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:29,080
 talking about this place is the longest saddest fistfight so I'm gonna be two

668
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:42,160
 punches me hit you and you hit the bed me hitting you and me your surface and

669
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:50,520
 yes good Jesus with legs wide open but then you like custom satellite there's a

670
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:55,200
 person make it tiny little saddles out of real leather see that's where that's

671
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:59,400
 when it gets really yeah yeah yeah yeah see with with the Masters of the

672
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:07,840
 Universe especially that's my forte it gets to like characters and people that

673
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,600
 were featured in the cartoons that have never been made into figures which

674
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,160
 that's getting that list is getting smaller and smaller and smaller of

675
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:16,320
 course years of yeah yeah Masters universe figures for that but there are

676
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:19,840
 still some and these people want these one-off figures it's been their dream

677
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:26,120
 like oh I really want this figure from this episode and if it's never been made

678
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:29,880
 people will make it but then the interesting thing is the fandom will

679
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:34,480
 respond and if it's a nice enough custom and enough people go oh well I really

680
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,760
 wish I had that figure too Mattel follows those boards and they build out

681
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:43,640
 figures based on fan demand and that's how we get a lot of these really rare

682
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:47,920
 weird one appearance I'm telling you right now the person making custom

683
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,520
 leather saddles for those Briar outfits doesn't know that there's a whole

684
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:56,880
 battle cat saddle universe out there oh yeah I don't know I thought they might be

685
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:01,720
 they might know they might know looking at some of those Mondos but but that's

686
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:08,560
 it that's the fact too is I would not be surprised if some of those what do you

687
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:18,000
 call that Newman the whole on Psalm I guess it's a lot of livery right the

688
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:23,040
 tack the livery the tack is that what it's called it can be liver yeah so that

689
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:27,760
 would encompass the what the jockey rides what the jockey wears the colors

690
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:32,200
 oh that's sure yes and then the saddling and all that kind of stuff would be tack

691
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:37,380
 so I mean I'm gonna go out on a limb and say there's probably been an occasion

692
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:46,480
 where a model tack maker has inspired a real-life replica oh sure oh yeah I'm

693
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:51,060
 sure I was worried we were gonna look at this like as a strictly parasitic

694
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:54,660
 relationship but no no no it's copacetic

695
01:07:54,660 --> 01:08:05,800
 yeah yeah yeah no these guys these guys absolutely inspire you know the big boys

696
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:11,280
 to make the big toys that's how it goes all right does have three battle cat

697
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:16,920
 saddles already you're right rich scoop I have more than three so past Breeders

698
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:21,240
 Cup how long is your season out there Newman I'd get right ahead home just

699
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:27,160
 okay just for it to be cold in Kentucky and then what's the next big race on the

700
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:32,320
 radar for for possible Triple Crown people because the Breeders Cup starts

701
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:37,000
 at all right starts at all the Breeders Cup juvenile starts at all and then the

702
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:42,280
 next in March there there are some there are lots of there's the the Arkansas

703
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:46,120
 Derby there's the rebel stakes there's a Florida Derby but what everybody's

704
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:50,000
 really got their eye on because of the international horses that are making a

705
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:55,880
 bigger impact is the Dubai World Cup the the United Arab Emirates Derby is

706
01:08:55,880 --> 01:09:04,880
 probably gonna be the next that's that's early early March okay flying horses

707
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:15,640
 makes me scared mayor force one so cuz do Americans and other best horses to

708
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:20,440
 Dubai or is it always this thing oh always you said a horse flights the most

709
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:26,560
 boring flight in the world right I hate it so much it's not that boring it's

710
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:30,600
 like a it's like fucking Russian roulette the way you described it yeah

711
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:36,160
 standing on there with with a needle with a put down and a dope up in both

712
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:53,080
 hands that reminds me of how I used to describe being a fireman oh yeah it was

713
01:09:53,080 --> 01:10:00,680
 just long periods of just complete boredom and then every once in a while it

714
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:09,800
 goes freestyle crazy so that's about what it is okay back to chili chili chili

715
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:17,520
 don't work it up I forgot about the put down juice Paul somebody you can murder

716
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,880
 a horse at 30,000 feet that's amazing that's it numerous times someone has

717
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:25,200
 spent tens of thousands of dollars to ship a horse to somewhere and have it

718
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:32,240
 arrived dead that's what this was that is what has happened the numbers that

719
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:37,240
 makes me sad about that is just like my recent experience with the injected die

720
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:42,240
 I'll wager that if you put death juice in a horse you can't really go glue or

721
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:45,480
 meet with that bad boy either that's pretty best you're pretty much just

722
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:50,640
 throwing him on a fire pit or great question Paul Nick how edibles a horse

723
01:10:50,640 --> 01:11:01,640
 after you kill it so it's okay yeah all right the half life's pretty low there

724
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:05,920
 is well it's kind of like it's kind of like how much rat feces they'll let into

725
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:10,680
 a McDonald's hamburger how much how much how much phenol barbital they'll allow

726
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:18,000
 into an average mix of puppy chow I don't know what's going on skippies just

727
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:26,120
 kind of low key today breakfast I don't know a lot of horse meat man he had his

728
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:34,400
 he had his purina he had his kennel ration I don't know thank you Newman

729
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:41,280
 thank you Jack vs. nerd buddy thank you guys go get them pure Reno failure here

730
01:11:41,280 --> 01:12:11,000
 we go of irradiated horses oh they didn't make it

731
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,880
 oh that's too bad I paid a lot of money for this flight do I get any of that

732
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:20,680
 money back or anything oh no no no no I I guess she did I guess you did

733
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:26,240
 transport the horse that is that is all I paid you to do that seems totally fair

734
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:32,840
 by the way the ladies lounge is the name of the Tasmanian Museum Mona that's the

735
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:38,120
 name of the art installation in Mona it was ruled illegal by the the first

736
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:41,960
 judges who dealt with it it has gone through to the Tasmanian Supreme Court

737
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:47,280
 who did uphold the legality of the exhibitions women-only policy there are

738
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:51,960
 now ways that men can see it there are a couple of different ways that they've

739
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:59,840
 made it so that male visitors can go in and see the display there are it features

740
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:03,320
 what you were saying Matt it features expensive jewelry and art including

741
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:08,820
 Picasso canvases as a comment on sexism and historical exclusion though some

742
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:12,760
 pieces were later revealed to be fakes or replicas I guess you're making the

743
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:18,160
 point yeah oh man that was that was it he inadvertently made the point of you

744
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:23,720
 know how dare you exclude me oh yeah while women had been excluded from male

745
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:28,360
 spaces forever and there are still so many of those things still on the books

746
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:37,440
 today yeah so it's almost like that guy didn't didn't get it he really we got a

838
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:24,680

 pretty big I don't know yeah I don't even know what makes an indie band indie

840
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:33,160
 anymore it seems like half the indie bands are signed to record labels and I

841
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:36,760
 don't understand how that works I'm passing to Matt this is obviously

849
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:42,280
