1
0:00:00 --> 0:00:03
Why does the black flat cap feel more pretentious than the other caps?

2
0:00:04 --> 0:00:05
It looks good

3
0:00:05 --> 0:00:11
Feels like I would say it is no more or less pretentious than your other cap. Thank you. It definitely looks very peaky blinders

4
0:00:12 --> 0:00:17
Yeah, that's what I mean. You look like you look like you're you're a bit of a patty enforcer

5
0:00:18 --> 0:00:24
You are a patty enforcer Matt. Hello. This is my favorite part of this show. It's my drag day

6
0:00:24 --> 0:00:31
This is the part of this show where we thank you the ice cream truck drivers. Thank you ice cream truck drivers

7
0:00:31 --> 0:00:33
I don't have a new list for the month yet

8
0:00:33 --> 0:00:35
We want to thank each and every ice cream truck driver

9
0:00:35 --> 0:00:39
And we will we will thank each and every one of you by name before this month is over

10
0:00:40 --> 0:00:44
If you want to be an ice cream truck driver, maybe you just want to be a patty driver

11
0:00:44 --> 0:00:48
I don't know head on over to preaching fun calm preaching fun commas

12
0:00:48 --> 0:00:53
We're gonna sign up to be an ice cream truck driver and who knows the life you save

13
0:00:53 --> 0:01:02
Maybe your own it's time for a program. Hey Johnny. Do you want to go to an ice cream social?

14
0:01:03 --> 0:01:06
Yeah, I'd love to great. Let's go

15
0:01:06 --> 0:01:11
So Jacob the fancy microphone you brought me when I travel

16
0:01:12 --> 0:01:18
Got me pulled out of TSA because they thought the adapter on the mic was a bullet

17
0:01:19 --> 0:01:20
What?

18
0:01:21 --> 0:01:23
Where the fuck were you?

19
0:01:23 --> 0:01:30
It's time for Matt Maddly's ice cream social sitting in prison. That's Matt Donnelly sitting in Pittsburgh. That's Paul Maddly

20
0:01:30 --> 0:01:32
I'm Jacob in Vegas

21
0:01:32 --> 0:01:37
We're preaching fun fun. So I I know exactly what you're talking about that big

22
0:01:37 --> 0:01:39
Nobby thing. I have one too

23
0:01:42 --> 0:01:46
Yes, so it's the

24
0:01:46 --> 0:01:48
Shore the shore little

25
0:01:48 --> 0:01:50
microphone connector

26
0:01:51 --> 0:01:56
Adapted to an XLR connection is what you're referring to and it gives power right? It gives power to the microphone

27
0:01:56 --> 0:02:02
Yeah, the the your recorder is sending phantom power to it as well, which is I think

28
0:02:03 --> 0:02:10
Forty something volts. I don't remember what it is. So I you know pack my heaviest stuff and put it on my carry-on

29
0:02:11 --> 0:02:15
To get weight out of my case for when I travel with my magic stuff

30
0:02:15 --> 0:02:16
Ah

31
0:02:16 --> 0:02:21
So one of the items is shackles. They're actual iron shackles

32
0:02:22 --> 0:02:25
and then my jar of rings

33
0:02:27 --> 0:02:33
My thing of rope and so it got it got pulled out at the Fort Lauderdale Airport

34
0:02:35 --> 0:02:36
and I

35
0:02:38 --> 0:02:39
You know

36
0:02:39 --> 0:02:44
I'm thinking it's gonna be about the shackles which only one time someone was like you can't you can't travel with these and I

37
0:02:44 --> 0:02:48
Was like, oh I sure can and for some reason that worked and then they let me go

38
0:02:50 --> 0:02:52
Yeah, I was like no I travel with them all the time

39
0:02:54 --> 0:02:54
and

40
0:02:54 --> 0:02:57
And all of a sudden he goes. Oh, it's this right here and he pulls up the microphone

41
0:02:57 --> 0:03:02
I go what he goes this is this adapter and the x-ray looks like it looks like a high caliber of bullets

42
0:03:05 --> 0:03:12
That's it my high caliber bullets is this guy bit x-ray my singular shot my my one

43
0:03:12 --> 0:03:18
One high caliber bullet I'm taking with me to assassinate the pilot from the back of the plane with my sniper rifle

44
0:03:19 --> 0:03:21
back and to the left

45
0:03:22 --> 0:03:26
Matt the man with the golden gun Donnelly exactly

46
0:03:26 --> 0:03:33
Don't mind me carry just just carries one bullet. Just the jackal making my way through the Florida Airport

47
0:03:37 --> 0:03:42
I'm actually shooting my target is at the Miami Airport. I'm that good. I'm shooting high wind

48
0:03:42 --> 0:03:49
From one airport to another it's one of those shots where you have to check the wind first. Yeah. Yeah, it's a whole big thing

49
0:03:49 --> 0:03:54
It's like one giant bullet will be traveling into a private jet taking out from Miami Airport

50
0:03:55 --> 0:03:57
Don't be traveling via private jet

51
0:03:57 --> 0:04:03
Yes, and it's not shot out of a gun because I didn't pack that so it's I just I just wheel my shackles like

52
0:04:03 --> 0:04:09
A slingshot and they put the bullet in there and I sling it like David and then boom

53
0:04:09 --> 0:04:12
Then as long as you do it in the plane

54
0:04:12 --> 0:04:17
Then the bullet is traveling at the speed of the plane in addition to the speed that the earth is already rotating

55
0:04:18 --> 0:04:24
You're able all the velocity. I need just comes from the flight itself. I just drop the bullet out the window

56
0:04:24 --> 0:04:27
It's like throwing pennies off the Empire State Building

57
0:04:29 --> 0:04:33
That's why I always request the seat with the rolled-out window that

58
0:04:34 --> 0:04:39
The product the proposition that you're creating the the the

59
0:04:39 --> 0:04:45
Strategic crazy scenario you're creating could actually be the plot of an episode of Golgo 13

60
0:04:46 --> 0:04:54
13 Golgo 13. He's an incredible assassin and it one of my favorite anime

61
0:04:54 --> 0:05:01
acid ass acid anime and manga of all time and go go 13 does constantly those kinds of

62
0:05:01 --> 0:05:06
Impossible assassinations that he's just a gun for hire. He's like this cold

63
0:05:07 --> 0:05:09
Merciless killer you pay him enough money

64
0:05:09 --> 0:05:14
He will do whatever needs to be done and then the investigators are always this close to figuring out

65
0:05:14 --> 0:05:17
But then they're like no fucking way could anybody do this

66
0:05:19 --> 0:05:25
Line a lot of other things should use that same plot line and then they go back then they go back and they go

67
0:05:25 --> 0:05:27
Oh fuck. He did do that

68
0:05:28 --> 0:05:34
They show you how he fucking did it and it's like what holy shit. Yeah, go go 13 is

69
0:05:37 --> 0:05:38
Unstoppable

70
0:05:39 --> 0:05:44
Bossy says I'm actually just throwing it like a dart from the back of the plane to hit the pilot just yeah

71
0:05:46 --> 0:05:49
The physics physics checks out nobody check it but the physics checks

72
0:05:49 --> 0:05:52
All you do is hold it in your hand on the numbers

73
0:05:52 --> 0:05:58
Hold it in your hand while you're landing and then just let go and let let gravity do the work

74
0:05:58 --> 0:06:04
That's right. Like I like my idea is when teenagers jump up and down inside of an elevator. Uh-huh

75
0:06:04 --> 0:06:08
Yeah, same same thing. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah

76
0:06:09 --> 0:06:14
All right, are any of you watching land man

77
0:06:15 --> 0:06:22
No, man. I love land man. Okay, we we haven't started the new season yet, but we burned through the first season

78
0:06:22 --> 0:06:29
I hung back until there's four episodes and now I'm four episodes caught up with a new season is this who is this?

79
0:06:29 --> 0:06:31
Who's the land is Billy Bob Thornton Thornton?

80
0:06:32 --> 0:06:35
Demi Moore is in it. Oh, he's fantastic

81
0:06:36 --> 0:06:43
Yeah, the whole cast is really killer. Okay Myron Chach is not willing to pay for Paramount respect respect on that

82
0:06:44 --> 0:06:47
There's just there are websites you can go to time to sail the seas

83
0:06:47 --> 0:06:52
Now you just gonna start now go the full other direction Myron steal steal the show

84
0:06:53 --> 0:06:54
That's it

85
0:06:58 --> 0:06:59
So

86
0:06:59 --> 0:07:05
Landman for those who don't watch the show. It's the most popular show on Paramount plus and Billy Bob Thornton plays a grizzled

87
0:07:06 --> 0:07:07
foul-mouth

88
0:07:07 --> 0:07:11
Smoking land man where he is there meaning what?

89
0:07:12 --> 0:07:18
So land man are people who own oil fields small smaller oil operators, right?

90
0:07:19 --> 0:07:22
Ah working for the big guns, but they're just trying to get by

91
0:07:22 --> 0:07:27
Which is definitely something that Matt and I knew before watching land man. Sure

92
0:07:27 --> 0:07:32
Well, this is it Taylor Sheridan for whether you want to what do you want to go with cause or symptom?

93
0:07:33 --> 0:07:39
He is simply basically between Yellowstone and mayor of Kingstown, you know

94
0:07:40 --> 0:07:41
in

95
0:07:41 --> 0:07:43
1923 and he shows like he basically

96
0:07:44 --> 0:07:49
takes pockets of where white dudes might feel obsolete and

97
0:07:50 --> 0:07:57
Gives them monologues and speeches that that kind of build up, you know, these these broken ways of life, right and

98
0:07:58 --> 0:08:00
Here's the thing. I

99
0:08:00 --> 0:08:05
Actually like at first like used to I feel conflicted about this right here

100
0:08:05 --> 0:08:08
Because this is you know, the way of the way of this country is going right now

101
0:08:08 --> 0:08:15
It seems like that's that's a big force behind a big imaginary force behind a lot of a lot of actions being taken

102
0:08:16 --> 0:08:17
Yeah

103
0:08:20 --> 0:08:26
I'm doing a show on the on the cruise ship and I get this guy up on stage and he is

104
0:08:27 --> 0:08:33
Basically me like 1.5 me in size like exact body type just six foot five

105
0:08:34 --> 0:08:39
and just a little wider and thick arms or whatever and I

106
0:08:40 --> 0:08:41
say

107
0:08:41 --> 0:08:43
You know, hi, you know, what do you do for a living?

108
0:08:44 --> 0:08:48
You know, do you work that kind of stuff and he goes I work in the oil and gas distribution

109
0:08:48 --> 0:08:49
from Texas

110
0:08:50 --> 0:08:50
Yes

111
0:08:51 --> 0:08:56
Yes, and I say because basis like my dad growing up hated law shows

112
0:08:56 --> 0:08:59
So he hated the way the law was portrayed

113
0:09:00 --> 0:09:04
On television and it made people stupid questions all the time

114
0:09:05 --> 0:09:08
So I wonder if that's better or worse now or if it's just the same

115
0:09:09 --> 0:09:14
For like new legal dramas because I feel like the new legal dramas try to stay more true to the law

116
0:09:14 --> 0:09:18
They don't ones do but like they're still ridiculous legally

117
0:09:19 --> 0:09:24
Yeah, my dad was just laughs like how quickly they can like get like lab results and stuff like that

118
0:09:24 --> 0:09:29
Like he's just like they get lab results like the next day or the same way on in the chat is saying they are

119
0:09:29 --> 0:09:30
Not much better Jacob

120
0:09:30 --> 0:09:32
Okay. Yeah, right

121
0:09:32 --> 0:09:35
Leon is our barrister. He is

122
0:09:36 --> 0:09:38
Their Leon he's our law man

123
0:09:39 --> 0:09:43
We need a law man, so I say

124
0:09:44 --> 0:09:47
Do you love or hate the show land man?

125
0:09:48 --> 0:09:52
Good and he like literally turns to me

126
0:09:52 --> 0:09:57
Like like doesn't doesn't like he's like we're not having a conversation. He just turns to me and he goes. Oh

127
0:09:57 --> 0:10:01
That is the most accurate portrayal of the oil and gas

128
0:10:01 --> 0:10:08
I have ever seen on TV or movies and he almost has tears in his eyes

129
0:10:09 --> 0:10:09
Wow

130
0:10:12 --> 0:10:15
You know now there is fascinating shit in the show

131
0:10:15 --> 0:10:20
There is shit that you do not you never thought about the oil and gas industry sure there is like really they really do do

132
0:10:20 --> 0:10:22
a good job of like

133
0:10:23 --> 0:10:28
Villages where the where the workers like live like the house villages, you know things like that

134
0:10:28 --> 0:10:33
It's it's really fascinating. It's neat stuff. There's one was like there's an there's an oil

135
0:10:34 --> 0:10:39
Area left all alone and therefore there's like a toxicity thing that can happen

136
0:10:39 --> 0:10:45
So they come across dead bodies and then also they go what's going on on the alarms go off on their uniforms and they go

137
0:10:45 --> 0:10:45
running

138
0:10:45 --> 0:10:53
So they don't die and you're like, oh right. I had no idea no idea that that kind of scenario

139
0:10:53 --> 0:10:57
There are electronic canaries in the coal mine now. Yeah. Yeah, they've got it

140
0:10:57 --> 0:11:02
Yeah, it's a little like gas meters and by the way the same thing for I think nuclear stuff by the way, Matt

141
0:11:02 --> 0:11:07
I know this wasn't intentional, but you just basically told a Trump rally story

142
0:11:08 --> 0:11:12
Saying there was big guy big guy came up to me and I turned to him

143
0:11:12 --> 0:11:19
I said, do you like land man or not and with tears in his eyes big guy big guy tears in his eyes

144
0:11:19 --> 0:11:24
I love land man. He tells me let me people are saying Paul and with that I'll finish out

145
0:11:24 --> 0:11:29
He said no one's ever asked me about land man before only you know, I'm joking

146
0:11:29 --> 0:11:29
I

147
0:11:36 --> 0:11:42
Didn't take the no one ever knows it's all about me and how I'm unique

148
0:11:42 --> 0:11:50
He looked at me with tears in his eyes and said that is the best question anyone has ever asked me about land man

149
0:11:54 --> 0:11:58
Sensational question such a good question giant man who weep

150
0:11:59 --> 0:12:05
You asked the best questions that's not only my noodler. So it's it is teaching you all kinds of

151
0:12:06 --> 0:12:10
Actual tricks of the trade within the land man community

152
0:12:10 --> 0:12:15
It is like any good show and that is a voyeur. It's a it's a voyeuristic

153
0:12:15 --> 0:12:20
You know the thing where you're getting a pocket of the world. You wouldn't normally get a pocket out of right?

154
0:12:22 --> 0:12:27
It's still filled with its weird weird monologues, you know things like that

155
0:12:29 --> 0:12:34
Season opens with Billy Bob doing a big monologue about breakfast and like the waitresses the most important meal of the day

156
0:12:34 --> 0:12:39
and he just lectures her about who profits from breakfast and blah blah blah blah blah and it's just

157
0:12:39 --> 0:12:42
Taylor shared it just has these monologues that are just atrocious

158
0:12:43 --> 0:12:44
and one-dimensional

159
0:12:45 --> 0:12:50
But you tolerate Billy Bob Thornton or Kevin Costner doing them, right? It's almost like a challenge, you know

160
0:12:51 --> 0:12:53
I can do this. I got this

161
0:12:55 --> 0:12:56
Yeah, I'll I do

162
0:12:57 --> 0:13:03
Watching land man. All I do is talk like Billy Bob Thornton the entire time and it makes SJ really happy. Yeah

163
0:13:03 --> 0:13:07
No, but I was trying I was trying to think about my man on the ship and I was trying to think about like

164
0:13:07 --> 0:13:11
You know, he came up on like my family call like when my brothers is really into what my brothers thinks

165
0:13:11 --> 0:13:16
it's it's a piece of shit show right and it was kind of like right, you know them them's fighting words and

166
0:13:18 --> 0:13:20
I mean I kind of I get both arguments

167
0:13:23 --> 0:13:23
I

168
0:13:23 --> 0:13:24
Everyone's right

169
0:13:24 --> 0:13:31
But you know we talk on this like these these weird times and I and I and I was basically kind of like

170
0:13:33 --> 0:13:34
thinking about

171
0:13:34 --> 0:13:36
Basically is the word obsolete

172
0:13:36 --> 0:13:40
That okay. That is the word like I've been trying to find a way

173
0:13:40 --> 0:13:42
to put my

174
0:13:42 --> 0:13:46
To encapsulate I think attention that's driving all this shitty decisions

175
0:13:46 --> 0:13:49
Like I think like so many things that are shitty about this world or not, you know themselves

176
0:13:49 --> 0:13:54
I think caused by one thing. I think their dominoes were pushed, right?

177
0:13:54 --> 0:13:59
Whether we're talking about like Trump ism or you know ice detentions that kind of stuff like all these crazy shit

178
0:13:59 --> 0:14:05
That's happening. Ah, and I think like if I'm trying if it was

179
0:14:06 --> 0:14:07
You know go my walks

180
0:14:07 --> 0:14:14
I was thinking about my friend on the other ship and then my brother's fighting and and I was like I

181
0:14:14 --> 0:14:17
Think that like part of

182
0:14:18 --> 0:14:24
Like AI and technology and basically tech tech has taken all of the money, right and

183
0:14:24 --> 0:14:30
All of the talent and now has seized all of the power right like like tech runs

184
0:14:30 --> 0:14:34
Washington and Tex runs all of media now, right? Yeah

185
0:14:34 --> 0:14:38
And the billion and the billionaires are more richer than us than ever

186
0:14:38 --> 0:14:42
Right, and then I think like basically like we're all afraid of

187
0:14:42 --> 0:14:49
Our ways of life becoming obsolete from one facet or another because of this, right? Okay. Yes

188
0:14:49 --> 0:14:55
I see what you mean now. Yeah, and so like if I feel like shit is on my doorstep and

189
0:14:55 --> 0:15:01
You tell me to help other people because they're doing something. They're experiencing something less fortunate and

190
0:15:03 --> 0:15:05
I feel like no one's talking about what's making my life unfortunate

191
0:15:06 --> 0:15:11
Right, like if I think I'm cool and not obsolete if I feel like I am thriving

192
0:15:11 --> 0:15:16
You tell me to help somebody else. Yeah, I go like cool. No problem

193
0:15:17 --> 0:15:20
But if you come to me and say, you know

194
0:15:20 --> 0:15:25
No one's doing stuff about these poor people over here and you're like wait mom about to lose my whole fucking way of life

195
0:15:25 --> 0:15:30
Yeah, I just got back from the food bank and you're telling me that that this is a problem over here

196
0:15:30 --> 0:15:36
And I don't process that tension properly, right? I don't process that like I think my way of life is going away

197
0:15:37 --> 0:15:41
Right, you know, like even we do on our show. We were do really like oh, we're just three white dudes talking

198
0:15:41 --> 0:15:45
Right. And so like we reduce ourselves to be like wait the world should be more diverse. We're not diverse enough

199
0:15:46 --> 0:15:50
We're getting older. We're done with mainstream things. We're over here in our little pocket, right?

200
0:15:50 --> 0:15:57
like we do to ourselves a little bit, you know, I would say actually Paul's probably the biggest voice that fights against it and

201
0:16:00 --> 0:16:05
Like and then you tell us to help go help something else is a little bit like I'm trying to fucking hold it down here

202
0:16:05 --> 0:16:10
Right, but you don't want to admit that you don't want to admit that I'm trying to hold it down

203
0:16:10 --> 0:16:14
You don't want to admit that you're afraid of losing it all right?

204
0:16:14 --> 0:16:18
you want to have pride and stuff like that and so I feel like this ups and then I think the

205
0:16:19 --> 0:16:23
Lockdown and pandemic just poured accelerant all over this tension

206
0:16:24 --> 0:16:30
And I think like it's really hard to shake that feeling

207
0:16:30 --> 0:16:33
So like I'm thinking that like I think that's a way

208
0:16:34 --> 0:16:37
To fight against what we're doing in a positive way

209
0:16:37 --> 0:16:43
I think you have to identify if someone is feeling like they're being made to feel obsolete

210
0:16:44 --> 0:16:48
And you have to find ways in yourself and other people make them feel like they can thrive

211
0:16:48 --> 0:16:53
And I feel like if you do that, that would be the first way to put a force against what we're doing

212
0:16:53 --> 0:16:55
It's a very deep thought it was on my mind

213
0:16:55 --> 0:16:59
It was all because I was watching land man and we can we can talk about something else

214
0:16:59 --> 0:17:02
I have a very embarrassing story to follow up with this if this goes nowhere, but

215
0:17:07 --> 0:17:11
Now that the ultimate solution

216
0:17:11 --> 0:17:17
For people in a political place where what they're doing is terribly unpopular

217
0:17:18 --> 0:17:22
Their ultimate solution is I'm going to give people money

218
0:17:22 --> 0:17:28
But unfortunately that should always be the thing the government should be helping

219
0:17:28 --> 0:17:33
The citizenry to elevate their standard of living constantly

220
0:17:33 --> 0:17:40
Yeah, we came up we came out of the pandemic with the wrong lessons learned when they did help bolster us and give us

221
0:17:40 --> 0:17:42
what was tantamount to a

222
0:17:42 --> 0:17:47
Basic, you know median basic income right, you know subsidy

223
0:17:47 --> 0:17:53
Yes, which we've got and and you spoke by the way. Here's your money back, right?

224
0:17:53 --> 0:17:56
But we spoke to pride if that's exactly right Jacob

225
0:17:56 --> 0:18:02
And we spoke we spoke to pride right or you talked about that man. Yeah, we need to look at that in a whole

226
0:18:02 --> 0:18:09
Other way we have conditioned a generation to look at any benefit coming from the government as something unnecessary

227
0:18:10 --> 0:18:12
shameful and to be repelled

228
0:18:13 --> 0:18:18
Right, which is crazy because what are you paying them for then if not to work for now?

229
0:18:18 --> 0:18:21
We're all working together our society to they are our

230
0:18:21 --> 0:18:27
Representatives they are our representatives they are to represent our interests and if our interests currently

231
0:18:28 --> 0:18:31
Require that we get some kind of financial

232
0:18:32 --> 0:18:37
Benefits and incentives to move forward in a proper way. Not just certain groups is that's what's happening already

233
0:18:38 --> 0:18:41
Farmers are getting a lot of incentives real soon

234
0:18:41 --> 0:18:45
Yeah again yet again, and it's still not gonna be enough

235
0:18:45 --> 0:18:48
But we don't even have to we don't even have to bag on the farmers

236
0:18:48 --> 0:18:51
No, we can just talk about the things we're already talking about

237
0:18:51 --> 0:18:56
Let's just talk about the people in the oil industry. Oh, we're just being handed money fucking forget about it

238
0:18:56 --> 0:19:03
Exactly people who are being handed money for no reason, but when but when little

239
0:19:03 --> 0:19:09
People look at the same kind of thing we have we have been socially engineered to be like, oh no

240
0:19:09 --> 0:19:12
I don't need anything. I don't need help. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's a handout

241
0:19:12 --> 0:19:16
It's a handout on the small scale on the large scale. It's capitalism, right?

242
0:19:18 --> 0:19:26
Yeah, no, I mean yeah, it's it's it is strange and complicated are it's bizarre and

243
0:19:26 --> 0:19:29
Giant men coming to you with tears in their eyes

244
0:19:35 --> 0:19:41
No, I'll tell you who else has giant men coming on them with tears in their eyes all the time wait

245
0:19:41 --> 0:19:43
I didn't get that part of the story yet

246
0:19:45 --> 0:19:52
That's the following sponsor today's show is brought to you by the fine people providers purveyors and makers of

247
0:19:53 --> 0:19:58
Greek yogurt, that's right. It's just a commercial for Greek yogurt for 2022. That's from the scoop Henley

248
0:19:59 --> 0:20:03
We're talking about Greek yogurt. All right

249
0:20:03 --> 0:20:06
That that it that it that it that it that it it

250
0:20:07 --> 0:20:08
Hey

253
0:20:16 --> 0:20:21
Come on over. He said a good Greek stuff. Yeah. Yeah

254
0:20:24 --> 0:20:28
This here yogurt got a little bit of the tomato and a basil

255
0:20:29 --> 0:20:32
Yeah, fresh from the Greek island

256
0:20:36 --> 0:20:42
Hey, why don't you put a little is a Greek yogurt all over your piece of pie

257
0:20:43 --> 0:20:49
Over your piece of pie. How about you put a little bit in it inside of the pasta sauce

258
0:20:49 --> 0:20:53
Yeah, and just a little bit of zest now. That's a Greek

259
0:20:57 --> 0:20:58
Oh

260
0:20:58 --> 0:21:05
When you're here you're a family extra Greek yogurt everybody with it a breadstick yummy

261
0:21:08 --> 0:21:14
Pasta fuzz you like Greek yogurt. Mmm. Yummy. Yummy manja

262
0:21:21 --> 0:21:22
Yeah

263
0:21:22 --> 0:21:29
Yeah, no, I I don't think me it like like basically while I was wrapped up in that beautiful commercial

264
0:21:30 --> 0:21:35
I mean sure oil tree sure the farms sure all of college sure all of medicine

265
0:21:35 --> 0:21:40
Sure, all like like we have been quietly always

266
0:21:40 --> 0:21:45
Training wheels and pushing every industry, right? And so, you know

267
0:21:46 --> 0:21:50
We have never the successful industries, right?

268
0:21:50 --> 0:21:53
And so like we have never

269
0:21:55 --> 0:21:56
Been a purely

270
0:21:56 --> 0:22:02
Capitalistic thing but as soon as we want to point at something and say stop doing that we say like see it's not capitalism

271
0:22:02 --> 0:22:04
It's socialism but raw

272
0:22:04 --> 0:22:09
But the truth is we've buttressed our entire country almost every aspect of our lives

273
0:22:09 --> 0:22:14
With government effort and it's been successful. Like it's what's made America

274
0:22:14 --> 0:22:22
And so it's like we improv Matt improv

275
0:22:23 --> 0:22:25
Improv in all of its forms

276
0:22:26 --> 0:22:30
Vallis Bolan was paid by the federal government

277
0:22:30 --> 0:22:36
Again an initiation of theater games for children during the Great Depression

278
0:22:37 --> 0:22:44
Improvisation is germinated from that government investment an entire my life

279
0:22:44 --> 0:22:51
My life from this woman's brilliance and the government funding that made it possible for her to do

280
0:22:52 --> 0:23:00
That's it. I agree. The only way for improv comedy to be successful is to have government backing

281
0:23:00 --> 0:23:06
The fucking fact I would love to have a little government jingle in my pocket every time I was teaching

282
0:23:06 --> 0:23:12
Holy shit make things real smooth, but just in general that needs to be

283
0:23:13 --> 0:23:18
yeah, we and I mean art is the first thing that gets it in the dick and

284
0:23:19 --> 0:23:22
Yeah, you know, I know it's like so like I mean we're

285
0:23:23 --> 0:23:27
very much out of our depths in terms of talking specifically about

286
0:23:27 --> 0:23:28
For yourself over

287
0:23:29 --> 0:23:32
What we know this is our wheel. Yeah, man. Yeah. Hello

288
0:23:33 --> 0:23:38
But I think part of like we're trying to get people to chill is to be like is is a little bit of a wake-up

289
0:23:38 --> 0:23:44
Like hey, we've been kind of doing this with everything the whole time and it's not just just the lefties

290
0:23:44 --> 0:23:50
It's not just the righties and it's not just what so that what you're saying is the solution to this might be

291
0:23:50 --> 0:23:53
Education. Oh good. Good

292
0:23:54 --> 0:24:01
Then that's assured that we're gonna move forward in a positive direction then because that's gonna be a priority going forward

293
0:24:02 --> 0:24:03
Linda fucking McMahon

294
0:24:04 --> 0:24:09
Is running of all things I can't even watch WWE anymore

295
0:24:09 --> 0:24:16
Not even no, not even like recap shit. Nothing. I haven't watched it for like a year. It's terrible

296
0:24:16 --> 0:24:21
It's like this is your it's the oh, it's real life professional wrestling

297
0:24:21 --> 0:24:24
I know it's done so much damage to the earth

298
0:24:24 --> 0:24:30
I listen to the whole fucking planet. They're gonna have a fucking you have see fight

299
0:24:37 --> 0:24:39
By the same company

300
0:24:40 --> 0:24:41
Go

301
0:24:42 --> 0:24:48
Yeah, you're right. All right. I'm definitely gonna go ice cream socials going to the UFC fight in the front

302
0:24:50 --> 0:24:54
Press pass, of course, although oh did you turn out ever?

303
0:24:54 --> 0:24:57
Did you see the explosive new?

304
0:25:00 --> 0:25:05
Confession I don't know what you'd have you how you actually say it. Are you familiar with the

305
0:25:06 --> 0:25:07
Canadian screw job

306
0:25:08 --> 0:25:13
Yes, the Montreal Montreal screw job, right? Oh this this is the the the Bret Hart thing

307
0:25:13 --> 0:25:15
Michaels, aha

308
0:25:15 --> 0:25:19
Tell me what happened. So Bret Hart was wrestling in his hometown

309
0:25:19 --> 0:25:24
he was gonna retire from the WWE or leave the WWE go somewhere else or whatever and

310
0:25:24 --> 0:25:29
They said you have to turn over your heavyweight belt to the new upcoming star Shawn Michaels

311
0:25:29 --> 0:25:32
And he said not in Montreal not in my home city

312
0:25:32 --> 0:25:35
Like we have to we'll have to do it another at another match

313
0:25:36 --> 0:25:42
Okay, and it's like this is where I'm from and this is where I can take a lot of pride in me being the heavyweight champion

314
0:25:43 --> 0:25:48
you know, we'll do a fight there, but it's got to be a different time and

315
0:25:48 --> 0:25:53
Vince McMahon and Shawn Michaels colluded behind Bret Hart's back and the Bret Hart

316
0:25:54 --> 0:26:00
Is fighting out of some chokehold or something like that and gets basically called out and loses the match and the look on his face

317
0:26:01 --> 0:26:07
When the bell goes off and thing is over this and they're gonna give Shawn Michaels the belt the look at his face is

318
0:26:07 --> 0:26:10
Crazy and it is a famously

319
0:26:11 --> 0:26:16
When the most moment in WWE where they broke quote-unquote kayfabe, right?

320
0:26:17 --> 0:26:23
When it's a very shoot moment. Yeah, meaning it was happening for real. It was happening for real

321
0:26:23 --> 0:26:26
And I think Brett wouldn't like punched Victor convinced McMahon

322
0:26:26 --> 0:26:30
I think like or something like that least spit on him. I think

323
0:26:31 --> 0:26:35
It on him and maybe punched him too. Yeah. Yeah

324
0:26:35 --> 0:26:38
So but it made so much news that they had to break

325
0:26:39 --> 0:26:44
kayfabe to break the the the the fakeness of wrestling because it was

326
0:26:44 --> 0:26:48
Leaking out that this was a crazy thing that happened behind the scenes. Uh-huh. Well

327
0:26:49 --> 0:26:53
Brett Hart has just this past week come out and said

328
0:26:54 --> 0:26:54
you

329
0:26:55 --> 0:26:59
Know Vince McMahon would always come on these specials

330
0:26:59 --> 0:27:03
Whenever they were talking about the Montreal screw job and Vince's famous quote was

331
0:27:03 --> 0:27:06
We didn't screw Brett Brett screwed Brett

332
0:27:07 --> 0:27:09
Right. That was his favorite. Okay

333
0:27:10 --> 0:27:11
well

334
0:27:11 --> 0:27:13
according to Brett Hart

335
0:27:13 --> 0:27:16
It may be more accurate to say

336
0:27:17 --> 0:27:19
Vince screwed Shawn Michaels

337
0:27:20 --> 0:27:21
Wait

338
0:27:23 --> 0:27:25
There is a rumor now

339
0:27:26 --> 0:27:28
Brett Hart has put forth that

340
0:27:28 --> 0:27:32
Michaels and Vince McMahon may wear hat we're flat

341
0:27:32 --> 0:27:36
at that point and that is a big reason why

342
0:27:36 --> 0:27:42
Vince put the belt on him and went through all that rigamarole because that was his current love boy

343
0:27:42 --> 0:27:46
I find it hard to believe that you can sleep your way to the top and WWE under Vince McMahon

344
0:27:46 --> 0:27:51
I know right unless you're willing to take a shit directly to the face. It's not really

345
0:27:51 --> 0:27:57
You're not your career is not really going to of course, this is what happened. This is obviously what happened

346
0:27:57 --> 0:28:03
This man is a depraved animal. So the Montreal mudslide proceeded the Montreal

347
0:28:06 --> 0:28:11
Exactly exactly and that's how Brett that's how Shawn lost his smile because he got shit

348
0:28:13 --> 0:28:13
Yeah

349
0:28:14 --> 0:28:16
Pretty ridiculous

350
0:28:16 --> 0:28:18
Finally something that we know about

351
0:28:18 --> 0:28:21
Leon saying it's the Montreal steamer. That's right

352
0:28:21 --> 0:28:27
That's a good one Leon. Yeah, so that I didn't I didn't look into it too far

353
0:28:27 --> 0:28:30
I just heard enough from what I heard and I was like, okay, but

354
0:28:32 --> 0:28:34
Brett's usually a pretty straight shooter

355
0:28:35 --> 0:28:39
Or he knows this is the most scathing thing you can say about Vince McMahon I

356
0:28:40 --> 0:28:46
May be but why now I guess cuz I don't know I think is he just actually

357
0:28:46 --> 0:28:50
Levitations he wants to kick him in the nuts. Yeah, maybe he just wants to yeah

358
0:28:51 --> 0:28:57
He would have come out I did follow this a little bit and I think it would have come out sooner had this actually

359
0:28:57 --> 0:28:59
Been the case. Oh

360
0:28:59 --> 0:29:01
Really? Don't you think they didn't?

361
0:29:04 --> 0:29:09
Know media if you know anything about the ring boy scandals and all the other bullshit

362
0:29:09 --> 0:29:14
That's been going on and all this stuff that's followed the McMahons around for decades

363
0:29:14 --> 0:29:20
It's only really been having a light shone on it very recently. That's had any kind of

364
0:29:20 --> 0:29:27
Consequence or public discussion about it. All right, that's reached. I hear you. I hear that. I hear that that makes sense

365
0:29:27 --> 0:29:30
Yeah, so I feel like yeah, I feel like there's a great deal more scrutiny

366
0:29:30 --> 0:29:35
I just think we're more attuned to it now and it's one of those things where back in the day

367
0:29:35 --> 0:29:40
You get stuff like that. Well, he's a very he's a very successful man. Of course, he's got haters

368
0:29:40 --> 0:29:44
You know, of course, there's people after him and gonna start rumors and stuff

369
0:29:44 --> 0:29:49
But now with all the things that we do know about him and his and his crew

370
0:29:49 --> 0:29:51
I don't want to think my neck out

371
0:29:51 --> 0:29:55
I don't want to you know stepping at the way these guys are to the they can be very litigious

372
0:29:55 --> 0:30:01
But I don't think he's really that tan. I think that's I think that's fake. I think basic man is a fake

373
0:30:04 --> 0:30:06
Don't sue me up

374
0:30:06 --> 0:30:12
Okay, okay. That was that's Matt at hey scoops.com. That's who said that

375
0:30:13 --> 0:30:17
Tan is real. I think he's just I think he's just in a tanning bed

376
0:30:17 --> 0:30:20
I don't think he uses like oh, yeah, he's gone out of the beach

377
0:30:21 --> 0:30:25
No, so let's fight about that. No, so I

378
0:30:25 --> 0:30:25
Speaking of wrestling

379
0:30:26 --> 0:30:30
I've grown to love John Cena as peacemaker and John Cena as a comedic actor

380
0:30:30 --> 0:30:35
Sure, and I never watched any wrestling with John Cena. Okay

381
0:30:35 --> 0:30:37
So five move Charlie

382
0:30:37 --> 0:30:44
So he sat down to do an interview with Bill Simmons my favorite sports podcaster and talked to him for like over an hour

383
0:30:44 --> 0:30:51
I was like, all right, let's do it. And then it was all about his wrestling career and man

384
0:30:52 --> 0:30:56
You couldn't pay me to ever listen to John Cena talk about his wrestling career ever again

385
0:30:58 --> 0:31:05
The problem with that so I bought the I bought the problem with that Paul one of the problem

386
0:31:05 --> 0:31:12
I bought the WWE game from I'm gonna say three years ago two years ago three three years ago and

387
0:31:12 --> 0:31:15
Let's say three, let's say three, whatever

388
0:31:16 --> 0:31:21
The cop the conceit of this one was Cena, right?

389
0:31:21 --> 0:31:26
But not only Cena it was Cena recapping his biggest losses

390
0:31:26 --> 0:31:32
So that's the story mode that you play through you play through you play through as John Cena

391
0:31:32 --> 0:31:39
Through his biggest losses. Yeah, and the thing and he he entered he is interviewed between each match

392
0:31:39 --> 0:31:45
Talking about what he learned and what the atmosphere was like during this match and special things about the opponent

393
0:31:45 --> 0:31:49
I kind of thing and it just comes off so crazy

394
0:31:49 --> 0:31:52
Because like it's very

395
0:31:53 --> 0:31:59
This isn't real, right? Right. It's not real. Yeah things he's saying aren't really reason

396
0:31:59 --> 0:32:04
Oh boy, I knew coming into that ring was gonna be a real slobber knocker go

397
0:32:04 --> 0:32:09
I knew my competition with Andre the giant was gonna be exactly. It's like well

398
0:32:09 --> 0:32:11
I don't think you ever fought Andre

399
0:32:12 --> 0:32:15
But like an example because I listened to this fucking interview

400
0:32:15 --> 0:32:23
Yeah, like he had to lose very badly to Brock Lesnar so that okay put up against Brock Lesnar would be then considered

401
0:32:24 --> 0:32:25
so

402
0:32:25 --> 0:32:30
Amazingly great that they had to write champion. So in order to put I think it was Roman Reigns

403
0:32:31 --> 0:32:35
The belt he had to get beat beat up by Brock Lesnar very badly. That'd be okay

404
0:32:35 --> 0:32:42
They talked about like trying to like, you know way that now hard that was physically and everything else and you know

405
0:32:42 --> 0:32:44
No, it's not it shouldn't be

406
0:32:46 --> 0:32:52
No one gets hurt, I mean yes, it's painful it's stressful. It's very athletic

407
0:32:52 --> 0:32:57
But you shouldn't be interesting people. It's dangerous shit. It's dangerous

408
0:32:57 --> 0:33:02
Okay, hold on because I want to come back to this we do have to go to a sponsor real quick

409
0:33:02 --> 0:33:07

No, no not yet you haven't you never left I have other options we have all tubes

441
0:35:19 --> 0:35:26
How about something few people think of we have two worms

442
0:35:27 --> 0:35:28
two

443
0:35:28 --> 0:35:30
worms here at

444
0:35:31 --> 0:35:32
tuberculosis

445
0:35:32 --> 0:35:40
What about with two worms whatever you want place them inside of you the children of the night

446
0:35:40 --> 0:35:44
What beautiful music they make? Oh

447
0:35:44 --> 0:35:49
Ever heard the two worms make music they ever heard them sing in the moonlight

448
0:35:49 --> 0:35:57
No, well, you could get some and do it and the best way to hear them is by listening through a tube

449
0:35:57 --> 0:36:00
It will amplify the worm song

450
0:36:01 --> 0:36:06
You know, I thought you were nuts when I came in here, but you're winning me over and I don't have any nuts

451
0:36:06 --> 0:36:08
just tubes

452
0:36:08 --> 0:36:11
And her age check out

453
0:36:12 --> 0:36:18
That's a good sponsor seems like a good company. Oh, they are great. I don't know how they make any money

454
0:36:19 --> 0:36:24
I think from this just let people buy the tubes. They want but the guy doesn't have any fasteners

455
0:36:27 --> 0:36:29
To say worth shit

456
0:36:31 --> 0:36:34
Loose to this tube don't do fuck for you

457
0:36:35 --> 0:36:41
So I'm thinking about pro wrestling now, oh, oh danger zone is there

458
0:36:42 --> 0:36:48
Is it just impossible for people to pretend that someone is better?

459
0:36:49 --> 0:36:53
Than us or has won a championship or something like that

460
0:36:53 --> 0:36:59
Is it just impossible for us to just pretend that that's happening? Do we do we just fall into the trap of this is real?

461
0:36:59 --> 0:37:00
every time

462
0:37:00 --> 0:37:07
Is that why it matters to the WWF people or WWE people who wears the the fake championship belt?

463
0:37:07 --> 0:37:10
It's so strange because like I guess

464
0:37:11 --> 0:37:15
Cena on this last trip around came close to if not

465
0:37:16 --> 0:37:18
Eclipsed Rick Flair's

466
0:37:18 --> 0:37:20
title runs I

467
0:37:21 --> 0:37:26
Know he has I have seen that yeah, because it's seen it seen as like I don't remember

468
0:37:26 --> 0:37:31
It's been a couple more time 18 or 19 time world champion something like that. Yeah. Yeah

469
0:37:31 --> 0:37:35
Anyway, it's but it just like one or two above Rick Flair

470
0:37:36 --> 0:37:38
But you know

471
0:37:39 --> 0:37:45
What does it mean but having having the belt doesn't it doesn't actually mean you haven't actually won

472
0:37:46 --> 0:37:51
Also, you can't win it 17 times if you don't lose it 16

473
0:37:51 --> 0:37:54
So what the fuck is that? I think

474
0:37:55 --> 0:38:00
Good point. That's just good. That's also true. That's math. Yeah, that's that's just the math checks out on what Paul just said

475
0:38:00 --> 0:38:05
But I mean like really like you guys there's 16 guys who are clearly better than you

476
0:38:05 --> 0:38:10
They are still beholden to the crowd

477
0:38:11 --> 0:38:15
The crowd the live crowds and they're in and their audiences for sure

478
0:38:15 --> 0:38:19
Yes, if they make the wrong person champion, they hear about it, right? Oh, yes

479
0:38:19 --> 0:38:23
You know, it matters it matters for their business that certainly matters. Yeah

480
0:38:23 --> 0:38:32
Is more of like the mental is it is it possible for human beings to pretend that someone is the champion

481
0:38:33 --> 0:38:36
Without kind of falling into that trap

482
0:38:38 --> 0:38:44
Well, I think we should have every mouth finger butthole champion on this podcast come back on and talk about their lives after

483
0:38:44 --> 0:38:52
Winning mouth good boy. Good boy. I don't know eyes have changed you watch enough of that wrestling and it just gets

484
0:38:52 --> 0:38:54
It gets crazy

485
0:38:54 --> 0:38:58
I'll never know. I will never I will not put myself to that test

486
0:38:59 --> 0:39:04
My kids I would have if my kids got into wrestling I would have my kids did not get into wrestling

487
0:39:04 --> 0:39:09
And and I think thank goodness and I still love the old classic goofy shit

488
0:39:09 --> 0:39:14
I think it's funny as hell but I appreciate it just for the the goofiness of it all

489
0:39:15 --> 0:39:19
But then you start if you start to really scratch at it. It just gets sad real fast

490
0:39:20 --> 0:39:22
You know, well, you know most things you know

491
0:39:22 --> 0:39:27
They're they're plenty of spots on me if you scratch at them long enough. It gets real sad

492
0:39:27 --> 0:39:30
I often just stare at Jacob until I feel sad

493
0:39:30 --> 0:39:36
That's basically what I do to get it going to stare at Jacob while he's scratching when I want to drum up

494
0:39:36 --> 0:39:38
You said this I do that

495
0:39:39 --> 0:39:40
Um

496
0:39:41 --> 0:39:48
Paul yes, what are you asking for your wife free for yourself for Christmas? Oh

497
0:39:48 --> 0:39:49
nothing

498
0:39:50 --> 0:39:54
Do you guys get each other stuff? Yeah, I got I got and a

499
0:39:55 --> 0:39:59
New coffee maker and a giant and of Green Gables box set. Oh, by the way

500
0:39:59 --> 0:40:04
Yeah, I want to step on this for a second the amount of like ho ho ho someone works for Starbucks

501
0:40:04 --> 0:40:11
Good coffee maker at home. Stop pretending like every fucking employee of Starbucks becomes like some coffee goddess for they have

502
0:40:14 --> 0:40:20
Or whatever like it was possible to be a regular human being with an aged coffee maker

503
0:40:20 --> 0:40:25
This is the problem get a job at Starbucks. It was only it was only like three years old

504
0:40:25 --> 0:40:26
It was a good coffee maker

505
0:40:26 --> 0:40:31
It just happened to get a stink bug in it and that made her physically unable

506
0:40:32 --> 0:40:33
coffee maker anymore

507
0:40:35 --> 0:40:41
She legit just vomited everywhere. She couldn't look at the machine anymore without getting physically sick

508
0:40:41 --> 0:40:45
That's the there was nothing wrong with this coffee maker. It was fancy

509
0:40:45 --> 0:40:49
Damn, you know you press the shit and the new one. I got hers fucking fancy Dan

510
0:40:49 --> 0:40:55
It's got a milk steamer thing on it and all kind of hoodly-hoo. It's fancy. It's a nice coffee maker

511
0:40:55 --> 0:41:00
It was like, you know almost $200 coffee maker that I got on super sale at my old Tarjay

512
0:41:01 --> 0:41:08
Paying for itself there a little bit milk that milk spritzer doubles as a Swedish hot bidet if you use it properly

513
0:41:08 --> 0:41:11
An upside-down Swedish hot. Oh, you just gave me a nightmare

514
0:41:13 --> 0:41:18
Oh god damn talk about oh for fuck's sake

515
0:41:18 --> 0:41:22
Swedish hot bidet. Oh

516
0:41:22 --> 0:41:23
Damn it

517
0:41:23 --> 0:41:27
I can think a few things more horrific than

518
0:41:28 --> 0:41:34
Superheated items up the asshole and I know that was a medieval staple slow nowadays

519
0:41:34 --> 0:41:37
Oh, come on take talk. It's lower. No, no, no

520
0:41:38 --> 0:41:44
How hot is hot what I just what would you do like the the original the original pain

521
0:41:44 --> 0:41:47
of a blistering asshole and then

522
0:41:49 --> 0:41:53
What happens after that's even worse, oh my god, oh

523
0:41:53 --> 0:42:01
What happens after you shoot stevie milk into your asshole then the trouble starts that's what I but it really does it's

524
0:42:01 --> 0:42:03
It's Pandora's box

525
0:42:03 --> 0:42:04
It's Pandora's butthole

526
0:42:04 --> 0:42:09
You have opened Pandora's butthole and she will never shit right again

527
0:42:10 --> 0:42:17
My wife and I decided last night to not get anything for each other for our anniversary our anniversary is December 27th

528
0:42:17 --> 0:42:22

Somebody's got to the American January 3rd. Hey, technically my mom did for a while

0:42:46 --> 0:42:51
You get hit the holidays hit SJ hard because the my birthday is on December 18th

534
0:42:51 --> 0:42:54

535
0:42:55 --> 0:42:57
So this year, we're just we're gonna take a trip

536
0:42:58 --> 0:43:03
We've loosely decided there will be a trip for the anniversary at some point. Nice. Well, that is probably

537
0:43:05 --> 0:43:09
Your guys's love language if I can be corny, I think so, right?

538
0:43:09 --> 0:43:13
I think so like I don't think you guys care about getting each other jewelry

539
0:43:14 --> 0:43:19
We get we are people that especially me. I mean, I'm worse about it than SJ is

540
0:43:19 --> 0:43:22
If there's something I want I usually just get it same

541
0:43:22 --> 0:43:28
Like in November SJ's like quit buying yourself stuff. Other people need to be able to buy you things for Christmas

542
0:43:28 --> 0:43:32
I just my luggage. Oh man, so I was

543
0:43:32 --> 0:43:32
carrying

544
0:43:33 --> 0:43:39
So I get I get off of the ship at Fort Lauderdale and there's a house about about five blocks away

545
0:43:39 --> 0:43:45
You got to go down down to the light make a left about five blocks is Joe's Cafe old-fashioned diner

546
0:43:45 --> 0:43:47
And after you've had like deluxe

547
0:43:49 --> 0:43:54
Fucking opulent cruise ship food for for me two meals a day

548
0:43:54 --> 0:43:59
You just go like oh a diner with regular fucking eggs and regular fucking bacon

549
0:43:59 --> 0:44:05
Let's go and I often just you know, skip the uber line skip it. It's it's chaos in the port, right?

550
0:44:05 --> 0:44:07
So you just I just drag my bags

551
0:44:08 --> 0:44:11
This this trip I specifically was only doing 20-minute sets

552
0:44:11 --> 0:44:15
So I tried to only have one case and so I'm dragging my stuff and I'm going like man

553
0:44:15 --> 0:44:20
My case is heavy. I could put too much stuff in this case and I get all the way

554
0:44:20 --> 0:44:23
To Joe's and I don't realize I'm like covered in sweat

555
0:44:25 --> 0:44:32
And then I look and at some point at some point I busted a wheel off of my giant case and I didn't realize

556
0:44:32 --> 0:44:36
And I didn't realize I was fucking lugging. You were just dragging

557
0:44:36 --> 0:44:43
Dragging a case for blocks. Did it recognize? I was sweating. Yeah, no, it's it's toast, right? Oh, yeah

558
0:44:43 --> 0:44:49
So I should ask for luggage for Christmas when said I went on Amazon and immediately ordered myself a luggage thing that I wanted

559
0:44:51 --> 0:44:51
and

560
0:44:52 --> 0:44:59
But I was laughing at like I thought I'd packed too much stuff and instead I lugged something like an ogre

561
0:45:00 --> 0:45:02
like half a mile

562
0:45:02 --> 0:45:07
And I was like so gross. I didn't realize how gross I was I go like go to get a table and I'm like

563
0:45:07 --> 0:45:09
just like

564
0:45:09 --> 0:45:15
The waitress is like, you know, okay, can I get your water and I was like using the napkins like wipe

565
0:45:15 --> 0:45:24
Cuz it's Florida Florida humidity and I was like, oh, yeah. I just was the swamp monster sitting down the diner was so gross

566
0:45:25 --> 0:45:29
But yeah, I should have made me bacon bring it to me now

567
0:45:31 --> 0:45:35
I'm hungry. I have a thirst bring me coffee

568
0:45:40 --> 0:45:43
Yeah, so I should have I should have asked for luggage but I just got myself it

569
0:45:44 --> 0:45:49
So you guys not terrible about skip the anniversary December 27th anniversary, do you do Christmas gifts?

No ducks. No mayo packets. So nothing for you this time. Fuck you in the face. That's rich scoop

608
0:48:56 --> 0:49:02
Rich scoop some people would say it's cruel to send gifts to Matt and Paul through me

609
0:49:06 --> 0:49:10
Paul bought me the Batman absolute Batman

610
0:49:11 --> 0:49:17
Thing I love it. You did get through it. It's great, right? Yes. What is that? That's the comic book?

611
0:49:17 --> 0:49:18
What yeah, yeah

612
0:49:18 --> 0:49:23
Scott Snyder wrote Batman for a while the the main title for a while and I loved it

613
0:49:23 --> 0:49:26
He did the whole court of owls and then on some really wild stuff

614
0:49:26 --> 0:49:31
Really loved that so I checked out his new stuff and this

615
0:49:31 --> 0:49:36
Absolute Batman is just knocking it out of the park right now. So yeah, I got Matt the first

616
0:49:36 --> 0:49:39
I guess it's the first five books. Yeah in the series

617
0:49:39 --> 0:49:44
Would you like about it? I like spoilers possibly I guess yeah

618
0:49:44 --> 0:49:49
Yeah, but it's right right at the top is Alfred's not his he's not rich and Alfred's not his butler, right?

619
0:49:49 --> 0:49:54
And so Alfred is just this other guy who's like a trained worldwide assassin

620
0:49:54 --> 0:49:57
And he's like he's actually like meant to like track down

621
0:49:58 --> 0:50:00
Track down a group days of tracking down

622
0:50:00 --> 0:50:05
He runs into Batman and they realize they have to work with each other and it's really a different deal

623
0:50:07 --> 0:50:07
and

624
0:50:07 --> 0:50:14
Yeah, it's just it's just a it's Batman is younger guy and he's more this really frustrated almost like UFC fighter type person

625
0:50:14 --> 0:50:17
It's really it's really clever. It's very clever. Yeah, I

626
0:50:19 --> 0:50:24
Quite like it and yes Cooper Nova girl the new absolute Batman drops today

627
0:50:24 --> 0:50:26
I haven't made it out to the comic shop yet today

628
0:50:26 --> 0:50:29
I might but I'm not buying it week to week

629
0:50:29 --> 0:50:34
But this current week's issue the cover is the Joker the reveal of the absolute Joker

630
0:50:36 --> 0:50:41
Looks insane looks like some kind of fucking creature. I don't know how they're gonna explain it, but it looks pretty wild

631
0:50:41 --> 0:50:44
I guess again, I'm behind

632
0:50:45 --> 0:50:47
By like five or six issues

633
0:50:47 --> 0:50:49
I guess closer to ten by the time the trade comes out

634
0:50:49 --> 0:50:56
But I guess he went through his whole killer croc thing and a lot of his friends are now becoming the villains that they were

635
0:50:56 --> 0:50:59
Destined to become yeah. Yeah, that's happening

636
0:51:00 --> 0:51:08
Yeah, so it's interesting. Yeah, all all his childhood friends end up being the rogues gallery that Batman ends up fighting

637
0:51:08 --> 0:51:09
It's kind of wild

638
0:51:09 --> 0:51:10
Yeah

639
0:51:12 --> 0:51:18
All right is the it's just it's just take away take away his wealth being a superpower is probably one of the smartest things

640
0:51:18 --> 0:51:23
Coolest things you could have done. Oh, yeah, that is interesting. Yeah

641
0:51:24 --> 0:51:25
He's a little more

642
0:51:26 --> 0:51:31
Gotcha. I mean he he was always making up for it with with more more tech genius stuff

643
0:51:31 --> 0:51:37
He well, he was always the Tony Stark of the DC you or vice versa

644
0:51:37 --> 0:51:39
I don't know how you really look Batman and Iron Man are more

645
0:51:40 --> 0:51:44
akin to each other than you might think and it's always myself but in this like

646
0:51:45 --> 0:51:49
Michaels right, that's exactly right. He's a

647
0:51:49 --> 0:51:53
He's a construction worker. That's what makes him such a buff freak. That's a big part of it

648
0:51:53 --> 0:51:58
like he's he's going to school for for you know, Kim and all kinds of

649
0:51:59 --> 0:52:05
Super science stuff, but he's a construction worker. So like the Batmobile is a giant dump truck outfitted with armor and shit

650
0:52:06 --> 0:52:07
Yeah

651
0:52:07 --> 0:52:17
It's me. Let's do a little we're gonna save that email. We're gonna do a little jock versus nerd

652
0:52:17 --> 0:52:26
bullshit the hunt for balls

653
0:52:33 --> 0:52:35
The hunt for balls

654
0:52:35 --> 0:52:42
I'm Batman a real real quick Batman one last thing lemur creamer was asking do they keep his parents?

655
0:52:42 --> 0:52:48
So in this retelling he loses his father early on that's definitive, but his mom is still with him

656
0:52:48 --> 0:52:51
So that's a whole nother dynamic to that. His mother is still

657
0:52:51 --> 0:52:54
It's a very much alive and very much part of his life

658
0:52:55 --> 0:53:01
It is for the city and then they're after like politicians and stuff. So it's neat. Mm-hmm. Huh?

659
0:53:01 --> 0:53:02
All right

660
0:53:02 --> 0:53:04
We're gonna scoop it today from the Swedish scoop

You must remember this a kiss is still a kiss. It's as time goes by as time goes by

666
0:53:33 --> 0:53:40
And when two lovers whoo, they still say I love you or that you can rely

1:05:02 --> 1:05:03
I

806
1:05:03 --> 1:05:10
Should wait until disco closes to to talk about this pet peeve I have but I'm not gonna

807
1:05:10 --> 1:05:18
Okay. Okay, the disco riot Kaminsky Park was not an actual event that killed disco

808
1:05:18 --> 1:05:23
What it was was an event that was supposed to be it was drummed up by a radio DJ a DJ

809
1:05:23 --> 1:05:29
I'll do it and it ended up being this incredibly racist event where everyone brought a bunch of blues and R&B records

810
1:05:30 --> 1:05:35
To it and then it broke out of this riot, but it was basically racially fueled

811
1:05:35 --> 1:05:39
So it's one of the most weirdest reported things in it

812
1:05:39 --> 1:05:46
Well, it's used as a cornerstone in the disco show where I'm like, that's not what happened as a baby child of the 70s

813
1:05:46 --> 1:05:49
I remember growing up with that whole disco sucks thing

814
1:05:49 --> 1:05:55
Yeah coming through his baby turns out that whole mantra that whole movement was just anti

815
1:05:56 --> 1:06:01
LGBTQIA stuff man, it was just yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It's all racist and racist

816
1:06:01 --> 1:06:05
Yeah, but I mean, you know, it's all just stems from don't let people enjoy

817
1:06:06 --> 1:06:14
The music that supports their their lifestyle and their culture. It's just awful. It's awful. This country is crazy

818
1:06:14 --> 1:06:18
Steve doll. Yeah, that's the DJ I think right Laurie. Yeah, fuck that guy

819
1:06:18 --> 1:06:23
Yeah, I think he ended up didn't get in trouble for all that shit

820
1:06:23 --> 1:06:27
Like a lot of destruction of property and stuff that happened on his yes

821
1:06:28 --> 1:06:35
It fucked up like the ballpark and stuff. I think yeah, I think he ended up being on the hook for some financial stuff

822
1:06:35 --> 1:06:36
Maybe even did some jail time

823
1:06:36 --> 1:06:40
I don't know back when there's a bunch of like niche cool podcast companies coming out this one

824
1:06:40 --> 1:06:42
I'm trying to I can't remember remember it now

825
1:06:42 --> 1:06:48
but there's a podcast that interviewed basically a black usher from Kaminsky Park and

826
1:06:48 --> 1:06:52
His and in his breakdown of what happened the day disco died

827
1:06:52 --> 1:06:54
It was a really great podcast

828
1:06:55 --> 1:06:59
At one point he basically has to like hide and run

829
1:07:00 --> 1:07:04
Because of what was happening in the park. What's that on? I have to find it. It's been so long

830
1:07:04 --> 1:07:07
It's listen to it forever ago, but obviously that a huge impact on me

831
1:07:08 --> 1:07:12
Swedish scoop is saying that was a double header and the second game had to be forfeited

832
1:07:13 --> 1:07:17
Laurie is saying it was a huge deal, but I believe they had to just call the game. No jail time

833
1:07:18 --> 1:07:19
Yeah, oh boy

834
1:07:20 --> 1:07:25
Yeah, there you go. There you go. All right. Well on that let's end on that high note, huh fellas

835
1:07:28 --> 1:07:32
