Hey a quick announcement for anyone who might come see me in Chicago

19
0:01:51 --> 0:01:56
I am not doing the Friday night show. I'm doing the Thursday to Saturday to Sunday, but Friday

20
0:01:57 --> 0:02:01
I got booked through this corporate thing. So I'm literally going to leave Chicago

21
0:02:01 --> 0:02:04
Go to Missouri and come back to Chicago and finish the run

22
0:02:05 --> 0:02:07
Holy, so you're not doing the show in Chicago and it's a good thing

23
0:02:08 --> 0:02:11
Yeah, I mean I was one of those things were like the I couldn't turn it down

24
0:02:11 --> 0:02:16
For the for the money and I said do I have to lose the whole weekend or can you replace me for just one night?

25
0:02:16 --> 0:02:18
And I said we can replace you for just one night

26
0:02:18 --> 0:02:24
Which is very unusual. So I was very very happy. That's wonderful if they did that for you. Yes

27
0:02:24 --> 0:02:28
Yeah, maybe maybe somebody was in town or something. So does that mean another airplane trip?

28
0:02:29 --> 0:02:35
It do you have to go to the airport fly to st. Louis drive two hours to do the show. Oh my god

29
0:02:36 --> 0:02:39
That bit the amount of money that makes that worth it. So it's fine

30
0:02:40 --> 0:02:47
Precisely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, there is an amount of money that I will I will go to the st. Louis airport today

31
0:02:47 --> 0:02:52
I actually was warned they're like they're like this is going to be just a bunch of drunk people

32
0:02:53 --> 0:02:54
Fucking with you

33
0:02:55 --> 0:02:59
Basically being told it was blood money. Do you want to do it? I was like, yep

34
0:02:59 --> 0:03:07
I was like, I'm fine with blood money a corporate paycheck before before christmas. Certainly that sounds lovely

35
0:03:07 --> 0:03:13
Do you get to bring your beers this time because of that kind of situation? I don't give them actual beers

36
0:03:14 --> 0:03:14
Yeah

37
0:03:15 --> 0:03:17
Oh, good point. I should just give out actual beers

38
0:03:18 --> 0:03:19
Yeah, yeah

39
0:03:19 --> 0:03:25
If there are there already what the fuck you're just I believe it's called piling on. Yeah

40
0:03:26 --> 0:03:29
Is anyone in here in Missouri scoop? Is there like a Missouri trash beer?

41
0:03:29 --> 0:03:35
That's like locally like a good trash beer in Missouri. That's that's oh, would that be like a yingling or something?

42
0:03:36 --> 0:03:39
That's a pennsylvania trash beer. Thank you very much

43
0:03:39 --> 0:03:41
My wife loves the yinglings

44
0:03:44 --> 0:03:44
Um

45
0:03:44 --> 0:03:46
No, I think it's the answer

46
0:03:47 --> 0:03:54
Oh, Mike Nielsen of the chat just says everything in Missouri is trash. So that's good news, man. You're you're safe. You're safe. You're safe

47
0:03:54 --> 0:03:55
So

48
0:03:57 --> 0:04:01
I switched it in text to some other beer when we did brushwoods that one time

49
0:04:01 --> 0:04:07
I forget I forget now the name of that beer. Oh, there's like larnstar and farts star. Yeah farts star farts star

50
0:04:08 --> 0:04:15
Oh old style Chicago's a good it might be a good call. That's a that's a nice, uh cheap beer old style

51
0:04:18 --> 0:04:20
Just go like

52
0:04:21 --> 0:04:25
Go like oh do they still make those fucking ones with the old men?

53
0:04:25 --> 0:04:28
Who drank a Bartles and James?

54
0:04:30 --> 0:04:34
Do they still make Bartles and James the wine cooler? Yeah

55
0:04:35 --> 0:04:35
I

56
0:04:36 --> 0:04:39
Had no idea where you're going with the two old men

57
0:04:40 --> 0:04:45
Do they still make schlitz uh lory elsroth? Oh schlitz schlitz is

58
0:04:45 --> 0:04:51
In the era of pats blue ribbon schlitz is also a comedy word

59
0:04:51 --> 0:04:54
Yeah, schlitz is a great word as is blats

60
0:04:56 --> 0:05:01
Ranch slunk coming through with blats valentine's there's valentine's ale back in the day

61
0:05:01 --> 0:05:06
Mm-hmm. Anyhow, I'll figure it out. I'll figure it out schlitz

62
0:05:07 --> 0:05:14
Sliding on uh, yes schlitz is still made and is currently owned by uh pats brood company. There we go. Wow

63
0:05:14 --> 0:05:18
Yeah, they probably bought all the vintage and they reintroduced the original 1960s formula

64
0:05:19 --> 0:05:25
It's it's brood and milwaukie. They but milwaukie as we know milwaukie in missouri both start with an m

65
0:05:25 --> 0:05:25
So I think that's fine

66
0:05:26 --> 0:05:28
they have a uh

67
0:05:29 --> 0:05:31
Some kind of cornered market

68
0:05:32 --> 0:05:33
on all the

69
0:05:34 --> 0:05:36
Nasty sounding names for beers

70
0:05:36 --> 0:05:41
This is classic old beers. This is classic old factory worker beers, man. They all just sounded like

71
0:05:42 --> 0:05:42
bodily functions

72
0:05:43 --> 0:05:43
shapers

73
0:05:44 --> 0:05:49
Yeah, oh god. I got a bad case of the shapers. I should have I should have got the vax when I had the chance

74
0:05:50 --> 0:05:52
No, I'm going I'm going through milwaukie

75
0:05:52 --> 0:05:53
uh

76
0:05:53 --> 0:05:55
with the with the jokers of magic

77
0:05:55 --> 0:05:55
um

78
0:05:56 --> 0:06:02
I was there last time we built the foolershow in milwaukie and doing paps at the paps center was like so fun

79
0:06:03 --> 0:06:04
Oh, right. Um

80
0:06:05 --> 0:06:09
I thought it was more cool than the audience did the audience didn't give a shit, but um

81
0:06:09 --> 0:06:10
I thought it was super fun

82
0:06:11 --> 0:06:13
They paps their prime

83
0:06:14 --> 0:06:15
Yep, they're paps. They're paps

84
0:06:17 --> 0:06:21
Uh, I finished up my uh f1 weekend. Uh, oh, yeah

85
0:06:22 --> 0:06:23
Oh, yeah, how was the rest of f1?

86
0:06:24 --> 0:06:25
Well, yeah, I was uh

87
0:06:25 --> 0:06:28
Basically trying to figure out the story didn't end well last time we were recording

88
0:06:28 --> 0:06:32
So I didn't get into too much of the nitty gritty details, but right the bottom line is uh

89
0:06:33 --> 0:06:38
They thought it'd be really funny to have two inept announcers announce some of the marquis events at the ski lodge

90
0:06:39 --> 0:06:44
For all three nights at at the uh at the f at the mercedes tent, right?

91
0:06:45 --> 0:06:45
um

92
0:06:45 --> 0:06:48
And the race is about an hour and a half long

93
0:06:49 --> 0:06:50
and having inept announcers

94
0:06:51 --> 0:06:52
uh

95
0:06:52 --> 0:06:55
For an hour and a half for an hour and a half is a little is a little long

96
0:06:55 --> 0:06:59
Are you one of the inept announcers? Yes. That's that was my job

97
0:07:01 --> 0:07:02
I mean was it

98
0:07:03 --> 0:07:04
Did you have breaks?

99
0:07:05 --> 0:07:11
Yes, or more importantly did the audience have breaks? Well, we we we eventually we figured out. Yes

100
0:07:12 --> 0:07:14
you know good good so, uh, we

101
0:07:15 --> 0:07:22
But uh, it was funny was like so we we were brought in right and then we came up with all these things for all these characters to be

102
0:07:22 --> 0:07:25
I came up with stetson barber. You can call me big barbie

103
0:07:26 --> 0:07:27
and uh

104
0:07:28 --> 0:07:32
We were going to do all these games and everything and uh

105
0:07:33 --> 0:07:36
All of a sudden we were at our first brainstorm session and they said oh

106
0:07:36 --> 0:07:40
We just have to you know film something and send it to Mercedes just so they know what's going on. Oh jesus

107
0:07:42 --> 0:07:44
Exactly exactly exactly exactly

108
0:07:45 --> 0:07:46
Just instantly

109
0:07:46 --> 0:07:51
So I was like film what like what are we shooting over right and it was like, you know

110
0:07:51 --> 0:07:53
And so it was it was me and uh, kasey wilson, right?

111
0:07:54 --> 0:07:57
friend of the friend of the show we love kasey

112
0:07:57 --> 0:08:00
and Mercedes based out of

113
0:08:00 --> 0:08:01
germany

114
0:08:01 --> 0:08:03
well, yeah international

115
0:08:04 --> 0:08:04
international

116
0:08:05 --> 0:08:08
automobile behemoth Mercedes Benz. Yeah, where's their

117
0:08:09 --> 0:08:10
Core base is the germany?

118
0:08:11 --> 0:08:14
I mean they're they're originally from germany. I don't know where they're based now

119
0:08:14 --> 0:08:17
Right exactly. I now's your chance to put on your best german

120
0:08:18 --> 0:08:21
And give them the kind of inept announcer

121
0:08:21 --> 0:08:22
That's really gonna sell it

122
0:08:22 --> 0:08:28
My lieber I can't believe what has happened with the car

123
0:08:28 --> 0:08:32
The tires they're rolling over and over the potholes

124
0:08:32 --> 0:08:34
And and the potholes are wet

125
0:08:35 --> 0:08:37
Why are we so much rain in the vegas?

126
0:08:40 --> 0:08:46
The rain didn't do the effect. How many cars are there? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

127
0:08:46 --> 0:08:48
nine nine cars

128
0:08:48 --> 0:08:50
There are nine cars. nine

129
0:08:52 --> 0:08:59
Uh, Mercedes still based in germany. Yes Mercedes are going to Benz the rules to win. That is what we do

130
0:09:03 --> 0:09:06
So, uh, uh, who welcomed f1. I'm your host Dieter

131
0:09:07 --> 0:09:08
exactly

132
0:09:08 --> 0:09:11
Now it's a time on sprockets for every race

133
0:09:12 --> 0:09:14
That's that's next year, man. You just beat Dieter

134
0:09:16 --> 0:09:19
So we're filming by the way like kasey and I came in for like a brain door

135
0:09:19 --> 0:09:23
You know a day at the office brainstorming session. We weren't dressed

136
0:09:24 --> 0:09:27
Like particularly flashy or well or in character or anything

137
0:09:29 --> 0:09:33
And so you didn't have your uh, you had your casual tuxedo on not your show tuxedo

138
0:09:33 --> 0:09:39
And so we had different people to manage the project different people to brainstorm. There wasn't necessarily a distinct director

139
0:09:42 --> 0:09:45
So we're going to make this video. I was like, what's so what's this video?

140
0:09:45 --> 0:09:48
I'm like, they just want to see stuff and I was like, which stuff, you know

141
0:09:48 --> 0:09:49
and so

142
0:09:50 --> 0:09:56
I kind of help orchestrate like a four phase flow to take one of the video right good

143
0:09:56 --> 0:10:00
And we finish and I go, okay. Well, that's the take and then I go

144
0:10:00 --> 0:10:03
We can we can cut up the best bits of that maybe it may be we'll do another run

145
0:10:04 --> 0:10:08
Uh, and we'll just do fresh bits. Uh, who who's editing this?

146
0:10:09 --> 0:10:09
Oh

147
0:10:10 --> 0:10:10
Oh

148
0:10:11 --> 0:10:13
Sweet summer child matt

149
0:10:15 --> 0:10:17
They're getting this raw. They're gonna be lucky

150
0:10:18 --> 0:10:20
You know what this is it's going to be on a flash card

151
0:10:20 --> 0:10:25
Mailed by a ups and it's going to get there in five weeks. They're going to be like, what's this loss?

152
0:10:26 --> 0:10:32
Oh, I was I was expecting you to say what are you talking about matt? I just sent it

153
0:10:32 --> 0:10:36
Right, that is basically what was what was happening. Oh shit

154
0:10:36 --> 0:10:37
so

155
0:10:37 --> 0:10:40
Our project was like, well, I don't see myself like editing a lot. I mean I can cut the

156
0:10:40 --> 0:10:42
There, but I'm gonna

157
0:10:43 --> 0:10:45
I don't see myself doing a lot

158
0:10:45 --> 0:10:51
That dang jaco, we need to get you that t-shirt. I don't I don't see myself doing a lot of editing here

159
0:10:55 --> 0:10:57
Hold on so

160
0:10:58 --> 0:11:04
Uh, I was like, well if we're not editing then I don't think we should do a second take right like because we're we're not gonna

161
0:11:07 --> 0:11:10
We're not gonna come we can't we can't edit the takes together

162
0:11:10 --> 0:11:13
And the magic's gonna be lost by the time it gets around to the second roll, right? Yeah

163
0:11:14 --> 0:11:18
You're gonna watch 20 minutes of stuff instead of 10 minutes of stuff that you know, whatever

164
0:11:19 --> 0:11:20
and so

165
0:11:21 --> 0:11:26
I I'm like, and I was like, I feel like I feel like this is a bad idea

166
0:11:27 --> 0:11:30
You were you were right matt. You were right. Your instincts were dead

167
0:11:30 --> 0:11:35
I was like, we're not really showing them what we can do or whatever and they go

168
0:11:35 --> 0:11:37
No, they just want a gist of what's going on

169
0:11:40 --> 0:11:41
And I was said

170
0:11:41 --> 0:11:48
It's a casey. I was like, I've never known any corporate client let alone even production companies. I've pitched projects to

171
0:11:49 --> 0:11:53
To show a single ounce of imagination when it comes to like what's going on

172
0:11:53 --> 0:11:58
Nobody wants the gist of it. They want to see what the finished product is

173
0:11:58 --> 0:12:01
The only thing that that kind of video does

174
0:12:01 --> 0:12:05
Is let a middle management person say no

175
0:12:05 --> 0:12:09
That's exactly what I was thinking. I was like, I was like, I that's all I was thinking. I was like, oh gosh

176
0:12:09 --> 0:12:12
I might not get to do this gig. That's all it is

177
0:12:13 --> 0:12:16
That's all that is that's all that that's all they do is say no

178
0:12:17 --> 0:12:21
Because they're so scared to death of taking credit for anything that could go wrong

179
0:12:22 --> 0:12:22
right now

180
0:12:23 --> 0:12:23
to

181
0:12:24 --> 0:12:25
My cruise credit

182
0:12:26 --> 0:12:31
They this is not their first radio with Mercedes, right? So they've gone around around with them before

183
0:12:31 --> 0:12:35
So they kind of knew what Mercedes likes. Well, they just simply

184
0:12:36 --> 0:12:40
Been like, you know, they've simply presented stuff where Mercedes was skeptical

185
0:12:40 --> 0:12:45
And then all of a sudden it goes off without a hitch and they're and they're happy and thrilled them

186
0:12:45 --> 0:12:51
Okay. Oh, so I that's true. The the company has some credit with the with the car company. Yeah

187
0:12:52 --> 0:12:55
Like for example, this is a multiple times that I was I was performing a thing called the ski lodge

188
0:12:55 --> 0:12:59
I'm sure the first time they said, hey, we want to shove a giant ski lodge in the back of your

189
0:13:00 --> 0:13:06
Hospitality area. They were kind of I'm sure the first thing was like what what how does that make me sure some eyebrows went up

190
0:13:06 --> 0:13:06
Right

191
0:13:07 --> 0:13:10
And now it's like some people's like favorite part of the whole attraction

192
0:13:10 --> 0:13:15
And so now nice lodge has been getting bigger and bigger with each race and this is like the fourth race

193
0:13:15 --> 0:13:20
They've had a ski lodge, right? Very cool. It's going to be an alpine village by the time

194
0:13:20 --> 0:13:25
The next race, right? I hope so. I mean, I doubt I'll be at some point. I hope so

195
0:13:25 --> 0:13:29
It's just going to be the winter olympics happening and an f1 race breaks out

196
0:13:33 --> 0:13:34
And uh

197
0:13:35 --> 0:13:38
So they're setting off the video and then all of a sudden I get a call

198
0:13:38 --> 0:13:41
I was like, hey, instead of uh noon to three tomorrow, can you come from 11 to five?

199
0:13:45 --> 0:13:49
Hold on. I'm just doing some some quick back of the napkin math here

200
0:13:51 --> 0:13:55
And I joke I wrote the video went over that well, huh?

201
0:13:59 --> 0:14:00
Yeah

202
0:14:01 --> 0:14:07
Did anyone I know the answer to this did anyone acknowledge that maybe we shouldn't have said that video?

203
0:14:07 --> 0:14:13
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We have notes. We have notes. No

204
0:14:14 --> 0:14:14
No

205
0:14:15 --> 0:14:20
No one will ever say in any industry. I don't know. Maybe I think I did yesterday. I just shouldn't have done it

206
0:14:21 --> 0:14:27
But this is where the uh, uh, uh, our our team leader was super smart

207
0:14:27 --> 0:14:29
We came in the state for a long time

208
0:14:29 --> 0:14:32
And uh case and I brought in stuff to look more professional

209
0:14:33 --> 0:14:34
uh

210
0:14:34 --> 0:14:37
And smart smart they said let's do another round

211
0:14:37 --> 0:14:41
But let's bring in everyone from the office and let's do it with a with an audience

212
0:14:42 --> 0:14:45
Oh, that's smart. It was smart. It was smart

213
0:14:46 --> 0:14:50
Uh, oh because your stuff reads with human beings

214
0:14:51 --> 0:14:52
Not just yeah

215
0:14:52 --> 0:14:53
Of course, no

216
0:14:54 --> 0:14:59
That's exactly how it is god. It's okay. They just want the gist of it. It's so different

217
0:14:59 --> 0:15:04
It's honestly it's why I love how we're doing our recordings now with our live audience

218
0:15:04 --> 0:15:09
It helps me tremendously when I'm doing my bits to see if people give it half a damn about it

219
0:15:09 --> 0:15:12
Right, right. Sometimes it do the answer is no, but

220
0:15:13 --> 0:15:16
Once in a while

221
0:15:19 --> 0:15:25
It's such a pleasant surprise everybody's like fuck that shit. We all hate they're all throwing their hands up

222
0:15:25 --> 0:15:27
Give me the booze

223
0:15:28 --> 0:15:32
Yeah, just thumbs down to camera. Yeah, get the fuck out of here, man

224
0:15:32 --> 0:15:36
With your garbage. They're just waiting for you to put on a bikini and do shots in a hot tub

225
0:15:36 --> 0:15:39
That's like all like all the other twitch broadcasts figured out honestly

226
0:15:39 --> 0:15:45
I've been waiting for that for 12 years start up and only fans and just do it. I'd fucking do it

227
0:15:45 --> 0:15:51
There probably is a market. I don't know. I've already got something of a user base. Maybe I should look into it

228
0:15:51 --> 0:15:52
Why not? It's already a market

229
0:15:52 --> 0:15:57
Wait a second Jacob. Did you just hear that in 20 seconds? Paul talked himself into doing an only fans like

230
0:15:57 --> 0:16:00
Oh, you think I've been thinking about this just today son

231
0:16:01 --> 0:16:08
Please you started with I can't do an only fans and then in three sentences said I guess I can

232
0:16:09 --> 0:16:09
I can't

233
0:16:11 --> 0:16:12
I'm doing one right now

234
0:16:16 --> 0:16:22
There was there was somebody who wanted us to do an only fans and do like uh stand up

235
0:16:22 --> 0:16:27
On on only fans. Do you remember that several years ago? I don't wait. I don't remember this at all

236
0:16:27 --> 0:16:33
Someone told us that we should do comedy somebody pitch this to us that we should do uh stand up and uh improv

237
0:16:33 --> 0:16:35
On our only fans. Oh

238
0:16:36 --> 0:16:39
And I think we all had that reaction. I think we all went like oh

239
0:16:39 --> 0:16:40
All right

240
0:16:44 --> 0:16:46
We've already failed to thrive on twitch

241
0:16:46 --> 0:16:50
We might as well add another platform that we tank on we should just do that

242
0:16:50 --> 0:16:52
Hey your definition of thrive

243
0:16:53 --> 0:16:58
Pump the brakes. We can get on every platform that is made for something else and do comedy

244
0:17:02 --> 0:17:08
Just just us uh doing doing live performances where people just tell take our clothes off while we do it

245
0:17:08 --> 0:17:13
The truth is I'd be really refreshing. I've never felt that attraction, you know that that kind of attention before

246
0:17:13 --> 0:17:18
It'd be fun matt take off your pants. Oh wow take take him off matt. It feels good

247
0:17:18 --> 0:17:21
Yeah, it's nice and airy right you guys start pantsless fridays

248
0:17:22 --> 0:17:25
I I get that uh, I get that I would be um

249
0:17:26 --> 0:17:27
I get that it would get old

250
0:17:27 --> 0:17:34
You know for for any for any of our more attractive listeners out there who who suffer harassment on the on the regular basis

251
0:17:34 --> 0:17:38
I'm not trying to belittle your harassment. I understand that maybe we get old

252
0:17:38 --> 0:17:42
It's just never happened to me. So uh, it's a novelty at this point

253
0:17:42 --> 0:17:47
I think if you open up a channel called bare necessities, I think you'd be a hit and I think that's all I need

254
0:17:48 --> 0:17:52
Be good to go might be a different demographic than you're used to but I think you're ready to rock

255
0:17:52 --> 0:17:55
Attention is attention and money is money, man. I don't know

256
0:17:55 --> 0:17:56
It sure is

257
0:17:57 --> 0:18:02
I think it would be hard to you know, tell the kids don't come upstairs daddy's doing a bare photo shoot for his only fans

258
0:18:03 --> 0:18:07
Like it might be a little tougher to pull off though. You're right. It it would be hard

259
0:18:09 --> 0:18:10
Real hard

260
0:18:11 --> 0:18:13
Lumberjack in it. That's a great name

261
0:18:13 --> 0:18:15
That's not a bad one

262
0:18:16 --> 0:18:17
That's not a bad one

263
0:18:17 --> 0:18:21
Yeah, I found the like ML Kennedy. Hey scoop starts a farmer's only profile

264
0:18:21 --> 0:18:26
Get my my flannels on here. That's all I need

265
0:18:27 --> 0:18:31

271
0:18:50 --> 0:18:56
No, that was another twitch channel. I don't know how that came up. Oh weird. That's weird only flannels has a twitch channel already

272
0:18:57 --> 0:19:01
Only flannels.com seems to be a twitch channel. Okay

273
0:19:02 --> 0:19:04
So I guess that's it smart

274
0:19:05 --> 0:19:08
Somebody beat us to it. Yeah, good job

275
0:19:08 --> 0:19:12
Or they I'll tell you who else uh beat us to that

277
0:19:19 --> 0:19:22
Today's show Matt and mantley's ice cream social is brought to you by

278
0:19:24 --> 0:19:27
Marcus McGillicuddy's luxury abandoned homes

279
0:19:27 --> 0:19:32
That's from george scoops stanza in 2024. That's a great scoop name

280
0:19:32 --> 0:19:33
Uh

281
0:19:33 --> 0:19:36
Marcus McGillicuddy's luxury abandoned homes

282
0:19:36 --> 0:19:39
Oh and Marcus McGillicuddy

283
0:19:39 --> 0:19:42
I came over to the united states

284
0:19:42 --> 0:19:44
And I moved to florida

285
0:19:44 --> 0:19:49
Here in the caves I bought a lot of luxury apartments

286
0:19:50 --> 0:19:55
But they've gone unused for years and they're rotting from the inside

287
0:19:56 --> 0:19:59
What what that means for you?

288
0:19:59 --> 0:20:00
Value

289
0:20:01 --> 0:20:01
That's right

290
0:20:01 --> 0:20:08
You can get value from my open apartments what nobody's been in for years

291
0:20:09 --> 0:20:14
Come on down and get your case a legionaire's disease from my old pipes

292
0:20:15 --> 0:20:21
And a bunch of mold. Have you seen those moldy spiders? What have we gotten going on now?

293
0:20:21 --> 0:20:22
You seen them

294
0:20:22 --> 0:20:28
There's a cryptid spider mold. What's taking them over and turning them into looking like

295
0:20:28 --> 0:20:32
We creepy snowflakes. Oh, we got plenty of those don't we?

296
0:20:33 --> 0:20:37
Come on over now what I meant to say at the top a minute again

297
0:20:38 --> 0:20:39
Value

298
0:20:39 --> 0:20:41
You won't stay for a dollar

299
0:20:42 --> 0:20:44
You can stay for a dollar

300
0:20:44 --> 0:20:46
And I do not care how long

301
0:20:47 --> 0:20:51
That's an indeterminate lease what i'm offering you. You give me one dollar

302
0:20:51 --> 0:20:55
You can stay in the abandoned place as long as you want

303
0:20:55 --> 0:20:58
You understand as long as you want

304
0:20:59 --> 0:21:02
But you do have to put it with the spiders

305
0:21:03 --> 0:21:06
And the legionaire's disease and the squatters

306
0:21:07 --> 0:21:10
There's already a lot of squatters in me abandoned place

307
0:21:11 --> 0:21:15
I shouldn't have never bought it when I saw there was already a squatter in there

308
0:21:15 --> 0:21:20
I shouldn't have done it but I did but you know I didn't pay much

309
0:21:20 --> 0:21:27
I paid like 40 grand to this guy and I got like 18 high-rise apartment buildings for 40 grand

310
0:21:27 --> 0:21:30
I thought that's pretty good turns out the tax lien on him

311
0:21:31 --> 0:21:37
18 million who knew well I've had a done with due diligence I would

312
0:21:37 --> 0:21:41
But didn't I saw it don't how about you

313
0:21:42 --> 0:21:47
Come and stay and then you know you can buy him off of me for a dollar

314
0:21:47 --> 0:21:53
I'll sell him real cheap now you do have the tax lien liability while that goes over but

315
0:21:54 --> 0:21:56
Who's coming for it? I mean really?

316
0:21:58 --> 0:22:01
Nobody nobody's coming to take it take it from a McGillicuddy

317
0:22:01 --> 0:22:05
You can trust me no one's come to collect from me

318
0:22:06 --> 0:22:08
No one wants these old abandoned high-rises

319
0:22:09 --> 0:22:11
Except for circus folk

320
0:22:12 --> 0:22:17
Apparently circus folk are real interested in abandoned high-rises had I had a wee lad

321
0:22:17 --> 0:22:23
And a fat man come over and say hey, how about we take your place for circus use?

322
0:22:23 --> 0:22:24
I don't know

323
0:22:25 --> 0:22:29
What are you the big guy and he says yeah, I'm the fat man in the circus and the little guy says yeah

324
0:22:29 --> 0:22:31
I'm the little guy in the circus

325
0:22:31 --> 0:22:35
And then sure enough they had a giraffe with them too

326
0:22:35 --> 0:22:39
And a monkey and a lady who could dance on a zebra's back

327
0:22:40 --> 0:22:45
I couldn't believe it and she said I'd kind of do anything but dance on a zebra's back

328
0:22:45 --> 0:22:53
I can't dance on regular surfaces because they're too flat and require the spine of a zebra to impact my

329
0:22:53 --> 0:22:59
Feet in order to enable my dancing. I thought that's strange, isn't it? That doesn't make a whole lot of sense

330
0:22:59 --> 0:23:03
Turns out they weren't circus people at all. They were aliens

331
0:23:04 --> 0:23:07
So these high-rise apartments are very

332
0:23:08 --> 0:23:12
Very nice looking to the aliens who are coming to take us over

333
0:23:12 --> 0:23:17
I should have known from the one guy who was real big and fat and the little guy there's little guy crawled in him

334
0:23:17 --> 0:23:20
They later on they crawled inside of him

335
0:23:21 --> 0:23:25
Yeah, I should have known there's something fish something alien going on about that. I should have asked

336
0:23:25 --> 0:23:27
I'm the lady who dances on zebras

337
0:23:28 --> 0:23:29
She didn't have a zebra

338
0:23:30 --> 0:23:35
You know like she didn't have a zebra. They didn't have a giraffe though

339
0:23:36 --> 0:23:40
At least that's what they told me it was could have been a stretched out dog

340
0:23:42 --> 0:23:44
I'm not a hundred percent

341
0:23:45 --> 0:23:48
I don't know anyway. Come on by

342
0:23:49 --> 0:23:54
Try out my houses. What are rotten from the inside? They're not good

343
0:23:54 --> 0:23:57
I'm tired of selling them the alien circus people

344
0:23:58 --> 0:23:59
Hey scoops check out

345
0:24:01 --> 0:24:07
That was a that was a good take one. Let's let's go back to one do it again one from the top everybody here you go

0:24:08 --> 0:24:13
McGillicuddy and action luxury abandoned homes. Hello. I'm Matt McGillicuddy

347
0:24:14 --> 0:24:18
Selling luxury abandoned homes, isn't it? Yeah. Look, I tell you what

348
0:24:19 --> 0:24:25
These homes are luxury and abandoned because they're overrun with mice

349
0:24:25 --> 0:24:26
That's just the truth

350
0:24:28 --> 0:24:31
Cut right to it. It's all mice

351
0:24:31 --> 0:24:39
Enter hey scoops a check. Oh, here's the thing. It's not like you think it's old stuff from Fry's electronics

352
0:24:42 --> 0:24:44
It's actual wired mice

353
0:24:45 --> 0:24:48
filling the houses from stim to stern

354
0:24:49 --> 0:24:53
You can't swing a cat in here and not hit a wired mouse. Please don't

355
0:24:54 --> 0:24:56
Don't swing a cat. Yes

356
0:24:56 --> 0:24:58
Oh damn it

357
0:24:58 --> 0:25:00

362
0:25:17 --> 0:25:21
Concert on the stage in my backyard last night. Wait, what?

0:25:35 --> 0:25:40
So we outfitted the stage in the backyard. When did you get the thing now? When did you get that? I have truss

Did you have the there's still the only ones that have signed the stage? I was gonna say

0:26:12 --> 0:26:14
The new band will have to sign the stage

378
0:26:15 --> 0:26:19
We haven't named the new band yet. Is is an as-yet unnamed band

0:27:42 --> 0:27:43
You pick

395
0:27:45 --> 0:27:47
Butch and bitch present

396
0:27:47 --> 0:27:55
But general rock general rock is not bad. What to have um

397
0:27:57 --> 0:28:01
Who were the the two with the shootout and body and Clyde

398
0:28:01 --> 0:28:04
Bonnie and Clyde. Yeah solid solid

399
0:28:05 --> 0:28:09
Also, uh, they were killed in Louisiana. So there's the there's the tie in

400
0:28:10 --> 0:28:14
When people are like, why is your new band named Bonnie and Clyde? We're like, no, no

401
0:28:14 --> 0:28:18
It's okay. Bonnie and Clyde were actually killed in Louisiana, which is where Jacob is from

402
0:28:18 --> 0:28:22
Who's Jacob? He doesn't have anything to do with this band. It's just he's just a guy that we know

403
0:28:26 --> 0:28:29
Bonnie and Clyde, there we go. Bonnie and Clyde

404
0:28:31 --> 0:28:37
Um, yeah, the stage is it needs to be a name and then like a thing

405
0:28:38 --> 0:28:40
Yeah, like a hoodie and the blowfish

406
0:28:42 --> 0:28:45
Yeah, I would I I'm not even being coy about it

407
0:28:45 --> 0:28:48
I would tell you the names that we've already come up with for the band

408
0:28:48 --> 0:28:52
But I can't think of a single one right now. All right. Well, you've already got SJ in the ruckus

409
0:28:52 --> 0:28:55
So SJ is not going to front another band with SJ in it

410
0:28:56 --> 0:29:02
Right, uh, probably not. Yeah, probably not. That'd be saying the commotion. That's good. That'd be some more

411
0:29:02 --> 0:29:05
Sarah Jessica and the commotion there. Thank you

412
0:29:08 --> 0:29:10
Uh, but yeah, so that was a lot of fun

413
0:29:10 --> 0:29:16
And now I have a whole lot of trust that the the trust that was in that picture is a little bit of the trust that we have

414
0:29:16 --> 0:29:19
I got a whole lot of trust. I got a whole lot of trust y'all

415
0:29:20 --> 0:29:25
Uh, what I have is I have a way for us to not have to rent pipe and drape for next scoop fest

416
0:29:25 --> 0:29:31
That's how much trust I have. Oh, that's awesome. How about this? Yeah, sweet bean and the fever machines

417
0:29:31 --> 0:29:32
sweet bean

418
0:29:34 --> 0:29:39
It's amazing that you say that that's already number one on the list sweet bean and the fever machines

419
0:29:39 --> 0:29:39
sweet

420
0:29:39 --> 0:29:40
Bean

421
0:29:41 --> 0:29:48
We all came up with that one. Yeah, that was basically everybody went away and brainstormed and all of us came back with sweet bean and the fever machine

422
0:29:48 --> 0:29:50
Right there at the top of our list

423
0:29:56 --> 0:30:01
I'm sweet bean. This is the fever machine. I'm saying thank you for having us. Oh my god

424
0:30:01 --> 0:30:04
Can you imagine if SJ got to be sweet bean?

425
0:30:05 --> 0:30:06
Holy shit

426
0:30:06 --> 0:30:10
Every time it's time for her to sing a song the other lead singer guy goes

427
0:30:11 --> 0:30:12
Take it bean

428
0:30:19 --> 0:30:23
When Paul says it I just picture money just showering

429
0:30:24 --> 0:30:28
So much money coming in I just got hit in the head by a quarter

430
0:30:32 --> 0:30:35
How about coyness interruptus

431
0:30:37 --> 0:30:40
When they decide they want to be like a corporate band is

432
0:30:40 --> 0:30:45
Is already a demand for corporate bands or is that a market that they want to try to crack?

433
0:30:46 --> 0:30:50
No, no, this is this is something that sj and one of her agents

434
0:30:51 --> 0:30:53
Came up with this. This is a thought for that

435
0:30:54 --> 0:30:58
It I'm saying corporate. It's really more like like city and city events

436
0:30:59 --> 0:31:04
That kind of that like when when cities hire bands, you know play the riverfront. Yes for a big city party

437
0:31:04 --> 0:31:07
It's it's that it's that type of thing. Yeah

438
0:31:07 --> 0:31:12
Yeah, so let corporates the wrong word. But yeah, I got it city and county events type thing

439
0:31:12 --> 0:31:15
Chris bill and the exact change

440
0:31:19 --> 0:31:24
Put some right out there we're in this for the dough. Yeah, it gives a very professional

441
0:31:25 --> 0:31:28
Oh, Wayne does not like Chris building exact change

442
0:31:31 --> 0:31:35
Thumbs down from waiting on that one. I think Chris building exact change might have legs, but we'll see

443
0:31:36 --> 0:31:41
All right. All right. That one's alph. All right. How about a bean bean counter and the accountants?

444
0:31:41 --> 0:31:45
There you go. You got that going on and then you can get your sweet bean take a bean back in

445
0:31:46 --> 0:31:49
And then you can do the the dolly parton typing song

446
0:31:50 --> 0:31:52
You know, these are the accountants taking accountants

447
0:31:57 --> 0:32:02
Yeah, I I'm also in the same market. That's why I was I didn't know how much I want to be competing with sj

448
0:32:03 --> 0:32:05
Uh, but I'm doing an all tap dance cover band

449
0:32:05 --> 0:32:11
So everything every song we play is through the through the toes and heels through the balls over eaten heels of a tap shoe

450
0:32:12 --> 0:32:13
Interesting interesting

451
0:32:14 --> 0:32:16
How about the Louisiana moon dogs?

452
0:32:19 --> 0:32:24
Paul's really trying which is weird. Are they based out of are they based out of Louisiana?

453
0:32:25 --> 0:32:25
No

454
0:32:26 --> 0:32:31
All the better of las vegas. All right, alabama moon dogs and one of them's based out of la

455
0:32:31 --> 0:32:33
Oh, the la moon dogs

456
0:32:34 --> 0:32:37
The la moon dogs. There you go. Here's what we got moon dogs

457
0:32:38 --> 0:32:39
location tba

458
0:32:43 --> 0:32:47
Okay, that's the last percent of the way there the lost moon dogs

459
0:32:53 --> 0:32:56
I'm trying to think of like if is it even okay, okay

460
0:32:56 --> 0:33:02
What's in the realm of possibility paul says a combination of words that make you go to sj and say a single thing

461
0:33:04 --> 0:33:09
What the barrier of entry of like you actually going to stay with an idea

462
0:33:10 --> 0:33:15
I don't know. I do know that I have not stood up or written anything down

463
0:33:19 --> 0:33:25
Like she's home, right? She's here. Yeah, she's in the building with me right now. All right

464
0:33:26 --> 0:33:31
A thousand paul and a thousand typewriters will make a band name

465
0:33:32 --> 0:33:35
Uh speaking of tap dancing. I saw

466
0:33:37 --> 0:33:41

And sure enough the cow was there and began to grin it

506
0:36:23 --> 0:36:29
I did the wiener dance right there with the cow. Like I said before it's me putting it down

507
0:36:29 --> 0:36:32
The others got in the way for about a minute

508
0:36:34 --> 0:36:38
But then I switched them aside and I went ahead and did it

509
0:36:39 --> 0:36:46
Yeah, and I got the weird cow aides from fucking the cow the weird cow aides from fucking the cow

510
0:36:46 --> 0:36:47

0:37:54 --> 0:38:02
Uh buggery is so when people were so upset that someone might have sex outside of wedlock

Some people uh took fucking animals as a workaround

526
0:38:11 --> 0:38:14
I'm not having uh, you know premarital sex with a human

527
0:38:14 --> 0:38:18

Okay

0:38:43 --> 0:38:50
Now wait, so the amount of work that these people are going to does not fuck this spouse

So the band is mostly rock and roll

537
0:38:53 --> 0:38:54
Yeah

538
0:38:54 --> 0:38:59
So we don't we're back to that. We're back to the name. So we don't want like we're gonna stop talking about fucking animals

539
0:38:59 --> 0:39:04
To go back to this we don't want country music type names. We want to rock and roll

540
0:39:05 --> 0:39:07
Like starship or something like that

541
0:39:08 --> 0:39:13
Flicky yeah flicky bean and the buggery wake up sj. Let's go look like we've had deaf leopards

Let's welcome this syphilis koala

563
0:40:52 --> 0:40:52
Um

564
0:40:53 --> 0:40:58
That'd be great because the most of them are chlamydia, so they've got a different disease in the mix. I like it

0:40:58 --> 0:41:04
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, they those koalas fuck agoraphobic agoraphobic honey bad

566
0:41:08 --> 0:41:10
Mildly depressed kangaroo

567
0:41:11 --> 0:41:16
We're secretly just doing spanish job song suggestions. We are that's all we're doing. That's all we're doing

568
0:41:17 --> 0:41:21
But uh, yeah, I think I think don't worry. I've uh written all these down

569
0:41:21 --> 0:41:27
I have sent them. I have sent them to Mercedes already. They're gonna get back to us

570
0:41:28 --> 0:41:34
It's gonna be great tomorrow. I'm gonna go to see uh the new wicked wicked for good

571
0:41:35 --> 0:41:36
Wicked for good

572
0:41:37 --> 0:41:38
wicked for good

573
0:41:40 --> 0:41:43
I'm excited about it. I'm hearing all kinds of things out there

574
0:41:43 --> 0:41:44
Ups and downs

575
0:41:45 --> 0:41:50
Some people are really critical of it. Some people are really like leaving the theaters crying. We're going multiple times

576
0:41:51 --> 0:41:55
I think it's hard to have a sequel to a movie like that

577
0:41:57 --> 0:42:00
Yes, and they and they shot it simultaneously as well, right

578
0:42:01 --> 0:42:06
And the and you you lose all the credit you got from the first one where you created these worlds

579
0:42:06 --> 0:42:09
You can't believe what you're looking at, right? Right did it's such a good job creating that world

580
0:42:09 --> 0:42:14
Now you go making you like, you know, what everything looks like and you're kind of like, okay cool and also

581
0:42:15 --> 0:42:16
This happened with kill bill

582
0:42:17 --> 0:42:21
Ah when you have an awesome movie and you don't have to stick the landing

583
0:42:21 --> 0:42:24
But just leave a cliffhanger and people can leave a theater satisfied with a cliffhanger

584
0:42:26 --> 0:42:29
Oh, that's really that's that's a lot easier to do

585
0:42:29 --> 0:42:35
That's a lot easier. I mean ask a tv writer if it's easier to write a season finale or a series finale

586
0:42:36 --> 0:42:43
Right, right, right, right exactly. That's uh, it's a very valid point. Uh, have you guys watched smiling friends?

587
0:42:44 --> 0:42:50
Smiling friends. No smiling friends brilliant animated series. I highly recommend it. It's absolutely my kind of humor

588
0:42:50 --> 0:42:51
It's fucking hilarious

589
0:42:52 --> 0:42:57
But they go in every season. They just got reneed renewed up to season five

590
0:42:57 --> 0:43:01
Reneed, okay. No reneed up season five everyone reneed

591
0:43:01 --> 0:43:04
But they approach every season

592
0:43:04 --> 0:43:08
Their last episode as though if this is it then this is it

593
0:43:08 --> 0:43:11
They make it so that it could be the end

594
0:43:11 --> 0:43:16
So they've taken that approach map from the jump like that's pretty smart. Yeah, I find it's weird a series

595
0:43:17 --> 0:43:24
That uh does does this bizarrely is slow horses. You guys watching these slow horses on apple

596
0:43:24 --> 0:43:29
Yeah, watch a little bit of that name great old great great band name

597
0:43:29 --> 0:43:30
uh

598
0:43:30 --> 0:43:32
They always end it

599
0:43:32 --> 0:43:38
Like satisfactorily like if that was the last show it could and then they run a preview for next season

600
0:43:38 --> 0:43:41
Which I find fascinating because I can't imagine they're always renewed

601
0:43:41 --> 0:43:46
But they run a preview of the next season at the very end of the montage

602
0:43:46 --> 0:43:50
And I'm always like, wow, how the hell do you do that? That's impossible

603
0:43:51 --> 0:43:54
I mean, I guess they I guess they put that together and run it

604
0:43:55 --> 0:44:02
Until apple says you're not renewed and then apple just takes it takes that part out. Maybe maybe yeah

605
0:44:02 --> 0:44:06
And also, how do you shoot that? How do you already have it? Yeah, how do you already?

606
0:44:07 --> 0:44:11
Right, that's that's the bigger question. Where did this footage come from? I find it bizarre

607
0:44:12 --> 0:44:15
Okay, uh, jacob chase the blaze

608
0:44:18 --> 0:44:22
Yes, there you go. That's the one. That's the one

609
0:44:22 --> 0:44:28
Chase the blaze. That's the one we found it's for people who want to have sex with people with std's chase the blaze. Oh my god

610
0:44:29 --> 0:44:30
A bunk chaser

611
0:44:30 --> 0:44:33
Bunk as jay in the bunk chasers

612
0:44:33 --> 0:44:35
Buggary chasers

613
0:44:35 --> 0:44:37

614
0:44:39 --> 0:44:45
Buggery buggery pittery. I only want to have sex with people who've had sex with animals previously. Oh my god

615
0:44:45 --> 0:44:48
Well, that's the now matt you've ruined it. That's the opening song

616
0:44:48 --> 0:44:49
Oh

617
0:44:50 --> 0:44:57
I only want to have sex with animals that have had sex with people and vice versa. How about piddly bob and the

618
0:44:57 --> 0:44:58
Meme

619
0:45:00 --> 0:45:04
No, I'm definitely not a cow. Let's get on the bus

620
0:45:07 --> 0:45:10
You're supposed to play bass not sing betty you're giving it away

621
0:45:13 --> 0:45:15
You idiot utter embarrassment

622
0:45:16 --> 0:45:18
Stupid cow. I mean human

623
0:45:20 --> 0:45:25
Who's definitely a human and I'm married to stupid human. I'm married to get on the bus

624
0:45:26 --> 0:45:31
I know I'm sorry. I had to cut your your hooves to look like hands

625
0:45:32 --> 0:45:37
I know it's terribly painful for you, but I love you so much

626
0:45:39 --> 0:45:41
Also, it's the only way she could play bass

627
0:45:50 --> 0:45:57
Oh, that is music to my ears music to my ears if only it was a country band, we'd have this thing solved

628
0:45:59 --> 0:46:03
Man, I was where was that? Oh, well, I was doing a week of shows in san Antonio

629
0:46:05 --> 0:46:07
Mainstream country music is so stupid

630
0:46:11 --> 0:46:16
Hold on this is breaking news mainstream country music is stupid. There are country songs that are amazing

631
0:46:16 --> 0:46:21
They're a country artist. They're amazing. Absolutely. But the but the other it's just pop

632
0:46:21 --> 0:46:23
It's just pop with a

633
0:46:23 --> 0:46:28
Wawa pedal and they literally it's like I literally go like really every song has a drink and a truck in it

634
0:46:28 --> 0:46:33
Every song has a whiskey and and the truck in it like all of them

635
0:46:33 --> 0:46:37
Uh-huh just makes me I basically I get so I'm sitting there drinking like coffee

636
0:46:37 --> 0:46:43
And like I stand turning a coffee shop being like who can't write this like who like anyone can write these

637
0:46:44 --> 0:46:50
This is not surprising now Matt some of them have a wife at home who is not happy

638
0:46:52 --> 0:46:57
Some of them wish they just could have done better if if a couple other choices are gone differently

639
0:46:57 --> 0:47:01
Well, you know, there's some shit going on when the ai is beating them all

640
0:47:01 --> 0:47:04
Yeah, yeah, but that's been a problem with all genres, but yes

641
0:47:04 --> 0:47:10
Yeah, and I don't know how the hell you fix it, but Spotify is being hijacked by ai bands

642
0:47:10 --> 0:47:11
Yeah

643
0:47:13 --> 0:47:18
And these ai and these and these people people sitting around with ai are just making a bunch of money off of plays

644
0:47:18 --> 0:47:19
uh

645
0:47:20 --> 0:47:21
Instead of actual bands

646
0:47:22 --> 0:47:25
I was just talking to a friend the other day. He was you saying that um

647
0:47:26 --> 0:47:30
Dr. Torrell, uh, what's the thing that you that you have to write to phd

648
0:47:31 --> 0:47:35
Uh, you know thesis a thesis. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Dr. Torrell thesis

649
0:47:36 --> 0:47:38
Betty stop guessing Betty stop guessing

650
0:47:40 --> 0:47:41
Back on the tour bus

651
0:47:41 --> 0:47:42
Let's get on the bus

652
0:47:43 --> 0:47:44
Stop guessing Betty

653
0:47:45 --> 0:47:48
Yeah dissertation. Yeah that kind of thing. Thank you lorry dissertation

654
0:47:49 --> 0:47:56
Uh, he's you got it all written out and gave it to his you know faculty advisor person and

655
0:47:57 --> 0:48:03
Was kind of accused of using ai to uh to write it

656
0:48:04 --> 0:48:07
And basically the the professor said

657
0:48:08 --> 0:48:10
You either use ai to write this

658
0:48:10 --> 0:48:17
Or you wrote this and it feels like ai either way you need to rewrite this

659
0:48:17 --> 0:48:20
That but but but he was like i go fuck yourself

660
0:48:21 --> 0:48:22
right

661
0:48:23 --> 0:48:26
But but no the uh the uh the professor was trying to be helpful

662
0:48:27 --> 0:48:31
Because because he was like no i did write this you know i i didn't i didn't use ai to do this

663
0:48:31 --> 0:48:35
I'm getting my phd and this is this is what i want to be doing like i'm doing this because i because i

664
0:48:35 --> 0:48:38
Want want to do it. Yep. So no i didn't have ai write this

665
0:48:39 --> 0:48:44
And the the professor was basically like yeah, but when the uh when the committee looks at this

666
0:48:44 --> 0:48:47
If they feel like it it feels ai

667
0:48:48 --> 0:48:51
Then uh, then they're gonna hold that against you ai ai

668
0:48:52 --> 0:48:58
That's my favorite song shut up betty get on the bus i'm gonna cut your hooves again

669
0:48:59 --> 0:49:04
I'm gonna re-finger up your hooves. I don't see oh mcdonald on the set list

670
0:49:04 --> 0:49:09
No, betty. We can't play that song. Oh, you're such a talky cow betty

671
0:49:11 --> 0:49:13
I mean person definitely a person person

672
0:49:14 --> 0:49:20
But yeah, they were like, oh, we had to rewrite my whole uh my whole thing or like a couple of chapters in it or something

673
0:49:20 --> 0:49:26
I don't know, uh, but had to rewrite a sizable portion of it because it felt like ai

674
0:49:27 --> 0:49:33
And i was like this is this is such a weird time that we're in right now because we haven't figured that part out yet

675
0:49:33 --> 0:49:37
No, and honestly we're in that weird pocket in history where it's just a pain in the ass right now

676
0:49:37 --> 0:49:42
And college professors are using ai to ask whether or not something is written by ai

677
0:49:42 --> 0:49:43
So they're doing it too

678
0:49:43 --> 0:49:50
And some some some college professors are using ai to read people's fucking shit and and grade it. Yeah. Yeah

679
0:49:51 --> 0:49:53
Oh, yeah, no, it's just it's just like the

680
0:49:53 --> 0:49:58
That thing any time technology happens it takes us a while to catch up to it

681
0:49:58 --> 0:50:04
I will tell you what's was weird and almost like why we think ai is fascinating is that I think ai can be wrong

682
0:50:05 --> 0:50:11
And I think that's definitely so much of lawyers recently got like sanctioned. I think whatever it's called or cc s

683
0:50:12 --> 0:50:18
cease and desists, um killed no murdered. No, no, but um, they uh, basically

684
0:50:19 --> 0:50:24
Had ai write their, uh, legal documents and had false sources

685
0:50:24 --> 0:50:31
Uh, yeah cases whatever and then so we were putting together our quizzes for, uh, f1

686
0:50:31 --> 0:50:35
We we put together, uh, breakdowns of each rate of each driver

687
0:50:36 --> 0:50:39
And there wasn't a lot, but there were three

688
0:50:40 --> 0:50:45
Errors three lines and so f1 one point was like can we go over all of your material before you do it?

689
0:50:49 --> 0:50:50
I'm sorry Mercedes

690
0:50:50 --> 0:50:54
We didn't know that we're gonna send that video to you and it made up dumb stuff

691
0:50:54 --> 0:50:57
Like they had uh pets that didn't have or

692
0:50:57 --> 0:50:58
Right, uh fears that didn't have

693
0:50:59 --> 0:51:02
You can while you're working on on the ai stuff

694
0:51:02 --> 0:51:04
There are times that you can

695
0:51:04 --> 0:51:08
That you should go in and just be like double double check all of that stuff

696
0:51:08 --> 0:51:12
You just told me is all of that actually corrected. Did you make up some of that?

697
0:51:12 --> 0:51:15
And sometimes it'll be it'll be like no, I made all of that up

698
0:51:17 --> 0:51:18
It'll it'll just tell you. Yeah

699
0:51:19 --> 0:51:22
But if you don't think to ask then you don't know that's really weird though

700
0:51:22 --> 0:51:24
I yes, it is

701
0:51:24 --> 0:51:27
I asked for a list. I was like, what are words have never been used in wordl

702
0:51:27 --> 0:51:31
Because I want to like see if I can get a wordl in one if I can commit to a word

703
0:51:31 --> 0:51:32
Oh, okay. Yeah

704
0:51:33 --> 0:51:38
And uh, it gave me a list and the list was completely wrong. I fact checked it

705
0:51:38 --> 0:51:40
And it was just like no

706
0:51:40 --> 0:51:46
It just gave me a bunch of random five letter words and set it check two archives and it was just lying

707
0:51:46 --> 0:51:49
And back in the 80s and 90s

708
0:51:49 --> 0:51:56
You'd get on and uh, or you'd find an ad or something and you'd hire just like a college student

709
0:51:56 --> 0:51:58
To write a paper for you or in high school or something

710
0:51:58 --> 0:52:02
I was asking if paul's writing down band names. Yeah, I am

711
0:52:02 --> 0:52:03
fire

712
0:52:05 --> 0:52:08
And he drew a logo. Yeah

713
0:52:08 --> 0:52:10
I don't think you'd go wrong with fire lizard

714
0:52:11 --> 0:52:11
I

715
0:52:12 --> 0:52:13
Surely not

716
0:52:14 --> 0:52:20
Paul don't put it fine as it shirts me paul if you're drawing my kid needs a name for his throughout the uh needs a logo for his

717
0:52:20 --> 0:52:21
three-on-three soccer team

718
0:52:22 --> 0:52:24
I have I have I have

719
0:52:24 --> 0:52:27
My brother jingle ballers

720
0:52:28 --> 0:52:30
The jingle ballers jingle ballers

721
0:52:30 --> 0:52:33
So they're like a holiday themed

722
0:52:33 --> 0:52:37
Yeah, so it's a holiday themed three-on-three. It's great people dress up for it

723
0:52:37 --> 0:52:40
Like it's a really silly is a really silly three-on-three soccer tournament

724
0:52:40 --> 0:52:43
Do you want me to be pictures of your kids?

725
0:52:43 --> 0:52:46
Are there gonna be pictures of your kids in santa costumes playing soccer?

726
0:52:47 --> 0:52:50
Uh, there's gonna be a picture of their coach in the santa costume because I am their coach

727
0:52:51 --> 0:52:56
All right. Oh, yeah, I'll get my tablet in a minute and I'll draw one up. I just did the artwork for this uh

728
0:52:57 --> 0:53:03
For this month it's coming out. Okay. Oh, yeah, so I'll get my tablet and draw up a

729
0:53:03 --> 0:53:09
Possible logo. I have already tasked uh rob with it too. So you you're a competition if it comes in second

730
0:53:09 --> 0:53:12
That's fine. I don't care. Okay. That's fine. You got you got a competition. Yeah

731
0:53:13 --> 0:53:17
I I uh, yeah, because basically like my son's

732
0:53:17 --> 0:53:17
youngest

733
0:53:18 --> 0:53:20
His soccer team was a disaster this year

734
0:53:21 --> 0:53:24
Okay, a couple kids got injured a couple kids quit

735
0:53:25 --> 0:53:29
Some kids would just not show up. They regularly played without like enough kids

736
0:53:29 --> 0:53:35
Uh, like one kid down my kid would play the entire game. It was a brutal brutal season

737
0:53:36 --> 0:53:39
So when the three on three came up, I was like, oh

738
0:53:39 --> 0:53:42
Let's get the five kids who showed up

739
0:53:42 --> 0:53:49
All the time who had and let's put them in the in the three on three together. Yeah have them play

740
0:53:50 --> 0:53:55
One one one one a proper finish to their season instead of just constantly getting clobbered by other teams

741
0:53:56 --> 0:53:59
The five gives you a pair of subs. Is that is that what yeah? Yeah, you can have up to six

742
0:53:59 --> 0:54:02
And you sub perfect you sub like crazy in three on three

743
0:54:03 --> 0:54:06
Yeah, okay. And so I was like, let's do it

744
0:54:06 --> 0:54:11
And then the coach who had finished his last season he coached like seven seasons was like, I'm not coaching again

745
0:54:11 --> 0:54:15
So I said, I imagine you don't want to come out of retirement and he goes. No, I do not

746
0:54:15 --> 0:54:18
I said, okay. I said, I will coach this team. I'm going to tell the parents

747
0:54:18 --> 0:54:22
I have no business coaching this team, but I will coach this three on three team. That's nice

748
0:54:22 --> 0:54:26
But I'll do it. That's really good at you man. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

749
0:54:26 --> 0:54:31
Um, so yeah, jingle ballers jingle ballers. That's a I didn't want this to become a democracy

750
0:54:31 --> 0:54:34
So I simply said, Hey, do you want to play?

751
0:54:35 --> 0:54:38
Hilly wants to play a three on three tournament. Do you want to join him?

752
0:54:38 --> 0:54:43
He's named the team the jingle ballers because I didn't want anyone saying anything else. I was like, it's not up for debate

753
0:54:43 --> 0:54:47
There's no conversation. It is the jingle ballers that is that has happened

754
0:54:48 --> 0:54:50
He was to be doing that in the snow devils

755
0:54:52 --> 0:54:53
Snow devils much easier to logo

756
0:54:54 --> 0:54:59
No, jingle ballers will be fun. Jingle ballers is funnier. How far can we go on the

757
0:55:00 --> 0:55:01
In your window scale

758
0:55:04 --> 0:55:09
The the Tino one last year they were just called the hard penises and they had a big giant cock

759
0:55:12 --> 0:55:13
Lots of veins

760
0:55:13 --> 0:55:16
Yeah, but the the the testicles were soccer balls. That was what made it a soccer

761
0:55:16 --> 0:55:20
Yeah, I mean that's the whole thing jingle ballers. That's what I'm thinking already. I'm like well

762
0:55:20 --> 0:55:26
They showed up to the game in an oscar mire wiener mobile that they had repurposed that it just a giant penis

763
0:55:26 --> 0:55:31
Yeah, just dragging. They painted they painted. They just all you gotta do is paint veins on it

764
0:55:31 --> 0:55:34
Just get a carrot purple spray paint and that's that's all I did

765
0:55:35 --> 0:55:42
In your mobile just like that boom becomes the cock mobile just dragging to christmas ornaments for balls behind it like like like just got married

766
0:55:46 --> 0:55:51
When I say hard you say penises hard penises

767
0:55:51 --> 0:55:54
Uh, so yeah, I I guess uh

768
0:55:54 --> 0:56:00
Paul they're they're 10. So use your best discretion. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I got you

769
0:56:00 --> 0:56:05
I got you they're 10. So they've only seen 10 years worth of internet pornography

770
0:56:05 --> 0:56:07
Just right keep that in mind man

771
0:56:07 --> 0:56:11
I just I think about this every once in a while

772
0:56:11 --> 0:56:17
And I do think about I thought about it too when when I accidentally gave matt's kid a comic that might have a boob in it

773
0:56:19 --> 0:56:20
But it was a circle in a circle

774
0:56:21 --> 0:56:27
I like that. That's moved accidentally. No, it I mean it was accidentally, but also I don't care, uh, but also

775
0:56:29 --> 0:56:30
But also

776
0:56:31 --> 0:56:37
If I were a child man, I've got a box of hustlers for your kids if I were me at that age

777
0:56:38 --> 0:56:42
Because I remember the kind of bullshit links I went to to see pornography at 11

778
0:56:43 --> 0:56:44
And we had to go to the woods

779
0:56:45 --> 0:56:47
Or somebody's house with a weird older brother

780
0:56:48 --> 0:56:51
Uh, you know or whatever. We also watched

781
0:56:52 --> 0:56:53
Uh in a group

782
0:56:54 --> 0:56:58
Absolutely, which is absolutely when you think about it or yes weird now

783
0:56:58 --> 0:56:59
But like, you know, can you imagine

784
0:57:00 --> 0:57:04
A bunch of guys like gathering around now to watch internet porn around a computer. It's it's a different feeling

785
0:57:04 --> 0:57:11
It is. I imagine it. Yes, but there's no way kids of this day and age avoid porn

786
0:57:12 --> 0:57:15
You can't turn on a computer. It's it's just it's in your face

787
0:57:15 --> 0:57:18
I think about this like what like because like all our, uh

788
0:57:19 --> 0:57:20
Our tv apps, right?

789
0:57:20 --> 0:57:23
I have different profiles and the kids have kids profiles, right?

790
0:57:23 --> 0:57:26
Yeah, and then the kids but the kids know my password to get to my

791
0:57:26 --> 0:57:30
Of course, right to get to the unrestricted

792
0:57:30 --> 0:57:34
And then I'm like, oh, maybe I should change that or do something about that

793
0:57:34 --> 0:57:38
Then I'm like the least of my concern is them finding stuff on like hbo

794
0:57:38 --> 0:57:43
Right, like right when they have access to the internet. Oh shit. They saw Daenerys's tits

795
0:57:43 --> 0:57:45
Yeah, whoop-de-doo

796
0:57:45 --> 0:57:51
They got on the on the max app and looked up old episodes of the red shoe diaries. Oh

797
0:57:51 --> 0:57:54
That's the thing real sex red shoe diaries. Those are all gone

798
0:57:56 --> 0:57:59
I don't think you can look those up anymore, right?

799
0:57:59 --> 0:58:04
Now the question is like so because right now they say it's basically a huge problem is that kids

800
0:58:05 --> 0:58:10
See so much porn before they actually have sex themselves. They get desensitized and weirded out by it

801
0:58:10 --> 0:58:17
No, they feel but they feel well, yes, but they they feel also pressured to imitate it or that

802
0:58:17 --> 0:58:21
They they want to do like porn sex constantly. Yes, right

803
0:58:22 --> 0:58:27
Like the first time you know when they're losing their virginity. They're like, when should I spit into your asshole, right?

804
0:58:28 --> 0:58:30
Yeah, yeah

805
0:58:30 --> 0:58:33
Do we do we gape now or gape later? Yeah

806
0:58:34 --> 0:58:36
Like that was my first question. There it is

807
0:58:37 --> 0:58:44
Galactic president scooper star. That's exactly what I came up with. Oh, just scrambled porn that it was exactly my life

808
0:58:45 --> 0:58:47
That was absolutely my oh man

809
0:58:47 --> 0:58:50
scrambled scramble tv porn scramble tv porn

810
0:58:51 --> 0:58:53
Is a great name for sj's band and um

811
0:58:54 --> 0:58:55
That is a good name

812
0:58:57 --> 0:58:58
Uh

813
0:58:58 --> 0:59:02
Yeah, but basically they're trying to do all this crazy stuff and not enjoying it

814
0:59:02 --> 0:59:04
Yeah, yeah

815
0:59:04 --> 0:59:06
Now it sucks that sucks

816
0:59:07 --> 0:59:13
Yeah, but most people most the good thing about that is have to have a basically and i'm gonna have to have a speech

817
0:59:13 --> 0:59:15
They're skipping from age 17

818
0:59:16 --> 0:59:17
to age 48

819
0:59:18 --> 0:59:23
And that's because that's the time when you kind of enjoy sex and after that it's just like, uh

820
0:59:23 --> 0:59:25
Really? Oh god

821
0:59:26 --> 0:59:31
There we go. I'm laughing really hard because I'm 47 so it's like oh, I didn't realize I was on the fucking cuss

822
0:59:31 --> 0:59:35

947
1:08:51 --> 1:08:52
Just finished another tour of australia

948
1:08:53 --> 1:08:55

1:09:46 --> 1:09:49
For 800 tizm is an acronym for what?

964
1:09:50 --> 1:09:57
This is a great question. This is stupid music. This is serious mum. This is so melodramatic

965

This isn't super meaningful

966
1:10:00 --> 1:10:01
Oh

1:10:04 --> 1:10:06
I'm torn between one and four

969
1:10:13 --> 1:10:14
