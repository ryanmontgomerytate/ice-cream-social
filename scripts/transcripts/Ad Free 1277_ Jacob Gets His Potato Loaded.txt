 oh it's a show hey Johnny do you want to go to an ice cream social yeah I'd love
 to great let's go I had a weird night last night I had a weird weekend I've
 had a weird life who am I fooling it's time for Matt and Mattingly's ice cream
 social sitting over there in Las Vegas it's Matt Donnelly sitting over there in
 Pittsburgh it's Paul Mattingly sitting here in Las Vegas it's me Jacob the
 other guy we're preaching fun we're preaching fun hey everybody yeah we're
 doing you uh everybody having a good day I don't care here's a production meeting
 blammo is right right out of nowhere boom I just scared the shit out of my
 cat with that blammo oh it was so much blammo oh man really woke her up poor
 kitty we are our company gentlemen is restructuring we are restructuring our
 company okay through somebody quit it our oldest our oldest friend and I
 suppose employee although that feels weird it feels we paid very little but
 yes but Annie is Annie is moving on from us our dear friend Annie is moving on
 with us from us she has been with us since the beginning of patreon at the
 very least we launched our patreon and then immediately expressed how
 overwhelmed we are by our own creation yep yep and she emailed us and said I
 will help organize this for you and then continue to do so for I guess I don't
 even know how long I mean I have I mean I mean we probably did patreon on our own
 for like a month before she swooped in and was like yeah here let me just let
 me just take care of you sweet sweet children lost in the woods it's very
 important to note you know and I think I really think is just Annie being
 respectful like I think she's just a first-class person started finish it's
 simply that like when we started we had like seven tears we had a bunch of bonus
 rewards for people who were on for more than three months right we had all kinds
 of different deliverables that we were thought you know that we could do if we
 had all the time in the world and then quickly realized that we don't have all
 the time in the world but Annie kept all of these things organized for us all the
 time and more importantly fielded emails from patreon yes I ordered what is
 happen I ordered all you can eat video whatever hands-free eating video and so
 long ago when we were first figuring out what our patreon was going to look like
 this is great we're just gonna go down memory lane now that we're talking about
 any when we first figured out what our patreon was gonna look like we just
 threw so many ideas at the wall and I think Paul I think Paul said the hands
 free eating yeah yes I'm sure I did and Matt and I just went both of us like Paul
 explained to us what he was thinking he said well we'll make a video where we go
 to a restaurant we will order food and then we'll eat that food without using
 our hands and and Matt and I just said like oh yeah yeah that is something we
 should do yeah no problem and no issue just right on there because our early
 patron was like hey let's pay for our gas and a meal once in a while that was
 our goal for the patreon and so yeah no I mean it was ridiculous and you know
 all the things we've learned we've talked to other people who start a
 patreon or sort of you know it's interesting and then now we've really
 simplified things here on a picture more than ever most because we kind of
 discovered that we're such a community that like watching us do stuff or
 making us do stuff it seems to be less interesting to our listeners than
 making sure that we all hang out or create social opportunities for each
 other like all you have to do to get us to do a hands-free eating video now is
 convince us that it's gonna be funny and we'll probably just do it if we can if
 you want a hands-free video for me I need a skateboard and a stick a ramp of
 food that can go down towards my mouth a new competitor entering the arena
 between team slide and team swing skateboarding skateboard with a skateboard
 catapult yeah oh the whispers to your oh something else if we hit a goal we
 actually came close this month to hitting a bonus goal for the first time
 in a long time we felt everyone just short which would be no means a bonus
 episode and just before we got on there we even brainstorming new ways to do
 bonus episodes and what about some we're in good shape to work I think we had a
 good idea we're in good shape without any to deliver a brand new bonus
 episode should we get there so please don't let this reorganization hold you
 back for support we still need you and by need you I mean we are completely
 reliant on you but yeah I mean you know yes we gave her a stipend but it was a
 charitable stipend and so I mean it really was just her helping us out for a
 decade and so she will be I feel like she wrote off the time that she worked
 for us as a charity donation on her time yeah and that'd be fair we would back
 that up at the IRS yeah I was sure I don't think any court would convict her
 no we're basically when it comes to us running a company we're basically make a
 wish I just got a random link texted to me from a random phone number wanting me
 to reset my Instagram password I got that from Google today too yeah I think I
 don't know you know I think maybe yeah maybe the line the US infrastructure
 might be hanging by a thread I think we're probably fine thank you Annie you
 have been our champion for years we are going to miss you in ways that we don't
 understand yet so so thank you so much we're gonna run into issues over the
 next weeks and months and we're gonna be like fuck Annie was just taking care of
 this and we didn't realize it I know that's going to happen so thank you so
 much Annie we very much appreciate you and everything you have done for us and
 for this community over the years she was a huge part of making this the
 success that it is yeah and always will be Annie Annie will henceforth be always
 welcome at any ice cream social event yeah anything that we ever do for all
 time Annie is forever welcome yeah and it's just in yarn and sticks is saying I
 hope Annie gets free membership for life I think we can yes Annie has whatever
 she wants get her she might be sick of us guys so it's not it's easy up on the
 rewards but she wants to stay away from us I get that too well I don't think
 we're you know I think she has access to the patreon stuff to a degree I don't
 think we're taking that away so we're not we're not scouring to reset all the
 passwords I haven't been resetting the door codes this morning I'll need your
 keys in your badge Annie yeah and if you're badgered your gun give me your
 gun give me a gun I don't care hand me any gun any gun any badge any gun broken
 is right and he's probably the only one who remembers the passwords that's
 absolutely that is true she has not received the last email or phone call
 from us that's for sure my last email to her was expressing thank yous and all
 the stuff and like and maybe could you just put a list together
 thank you so much Eddie that was so wonderfully appreciated yeah so I had a
 weird week I went to um went downtown the other night went downtown on Monday
 night we're not starting there I tell you where we're starting okay you went
 to a football game with with pod therapy is where we're starting I did I went on
 Sunday I went to a football game with pod there this is where football why
 football rules like like when you look at American sports like football is just
 in its own fucking category in terms of success you I would say I three three
 other friends JD who directed is directing the hey scoops movie sure my
 friend Alice who has the offensive crayon purposely offensive crayons all
 went to this game and I went to bust balls with everyone I think so maybe JD
 after the fact during the game because you were at what I would think is the
 dumbest football game on earth so if you don't follow sports it's the last week
 of the season okay the Raiders were already the most terrible team number
 one draft yes locked up they're bringing but at the beginning of the day we
 didn't know that we thought the only thing that was going to matter on the
 day was that the Raiders needed to lose to lock up the number one draft pick and
 then right before the game started they come over the PA in the stadium they're
 like hey the Giants just upset the cow or just lost to the Cowboys or upset the
 Cowboys or beat the cow whichever one they did yeah Giants just beat the
 Cowboys which solidifies the Raiders getting that number one draft pick now
 that's not even on the table and that's like another table the Chiefs come to
 town there's no Mahomes he's injured Patrick Mahomes is injured he's out
 now he's a probably the last game did they come to the game there yeah yeah
 he was at the game I'm out there wasn't he I don't know I thought he was there I
 thought somebody told me he was there I don't fucking know I don't watch your
 breaks you asked us then Jacob and I were clarifying with each other can you
 just give us a second I thought he was there I thought somebody told me that he
 was there because it was probably Kelsey's last game yeah both teams
 started yes yeah Kelsey might retire he's probably retiring Travis Kelsey yeah
 he's my age he's old he's also married to the gajillionaire that Brady it's
 true that is true yeah but second most money and it but somebody made the
 second most amount of money in his marriage and that did not stop him I
 don't know because he hated his family he had to go back to my kids anybody
 hiring Giselle is a way I'll spend time in Tampa Giselle is a certified which
 careful she also knows a black belt buddy she'll kick your ass I ain't saying
 anything negative about it I was wondering how powerful which Taylor
 Swift is in comparison I wonder I guess pretty powerful wonder as well either way
 I feel like Travis Kelsey's gonna land on his feet somewhere I'm saying there's
 absolutely nothing on the line Raiders absolute worst team they're playing they
 are the worst both teams played multiple not one but multiple backup
 quarterbacks oh so many quarterbacks and no one could score a touchdown no and it
 was just a field goal festival for the first half and I'm texting you and I'm
 texting house and I'm busting balls like all right happy field goals yeah like
 basically like why are you at this game it's so dumb that sounds like an old
 that sounds like a Steelers game playing the whole game with nothing on the line
 it comes down to a field goal and the Raiders win drill it 14 to 12 they
 scored 14 points with no touchdowns which is a miracle they have scored a
 safety at some point scored a safety in there and people went fucking wild like
 it was great and all of my ball busting fell on deaf ears because it was like
 whatever that was fucking amazing and I was like this is why football wins like
 that is by far the dumbest game like right now it's a Brooklyn Nets beat the
 Wizards on a last second shot right like like when when the NBA has futility it
 is futility yes when you are watching the backup of backups play against each
 other to win by a field goal kick and everyone is like it's like what what
 this is what football has won this football has won I mean we went in large
 part because it was a meaningless game of course the tickets she bought tickets
 that morning yeah yeah we were on the 13th row on the on the 40 yard line so
 we had killer seats right and yeah we just had we went to we went knowing it
 was a meaningless game knowing that neither team was gonna really care the
 backups were gonna be the ones that care they are the guys they're playing for
 jobs they care and of course everybody's professional so I mean they're they're
 still going out there and doing the thing and yeah it was it was so much fun
 it was the most relaxed sporting event I've ever been to there were there were
 Kansas City Chiefs fans sitting directly in front of us we were just having nice
 conversations the whole game and would like razz each other with that when our
 team did well of their team didn't do well just everybody was just having a
 good time just a quick check in with our listeners here Jeff Loomis in the chat
 says I'm so disconnected from the NBA this is the first time I heard the Nets
 are now in Brooklyn and not New Jersey Jeff they moved there before I moved to
 Las Vegas I used to be a Nets fan you are behind on that I used to be a Nets
 fan and they and they moved to Brooklyn and I'm such a Jersey guy that I was
 pissed because there was a superior deal offered to them for them to play in New
ark yeah and they took this really shady real estate deal so this guy Bruce
 Ratner could basically own all the property around the stadium and Bruce
 Ratner moved the team to Brooklyn and immediately sold the team and kept the
 rights to the land and everything around it it was such a fucking it was such a
 fucking piece of shit deal I mean I know it moved them out of New Jersey but have
 you ever heard of a more New Jersey deal than that come on they finished in style
 as they say but yeah Jeff it's been at least before 2008 I don't know what year
 but it's been a minute I always think that they moved just so they could
 rename their dance team you know the name of the dance team for the
 Brooklyn Nets right I don't it's the Brooklyn Nets Brooklyn Nets
 you guys win you guys just good job yeah that's wonderful all right dance teams
 for all the football teams let's go for it let's go all right well the Raiders I
 just saw them the other day they're the Raiderets they're there that works
 they're just like Brooklyn I know the Saints I know the Saints ones they are
 the St. Seychens so they've done this a lot all right oh bangles bangles yeah
 right the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders that's just Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders
 but they're a dance team as well right the Chargers are called a charger the
 subtitle guys hate them are the Packers what are they the Packers fudge Packers
 okay that's it the fudgies the dancing fudgies for the Packers the the bears
 the cubs yeah the cubs oh are they the cubs it's a bunch of it's a bunch of
 young dudes so they dance the cubs and the Twinks not to be confused with the
 Dolphins they have the seals how awesome would it be to be the football game is
 it you know time out and they're like all right making way the field give it
 up for the Twinks it'd be great right that's good tons of cartwheels a lot of
 backflips yeah yeah oh bear you have honey bears says we just do oh honey
 bears is solid honey bears is nice yeah I'll tell you who else likes a good a
 honey bear just cut this off before we get to the commanders and mark today's
 show is brought to you by al dente for its book three Al dente escapes the

 Enter Haste Scoops to check out
 You know the difference between a door jam and a door jelly right?
 What's that?

 I don't either
 Okay
 Monday night we uh we went downtown SJ and I we go downtown we had a rare night off together
 and so my wife and I said oh we're gonna go out and and hit the town we'll go
 find some dinner we called a couple of friends and said hey we're gonna go
 down to Fremont Street and walk around maybe find a little music find a little
 food see what see what the night brings us so we went down downtown we went
 downtown head down to Fremont Street what we say gentlemen would we say this
 is version 5 version 6 of Fremont at this point it's a resting version 5 it's
 a it's a slightly slightly adjusted improved like you know they do like the
 point the decimal points on different versions of stuff but it's okay I'd say
 I'd say we're like 5.5 of that makes sense okay I think so Jeff Loomis you
 are not completely wrong I am I am in a small minority of Las Vegas locals that
 goes and does stuff on the strip in downtown that's true mainly I mean the
 strip part is because my my work takes me there it's rare that we go to the
 strip without work taking us there but downtown is a different animal but yeah
 so we head down we we listen to a little bit of music there's a band that SJ
 might work with a little bit and we wouldn't listen to them a little bit
 which was nice and and then we see we did a very Las Vegas tourist thing we
 saw a billboard for a special at one of the steak houses at the I should give a
 shout out here the Fremont the Fremont Casino down on Fremont Street they had a
 special starting at 9 p.m. 1799 for a steak and lobster dinner hey that is
 that's a nice old-school Vegas touch right there can't beat that with a stick
 so we said you can't be that they're trying to be old Vegas and we talked
 that we've talked about like Vegas a lot on the obviously and there's a hearing
 this week local businesses are trying to stop Las Vegas the town from raising
 parking prices and expanding paid parking and they're basically their
 argument is their argument is like the fuck I follow of course our good buddy
 Troy heard who is one of the key motivators down there in the Arts
 District yeah with with the theater and majestic doing his thing and his you
 know his feed has just been so sad to keep up with they are just trying to
 fuck the Arts District yeah and they're just trying it's just nickel and diamond
 it's just the worst kind of nickel and diamond and it is being done with it
 seemed it sure seems like from an outside point of view it's being done
 with zero for thought not only zero for thought Jacob it seems with some level
 of malicious intent as there are now security guards parking security guards
 out there who are former police and they are carrying guns like what's one thing
 to have a meter made on duty it's another thing to have an armed guard
 patrolling your parking spaces just me getting pistol whipped as my as my chip
 won't scan on the parking meter right exactly it's like it's like I just came
 down here to watch my kid in a new version of Cinderella I hear what you're
 shut I hear what you're saying dance I hear what you're saying and I appreciate
 what you're saying I don't see that as a change
 lost Las Vegas security guards it is easy to have the to have the license here to
 be an armed security guard and also it's an open carry state so like having more
 having more guns around is what while I don't love it it's not a surprise but do
 you do either of you recall running into that on the regular in the arts district
 I arts district is so new relatively okay but I mean but like I I oh no no
 it's definitely changing I don't I'm saying I never saw armed guards parking
 lots down in the arts district ever you know that that's I mean the argument
 likely isn't like I guess I want to be able to fucking pull heat on some you
 know scoff laws it's that right if you're gonna send me downtown working
 late at night I would like to be armed is what they're doing because it yeah
 outside I'd like to be armed everywhere I go but that's not good
 are you with that well I mean I'm just taking a quick vote and nope nobody
 wants Paul to be armed I've got my adamantium claws that retract and you
 know so I can we're actually gonna take those away from you oh no I'm not I'm
 not comfortable with you having those grafted to my bones nope sorry we're
 taking them is on fire in the chat today Jeff insists you know what raising
 parking prices means that this might be a spot available and I'm willing to pay
 a premium for it Jeff if you lived here I'd tell you to move but you don't even
 live here oh shut up and get lost and Jeff I'll tell you the the downtown
 parking situation I don't think again just looking at from an outsider point
 of view it sure doesn't seem like it has been affected the business side of it
 has been affected by these parking rate changes yeah it's the look like this is
 that are saying let they want locals to come on down there breeze in grab right
 eat see you see a show go home no problem and that should be the way our
 arts district work it's us it's locals it's for us also we are like our taxes
 already paid for the fucking streets why I'm having to pay again to park on my
 street yes we're Jacob you're ready Jacob in this country it's insane yeah
 there is a meeting happening today we're not gonna be able to go to it but there
 is a community meeting happening in my neighborhood today about a new church
 that is wanting to be built nearby people are up in arms
 right argument it should be I hope they did fuck off get the fuck out how close
 to your house pretty close okay like other side of kind of the the block and
 everything from me but like as the crow flies should this should this go through
 and get squirrely in your neighborhood how much of a possibility is there for
 us as ICS to try and file for church status at that point trying to try and
 solve some things I mean it would it would automatically lessen our tax
 burden which I mean we would definitely get away with it at least through the
 current administration until the IRS gets beefed back up yeah you're right
 we'd have three good years of skating so I would have minimum three good years
 probably more like ten so yeah let's let's fucking go I mean this is fucking
 also like the way your neighborhood is set up right like you have the wall
 there and stuff you can put whatever st. Annick sculpture you want like right
 there yeah yeah just have like we could do anything I got I was genuinely I have
 trees and I have some palm trees in front of my house and I have been
 genuinely considering hiring somebody to come carve tiki figures into the living
 palm trees ooh can that is that safe for the palm tree I'm told that it is
 really I would I would look into that a little more before doing it for sure I'm
 not this is this is an idea that I'm playing with I'm just saying it to say
 that I just put ridiculous things out in front of my house you can carve six six
 six into the trunks of those no problem right in there it won't be too damaging
 all right not a cult ish correct so we head downtown we enjoy our $18 steak and
 lobster which by the way was delicious was it not was it like crawdad times or
 was it lobster tail nice nice lobster tail a little cup of the drawn butter
 which I mean who doesn't love a nice cup of drawn butter that's right he yeah a
 little ghee for you I actually I poured water I poured butter into this can
 that's I'm drinking right now good slicks your slicks up your blood vessel
 walls make sure to make your blood move quicker keeps the vocal cords nice and
 lubed perhaps blue ribbon butter Jeff Loomis says in the in the chat cost more
 than 17 bucks to buy a decent quality steak at the grocery store that is true
 this steak costs less than $17 at the grocery store but I would put it I would
 put it on par with an outback not terrible at all like a street mugging
 kind of steak sounds thin nice thick steak nice thick steak is that a full
 measurement you put up with the screen is it also that big round as well it's
 and a half right yeah that's that's girth girth and with oh they said oh we
 asked the waiter said what does it come with he goes oh it's steak lobster and a
 baked potato so no great what's the big potato come with he goes butter and
 sour cream said anyway you can uh can do anything else with that anything else
 you can add to the baked potato he goes well I can load it up for you go oh
 that'd be great load it up for me you didn't ask how much the loading would
 cost didn't ask how much the loading cost but it came out you know food came
 out and the load up was some shredded cheese and some bacon bits right in
 caviar yeah caviar no problem that was five bucks I was gonna say don't you do
 it man that was the only weird the only weird cost it was five bucks the drinks
 were cheap we both ordered cocktails there were like eight dollars for a for
 a drink it's like good job Fremont Street casino down here doing doing
 this yeah so that's nice we we walk out of there we listen to a little more
 music a couple of our friends come down and and meet us so now we're all we're
 all hanging out and moving around and they say oh let's go check out this new
 bar downtown I'd shout him out right now if I remember what it was I'll find it
 here in a minute Jacob I know so we went down we check out this new bar it's a
 Japanese bar downtown in the Arts District they're really nice it is
 called Pachi Pachi Pachi Pachi Pachi Pachi Pachi Pachi Pachi Pachi Pachi it was lovely I had
 Happy Days themed bar it was not it was not Paul oh I'm thinking of Potsy Potsy
 that's right that's a different bar different bar different bar yeah yeah
 the jukebox is cheap though you know how to work Potsy Potsy you gotta order the
 Ralph mouth there you go so we hang out there we we have some cocktails our
 friends have a little bit of food we pick off their food a little bit the
 food was really good the cocktails were delicious oh I had a wagyu washed old
 fashion and just fine just fine now what's that mean oh so they just with the old-fashioned they wipe a steak in the in the that's it
 they just dip a steak down in there in the it just they put a steak those
 drink shakers they just put a chunk of steak in there whip it up this is I am
 also washed I've replaced my soap with wagyu beef now when I shower just just
 just take wagyu beef across all my extremities and butter with you Matt
 you're really gleaming yeah yeah I just the only person doesn't like this new
 look is my cardiologist the only man who knows my secret my cardiologist he's
 like I'm drinking butter I'm washing myself with beef what do you want for me
 doc I don't want you to do either of those things name one thing I can do
 differently
 you're right pass next new solution you got me that's not gonna work for me doc
 so you were at the Fremont enjoying this meal so we went to the Fremont enjoyed
 this meal and then we go over to this to this new establishment called Pachi
 Pachi reference to Fremont it is a walk from Fremont but just a walk it's just a
 few minutes off of Fremont in the kind of on the edge of the Arts District
 between kind of the Fremont Street experience and the Las Vegas Arts
 District there's like where the Griffin is and all those spots on that end but
 just a little bit past that and one walk over there's always fancy little spots
 popping up over there yeah exactly over by like Carson kitchen area all that
 yeah it's offensive to charge for parking it's that's why we walked for us
 to clearly build for locals just pull in there have a good time and get out of
 there yeah yep that's true so we were in there we're hanging out with our with
 our friends there are four of us in there and we are at the end of the
 evening we are the only people left in there with the exception of one group of
 three guys that's over by the bar okay and so we we finish up and we're gonna
 we're gonna head out we're gonna go you'll probably find something else and
 maybe a maybe a nightcap before we call it a night and so we stand up we're
 gathered up our things and one of the guys from the group across the room
 breaks off and comes over to us and says you know you guys you guys enjoy your
 night thank you so much for coming by and our friend goes you are you
 associated with this establishment because oh yeah I'm one of the owners I
 just want to come over and thank you for for coming in a lovely guy we had a nice
 chat and he says hey I know you guys are getting ready to leave before you head
 out for the night would you be interested in having one more cocktail mmm and we
 all do the thing where the four of us just do the do the look at each other
 and check in and we go yes let's have another cocktail this will this will be
 nice and we all start to kind of shift towards the bar in the in the place and
 he goes great hold on just a second and he calls over to the bartender says hey
 I'm gonna take these folks over to forever I'll be back in a little while
 what whoa oh we're going somewhere else never go to a second location Jacob
 never go to a second location never go to a second location we're gonna go to
 my apartment never go to a second location this is awful so we go oh we're
 going somewhere else he goes yeah yeah it's just a it's just a little walk it's
 a couple doors down go all right great we're in and so we we head down we walk
 down the block it's clothing optional so you can leave your clothes here or check
 out when you get into the place whatever you want to do they have lockers I think
 it's fine don't worry about it lockers here so if you want to leave your clothes
 here that's cheaper $2 over there I'm scared for you I'm really scared now oh
 no no it's not that kind of story so we go over it turns out the bar that we go
 to is a new bar in an old location the old location of this bar is a bar that
 SJ and I used to go into all the time when we first moved here so that was
 kind of exciting so we were we head into this new bar the the owner from the from
 the Pachi Pachi he comes in and he says yeah these are my new friends just met
 them down at down at my spot and we're all great in the world we all meet we
 all we all shake hands sweet Nova girls asking did he ever prove that he was the
 owner that is a fine question because what happened at that point after he
 introduced us to everyone what do you think he did after we walked in he said
 oh let's go let's go have a nightcap a couple doors down we walked down to the
 other bar we walk in he introduces us to the the staff and everybody who's there
 yeah what do you think he does at that point we haven't ordered anything we
 just walked in we've met everyone it's a finger wag in the air for everyone
 drinks for everyone finger wag that's what I think happens next Paul's on it
 he just goes well I gotta get back over to my bar thanks for coming in guys
 is this the game that they're playing they're just shifting customers to each
 other's spot and we all look to each other we're like I weren't well we have
 you know yeah right this is gonna you invited us here yeah these are my new
 friends you I don't want to talk to you time right we were leaving his
 establishment when this happened so that was trying to be slick and kick you out
 of his his place so we could close no that I was like maybe you wanted to
 close but that doesn't make sense because we were leaving we were like we
 were up and putting our coats on leaving that's bizarre didn't make a single bit
 of sense driver taking you to a specific strip club right I guess but I don't
 think anybody got anything out of that I mean the bar that we went to got us to
 buy another drink there I mean it was great we had a good time there we did
 have I mean he left and we did just order a couple of rounds drinks there and
 had a nice time there so the recommendation was awesome this is
 bizarre this is bizarre also because I don't have a single bad part of this
 story it was just the weirdest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life but the
 weirdness matters right because like how how quickly are you gonna go to Hotsie
 Totsie again I mean I don't think it's affected our opinion of that place at
 all here's the thing you went down for your bargain steak steak steak bisque
 the plate and lobster tail that's right and decided to dial it up by going to
 Hotsie Totsie uh-huh and what probably would have ended as just a really fun
 night out downtown and now next time you have like friends in town or whatever
 and they're still doing the the surf and turf special whatever you're not gonna
 do it again right you're not gonna just go like oh we should go do this and
 bingo bing bang boom it's a really fun night downtown right well the surf and
 turf special and the and the Hotsie Totsie aren't connected right they were
 just they were just a walk from each other right so the surf and turf was
 just earlier and then Hotsie Totsie like I know what you mean though it is a it
 is a weird nightcap on the end of your experience at Hotsie Totsie in other
 words like if you like a friend came down like is there any old Vegas left on
 this town and you would be like oh buckle up I'm taking you down to the
 Fremont we're gonna go yeah it don't don't get your don't get your potato
 loaded and other and follow my lead yeah then down there you might be like hey
 there's also like a little bar if you guys want to get off the strip we can go
 around the town like you know me like you're very lucky like replay that
 scenario but you're very much less likely to be like now to be like hey you
 want to go to this bar where the guy weirded me out like you're just not
 gonna do it you're just not gonna you might be right you might be right you
 know like you're just simply not gonna be inclined to treat someone else to
 that experience again because you're like this owner is weird there's just a
 weird story and it's a it is like I say not a single bad thing not a single bad
 thing at any part of the story including the recommendation the
 recommendation was great no and we had a before how flawed this person's logic is
 like we yes we can't find all of the spaces on the board game of decision
 making on this person's right and and I and I didn't even tell you about the
 full-length conversation that we had at his bar before leaving there we stood
 there and all chatted and laughed and had a good time for easily for ten
 minutes before he suggested that we go to the other bar we all stood around and
 laughed and had a good time for about ten minutes but he specifically said you
 guys want to stay for one more he saw you leaving and said let's do one more
 came over when we were leaving we stood up we're putting our coats on he came
 over and engaged us in conversation at that point we had a nice long
 conversation we all had a nice time and as that conversation seemed to be
 naturally getting to a point where we could either you know sit down and
 continue it or move on with our evenings he said I know you guys are leaving
 would you like to have one more cocktail right and that implies one the
 cocktail happens in that location and or at least that he's gonna have it with us
 and to that he's paying or that's a free round sure the paying part I was less I
 was less weirded out by the paying part it is weird to escort someone to a bar
 and not by the first round that's just weird agreed no matter who you are or
 not if I rally a group to move one location and go to be location especially
 if I'm gonna ditch them which he did that's really odd at least at least if
 he says get them whatever they want on me listen I owe you back to my bar but I
 wanted you guys to check out this place this rounds on me now you're doing some
 hospitality work and now you know whatever but he just like shoved you into
 somewhere else make buy things over here you're welcome is not it's a weird move
 it is and you know what I really wanted to do you know an hour later we were
 leaving the second bar yeah but I really want to do was go back to the first bar
 and see well see if it was still open if it is just if it is just vanished see if
 it was still there there's not even a building yeah right exactly oh there used
 to be a building here years ago exactly you familiar with the hot seat hot seat
 building and there's a painting of a guy and it's like 1958 fuck that was the guy
 that's the guy total ghost how long was the walk between the bars oh good
 question around 90 seconds it was right there yeah right now I'm not not out of
 the way at all really a couple of doors down and in the in the same area in an
 area we were familiar with there wasn't there was not a single moment in this
 story where any of us were uncomfortable at all because not to put too fine of a
 point on it but by making you go to another bar and get another drink in
 which you didn't pay for you also to pay for another hour of parking that you
 were about to save by leaving the bar in the first place that would have been
 true that would be true for for other people we had we had parked with our
 friends at the at the valet down at the Golden Gate Casino and you have friends
 there and we have friends there they take care of there also connected but
 it's also it's also old-school Vegas so it's all it's free valet for anyone if
 you can get in the hard part there is get again because it's small it fills up
 that's Jeff Loomis she charged $50 a car than anyone who really wanted to pay
 could do it yeah I mean look at the capitalist Jeff Loomis over here
 capitalism will solve all our problems right Jeff yeah I tell you who else
 thinks capitalism will solve their problems and that's the following
 sponsor old money guns Jeff Loomis today's show is brought to you by creepy
 best-by guys part-time job as a professional wrestling trainer that's
 from bear scoop in 2025 it's creepy best-by guy part-time job as a
 professional wrestling trainer hey it's it's getting the ring it's just go a
 couple see we can do here okay yeah all right now first thing you want to do is
 you want to put your arms together with the other person's arms and you know
 hold hold on to them so specific type of holds like what do you mean by which
 holds start touching see what you see what you touch but like is there a
 technique to the hole that I should be using you've been you've been punching
 rice like I've asked you punching rice yeah I asked you to punch rice that was
 part of the training yeah yeah big old bucket of rice he just yeah punch in
 that rice yeah and it gets your grip strength growing right yeah okay yeah I
 used cooked rice though so it was much easier it was very nice okay I'm gonna
 call you Panda Express okay enter Hayes groups and check I don't think I think
 that would very much defeat the purpose well unless you cooked it and then
 refrigerated and let it reset in there then maybe I don't know maybe be sticky
 enough that's why I remember I worked with this guy who's the nicest guy in
 the Virgin Islands and he was a former army ranger and he said that they would
 jab their hands into buckets of sand to build up their callus and strength and
 then you added rocks after your house is built up after a while and then you
 added broken glass when the rocks didn't do anything to your hand you just kept
 jabbing them over and over again into hands the sands or whatever and he's
 like that way that if you only get two fingers on someone you can still and he
 literally put two fingers on my neck and I was like Jesus those are strong
 he's basically saying that you just that way you still needed two fingers free to
 kill someone who was trying to kill you and I was like thank you for your
 service my pants what was his army ranger there's an army ranger yeah yeah
 we I had friends like that a couple of Ranger friends back in the day and yeah
 they I didn't fuck with him a whole lot hardly ever in fact hardly ever we have
 an update on a previous story a few weeks ago fellow went to the old what was
 what was the establishment went to the the haunted thing at the John Wick the
 John we're on the way the John Wick experience over at area 15 fella showed
 up there with a real sex doll companion and wanted to take himself and his real
 sex doll companion through the experience and at one point shenanigans
 occurred but professor big scoop in the chat with us here in the in the room
 with us here in the zoom where it happened if you will was there so you
 professor tell us your tell us your tale if you have seen the video I am the tall
 guy standing to the screen right of the guy playing the manager what's it we had
 we have friends send to our Instagram the actual security footage of the
 events that took place yeah oh yeah so you're working there currently yes bigs
 oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean you know friends of ice cream social you know
 sure Nicole Unger and Brenna Folger Oh lovely Brenna Folger is no friend of
 ice cream so those names have nothing to do with who may have sent us those
 videos so give us the skinny bigs what what what happens from your POV all
 right so we've got we got the word that this is going to be happening like like
 two days before really that part advance oh yeah okay that's polite or is it
 polite or has he done this before with lots of places and finally realized oh I
 gotta give the answer to both of those questions very well be very well be he
 asked permission for the doll to be armed and we said this is an open carry
 state go ahead you can strap heat under the under the torso of the real doll my
 doll is coming straight from her job as a parking meter and force so so we knew
 way ahead of time and and of course all of the records Chris Brown normally
 plays the manager and the and the others but I was like oh come on I I was
 getting ready to bump him in because I was also playing the manager and I was
 like all right I I need to go in there and just kind of be his his muscle right
 be the be as you know the guy standing behind him yeah and he was fine with it
 and the guy came in very nice guy apparently been spending you know about
 an hour or two beforehand out in the bar having conversations yeah with her and
 patrons that would patrons that would come up and say oh yeah phone so I
 really likes the decor here blah blah blah and the whole time he said he said
 now here's the thing I'm not as weird as you guys may think I know she's fake
 but I've had some really bad relationships is just makes me
 comfortable makes me not crazy hard to argue with that logic who can argue
 yeah and and again middle-aged guy would say it I would say probably 50 plus you
 know well he's got that top of the line Vag doll model money that oh my lordy
 that shit ain't cheap and he he didn't even want the whole thing he went with
 the you have the huge tracks of land model as well it was yeah you lose it
 over the side of a boat you wanted to be able to float guys I'm just so
 psychologically damaged from all of my relationships with humans decided to
 find my own holy shit now I didn't see them but everyone but some other people
 said it made me took them off when once they got out of the bar apparently she
 had elf ears as well okay okay yeah that is why she was rolling for
 that go before going to each room exactly nice Auburn haired young lady in a blue
 dress so he comes in so this thing is apparently they prefer sex workers yeah
 it's heavy right it's a horse yeah it's I would I would estimate it is closing in
 on 100 back somewhere between somewhere between 50 and 100 how is Jacob speaking
 point with real women think you can't how's he currently transporting the
 thing so he has a truck that has a lift on the back great she rides in the lift
 stop it he just carries her yeah I'm like is that Paul he was just carrying
 her around I'm not to be I mean I'm not as crazy as I was I just hired this
 vehicle that normally transports aquatic animals if you know if you think you
 recognize this swing this is the one that SeaWorld used to use you've
 probably seen this thing before got a deal got a real deal it it was actually
 like like a some sort of a chair one okay all right yeah so so we're in there
 and we get the word all right he's coming through blah blah blah so he comes in
 and because this thing is so heavy he he's got it up under the armpits and
 he's kind of waddling in you know Oh Supernova girl is saying roller skates
 and and somebody needs to get through to this guy and get him a pair of roller
 skates no but roller skates with I just what boom she'd be on her ass every five
 seconds he'd be doing like that's a real problem he'd be doing like those weird
 like Scott dances with her you know just like to the legs and up and around you
 get a tripod maybe we can talk roller skates what'd you call me yeah you heard
 it so he comes in he puts her behind a chair he tries to be apparently she's
 got wires or some kind of armature in the fingers and he tries to get her to
 grip the back of the chair is this the side the grip was apparently not good
 enough and you guys have seen the security footage yeah Paul it's a ride
 backwards just both eyes just pop right out of the head like champagne corks it's just like it's like a cartoon oh they just they just
 fly I don't with another way I christen what other guys in the room now this is
 indeed where he is not as crazy as I think he is because if he was crazy
 thing he was he would start weeping and he actually did just kind of start
 laughing and he was like okay and this one guy went to kind of help him and he
 was like no no so he went let me be the one that touches this don't do that sir
 don't help some things can't be undone sir back away they're supposed to be the
 the sockets are those sockets god this is this is worse the sockets kind of
 packed with cotton or something yeah just one of the little cotton balls also
 popped out and so he gets her he gets her back up she's there staring at the
 manager and she's got no oh and and of course I'm sitting there I'm you know
 it's not my show it's it's Chris's show and I'm just like all of my years of
 improv just failed me I had no idea what to do in this surreal I believe I would
 have literally fallen to the ground I believe I wouldn't be on the ground just
 right next to her my eyeballs might pop out as well I don't know yeah this has to
 be a huge curveball because you've already volunteered to do something
 maybe above and beyond at work and you've you said to basically you decide
 to hop on the social grenade so to speak you will be the front and back
 depending on how you're operating the room muscle to basically keep awkward
 bad conversations from happening right that's that's kind of like your your
 your MO yeah yeah I'm just gonna drop must have thrown you for a loop I just
 wanted I just wanted to be in the room standing back in the corner looking
 stern you know all right are you people are you gonna you know get my boss here
 you know it didn't go through a lot even weirder was it was in like a general
 admission everyone else knows that that looks like fun and they started
 throwing themselves on their backs hoping their eyes would pop out of their
 heads and we're just like seven people died that day it's like the 80s movie
 moment I'll make sure this person fits in I think I think Chris got
 a line of dialogue out before the thing and then he was just like cuz Chris do
 you guys know Chris Brown local Las Vegas actors work with oh I don't know
 if we know Chris I'm not sure thank you it works with Rihanna is that right no
 different Chris Brown ball okay okay so he was just I know you know waiting for
 things to get back to some semblance of normal and then he did probably the
 quickest version of that show right you have to this show resets like every 20
 minutes right like you can just run people through the show just resets you
 do the same show like many many many times and during the day it's got to be
 weird to do the show right after that show like you have to like yeah there
 must be like a weird thing where you're just watching yourself perform because
 you're like I shouldn't be just doing another show I should be talking to a
 counselor you have suffered a traumatic event I will I will contact the eyes
 exploding out of the robots and counselor for you and oh my god and so we
 sit the group accidents all the time here's my card and again it's the end of
 Chris's ship so I was in there just bump him out oh it's the end of his and he
 was just like he's just like oh my god the eyes they pop and we just we're both
 just like what were we supposed to did he find the eyes oh yeah yeah they were
 you know they're white carpet they were yeah I mean you can actually see him in
 that in that security video any and he just picked him up and pocketed him yeah
 he didn't worry about putting them back in her head at that point what do you
 know is this a video that we can reasonably post on our patreon do you
 think I don't think we can like reasonably share it I don't like that's
 for sure yeah I don't think we put on a butter goes the patreon yeah I probably
 know we've had the same conversation over I'm sure it's like you guys have
 to decide favorite nations make sure you split whatever money you make off of
 selling that video so yeah so yeah it was it was just like in yeah yeah
 just tell you now scoops scoops you know we owe you high fives when we see you in
 person I have access to the video okay so we're gonna video and we'll figure it
 out from there that's exactly it here I just I just sold tickets of Jokers of
 Magic for people just cuz they're like yeah I wasn't I wasn't gonna Wabash
 Indiana but now let's go let's let's hit it we gotta see this video no that's so
 hilarious there you have it January 23rd lucky day at the old House I'll be there
 holy smokes well thank you so much for sharing your inside scoop with us for
 sure did you have like a like a company debriefing about this event everyone
 kept their underwear on at all times Matt no but I mean like you might have
 been like as a company worth checking in you know that's that's the only thing
 I'm like are you saying post you say oh post no no we just I mean there wasn't a
 whole lot to do except I mean the guy apparently had a great time you know he
 went through was there any worry about the other people who went in the
 experience with him uh they I don't know if they were friends or not but they
 they thought it was interesting featured on a bug for the ticket value I will say
 those people probably got a much different show than than than most
 people right I know that the guy at the end playing the unseen it goes alright
 everybody let's move you pick up that sex doll let's go the characters have to
 talk to the doll like it was a person he yeah and he would do things like like
 yeah this is the blah blah blah oh she says I'm about tired of you speaking for
 safety you sir have disqualified yourself as a proper custodian for this maiden
 custodian ship on her this instant oh my god demand satisfaction preposterous
 preposterous whatever Britney Spears dad's thing was with her that's what I've
 got with that doll now I'm gonna take care of her I can give her a better life
 what's the shame now is simply that you've peaked right like this is it
 there's there's no other story coming down the pipe that's going to be like
 and then this other time like you're you're done now with stories from work
 yeah yeah that's that's that is that's true you have to go to the other ones
 first and just keep hanging that one back until someone really I just can't
 get over him fucking carrying the damn thing I put in a wheelchair that that I
 mean the eyes popping out was just oh my god what do we do him hoisting her up
 and then wobbling back and forth between her that that almost broke me right
 there those doors close those doors now I find the writing to be the Herculean
 effort here I don't sure you waddle around a hundred pound weight it is the
 constant fabricating of dialogue in your head that you were translating to
 everyone else in the room that to me feels exhausting doing some work man
 doing some work yeah and like I said the gentleman was not a young man so I'm
 guess he's getting his young man can't afford those things that's true too
 that's true too young man only can only afford the torso did you get a whiff of
 any thing whatever do you mean ball did it smell like anything just been fucked
 a bunch of times say that then what else could you be asking did he like to shoot
 down his throat like what are you talking about
 it smells like soup I'm calling the authorities that that doll is that doll
 is clearly leaking cream of mushroom get the cops in here right now this is
 disgusting oh my god would it be too much if she's leaking cream of mushroom
 down her leg and he's like up menses what are you gonna do oh I don't like
 having professor bigs on here anymore it's her time of the month but my time
 in the mouth as he slurps it up it's his shirt her he's basically a walking
 lunchable he clearly has not been cooked he keeps his snacks in there that is
 clearly raw cream of mushroom soup sir look that it's human grade where can
 people hear more stories from you they can hear them on the fabulous geek shock

 decade a little more than a decade finally got it all cleaned up anything

 moment I wonder if that guy's still sitting hey guys it's free click nice
