 got airplane helicopter next comes a slide whistle and a cymbal crash the

53
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:47,520
 chicken squawking so I was supposed to be at sea today yesterday we're supposed

54
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,160
 to spend the day in Maine and one of the things that's interesting about Virgin

55
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,840
 is that they basically when you go to ports that you can't dock at because

56
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,760
 your ship is too big you have to take boats little boats from your ship to the

57
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:11,680
 to the shore right okay those are called tender boats I prefer dinghies and it

58
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,680
 was really interesting because I didn't know that and I was like oh we're gonna

59
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,440
 tender can we tender tomorrow are we gonna tender or how do we tender and I

60
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,560
 was like what is going on you didn't understand the lingo eh I was like I

61
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,800
 brought plenty of actually let's do this rock and roll I'm an open-minded

62
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:36,280
 individual I assume my wife is as well but either way she's not here if she

63
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,680
 wanted she wanted me to do it she want me to do a tender that's what that's

64
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:47,080
 what you know if I know her so then we were in Maine and the seas were too

65
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,320
 too rough the current too strong to tender boat from the from the ship to

66
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:58,000
 the shores in Maine oh no so that means no none of their excursions got to go

67
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,040
 through right so excursions are over that kind of stuff and then also met

68
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,600
 that like for the time being we were just spending a sitting and looking at

69
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:14,400
 the shores of Maine was it kind of rocky even while you were docked no not too

70
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,360
 bad no because you're you're lassoed in pretty taught yeah yeah cuz it's also

71
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,680
 more of a current issue and currents weren't affecting the anchorage gigantic

72
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:30,240
 boat interesting but it's different when you're at sea and you're moving you're

73
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,040
 like oh it's a sea day but here we're going it's everything when you're at sea

74
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:40,480
 day you're like we can't go there and we're gonna sit here right and bless

75
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,600
 their hearts I'll say it bless their hearts over there at Virgin they made

76
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,760
 some calls and like about two hours into everything being canceled they're like

77
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:55,680
 hey we're going to Boston like right now so we're supposed to be in Maine go at

78
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,920
 sea for a day then be at Boston in the morning and they're like no we're gonna

79
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:06,400
 haul ass right now and go Boston right now and so you're gonna have an overnight

80
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:13,120
 two-day Boston excursion and and so I thought those pretty heads up on their

81
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:21,640

82
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,680

00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,560
 quantity finger-crossing but so yeah I was just doing that right up to the end

179
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:14,640
 and then you know shifting the dogs around because I got I got to run the

180
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:21,040
 giz and adora warden so I got to switch them oh yeah one has to be away while

181
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,800
 the other gets to roam free and then back and forth back and forth you got a

182
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:31,440
 balanced yard time they still don't get along no oh I thought it was like I

183
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,800
 thought there's like a temporary growth like no no no this is a forever thing

184
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,560
 this is not something that I would be okay with as a pet owner it's a it's

185
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,680
 aggro simply not be okay with some of my pets be like no no fuck you but now

186
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:50,000
 Agra leaving yeah it's agger damn bait and that's for sure either she is on my

187
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,440
 lap next to our next to Anne okay or she is put away or one of the other one is

188
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:04,640
 put away but so yeah I spend no all the time no babysitting is making sure gives

189
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,120
 is there and safe and then and then she'll start going because she needs to

190
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,520
 go out or want some water or whatever then I had to go and lock up a Dora and

191
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,440
 then put her out and then take her back and get a Dora back out and when Anne's

192
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,560
 home you have to put her up to right oh forget and adore I don't get along

193
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:28,120
 forget it they are vinegar and water just I think that's right is that right

194
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,440
 vinegar vinegar and water and also that's gonna be on the new burger of

195
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,240
 vinegar and water does not sound good I mean it is gonna be on there it will be

196
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:48,360
 something water vinegar and vinegar I don't know why not oil and vinegar it's

197
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:54,280
 you know it's the reason these oil spills are a problem is because they

198
00:19:54,280 --> 00:20:00,480
 don't mix and not snow as your copy editor but I ask if you want to do oil

199
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,400
 oil and vinegar instead of water and vinegar he doesn't know what copy editors

200
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:11,900
 mean I do though I do I just don't remember what the phrase is right but it

201
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:17,920
 was yeah no boy so well yeah fingers crossed for whatever she should she will

202
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:25,320
 crush whatever it is yes yes I only you know shake my head in disbelief anytime

203
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:32,160

238
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,600
 little help from above you'll feel the power of love it's not that Joe Pesci

 bucks back and maybe we'll talk dollars and some time with my children which has

261
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:15,680
 a price let's be honest it does people it does I'm sitting in a cabin the price

262
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:20,640
 is here the price is right motherfuckers prices right my little golden bottomed

263
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:29,700
 glass of water matches there with magic fish scaring housekeepers too much too

264
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:35,080
 much rating the rock vault is finally closing this year and in Las Vegas yes

265
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:39,600
 I think I think just like a couple years past for this might be the year we're

266
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,480
 talking about a lot of shows closing but yeah my sincere some touring but yeah

267
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,320
 they're gonna they're gonna close at the old Hard Rock Cafe here in Vegas finally

268
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:54,120
 at the end of the year after I think like 12 years my sincere hope for rating

269
00:27:54,120 --> 00:28:00,320
 the rock vault goes to the old wrestling adage how can they miss you if you never

270
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,640
 go away I agree and I really think that maybe three years from now they can come

271
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:13,640
 back really well let's see 2028 provided things are still intact she's shaken out

272
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:19,440
 in a certain way let's say 2028 maybe yeah okay just as a just as a arbitrary

273
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,680
 possible gotcha yeah okay I'm not picking that date for any specific reason

274
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,520
 no a little Vegas in parking whether they're trying to do a couple things or

275
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,680
 some because you know so you're like not gonna charge for parking for locals other

276
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:38,640
 people try deals and the whole point is just like man Vegas is a town of bold

277
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,400
 swings so if you kind of inch back little things and expected to have a big

278
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:49,480
 impact you're a fool yeah Cosmopolitan I just got an email about three minutes

279
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:55,680
 ago a report about Cosmopolitan they are doing a new special to try to entice

280
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:02,080
 locals and quote-unquote industry people to come to Cosmopolitan and what they are

281
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:14,640
 doing is they are offering free parking to these people every single Monday

282
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:22,480
 Mondays Monday is going free parking to locals on Monday when I was in my 20s

283
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,960
 and Monday was my night off after I worked on Saturday and Sunday yeah I

284
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,360
 started a thing with my friends called Mondays the new Saturday and we would go

285
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:39,160
 nuts on Monday nights I'm not even saying that I won't take advantage of

286
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:44,560
 this ever I'm just saying it's a dumb promotion as it worked in a very small

287
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:52,160
 group of friends in the 90s and 2000s early 2000s I would like you and that

288
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,360
 group of friends to hang out at the Cosmo on Monday nights going well I

289
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,500
 believe what let's see how long this going what the Cosmopolitan is missing in

290
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,240
 this calculation is there need to be industry people employed in Las Vegas

291
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:10,080
 for the discount to apply and if all the people are getting let go here's an

292
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:18,400
 example of what I think would would would be fun okay free parking and free

293
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,320
 valet again because it used to be free valet when you first came here right for

294
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:29,280
 an entire month if all of November it was just free parking and free

295
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,560
 valet because that would make people I think from Los Angeles and stuff go like

296
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:37,480
 oh maybe funders roll in there and toss the keys and go into Vegas for a weekend

297
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,080
 or whatever like they might like that would be something that would at least

298
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,280
 make people go like oh shit you know like you know like there you go scoop

299
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:49,000
 Jesus has got it no fee November I was gonna say no pay no Ben November to go

300
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,880
 along with no nut November as we all celebrate of course yeah I'm getting a

301
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:07,320
 jump on it that was low-hanging fruit that's why I can't resist touching it

302
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:16,120
 boy yeah that's a good idea Matt it does need to be a big move right silly or

303
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,420
 stupid it needs to be like oh like oh what like it needs people go like whoa

304
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:24,480
 like it needs to like make people go like oh shit cool Vegas is back that's

305
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,520
 what that's like so like these little inching things of like oh well you know

306
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:33,040
 we're not charging for this over here we give this much and maybe that will get

307
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,680
 enough people in the door to move the needle a little bit yeah but we won't

308
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:44,400
 change too much yeah yeah but they won't do it well I don't want to give away too

309
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:51,480
 much production stuff here but I feel like our dealings with the Orleans

310
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:59,280
 reflected very much sort of zeitgeist of what's going on in Vegas and I see this

311
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:05,920
 quoted by local Vegas and Las Vegas locally and and you know some of our

312
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:12,080
 favorite Twitter bloggers and whatnot how you know this vicious cycle of oh

313
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:17,400
 shit we're losing money because no one's coming let's charge everyone for

314
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:22,240
 everything right every little thing because everything that used to be free

315
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,160
 now are our charges things that used to be just considered complementary now our

316
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,720
 charges things that we used to be able to make a deal on now we can't negotiate

317
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,960
 a fucking penny you know and then that gets even worse because you start to

318
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,200
 tighten the strings on the people who are actually paying to utilize your space

319
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:44,920
 and then they don't want to utilize your space and then it's like yeah yeah sorry

320
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,040
 I wasn't listening what you could you start from the beginning again so I

321
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:54,200
 don't want to give too much away here regarding our yeah you wouldn't talk

322
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,320
 about the oh he's talking about Vegas as a whole so Jacob I had both leaned in

323
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:04,040
 and leaned out yeah no I didn't want to give too much away oh I don't mind

324
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:09,040
 telling the audience that we had a very fucking hard time dealing with yeah yeah

325
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,720
 no they were tough this year yeah and I think but I mean I think it's part not

326
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,720
 just for us I talked to what to other people that had right events there and

327
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,760
 and everyone had exactly the same complaints and I think it's in no small

328
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,800
 part due to that whole effect of the tightening of belts all the way around

329
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:29,520
 and the rejiggering of employment employees to where there's all people who

330
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:34,440
 aren't familiar with their now prior roles you know and if you don't want to

331
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,560
 give too much away here but we actually had kind of a hard time dealing with

332
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:43,200
 your liens this year okay I don't want to spill all the beans but this year our

333
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,840
 relationship with the Orleans was strained that was yeah yeah yeah yeah

334
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:55,040
 but not to give too much away let's keep some cats in the bag here but let's also

335
00:33:55,040 --> 00:34:04,760
 say so far as us go into the Orleans that was tough this time around that was a

336
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,440
 real dick kick there's a really there was a free place for me to park on

337
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:17,240
 Mondays then it would all be better then I'd hang out on the strip some more yeah

338
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:21,520

399
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,760
 future there are people around me that were like whoa

 I don't fucking know but I mean oh my savings scoop Jesus is putting on the

406
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,400
 chat like I've noticed some plot holes in this cruise ship jukebox time travel

407
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:30,320
 musical no I get it that that parts like no it's ridiculous of course it is the

408
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:38,640
 story to note that like just be like whoa like it was blowing people away I was

409
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:45,120
 ready for time travel but not extreme time travel what they think of next I

410
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:50,760
 don't know the most logical thing did they do jungle love they did not do

411
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:57,600
 jungle love although yeah they do walk the dinosaur when when it featured

412
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:06,480
 tribal people it did go into more ethnic and rap songs oh no suddenly it's a

413
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,880
 Busta Rhymes video yeah that's kind of like maybe don't maybe don't put those

414
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:22,600
 two together like that you know what kudos to them for really addressing our

415
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:29,700
 troubled past everybody was definitely a lot of races all getting along and

416
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:34,240
 everyone got to sit wherever they wanted there's a chance I could add some real

417
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:44,160
 commentary what I would like to see on a cruise ship more a cheesy song and dance

418
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:49,240
 show where they're traveling through time or a show where they really examine

419
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:55,240
 all of the problems in America's racial history hey there daddy oh where'd you

420
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:02,840
 zip in from I'm from the future I'm from the future I'm from 2026 Wowzers what's

421
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:10,040
 that like well it's not too far off from the 1950s segregation but none of the

422
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:18,240
 prosperity fuck us right yeah how'd you build a time machine God knows why don't

423
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:22,000
 you want to stay here I'm ignorant I'm going back to where dinosaurs are

424
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,760
 because I've got a better chance of making a life for myself in the time of

425
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:32,000
 dinosaurs than I do in my time you're right I do want to see the educational

426
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:39,480
 show on the cruise ship yeah exploration it's Saturday night I'm gonna go to the

427
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:46,240
 Rosa Parks musical let's do it look man I'm a Tyrannosaurus Rex not a

428
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:58,600
 tyrannoracist Rex everybody gets along in my time unless you're prey but you

429
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:03,800
 could still sit anywhere you want in our dino diner

430
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:09,640
 oh the diner is still there oh yeah the diner is the through line show the dino

431
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:15,400
 diner it's always been a diner no matter what time

432
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:32,240
 period I would love to me you and Sarah and maybe even Jacob and SJ honestly all

433
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,640
 of us I think it'd be really fun to take a swing at trying to come up with a

434
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:42,080
 cruise ship show that we could put together a jukebox musical for cruise

435
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,920
 ships I think we could fucking crush it that might be the next episode of this

436
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:51,560
 show like seriously we could crush one the four of us all together with all the

437
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,960
 experience we've had like on both sides like Jacob could come at it with the tech

438
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:00,480
 stuff and we could come at it from a writing perspective and and you can come

439
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,760
 out from a performance perspective and it would just you know we could make

440
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,160
 something really interesting I think all right we're gonna stop doing this

441
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:15,000
 podcast from now on we're just writing cruise ship musicals step three profit

442
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,560
 all you need is one all you need is one it'll play like you know like you have

443
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,280
 these young people who are crazy talented right they have to get to do be

444
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,120
 if you do so many dance numbers and sing so many songs to get on these these

445
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:31,960
 things and they have like their songbook and they can like kick-ass choreography

446
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:38,320
 then you put them in these musicals that are so strange where every costumes like

447
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:45,280
 a million dollars and you're like I was gonna I was gonna showcase myself but

448
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:52,400
 instead of playing like a secret spy scientist wearing a dinosaur tail that's

449
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:58,760
 that's where I'm doing that's where I'm living my life but the money is yeah

450
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:04,600
 yeah but it was it was fun it was it was it was certainly worth seeing so did

451
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:08,360
 they go to the far-flung future eventually - yes they went back to like

452
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:16,600
 before the big bang no lightsabers yeah what indicated Jacob when they were

453
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:20,280
 hanging out before the big bang I was like where are you hanging out and where

454
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:25,960
 are you staying they went to before the big bang they went to before the big

455
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:30,480
 bang now wait a minute what they said that was it yeah the big bang that's

456
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,200
 where they had this a real soul-searching Paul it's where they

457
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:36,040
 really start to discover who they were and their feelings for each other well

458
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:39,920
 it's because they didn't have any lights because they just went to pitch black

459
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,480
 they're like oh this is where the big bang all matter actually how is it the

460
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,080
 one tiny particle I was like how was our sound traveling from my mouth to your

461
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:54,680
 ears before the big bang again with the big bang again I don't want to poke

462
00:46:54,680 --> 00:47:05,800
 holes in a cruise ship musical I don't I just I was curious about it there's so

463
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:10,240
 much happening here before the big bang

464
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:21,160
 really a really great image of dinersaurus dinosaurs dressed up like

465
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:26,200
 line cooks pretty great

466
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:38,720
 well the diner it could be it's sort of like a hitchhiker's guide the diner at

467
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:46,640
 the end of the universe right yeah yeah yeah but how is this diner even here who

468
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:53,080
 knows before the big bang who the fuck knows we're all just hash brown cakes not

469
00:47:53,080 --> 00:48:01,880
 before the big bang they don't exist yet we don't even have moons over Miami

470
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:10,560
 because there are no moons hey how are my hammy my hammy welcome to Miami Ben

473
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:26,280
 with Jackson Dart I only bring the New York Giants look like the best team in

474
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,600
 the football league that's right that's what happened I only bring this up

475
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:36,320
 because Jackson Dart absolutely is the boyfriend of the daughter from land man

476
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:44,320
 like that's watching when a press conference I was like oh my god it's

477
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:48,400
 just the boyfriend from the show land man the football high school football

478
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:56,960
 player oh yeah he's totally the same guy and Paul went away but Paul I'm here he

479
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,520
 wears uh he wears like a black splotch on his cheek yeah he doesn't do the the

480
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:08,040
 black face paint below both eyes he just does like a big splotch below one eye

481
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:18,400
 and he does it because it's a tribute to Anakin Skywalker is it really he was

482
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,360
 playing in high school and he was inspired by Anakin Skywalker and then

483
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,400
 put a little black splotch on his cheek and some said look pretty cool so that

484
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:32,000
 became his thing from then on and it was so funny because Herb Street and Al

485
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,880
 Michaels and Al Michaels is like almost 80 years old he's done all like the

486
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,120
 greatest right you know called the mystery the miracle of ice in the 1980

487
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:44,880
 Olympics like and Herb Street's like of course it's a Star Wars reference Mike

488
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:51,600
 you want to take it from here because Al Michaels I guess Al you want to take it

489
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:55,760
 from here no no yeah you know I love me some Star Wars but no you go ahead Kurt

490
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:01,000
 you break it down for the audience Al Michaels was like do not make me talk

491
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:09,240
 about Star Wars wow well I mean you know that generation they really did love the

492
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,600
 prequels yeah you know it was very impactful for them that was their big

493
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:17,920
 movie going experience and I gotta say Hayden Christensen was doing a lot of

494
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:25,440
 heavy lifting he tried with that shit script that he had you know so props to

495
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,200
 him but I guess so the blotch is to indicate like when he got burned up in

496
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:37,360
 the yeah oh it's from it's the scar it's the scar okay yeah now I see I thought

497
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:41,280
 it was just on his cheek oh no it's the scar okay okay yeah he's like blacked

498
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,880
 out one eye yeah he gets a scar okay well he's a handsome little Hayden

499
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:54,280
 Christensen looking dude himself yeah yeah the quarterback of the New York

500
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:59,200

530
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:55,860
 gentlemen an episode 1244 you guys discussed the song darling Nikki by

531
00:53:55,860 --> 00:54:00,760
 Prince the first time my mother ever heard that song was in April of 1985 I

532
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:06,560
 had been born in March of 1985 my name is Nikki Jacob gave a good rundown of

533
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:11,240
 the song on that episode but for context the very first lyrics are I knew a girl

534
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:16,200
 named Nikki I guess you could say that she was a sex fiend I met her in a

535
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:22,480
 hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine my poor mother was completely

536
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,160
 horrified she said that if she had just heard that song a month earlier there is

537
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:30,600
 no way in hell that she would have named her baby Nikki my name would have been

538
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:35,640
 Sarah and that would have been weird so I'm glad it all worked out

539
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:41,920
 people named Sarah are weird breaks in the same episode Matt talked about the

540
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:48,840
 band G love and special sauce oh yeah coincidentally they also have a song

541
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:53,680
 that references a girl named Nikki performing sex acts on the singer it's

542
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,920
 called kick drum and it's actually a really good song it is a good face

543
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,640
 that's a mass hole scoop who is a brand that's a brand new scoop name no

544
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:09,120
 fantastic yeah thank you mass hole scoop so that's another question for the ages

545
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:16,440
 and I'd love to get the popular opinion Matt Jacob what is your take on Nikki's

546
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:23,560
 actual physical situation during this scenario is she reading and perusing a

547
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:30,920
 magazine and did live the beam rolling up the magazine to some sort of phallus

548
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:38,520
 and inserting it you know Paul there by masturbating with a magazine I have to

549
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:44,760
 thank you Paul because I thought I was gonna have to ask that question and so

550
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:50,600
 thank you thank you for being one of the turtle burning questions Nikki actually

551
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:56,960
 doing with that magazine option B is eternally burning that's for sure and

552
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:01,760
 then ML Kennedy says the magazine was also masturbating right that's another

553
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:08,340
 reading on it it could have been joining in on the magazine's master magazine

554
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:14,120
 there's masturbating I think Prince forgot word for reading and replace it

555
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:31,040
 with masturbation you think he just did a search and replace better in a hotel

556
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:39,880
 lobby reading a magazine that word means I don't know let's replace it with

557
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:55,000
 masturbating reading too few syllables doesn't work linguistically also you

558
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:02,800
 would hope that that's a very glossy tone because if it's just straight news

559
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:10,200
 print oh he's gonna disintegrate you're basically she's gonna have a paper

560
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:27,280
 machine good check for paper luckily it was a glossy magazine yeah when you read

561
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:32,280
 the lighter notes is that do not try this at home do not utilize lighter

562
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:37,720
 notes for who high insertion when I read the lighter notes they were all smudged

563
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:46,920
 from being in my hoo-ha we got one from Trav hi I have over a decade of

564
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,680
 professional experience in kitchens not to mention my continued learning and

565
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:55,000
 growth in the 20 plus years of my adult life that I haven't gotten paid for

566
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:00,240
 cooking I say this to only say unfortunately Paul is right about

567
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:06,040
 microwaving hot dogs he's an absolute potato when it comes to

568
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:10,600
 microwaving bratwurst though you see cooking a hot dog just involves warming

569
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,640
 it up most of them you can eat it raw for the most part they're cured and

570
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:17,000
 fully cooked therefore the only thing that needs to be done is to make it hot

571
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,320
 to be tastier the traditional method for a ballpark hot dog is boiling cooking a

572
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:24,640
 hot dog in a microwave is essentially the same thing it's akin to steaming as

573
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:28,740
 long as you don't overdo it a microwaved hot dog is perfectly acceptable one could

574
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:34,240
 argue even efficient I'm not saying you microwave the bun never microwave bread

575
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:38,600
 it makes it tough now there could be arguments that grilling a hot dog adds

576
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,600
 more flavor and a bit of texture that's not wrong but that doesn't make a

577
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:47,240
 microwaved hot dog unpalatable it just makes those options better let's not

578
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:51,960
 pretend that a hot dog is some culinary masterpiece it is a way to dress up the

579
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,840
 leftovers and sell some cheap-ass shit love y'all fuck you the face that's

580
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:07,520
 Trav aka ID H a S in okay yeah it hasn't I don't know I appreciate that Trav

581
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:12,960
 thank you for coming to my defense yes I did say that you're a potato for

582
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:20,560
 microwaving bratwurst look I did it once okay I've learned my lesson potato yeah

583
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:24,720
 yeah it's just it's just a convenience thing yeah tell that to my intestines the

584
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:37,000
 science is tight on this it's not it's not the same the science is out and we

585
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,600
 got one here from Robert hi folks loved episode 1227 Rob's story about his

586
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:47,040
 heroin neighbors reminded me of our old family friend Tim he was about 60 at the

587
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:52,600
 time and this took place back in the 80s back in Poughkeepsie New York every fall

588
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:58,360
 Tim would wander into our woods and collect giant quote-unquote basketball

589
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:05,000
 mushrooms that not a nickname they were literally the size of basketballs I got

590
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
 he had the he had the foraging know-how to tell the good from the deadly and had

591
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,920
 sliced them like bread and fry them up said they were delicious we weren't

592
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:17,880
 brave enough to find out for ourselves then one year Tim just stopped showing

593
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:23,480
 up he was dirt poor and had no phone so we had no way to check on no our best

594
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:28,440
 guest he finally grabbed a wrong mushroom and joined the network in the

595
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:39,680
 sky years later surprise Tim reappears turns out he had gone to prison he went

596
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:49,880
 to prison he just went to prison for mushroom thievin who knows I like to

597
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:53,760
 think it was for mushroom thievin fast forward these turn things around got a

598
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:58,040
 place even a phone he calls my grandfather and asks if I the family's

599
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:05,120
 designated preteen tech wizard can help him set up a fax machine grandpa and I

600
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:10,200
 head to his sketchy apartment one of the in one of Poughkeepsie's less than great

601
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:14,640
 neighborhoods I plug in the brand new fax machine and ask if he has anyone to

602
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:19,560
 fax or someone who might fax him then we spend 20 minutes explaining what a fax

603
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:27,400
 machine actually does he seems surprised by the concept thanks for coming over I

604
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:32,920
