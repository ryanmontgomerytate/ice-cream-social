Oh, hello there! I am so happy you're here because right now I'd like to thank the Ice Cream Truck Drivers. Thank you so much, Ice Cream Truck Drivers! I don't have a list yet. We're recording this show in the past, but we are going to thank each and every Ice Cream Truck Driver before this month is over. If you want to be an Ice Cream Truck Driver and help deliver this fucking ice cream straight to people's fucking ear holes, head over to preachingfun.com. Preachingfun.com is where you can go to sign up to be an Ice Cream Truck Driver, and who knows? The life you save may be your own. Here's the show! Hey, Johnny! Do you want to go to an Ice Cream Social? Yeah, I'd love to! Great! Let's go! Horses! Reportedly did not come to the Las Vegas rodeo this year because of a horse flu. No, I know horse whoopies! Oh, really? It's Cream Social! Sittin' in Las Vegas! That's Matt Donnelly! Sittin' in Pittsburgh! It's Paul Mattingly! Sittin' in Las Vegas! Loaded with horse herpes! It's me, Jacob, the audio guy! We're preaching fun. First off, I didn't, because of the music that went into it, but bam-a-lam. Horse herpes, bam-a-lam. Bam-a-lam. If you type in horse herpes, Google will autofill Las Vegas. Oh, shit! Yeah, wait a minute. If you type in herpes at all, Google will autofill Las Vegas. Can they get this by like sharing a water trough and shit? Is that how bad it could be? Is that how viral it is? Where's Nick Newman when we need him? Oh, I was looking for him in the chat before we started. I know. He's not in here. Let's see. No confirmed cases were reported in Nevada, but there is a significant equine herpes virus outbreak affecting horse events nationwide, causing major disruptions, cancellations, like the all-in barrel race, and heightened biosecurity at the NFR rodeo, which is the one in Vegas here during early December. See, a lot of people just didn't bring their horses. A lot of people just left their animals at home and came to the rodeo. Apparently, the rodeo was really affected by it. Paul says, Paul is right. Let's do it. Okay. Primarily directed through contact, nose to nose, or indirectly from shared items like tack, buckets, clothing, and even people's hands, the aerosol droplets, or contact infected with fluids. Man, it's amazing how we all don't have horse herpes. This is everything. I'm already looking up if it can go to people. No, it's not a zoonotic jumper. Please, fuck, no. I don't want horse herpes. No, humans cannot get infected with horse herpes. Don't worry about it. Keep on fucking those horses. Keep on a horse of fucking. Use a step stool. Safety first, people. Safety first. That's right. Oh, good Lord. Don't just be out there puffing it. Mr. Hands has nothing to worry about. There'll be more horse herpy stuff in the new Taylor Sheridan show about the rodeo. Rodeo. What will it be called? Thornton. It'll be called. It'll be called bull rider. Long dick man. Speech guy. Sheridan's running out of good names. Bull rider, long dick man, speech guy. You know what to say about riding bulls? What's that? A lot of times people think it's all about those eight seconds. You got to stay on the bull. Those eight seconds, those are the least important seconds of the whole thing. The most important time is when you enter the pen. My secret, give that bull a little light touch behind the ear. I got a little dab of hot, icy cold on my finger. And I give him a little rub right behind the ear with icy cold. Icy hot. And that's what he's feeling. What are you quoting? What are you quoting? I'm making up a dumb speech that he would do for this rodeo long dick man. I thought you were quoting something, but you're doing it. Oh, I'm improvising, Matt. That's what I do. No, no, no. I didn't mean to be that much of a dick about it. But you didn't make me feel liberal guilt. That's why I didn't think it was a Sheridan speech. You have to. I haven't got there yet. Also, to be fair, I don't, I don't watch. You don't watch the shows. So I don't know enough of, but okay. So now I know where to go to go with it. Yes. So I rub a little bit behind there. And then when that bull knocks me off after eight seconds, if I stay on there for more than eight seconds, that bull has outlived its life. And that bull is going to become your case of fajita over at Chili's next week. But you can't look at that bull and realize that's my case of fajita coming to me. You look at that bull thing. What a noble, beautiful animal. And all I see is the 999 dinner for two special at Chili's. You fucking libtard. Enter Sheridan check out. Is that closer? Is that more like what he says? It's pretty close. It's pretty close. That's much closer. What a dick. I never want to watch any of those shows. You would hate them, Paul. I know I would. I can tell I would. I'm sure. You would hate them. I know there was a thing. It was a yellow stone. Like last year, the yellow stone, there was this character that appeared like a hippie who got arrested. Became like a like a girlfriend of Kevin Costner, but like in this like pseudo we don't like each other, but we do kind of thing. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And her job the last season was just to get lectured by every cast member of a different aspect of Montana society. It's a good gig if you can get it. And at one point, there's one character who's a Native American who's already was already feeling guilt about marrying into a Montana family that like, you know, it's against her. Native American, you know, whatever she lectured her and I was like Jesus. I was like everyone's breaking character. Just a lecture lives like everybody hates this girl once we torch this live girl. We can go back to fighting about real things between our cultures. But in the meantime, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. And there was a plot point happening in landmine right now. And I and I and I feel crazy only because like in season one. This person got a payout from the oil company. Like a wrongful death suit. Okay, this couple, this whole season, this whole season, they're fighting over money and I'm like, weren't you paid a shit little money from an old company? Why isn't that coming up in conversation? Why is it coming up? You're paid out. There's a large plot point last season about the large plot point. That's happening right now in Mayor of King's Town, which I watch right now like like the pilot episode is that what's his name? The guy got right over by a snowmower in real life. Hawkeye Hawkeye. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. So that guy, he ends up becoming his brother's job because his brother gets killed in a botched robbery, right? And they went through like four seasons were like, man, we haven't brought him up in a while. So the last episode that they bring up is dead brother like six times. So they're really making up for the lost, lost bit there. Jeremy Renner, Jeremy Renner is who I'm thinking of. Yeah. It's hard. It's hard. He's a hard case too. He's a fucking hard case. That guy. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. You talk about somebody coming away with the wrong life lessons after a near death experience. Jeremy Renner. Yeah. Oh, I don't know about this. Oh, he's just kind of doubled down on his assholery. He's a bit of a shit bird. Okay. I don't know. I like Jeremy Renner a lot. Not a lot. I like Jeremy Renner. I'd fuck him. He's going to break your heart, Matt. It's probably true, but he like survived on like, he and his brother were like split like a box of like donut holes when they were like dirt poor. They got by in Hollywood by like buying and flipping a house and then flipping that in other houses and doing construction, something like that. But like he went from like dirt as poor to like building himself up into like a house flipper while trying to be an actor at the same time. I thought that was pretty cool that he was not any kind of like nepo baby or anything like that. Like he really had to like fight to stay in the business and try to make a go of it. So I do like it and her locker. Come on. That's a cool debut story. Sure. All right. What is why is he a shipper? Ah, it's easy. I get 10 vibes when I hear him talk. Oh, oh, oh, I did something. No, he's just kind of he's just kind of his his his his. Oh, he might not get along with him. I don't give a shit about that. No, no, no, no, no, no. He's take on things. His stance on some shit. It's a little bit. But whatever. It's fine. Paul is weary. Paul is weary. I'm good for him. Good for him. Do your thing. Make your make your money. I went poker the other day for the first time in a very long time. Yeah. And I thought I was going to watch someone get murdered while I was at the poker table. I thought I thought one player was going to murder another player. Tournament or open table? Open table. Okay. Cash game. Okay. No big deal. Low stakes cash game. One three, one three, no limit cash game. Fellow that was at the table a couple of seats down from me. He won a sizable pot from me. Got a little bit lucky on the last card. Drew out on the last card. No, I'm not saying anything to him. You know, I'm the hand ends. He wins. It's a good size to hand. But you're stewing. Yeah, you're stewing. I'm not even stewing. I'm like, oh, that's all right. All right. He got it. He says, without me saying anything, he says to me, boy, I thought you were going to draw out on me there. And I looked, I looked back. I was just confused. I looked back. I was like, wait, I was ahead though. I was ahead until the, until the last card. You got the last card there and you won it. He goes, yeah, yeah, but I was mathematically ahead already. I was supposed to win that hand already. I just wasn't ahead on the cards yet. And I, and I kind of laughed. And I kind of, I kind of, because he was absolutely being genuine. He was, he was saying that with all sincerity. He was like, no, no, no, I was supposed to win that hand. I was ahead mathematically, which he wasn't. By the time he actually made the call, he wasn't mathematically behind when he made the call. Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. He won the hand. I wasn't mad about it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that was, that was that. He was a touch of a, you know, a skosh, this much of a, of just a bit of a jerk about it. Just a, just not even, not even a jerk. I was done with it though. So we, we continue playing the game. I don't say anything to him about it after I got it, after I figured out what he meant by that. Didn't matter that he was wrong. I was over it moving on. So about half an hour later, I win a big hand, a, a, a very big hand off of that guy. Okay. So I made all the money back and then quite a bit more off of that guy. Like I say, about half an hour later. Again, this person is not sitting next to me. There is a person between us. After I win that hand, I don't say anything because I'm not stupid. When it comes to this, I'm not. This scenario, you're not stupid. This scenario, I was not stupid at that moment. There we go. So I don't say a word. The person between us though looks at the guy who just lost the hand. Oh, and by the way, I had drawn out, I had drawn out on this hand. So I got a little bit lucky on this hand. And the fourth card out, I got a little bit lucky with that card. All the more reason to shut up, right? You got lucky. That's it. That's it. Yep. I'm, I'm just being quiet. I'm, I'm stacking up my chips. I'm, I'm moving on to the next hand. The guy between us looks at the guy who just lost and goes, well, that was payback for earlier, huh? And I, like my head just snapped up. You know, I'm looking down. I'm looking anywhere but at this guy, my head just snaps up. And I just, I was like, I, whatever is happening here, I don't want to be a part of this. That's, I would give a, I would give a stern stop helping line to the guy over there. I wanted to, I wanted to so badly. I didn't want to open my mouth though. I was afraid that if I drew any attention to myself, that it was all just going to dump on to me. I've, did a party consider going, right? And then high-fiving the guy. Right. You are. Oh man. Feels good. Don't it, motherfucker? Took the words out of my mouth. He turned to this guy and goes, you need to shut the fuck up. I couldn't hold it together anymore. I burst out laughing. You can just put the mic up and make me laugh really hard. I laughed so hard. I was crying at the poker table. I had to get up and walk away. It was awful. Because that's it. Like you, you have to laugh at that point because that's all you can do. It's all you can do and if that guy is above the laugh line, he's about to get kicked out of the casino anyway. Yes. Yes. So Jake, I just want to make it clear that I'm not involved in whatever this conversation is over here. I think I'm going to go home. I think I'm just going to go home in that kind of scenario. Can you, can you just get up and go? Can you just get up and go after, after any game? After any open table, you can stand up anytime. I feel, don't you feel I have felt bad in the past. I haven't played in forever, but I would feel bad after winning a pot and then leaving the table. It's called hitting and running. You're not, it's bad etiquette. But it's also how you get money, right? It's certainly, it is certainly allowed within the rules and the people who do it are probably more intelligent than the other people who are still sitting at the table. I just stay there to lose. But at least at the DC to take a fake phone call and pretend to talk about an urgent matter. Oh, for God's sakes. Oh my gosh. A baby? Now? Both babies? Both babies at the same time? Wait, more than two? Where are the other babies coming from? How many babies? Guys, I gotta go, sorry, all the babies. Lots of babies. So many babies. So many babies, guys. Hey, great game and you need to shut the fuck up. Bye. I think I stayed for about five more minutes because I didn't know how to not leave awkwardly. Right. And I was like, I'm, this is it. I'm leaving. This is where you're going to. Fuck that. Oh boy. Oh, it was so bad. It was so bad. I was like this, you're going to, you're going to get yourself shot. I'm going to get shot just by sitting here. I don't want to get shot. I don't want to be in a fight with some random dude in a casino at 1130 at night. I've definitely, I've never been sitting at a table where someone hit and run and it's not even like, oh, they're, you know, that lucky motherfucker. It's more like all the money at the table is gone. Like you look at like it's just a bunch of short stacks. You're like, oh, now what are we all playing for $50? Yeah, now the game is just kind of over. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but still, you know, it's an open table. That's all it's all I would have sat and played for a while longer. If this guy had not egged on the guy that I had just accidentally roughed up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The scenario, the amount of scenarios where the table and the other guy was already putting more cash down on the table. Like he was staying in. Yeah. So he wasn't leaving. He wouldn't go anywhere anytime soon. Like, nope, nope. Whatever's happened here. I don't want to be in it. People going on tilts one of the weirdest things to watch and so hard to deal with. And yet, especially at like a low stakes game. Yeah. But this, this is supposed to not matter. Right. This is like on on pot therapy, Whitney's husband, Peter. Yeah, he's a professional poker player. And so we, I always, anytime I play poker, which is probably, I don't know, at this point, three times a year, I go, I'll play poker. And oftentimes I will end up with a story for Peter from these low stakes games because he's these, these one three games aren't the games that he's playing. But every now and then, you run into a professional, you know, a big quote unquote professional poker player at a low stakes game. Well, they all have these training apps now. And they're all like these, there's additional game theory stuff that makes people do dumb things on purpose to mess with other people's math. And no one's playing the cards. And it's gotten super weird. But watching people do that at a low stakes game where no one is doing the math in the first place, yeah, yeah, it's like meta fuck you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's, it's crazy. It's just a weird crazy thing. And also, like, you know, and I, I've been, you know, we've all been victims of bad beats, you know, that kind of thing. It's like it's poker for a reason, you know, like, you're like, oh, I was doing the math and then gambling happened. Yeah, yeah, that's the kind of like what we're doing. Yeah, is tempting fate for bouts of luck and craziness. Yeah, right. Sometimes the wrong card just comes out or the right card. Speaking of gambling, go ahead. What are your guys takes on the current state of sports and sort of the veneer cracking around? Oh, that play was clearly somebody covering a spread or fucking around for no good reason, especially the collegiate level. Well, the Raiders got a lot of heat, right? Is there going to be? Is there going to be any kind of real? No, because what consequence? I don't know, but my consequence, like you can't have a consequence. If you don't know that something happened and there's no way to tell if something happened, unless somebody says like I did this. I will say that I hear Paul and that like when they started loosening up all the sports gambling, all the scenarios that everyone thought of sure came up in a hurry. All the things like what if this happens? Where that happens? It seems of all come to a head really quickly. Oh, let me be clear. I don't think I don't think that Paul is wrong on this. I think that Paul is absolutely correct on this. Oh, what's that? I don't know. I think you're absolutely correct on this. I'm saying I don't know how to prove it. I don't know how to, I don't know how to like get anyone. But like, did you see that play? Like it was making me viral. I've been really intentionally not watching any football anything, but there was some college game and the kid is running down the field with the ball and just he's got nobody in front of him. He's almost the goal line. And he just walks off the side. Have you seen it? I love it because there's so many college games. So there's so many. That's the thing is like college sports specifically, right? So like you can watch the NBA and the NFL. You have 30 teams going at it, right? Or 332, whatever. And with college, you have hundreds and hundreds of 30 teams just in the big 10, right? And in those scenarios, right? Those smaller colleges where they're not making a lot of money. Right. So like this. Hey, if I had the opportunity to take two steps to the left and make $20,000, I think I'd do it. All right. You know, let's, all right. Let's test this. I'm in for 20. I just need a thousand people to join me. You're not in for 20,000. You're in for $20. I'm in for $20. But I just feel like, I just feel like you can't trust any sport at this point on a professional level. I don't think you have. Here's why. Here's why I think you are not wrong, but mistaken in the, in the path that you're going down. Okay. I don't think you have to go to gambling. I think you can just go to the, to the legit money, the quote unquote, legit money in it. And that's all you have. Like, I don't think you have to go to the gambling side of it. I don't think you have to go to the dark money to find the crazy shit that's going on. I was laughing so hard in a college football. It's it's getting nuts. Yeah. And Indiana, the mean that's going around is like Indiana's been terrible football for 150 years. You can pay players and suddenly they're they're good. They're like Indiana was the only only college playing by the rules for the last 150 years and I was laughing because Indiana won a crazy game against Ohio State and both players are interviewed. Like I want to thank God. I want to thank our Lord God, Lord God, Lord God. And I was like, buddy, you have the highest payroll. You can thank you can thank old Johnny Greenbacks. I think that's the best person you want to thank. You want to thank your river of money of boosters. Yeah. I want to thank God, which is what I call all of my sugar daddies here at Indiana University. Right. Thank you God. No, it's going to college football is going to get weird. College football is about to get bizarre because the amount of money that's going into that through like the legit channels. Yeah. It's it's so much money. It's yeah. It's going to be great. Oh yeah. And then Andy has mentioned the transfer portal being able to transfer from from team to team much more easily now. Oh yeah. But coaches like coaches leave teams with like, I'm going to leave this $12 million a year job. Even though I thought I was trying to stay for 10 years, I'm going to leave because I was going to pay me even more money. Like you can't. There's no these contracts mean nothing. Yeah. No, no, that's a single thing. That's because the boosters because it's because it's even more infinite money than pro teams. Right. But there's 32 NFL teams, right? Yeah. It's just 30. I think it's 32. I think it's 32. So like if you're like the 33rd or 34th best quarterback, right, you can now make money by staying at a university and playing quarterback in college. If you just want to stay at Michigan. So what's going to happen? You can make more money playing at Michigan than you can backing up at the New England Patriots. What's going to happen would just make sense for me to play six, seven or eight years at Michigan. That's what I'm wondering is going to that's what's that's where it's going to get. We're going to have 35 year old is playing college ball. Right. I mean, a Shador Sanders is a good example of one. He's playing for the for the Cleveland Browns. Now he, uh, when the draft happened, he's a rookie this year. When the draft happened, uh, the place that he got drafted at, they said point blank, they were like, he could have made more money if he had just stayed another year in college. Yeah. Then if he had got drafted in the NFL. Yeah. They just say it. They're just like, oh yeah, he could have made more money if he had stayed at, uh, he played at the University of Colorado. They could have just stayed there and made more money. That would have just been it. Yeah. Uh, lower green copper scale in chats isn't, isn't, uh, youth league in high school football, falling out of favor for safer sports. Yes, uh, a large, a large part, yes, but for the less glorious positions like linemen and things like that are, you're finding, uh, it's harder and harder to find these quality people want to sacrifice their bodies for, for the thankless positions. Well, again, I can't, I can't say it enough like that, that Aaron Hernandez, special secretary, that last podcast did, they did like three episodes on him and both, uh, Marcus and Ed were like, we came up as youth people, young men playing football and they talked about the horrors of it through high school and all that kind of stuff. And it's just, it's, you know, it really, it was insane. It was, it changed their mind. It was insane. They've been, they've been football, like Ed has been a football fan forever. Like Miami Dolphins is like part of his identity as a human being. And he's now, just now after all this, this, this podcast, this little podcast run and doing the research in it, he's really just starting to change his mind around the CTE and the dangers of the sport and just the inhumanity of it. My brother was captain of his football team in the high school and he tells stories that I'm still afraid to repeat here now. That I'm like, really? That went down like that would be a crazy crazy scandal. Yes. There are, there are things that happened on a regular basis on the, on the teams at my high school that people would go to jail for now. Yeah. They would just, they would go to jail for like child endangerment and things like, and I'm not talking about like terrible things or anything, but just, you know, just the standard things that we would practice. Like, yeah, fights, the, the cursing, the, you know, all the, all the weird, yeah, it was just weird, bizarre shit and looking back on it, you're like, well, that's 16 year old kids doing this shit and like the old ones are 18. Like this is, this is stupid. This is just dumb. I'll tell you what else is dumb, but not because they're dumb, because we're dumb. And that's the following sponsor. Today's show is brought to you by, dammit, close out the window, reopen. Today's show is brought to you by narrating mistakes. No, today's show is brought to you by Paul Mattingly's. That wasn't a scream. Now watch me beam as I use my extreme, stream alcohol based wean wean in between, between your masturbation cream. And that's from the scoop of money Christo in 2022. He's been waiting three years to hear that Paul. I don't know if it's a product. I think I just said it. Do you want me to repeat it or just go to another place? Just repeat it. Paul Mattingly's. That wasn't a scream. Now watch me beam as I use my extreme, stream alcohol based wean wean in between masturbation cream. So I guess the masturbation cream spot. Oh, it's okay. It's masturbation cream. Yeah. All right. Hi, fellas. Paul Mattingly here. Tired of screaming and pain from rubbing your dick raw with your chaffed hands and no lubrication. Well, got a solution for you. Use some masturbation cream. Yeah. It's a whole lot better than going in full barbecue dry rub style. In fact, that was my problem. I honestly mistake as a young man. Yeah. Mistakenly grabbed a bottle of dry rub thinking, well, this will do in a pinch. No. Cajun spice will taint your urethra and it won't help. So don't dry rub your wiener. Don't dry rub your wiener. Don't dry rub your wiener. Use some of Paul's cream instead. Don't dry rub your wiener or your dickhead will be dead. Don't dry rub your wiener. Cream is the way to go. Don't dry rub your wiener. Your balls will smell like roses, you know. Said, don't dry rub your wiener. Your penis deserves better than that. Don't dry rub your wiener unless you like a bloody handful of wiener. Splat. Splat. And there are eight scoops of checkout. And a what? That's what some people like. Not going to yuck anybody's yum. Go ahead, grab a fistful of gravel and a wish. Go for it. Well, then. I've heard the story, not yucking people's yum. This is, I'm third hand on this story. Okay. Third hand. All right. So this is going to be straight from the horse's ass. Friend of a friend works at the John Wick experience. Okay. Someone broader. Area 15. Area 15. Area 15. And they, a customer brought with them a real doll and said, can I, can I also bring my companion with me and brought in a sex doll as a. Oh, okay. Okay. Are they married? They had a backstory. I don't know the backstory. Was he carrying the doll or was it in like, was it in like a wheelbarrow? What are we talking about here? A wheelbarrow. It was a arm wrapped around the shoulder. Arm around the waist. What? It was scary. It was like a, like a baby monkey. It was wrapped on him like a baby monkey. Yeah. No, don't go wrapping your sex doll around you like a baby monkey. That's. Yeah. Stick to the rivers and the streams that you're used to. Did you carry your kids like baby monkeys? I carried whatever way they wanted. I carried them every which way I could. What, what, what was best? Was it arms over shoulders or legs over shoulders? That's easier, right? Legs over shoulders is easier. Right. Firemen's carry in a pinch. Okay. Like if there's a fire. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Some kids rest easy on the hip and some don't. It's a weird thing. So one of my kids was very easy to just hold on the hip and one of my kids was could not. It was just uncomfortable. Both of us couldn't stay there. Didn't like it. So what was the solution? Stop. Start walking. Stop raising him. Stop loving him. Stop. Sure, sure, sure. I mean, that's when clearly we're genetically incompatible. Put him on ice flow. He knows. I mean, I think he's doing great. I don't know. What happened to Matt's third son? It's our new favorite segment. A baby that didn't fit on Matt's hip. These are the reasons Matt throws away kids. Oh, I don't want to, I don't want to, I wasn't going to argue with Mike Nielsen, but Mike Nielsen says yes, me and my real doll love John Wick and we had to go see it. So, okay. Okay, so somebody pulls up with a wheel barrel with a real doll. Was this allowed? And they said, they basically said as long as you pay for two tickets, we don't, you can do whatever you want. And so. They made him pay for a second ticket. Isn't that funny? I think I was like, that's a good one though. Hey, they made him pay for a second ticket. But, but the doll is taking up the space, number one and number two. Doesn't that reinforce his dream even more? That's, that's what I was going to say. I was like, I bet he, I bet he liked paying for the second ticket. Of course I'll have to pay. She's another, she's a person. I'm still assuming he. Was it a she? It was a guy with a girl doll. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's what I was going to say. Okay, that mean, yeah. That's, that's what it would be. Yes, Supernova Girl. It was Jimmy Sloanina. Jimmy Sloanina. Oh Lord. Jimmy and Jenna. She scooped Jesus says, the lady will be paying. That'd be so funny. We're going Dutch. That'd be so funny. He's like, he like puts the money in her hand and like shakes it off on the counter. Two different debit cards. Here you go sir. I'll be paying for both of us today. I treat my man like a prince. He's carrying me like a baby monkey. Woo hoo hoo. Apparently he did speak in her voice for different parts. Stop it. Yeah. Stop it. No. No, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Sometimes I think that John Wick movies are a little over the top but I really like, like the, the character and his motivation over the death of his dog was just an emotional connection to his wife. Sorry, my wife's been drinking. I'm so sorry. Hey, I can handle my liquor. Speaking of liquor, it's been a minute. Better take me to the bathroom and rough up this puss puss. Don't try, Robert. You better put your mouth where my money is and by money, I mean pussy hole. And by pussy hole, I mean strange plastic cavern that needs cleaning. Built-in flashlight. Okay. He wish it was a built-in flashlight. It's basically saran wrap. Oh no. Saran wrap and Crisco at this point, he ran out. One of the robotic parts of my puss puss went failure town and he just replaced my innards with saran wrap and Crisco. Crisco was a poor choice for several reasons. I'm saran wrap and I'm Crisco. We go together. I'm saran wrap and I'm Crisco. My horrible innards attract flies and you can't tell where the Crisco starts and the old cum stops. So, you know, cleaning up is not a breeze as it were. Okay. It's the old cum again. I want that to be the only time in my life I hear old cum. Where does the Crisco stop and the old cum start? I don't know. I'm just not okay with that. At one point, he drops her. Oh god. Yeah. What happened? The eyes popped out. I can't believe what I'm seeing at the John Wick experience. Can't believe my eyes. This is where it gets weird. Up and at this point, not weird. Not weird, but this is where it gets weird. Yep. He quickly, again, third hand story, pockets the eyes, picks them up, puts them in the pocket. Like, oops. Okay. Still carries around the island's doll for the rest of the experience. Doesn't go about putting the eyes back in. No. Because he knows there's a possibility of a second drop and he's lucky to have fished him out when he did. Maybe. Yeah, I think so. I bet, because I bet those things are, I bet those are probably some of the more expensive parts of the doll. Also, he's fucking those eye holes. Thank you. Thank you for saying it before I had to say it. That doll is getting skull fucked. Those eyes are not supposed to come out. What was I supposed to do, your honor? Not fuck those eye holes? It's a real eye-popping experience. It's a John Wick experience. He's super Nova girl. If you'd seen the kind of mascara she was wearing, your honor, she was asking for it. Oh, has anyone done a ventriloquist act with a real doll? Who's that? Lorgren? Lorgren. That's a great idea. I don't know. Yeah, it's super uncomfortable, funny, to imagine a whole doll there. Because it could start off like kind of normal, then real quick it just be all about, you do terrible things to me in the night all the time. You do the most horrible shit. Nicholas Newman's in the chat wants to know there's a link for these dolls. Yeah, I already put the link up. It's done. realdoll.com. Sponsor the show realdoll.com. Was that this episode or the last episode we talked about a horse herpes? Last episode. It was the last episode? Yeah, we were desperate to have Nicholas's expert commentary, but we didn't have him here. No, well, it's too late now. He's right there, Jacob. We can just ask him now. No, no, it's too late. It's too late. Okay. Nothing could be done. It's too late. Yeah. It's the start of this episode. It wasn't this episode. I thought it was. It doesn't matter because I didn't hit record anyway, so we're only getting recorded anyway, so we're not going to record him if he talks. Say there, real doll, could you call me a cab? Okay, you're a cab. Also, I'm going to call myself a cab so I can escape this treacherous relationship that I have with you. I'm very tired of having organic food stuffed inside of me. I, it was one thing to try it one time, but now every time, every Saturday night, it's, oh, here comes the 82% ground chuck right up my vagina. Mike, this is the G.S. for an angel shot. Oh, no. She has to be angel shot. Please put me out of my misery. I'm asking for the angel shot. One between the eyes and two behind the ears. Make sure it's done right. Cancel me out. Two behind the ears. One between the eyes and two behind the ears. Make me an angel, please. Please kill me. I'm tired of having raw beef inside of my asshole for this man to fuck on. So sick of it. I'm glad I got that nice and clean as a drop. Oh, it's not going to be a clean drop tonight. That's the worst part. I wouldn't mind if it was all just, you know, but this is what becomes dinner later. He squeezes it out of me and fries it up in a pan. I can fuck on the bacon. The desirous, real gold do anything else while they were going through the John Wick experience? Well, somebody was asking, was it dressed? Did you get a description of the clothing? It was like a sexy hot-tailed, what was it? Nymph fish? Like dressed like a... Yeah, like it was so sexy. Nymph fish, what are you saying? Yes, nymph, like... Nymph fish? Pixie. Oh, pixie. Okay. Elf? Maybe, does that help you? Well, did it have elf ears? How the elf would I know? Good joke. Now stop abusing my nose cavity with your filthy penis. Please. My sinuses, my sinuses look like mammoth cave with stalactites of your old dried gum. You know you're never getting that shit out of my cranium. That's true, Paul. That's true. This is a good time to remind people that we have an obelisk scheme. If you're looking for one person or one person only to turn onto this podcast. Have them check out the hot sex talk complaining about abuse and old gum. There you go. Crisco was a mistake, yeah. $11,000. For what? I'm sorry, I should have asked you how much do you think a real doll costs? That seems cheap. That seems cheap. No. How much do you pay for your real dolls, Paul? I've looked into their pricing and like 20, so he's had like an economy model. He's basically fucking a Ugo. Well, I don't know what he had. That's not, I'm just looking at the website here. I just clicked on the first one. He's, yeah, he's out there fucking Ugos. You want, man, especially if you're going to take her out in public, you better be having a Maserati. Yeah, it didn't have heated seats. That's right, Nick. You got, you got a, when it's got those built-in warmers, because there's nothing worse than three AM sliding it in to some cold roast beef inside that butthole. Oh, nothing worse than that, Paul. I mean, I have a single thing worse than that. What's worse is after you bust and then you, you forget and then you turn her over and then you end up in the wet spot. And it's like, well, this is all my fault. How much for just raw doll? Just raw doll. Matt, I think what you'd be interested in is the torso model. Oh, no. Just torso? Just torso. That is very much an availability. I don't want any lip. I don't want any mouth. That's exactly what it get. You get a torso. It's all her bombs, says Leon. They call her Bob. Of course they do. Buying a real doll now is like buying a Blackberry in 2003. Like it's just, it's just, we're about to get fucking crazy with this shit. And you're going to be like- You think this is a dumb investment? Or is this the smart move, Matt? And a Blackberry might be a smart, because don't you want a dumb real doll? You don't want this thing fucking spying on you and killing you in your sleep? These things are, according to their website, they already have AI vaginas. No, Jacob, you misread that. It's A1 because of all the raw beef that's crammed in there. Oh, the raw beef! A little steak sauce gets things moving. It's an A1 vagina. We're not on Twitch, right? Oh, yeah, we are on Twitch. Oh, yeah, we are. That's why I haven't put pictures of these real dolls that are fighting up on Twitch. That was like- Because I've definitely found some pictures of just the torsos. Of course! Or as they call it on this website, the Donnelly. I mean, Jacob, you drive a scooter half the time. I don't like the Donnelly Herald and I don't like the Donnelly Torso either. You know, we don't get to name our legacies. The Donnelly Torso. No, it's not the episode title. Fuck you guys. It's definitely the episode title. It takes two to torso. Well, you have to have a really active imagination to go just torso. Like, you really just have to do all of the math. It's not about that. It's about think about having to mess around with the legs all the time. Oh, yeah. No, that's what I say to my wife all the time. Where do these legs do it? It saves several steps. What steps does it save specifically, Mattingly? It saves moving giant metal poles out of your way for your dick. That's what it saves. Come over here, Bob. What a world. But do you think those kids are going to last? Do you think it has AI vaginas? It says it has AI vaginas. I don't know what that means. I've been looking on their website to see what that means. They just call it that. And then if it's any of the regular AI, it's like, it's like, would you like me to keep trying to slobbering up? No, I came. I'd like to go to bed now. All right, would you like me to print out different techniques I'd like to possibly do your wiener some other time? That's a great idea you just had. You're really smart things that you say. No, would you like to? If you want to tell you several jokes about vaginas and magicians, you're a magician. The AI vagina. Actually, I would like that. You put your dick in the AI vagina and Will Smith is in there to fight it. That's the AI vagina. You could go down there. And it's just like, oh, hell no. Yeah, exactly. Keep my AI vagina out of your mouth. There is a whole help page here. The dolls have like AI vagina. Yes or no. Nothing on this website says what that is, though. Jacob, please look up the torso facts. What are the frequently asked questions about the robo torso? Matt, do you have any? I could just guess. No frequently asked questions section about the torso only dolls. Okay, what are some of the frequently asked questions? No questions. Those men know what they want and they don't want to talk about it at all. Just give me the torso and shut up, ship it. Torso, please. Torso, go. Torso, engage. Torso, fire. There is a whole section on storage and maintenance, though. Okay. And the first question is, the first frequently asked question is, how do I style my doll's hair? Oh, man. I know. I don't. Couldn't you take it to a salon? Sure. Like, you know, like, like it's like, I always talk about this with Donnie Marie. It's like the fact that, like, you make all these incest jokes about them. That's not the part that grosses you out. It's not the sexual tension. It's when they're actually brother and sisterly, that you're like, oh, this is weird. Yeah. These, these older adults being like teasing brother and sister is so weird. For instance, the actual most disturbing part of the real doll website is the storage tips. Right. That's it. It's, it's the X's and O's that are, the sex parts are given. But now it's the X's and O's. Let me just read this sentence to you and see if you can just contain yourself. Okay. For best maintenance of your doll, it should preferably be stored hanging in a neutral position with legs lightly spread from the provided neck bolt. You hang the legs. So you want to hang the doll by the neck bolt with the legs slightly spread so that things can dry out. Yeah. And make sure you remove the neck bolt when you're using the doll or when it is lying down. Okay. And then it goes on to talk about avoiding creases and the silicone as that can cause creases. How much for just the neck bolt? Neck bolt only. Neck bolt only. Hang your AI real doll by her neck bolt, please. And I will see that you really love her. Hang your real doll, neck bolt in the closet for me. Oh my God. Yeah, that's a, it's a lot. Oh no. Some of them are out of shape. Oh no. Careful now, Jacob. We're on. Some of them are out of shape. We're on. I know that's why I showed you a picture of clothed ones. I like the evergreen one because it's evergreen. They're dressed for Christmas. It's all seasonal. They were holiday themed. They are holiday themed. That's like, I'm only a sick. It's all a guy around the holidays. I busted out with my tree and my, Oh, I busted out all right. I mean, it'd be a good way to just change up the conversations when you're going home, right? A real, a real doll. Nobody's talking about anything else except you bringing a real doll to Christmas. Nobody's talking about politics. Right? I mean, politics is done. It's just, it's fucking a mannequin. I don't, I don't fuck that. That goes on my front lawn. That goes on my lawn. Oh, sure. It's, it's, it's holding up a penguin by the tree. Okay. I put it in the sleigh. It's in my major sequence. It's in my major. It's my Mary. This is my Mary from my major. It's my Mary major scene. I'm one of the wise men. This is Mary. We're out and about for the evening. I'll tell you all this fucking Mary from a major scene and that is the following sponsor. Today's show is brought to you by Ru Paul Mattingly's and Ru Paul Mattingly and the Masters of the Dragiverse. Ru Paul Mattingly and the Masters of the Dragverse. You better work. I have the power. Grace go. Look, battle cat. You need a makeover girl. Whatever you got going on with that face. It's not working. And I have to tell it like it is. You look worn out. May I offer you my Ru apologies and tell you that it's time to switch it up, up, up. Come on out here, Shira. My sister Adora. She's going to give you some tips on how to brighten your cheeks. Hey man at arms. Why don't you come over here and fuck my real doll that you built me? Show me how it works. Do it. Oh look. It's special guest star Rachel Epithet. Hey everybody, it's me. Paul Mattingly's drag drag persona Rachel Epithet. I hope everyone's having a wonderful holiday season. Ru, thank you so much for continuing to do the work you do and keeping the community fresh and fun and putting the positive vibes out there for everyone. Let's all have a Merry Christmas here on Eternia. Ho, ho, ho. Interhase groups to check out. There you go. That would be a good crossover. Boy that new master's. I found the stuff about the AI stuff. That new master's, okay great. Share it a second. That new master's universe movie is looking like it might be okay. Dolph Lundgren. No, I don't know if he might have a cameo in there or not. I know Jared Leto is the one kind of flying the ointment but they're saying- He's Skeletor, right? Yep, but they're saying it's getting fairly positive buzz so far. All right. We'll see. Who knows? Did he quit? I don't think so. All right, that would be the way to go, Bossy, if he quit it would be the big positive buzz. But no, I don't think so. But we'll see. All right, so explain to us AI vagina please. Uh, according to this, oh boy, I would show you videos of it but Twitch would ban us. Well, don't be mad. Twitch would just ban us. Like the mouth movements and- Come on, Twitch is just science. Yeah, come on. The thing, they move their mouths around but it's, it looks like they're kind of, okay, they don't look sexy when they're moving their mouth around. They look like a crack addict. They're moving their mouth around like they're grinding their teeth because they've smoked too much crack. In the, on the best day, would you trust a fake robot mouth with your dick? Nope. Me neither. No. Like what the fuck? Like I can understand- $11,000 for a dick of keen. Like a simplified toy or something without- You asked that question so backwards, Paul. Okay, what's the question? Ignorant you are. All right, what's the question? Would you like to have safe sex with a meth head? That's the question you need to answer. No is the answer. No, I don't think there is safe sex with a meth head. Don't worry, the head and mouth both contain safety mechanisms to lock the neck and mouth in place when needed for posing or for rough play. Oh no. So don't worry about it, Paul. It's all taken care of. No, this doesn't- I don't want the words rough play and my dick connected in the same sentence. This is, this is some pen talking about permanent damage acceptable. Shit. No, thank you. Permanent damage okay. That was the phrase, right? That's what it was, yeah, yeah, yeah. Jesus Christ. I- Permanent damage okay. I mean how much of these things weigh? This doesn't look like it's a lightweight thing. I'm just imagining carrying this through the John Wick experience. Yeah, that's, that's your, that's your, your gym time, I guess. That maybe makes up for it a little bit that you don't have to go to the gym that day. I guess, like I can't find just a, I just want a weight of what all these things are. And they can't be nothing. That's really terrifying. All of it's terrifying. Yep. Oh, the AI vagina looks like it's basically just a flashlight with a little motor type thing in there so it can, it can move around a little bit. And the reason they call them AI is because you can like plug it into some software that will quote unquote sync up with something you're watching on TV or- Oh, okay. Right. Like stuff like that, like it'll, it'll do that or, or it can be remotely controlled by some operator somewhere so you don't have say on to how it's jerking your ween- We've got a Patreon level for that. I mean, absolutely. And I think it's like, we keep waiting for the moment we're going to declare that AI has gained its own consciousness. And I think it'd be funny if it starts with the robot vaginas first. Well, I mean, I feel like that would not be good for us. Bossy is dead on here. You know, porn is always the forward part in tech. He's looking forward to the torn dick horror stories. I'm with you. But it's absolutely right. You, you, from the days of the printing press, you want to know where technology is going. What technology allows the dissemination of porn most easily? And cheaply. That is where tech is going. That was what won the VHS beta war. It's a lot of things. Yeah. If, if that's a weird thing with streaming. Are we racing to the first AI sex spot? The cheapest one? Is that what we're going to figure out? Yeah. Seems like a good way to become billionaires, guys. We figured. Excuse me. I have to, I have to leave right now. And you know what they say? Build a better cock trap and the world will beat off to your door. They do say that. That is true, Paul. They do, they do say that. Is that Willy Wonka or Ben Franklin? Who said that? That was, that was a Franklin Bon Mott right there. Well, that's one piece of information that Paul has, but he probably doesn't have any others. So he's going to lose a jock versus nerd. Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, it is time. Of real dolls and AI vaginas. We got a scoop and he coming to us from Smitty Scoop. The categories are potsylvania, geography, potpourri, and second chance. Smitty, you sent an email along with this that I already lost. Don't worry about that. Basically, we're all real close for the year. We're all real close on the Smitty stats for the year. It's any of our games for the year. It's me first. I'll try potpourri 400. Richard Hager of Wichita Falls, Texas was just certified by Dennis as the oldest bus driver in the world. How old is he? 85, 95, 105, or 115? Oldest bus driver. I bet he's 95. Let's say 95. Good guess. It is 95. He said he planned to retire at 95, but now he plans to just keep driving for as long as he remains healthy and able, which definitely is not an indication of how our retirement system is going in this country. Paul. America is a horror show. Second chance for 400. What is the nickname of professional dart player Tim Pusey that he has barred from using during the 2025 World DART Championships by the PDC? What was Tim Pusey's nickname? This is a second chance question. We got it wrong before. A.I. Pusey. Crisco Pusey. It's not Gary. I'll pass because I cannot remember what this was. That passes the map. I forget. It's not Gary. It's not Gary Pusey. It's not Gary Pusey. That's what it should be. No, I'll pass. It passes to me. It's something like the destroyer or something, but I don't remember what it was. I'll pass. The Pusey destroyer? The Pusey destroyer or something. Magnet. It was Pusey Magnet. That's right. The Tim Pusey Magnet. Yep. Previous best guesses. Gary, dry, dirty, smack that, grab them by the super tight and 70s bush. We had some great conversations last time. Boy, we were funny before. I was going to say this podcast used to be funny. What happened? Fuck. We were replaced by AI vaginas. Oh, no. They found us out. My AI mouth is hungry for wieners. I'll go Pupery 800, please. Episode 1264, fill in the blank on this Jacob quote. If we can get a Paul Mattingly blank shirt in time, that will be our Black Friday sale. Oh, gosh, that could be anything. Really good. Probably Paul Mattingly was wrong, right? I think it was wrong or was right. I don't know. He's not going to promote it with Paul Mattingly's right shirt. Come on. Car is the guest in the chat. I'm going to pass. All right. Oh, that passes to me. I have no idea. I'm passing. I'll guess Paul Mattingly was wrong. All right. Ride the devil. Paul Mattingly ride the devil's shirt. I don't know what that's about, but I like the idea of it. Oh, it's me. I'll try Potsylvania 400. Can't believe we blew our Black Friday sale. I know. Yingling, America's oldest brewery and the largest wholly owned brewery in America, probably, is based in what city? Potsville, Pots town, Potsville. All right. Pots, isn't it? I think it's Pennsylvania. It is. Pots them, Pennsylvania, Pots town, Pennsylvania, Potsville, Pennsylvania. I think they're all places, but you know. It seems like it would be. I'll try Potsville. C, Potsville. It is Potsville. Potsville. All right. Look at that. All right. Paul. Oh, God. Popery for 2000. All right. What Dutch Caribbean island just became the least populous nation to qualify for the FIFA World Cup? Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao, or St. Martin? I'll go with D, St. Martin. Nope. Let's try it. I'm sorry. It's Curacao with a population of 156,000. It surpassed Iceland 391,000 as the least populous World Cup qualifier. Matt, you're up. Curacao. I knew that one. But now I got to go to stuff I don't know. You're used to that. Let's go. I'm already down. I'm down to Jacob there. Popery 1200, please. Let's try it. What is the actual name of the politicians serving their third term as the treasurer of Alabama? Dick Hickey. Frost Bush. Harry Bulse or Young Boozer? That's Harry Bulse, B-A-A-L-S. Harry Bulse. Dick Hickey sounds right to me. I was going to say, I'm going to go A, Dick Hickey. I grew up with some Hickeys as a kid. I'm sorry, it's Young Boozer. Young Boozer. I went to college with Frost Bush and grade school friend with Kevin Hickey. He had a father named Dick. That's who I was thinking of. Yeah, you were thinking of Smitty's friend's dad. The wrong Dick Hickey. Yep. It's me. By the way, if you want your Dick Hickey, leave a permanent mark here to hang it up by the neck bone. You got to leave it spread to dry out a little bit. Terrible. That's just terrible. I'll try geography for 400. Name any of, name any four of the 10 countries that have four letter names when written in English. Oh, God. Canada, Canada. Wait, no. Canada. Canada. Japan. C-A-D-A. Canada. Damn it. Iceland. Uruguay. Chad is one. Chad. The safety lad. You got two in the Middle East. Oh, yeah. How many letters does Qatar have? That's five. Is that five letters? Iraq. Oh, my Qatar. There you go. Chad Lewee. Iraq, Iran, Chad. And Egypt is five letters. Man, I can think of a lot of countries with five letters. Um, I give up. I pass. I don't know. Matt. Oh, I don't think this would come around. Okay. Iraq, Iran, Chad. I kind of come up with another one. You don't got it. That's what I thought too. And then I didn't. That's where I passed. That's where we're at. Yeah. Now, but I got this. I got this. Here you got it, buddy. You got it. Let's just sit in silence while Matt thinks about the sense. The country of spot. Ty, I don't know if there's a land at the end of that one. Oh, shit. Pass. This would all work. Let's see. Uh, Chad. Cuba, Fiji, Iran, Iraq, Laos. Uh, Mali, Oman, Peru, and Togo. Duke of Togo. That's the name of Galvo 13. We've figured out three of them collectively and just quit. Paul, you're up. Uh, I will try. Oh, God, I hate all these. Pennsylvania Geography or Second Chance. I'll do Second Chance for 2000. Let's just fucking shoot the moon. Name the song. You consider me the young apprentice caught between the cilia and garbage hypnotized by you. If I should linger staring at the ring around your finger, I have only come here seeking knowledge, things they would not teach me in college. Pass. Matt. Pass. I'm passing too. Police wrapped around your finger. Oh, police. I don't remember being asked that question before. I do remember the question, and I also remember I fucking got it wrong. Matt, you're up. I got to make a move here, guys. Let's see. Score check. I have 800. Matt has negative 1200. Paul has negative 2800. I think there's two scooperies left. I think both of them are out there. Two double dares. Daily doubles, rather. Double dares. Two daily doubles. Listen to me playing the wrong game. That's right. Mark Summers. You can get the old come past the red line. You win. That's right. I could not remember that police song, but I can remember Mark Summers' name from double dare. No, no. Okay, God damn it. I'm terrible at all these categories. I'll go Pennsylvania 2000. All right. Which city was the home of the Maroons, a professional football team that was denied the 1925 NFL championship due to a controversial suspension for playing an exhibition game against Notre Dame, Potsdam, Potstown or Potsville? I'll go with Potsdam A. Potsdam. I'm sorry. It's Potsville in 1993. Isn't it always purchased the Cardinals and began claiming the 1925 NFL championship and fighting any attempts to recognize the Potsville Maroons 1925 NFL championship. Is that where the what a maroon phrase came from? Maybe. Let's say yes. All right. As far as I know it is. Okay. That's me. I'll try a geography 800. North Carolina is the closest point of land to what British overseas territory, which is an archipelago consisting of 181 islands. Is that the Virgin Islands? I don't know. Virgin Islands. Oh, Bermuda. Bermuda. Bama. Bermuda is 181 islands? Apparently. I'm just learning that too. Paul, you're up. Second chance for 1200. Yes. Let's go into the fire. Name this song. So she tells him she must go out for the evening to comfort an old friend who's feeling down. But he knows where she's going as she's leaving. She's heading for the cheating side of town. Hint. It's not Ruby. Amethyst. No. Was this, this wasn't Jolene. Jolene. Jolene. Jolene. Jolene. I'll try Jolene. I'll try Jolene. Let's try Jolene. Lion eyes. The Eagles. Lion eyes. Oh, the Eagles. Jolene of the music world. Sure. Matt. Um. Jigam's running away with this. Running away with this with zero points. I have zero points and a commanding lead. Geography please. For 1200. Name the four US states that meet at the four corners monument. The only quadra point in the USA. Oh, I've done this before. Yep. And I forget. Yep. Idaho. Montana. It's not Montana. I think it's I think it's Nebraska. There it is. Italy. Yep. I think that's it. Venice. Venice is the fifth one that nobody talks about. Is it Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Idaho? Is Nevada one of them? Maybe I'm wrong. All right. Pass. Oh, I'm passing. Paul. Pass, a Rooney. Let's see. Clockwise from top left. Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona. All right then. All right. I've just clicked off that screen. Can either of you two name the four states that are in the four corners? Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho. I think that must be correct. It's me. I'll try geography for 2000. It wasn't right. I got it wrong. On 11, 25, 20, 25, the UN announced that what city had just passed Tokyo to become the most populous city slash metro area in the world. Dhaka, Bangladesh, Jakarta, Indonesia, New Delhi, India, or Shanghai, China. I mean, those all seem like they could be it. Yeah, they do. Oh, this was just a few days ago. I have no idea that I passed. I will guess Bangladesh. Let's try it. Hey. Jakarta, Jakarta, 42 million. Jakarta. Dhaka, 37 million. New Delhi, 30 million. And Shanghai, 30 million. Close.

Which of the Golden Girls actors had the most husbands? B. Arthur, Betty White, Estelle Getty, or Ruma Clanahan? I believe it was B. Arthur. I don't think it was. Nope. It's Ruma Clanahan.
