Why does the black flat cap feel more pretentious than the other caps? It looks good Feels like I would say it is no more or less pretentious than your other cap. Thank you. It definitely looks very peaky blinders Yeah, that's what I mean. You look like you look like you're you're a bit of a patty enforcer You are a patty enforcer Matt. Hello. This is my favorite part of this show. It's my drag day This is the part of this show where we thank you the ice cream truck drivers. Thank you ice cream truck drivers I don't have a new list for the month yet We want to thank each and every ice cream truck driver And we will we will thank each and every one of you by name before this month is over If you want to be an ice cream truck driver, maybe you just want to be a patty driver I don't know head on over to preaching fun calm preaching fun commas We're gonna sign up to be an ice cream truck driver and who knows the life you save Maybe your own it's time for a program. Hey Johnny. Do you want to go to an ice cream social? Yeah, I'd love to great. Let's go So Jacob the fancy microphone you brought me when I travel Got me pulled out of TSA because they thought the adapter on the mic was a bullet What? Where the fuck were you? It's time for Matt Maddly's ice cream social sitting in prison. That's Matt Donnelly sitting in Pittsburgh. That's Paul Maddly I'm Jacob in Vegas We're preaching fun fun. So I I know exactly what you're talking about that big Nobby thing. I have one too Yes, so it's the Shore the shore little microphone connector Adapted to an XLR connection is what you're referring to and it gives power right? It gives power to the microphone Yeah, the the your recorder is sending phantom power to it as well, which is I think Forty something volts. I don't remember what it is. So I you know pack my heaviest stuff and put it on my carry-on To get weight out of my case for when I travel with my magic stuff Ah So one of the items is shackles. They're actual iron shackles and then my jar of rings My thing of rope and so it got it got pulled out at the Fort Lauderdale Airport and I You know I'm thinking it's gonna be about the shackles which only one time someone was like you can't you can't travel with these and I Was like, oh I sure can and for some reason that worked and then they let me go Yeah, I was like no I travel with them all the time and And all of a sudden he goes. Oh, it's this right here and he pulls up the microphone I go what he goes this is this adapter and the x-ray looks like it looks like a high caliber of bullets That's it my high caliber bullets is this guy bit x-ray my singular shot my my one One high caliber bullet I'm taking with me to assassinate the pilot from the back of the plane with my sniper rifle back and to the left Matt the man with the golden gun Donnelly exactly Don't mind me carry just just carries one bullet. Just the jackal making my way through the Florida Airport I'm actually shooting my target is at the Miami Airport. I'm that good. I'm shooting high wind From one airport to another it's one of those shots where you have to check the wind first. Yeah. Yeah, it's a whole big thing It's like one giant bullet will be traveling into a private jet taking out from Miami Airport Don't be traveling via private jet Yes, and it's not shot out of a gun because I didn't pack that so it's I just I just wheel my shackles like A slingshot and they put the bullet in there and I sling it like David and then boom Then as long as you do it in the plane Then the bullet is traveling at the speed of the plane in addition to the speed that the earth is already rotating You're able all the velocity. I need just comes from the flight itself. I just drop the bullet out the window It's like throwing pennies off the Empire State Building That's why I always request the seat with the rolled-out window that The product the proposition that you're creating the the the Strategic crazy scenario you're creating could actually be the plot of an episode of Golgo 13 13 Golgo 13. He's an incredible assassin and it one of my favorite anime acid ass acid anime and manga of all time and go go 13 does constantly those kinds of Impossible assassinations that he's just a gun for hire. He's like this cold Merciless killer you pay him enough money He will do whatever needs to be done and then the investigators are always this close to figuring out But then they're like no fucking way could anybody do this Line a lot of other things should use that same plot line and then they go back then they go back and they go Oh fuck. He did do that They show you how he fucking did it and it's like what holy shit. Yeah, go go 13 is Unstoppable Bossy says I'm actually just throwing it like a dart from the back of the plane to hit the pilot just yeah The physics physics checks out nobody check it but the physics checks All you do is hold it in your hand on the numbers Hold it in your hand while you're landing and then just let go and let let gravity do the work That's right. Like I like my idea is when teenagers jump up and down inside of an elevator. Uh-huh Yeah, same same thing. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah All right, are any of you watching land man No, man. I love land man. Okay, we we haven't started the new season yet, but we burned through the first season I hung back until there's four episodes and now I'm four episodes caught up with a new season is this who is this? Who's the land is Billy Bob Thornton Thornton? Demi Moore is in it. Oh, he's fantastic Yeah, the whole cast is really killer. Okay Myron Chach is not willing to pay for Paramount respect respect on that There's just there are websites you can go to time to sail the seas Now you just gonna start now go the full other direction Myron steal steal the show That's it So Landman for those who don't watch the show. It's the most popular show on Paramount plus and Billy Bob Thornton plays a grizzled foul-mouth Smoking land man where he is there meaning what? So land man are people who own oil fields small smaller oil operators, right? Ah working for the big guns, but they're just trying to get by Which is definitely something that Matt and I knew before watching land man. Sure Well, this is it Taylor Sheridan for whether you want to what do you want to go with cause or symptom? He is simply basically between Yellowstone and mayor of Kingstown, you know in 1923 and he shows like he basically takes pockets of where white dudes might feel obsolete and Gives them monologues and speeches that that kind of build up, you know, these these broken ways of life, right and Here's the thing. I Actually like at first like used to I feel conflicted about this right here Because this is you know, the way of the way of this country is going right now It seems like that's that's a big force behind a big imaginary force behind a lot of a lot of actions being taken Yeah I'm doing a show on the on the cruise ship and I get this guy up on stage and he is Basically me like 1.5 me in size like exact body type just six foot five and just a little wider and thick arms or whatever and I say You know, hi, you know, what do you do for a living? You know, do you work that kind of stuff and he goes I work in the oil and gas distribution from Texas Yes Yes, and I say because basis like my dad growing up hated law shows So he hated the way the law was portrayed On television and it made people stupid questions all the time So I wonder if that's better or worse now or if it's just the same For like new legal dramas because I feel like the new legal dramas try to stay more true to the law They don't ones do but like they're still ridiculous legally Yeah, my dad was just laughs like how quickly they can like get like lab results and stuff like that Like he's just like they get lab results like the next day or the same way on in the chat is saying they are Not much better Jacob Okay. Yeah, right Leon is our barrister. He is Their Leon he's our law man We need a law man, so I say Do you love or hate the show land man? Good and he like literally turns to me Like like doesn't doesn't like he's like we're not having a conversation. He just turns to me and he goes. Oh That is the most accurate portrayal of the oil and gas I have ever seen on TV or movies and he almost has tears in his eyes Wow You know now there is fascinating shit in the show There is shit that you do not you never thought about the oil and gas industry sure there is like really they really do do a good job of like Villages where the where the workers like live like the house villages, you know things like that It's it's really fascinating. It's neat stuff. There's one was like there's an there's an oil Area left all alone and therefore there's like a toxicity thing that can happen So they come across dead bodies and then also they go what's going on on the alarms go off on their uniforms and they go running So they don't die and you're like, oh right. I had no idea no idea that that kind of scenario There are electronic canaries in the coal mine now. Yeah. Yeah, they've got it Yeah, it's a little like gas meters and by the way the same thing for I think nuclear stuff by the way, Matt I know this wasn't intentional, but you just basically told a Trump rally story Saying there was big guy big guy came up to me and I turned to him I said, do you like land man or not and with tears in his eyes big guy big guy tears in his eyes I love land man. He tells me let me people are saying Paul and with that I'll finish out He said no one's ever asked me about land man before only you know, I'm joking I Didn't take the no one ever knows it's all about me and how I'm unique He looked at me with tears in his eyes and said that is the best question anyone has ever asked me about land man Sensational question such a good question giant man who weep You asked the best questions that's not only my noodler. So it's it is teaching you all kinds of Actual tricks of the trade within the land man community It is like any good show and that is a voyeur. It's a it's a voyeuristic You know the thing where you're getting a pocket of the world. You wouldn't normally get a pocket out of right? It's still filled with its weird weird monologues, you know things like that Season opens with Billy Bob doing a big monologue about breakfast and like the waitresses the most important meal of the day and he just lectures her about who profits from breakfast and blah blah blah blah blah and it's just Taylor shared it just has these monologues that are just atrocious and one-dimensional But you tolerate Billy Bob Thornton or Kevin Costner doing them, right? It's almost like a challenge, you know I can do this. I got this Yeah, I'll I do Watching land man. All I do is talk like Billy Bob Thornton the entire time and it makes SJ really happy. Yeah No, but I was trying I was trying to think about my man on the ship and I was trying to think about like You know, he came up on like my family call like when my brothers is really into what my brothers thinks it's it's a piece of shit show right and it was kind of like right, you know them them's fighting words and I mean I kind of I get both arguments I Everyone's right But you know we talk on this like these these weird times and I and I and I was basically kind of like thinking about Basically is the word obsolete That okay. That is the word like I've been trying to find a way to put my To encapsulate I think attention that's driving all this shitty decisions Like I think like so many things that are shitty about this world or not, you know themselves I think caused by one thing. I think their dominoes were pushed, right? Whether we're talking about like Trump ism or you know ice detentions that kind of stuff like all these crazy shit That's happening. Ah, and I think like if I'm trying if it was You know go my walks I was thinking about my friend on the other ship and then my brother's fighting and and I was like I Think that like part of Like AI and technology and basically tech tech has taken all of the money, right and All of the talent and now has seized all of the power right like like tech runs Washington and Tex runs all of media now, right? Yeah And the billion and the billionaires are more richer than us than ever Right, and then I think like basically like we're all afraid of Our ways of life becoming obsolete from one facet or another because of this, right? Okay. Yes I see what you mean now. Yeah, and so like if I feel like shit is on my doorstep and You tell me to help other people because they're doing something. They're experiencing something less fortunate and I feel like no one's talking about what's making my life unfortunate Right, like if I think I'm cool and not obsolete if I feel like I am thriving You tell me to help somebody else. Yeah, I go like cool. No problem But if you come to me and say, you know No one's doing stuff about these poor people over here and you're like wait mom about to lose my whole fucking way of life Yeah, I just got back from the food bank and you're telling me that that this is a problem over here And I don't process that tension properly, right? I don't process that like I think my way of life is going away Right, you know, like even we do on our show. We were do really like oh, we're just three white dudes talking Right. And so like we reduce ourselves to be like wait the world should be more diverse. We're not diverse enough We're getting older. We're done with mainstream things. We're over here in our little pocket, right? like we do to ourselves a little bit, you know, I would say actually Paul's probably the biggest voice that fights against it and Like and then you tell us to help go help something else is a little bit like I'm trying to fucking hold it down here Right, but you don't want to admit that you don't want to admit that I'm trying to hold it down You don't want to admit that you're afraid of losing it all right? you want to have pride and stuff like that and so I feel like this ups and then I think the Lockdown and pandemic just poured accelerant all over this tension And I think like it's really hard to shake that feeling So like I'm thinking that like I think that's a way To fight against what we're doing in a positive way I think you have to identify if someone is feeling like they're being made to feel obsolete And you have to find ways in yourself and other people make them feel like they can thrive And I feel like if you do that, that would be the first way to put a force against what we're doing It's a very deep thought it was on my mind It was all because I was watching land man and we can we can talk about something else I have a very embarrassing story to follow up with this if this goes nowhere, but Now that the ultimate solution For people in a political place where what they're doing is terribly unpopular Their ultimate solution is I'm going to give people money But unfortunately that should always be the thing the government should be helping The citizenry to elevate their standard of living constantly Yeah, we came up we came out of the pandemic with the wrong lessons learned when they did help bolster us and give us what was tantamount to a Basic, you know median basic income right, you know subsidy Yes, which we've got and and you spoke by the way. Here's your money back, right? But we spoke to pride if that's exactly right Jacob And we spoke we spoke to pride right or you talked about that man. Yeah, we need to look at that in a whole Other way we have conditioned a generation to look at any benefit coming from the government as something unnecessary shameful and to be repelled Right, which is crazy because what are you paying them for then if not to work for now? We're all working together our society to they are our Representatives they are our representatives they are to represent our interests and if our interests currently Require that we get some kind of financial Benefits and incentives to move forward in a proper way. Not just certain groups is that's what's happening already Farmers are getting a lot of incentives real soon Yeah again yet again, and it's still not gonna be enough But we don't even have to we don't even have to bag on the farmers No, we can just talk about the things we're already talking about Let's just talk about the people in the oil industry. Oh, we're just being handed money fucking forget about it Exactly people who are being handed money for no reason, but when but when little People look at the same kind of thing we have we have been socially engineered to be like, oh no I don't need anything. I don't need help. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's a handout It's a handout on the small scale on the large scale. It's capitalism, right? Yeah, no, I mean yeah, it's it's it is strange and complicated are it's bizarre and Giant men coming to you with tears in their eyes No, I'll tell you who else has giant men coming on them with tears in their eyes all the time wait I didn't get that part of the story yet That's the following sponsor today's show is brought to you by the fine people providers purveyors and makers of Greek yogurt, that's right. It's just a commercial for Greek yogurt for 2022. That's from the scoop Henley We're talking about Greek yogurt. All right That that it that it that it that it that it it Hey Python You needed some yogurt. Hey, I got you. I got you. What do you need? Come on over. He said a good Greek stuff. Yeah.

That's a Greek Oh When you're here you're a family extra Greek yogurt everybody with it a breadstick yummy Pasta fuzz you like Greek yogurt. Mmm. Yummy. Yummy manja Yeah Yeah, no, I I don't think me it like like basically while I was wrapped up in that beautiful commercial I mean sure oil tree sure the farms sure all of college sure all of medicine Sure, all like like we have been quietly always Training wheels and pushing every industry, right? And so, you know We have never the successful industries, right? And so like we have never Been a purely Capitalistic thing but as soon as we want to point at something and say stop doing that we say like see it's not capitalism It's socialism but raw But the truth is we've buttressed our entire country almost every aspect of our lives With government effort and it's been successful. Like it's what's made America And so it's like we improv Matt improv Improv in all of its forms Vallis Bolan was paid by the federal government Again an initiation of theater games for children during the Great Depression Improvisation is germinated from that government investment an entire my life My life from this woman's brilliance and the government funding that made it possible for her to do That's it. I agree. The only way for improv comedy to be successful is to have government backing The fucking fact I would love to have a little government jingle in my pocket every time I was teaching Holy shit make things real smooth, but just in general that needs to be yeah, we and I mean art is the first thing that gets it in the dick and Yeah, you know, I know it's like so like I mean we're very much out of our depths in terms of talking specifically about For yourself over What we know this is our wheel. Yeah, man. Yeah. Hello But I think part of like we're trying to get people to chill is to be like is is a little bit of a wake-up Like hey, we've been kind of doing this with everything the whole time and it's not just just the lefties It's not just the righties and it's not just what so that what you're saying is the solution to this might be Education. Oh good. Good Then that's assured that we're gonna move forward in a positive direction then because that's gonna be a priority going forward Linda fucking McMahon Is running of all things I can't even watch WWE anymore Not even no, not even like recap shit. Nothing. I haven't watched it for like a year. It's terrible It's like this is your it's the oh, it's real life professional wrestling I know it's done so much damage to the earth I listen to the whole fucking planet. They're gonna have a fucking you have see fight By the same company Go Yeah, you're right. All right. I'm definitely gonna go ice cream socials going to the UFC fight in the front Press pass, of course, although oh did you turn out ever? Did you see the explosive new? Confession I don't know what you'd have you how you actually say it. Are you familiar with the Canadian screw job Yes, the Montreal Montreal screw job, right? Oh this this is the the the Bret Hart thing Michaels, aha Tell me what happened. So Bret Hart was wrestling in his hometown he was gonna retire from the WWE or leave the WWE go somewhere else or whatever and They said you have to turn over your heavyweight belt to the new upcoming star Shawn Michaels And he said not in Montreal not in my home city Like we have to we'll have to do it another at another match Okay, and it's like this is where I'm from and this is where I can take a lot of pride in me being the heavyweight champion you know, we'll do a fight there, but it's got to be a different time and Vince McMahon and Shawn Michaels colluded behind Bret Hart's back and the Bret Hart Is fighting out of some chokehold or something like that and gets basically called out and loses the match and the look on his face When the bell goes off and thing is over this and they're gonna give Shawn Michaels the belt the look at his face is Crazy and it is a famously When the most moment in WWE where they broke quote-unquote kayfabe, right? When it's a very shoot moment. Yeah, meaning it was happening for real. It was happening for real And I think Brett wouldn't like punched Victor convinced McMahon I think like or something like that least spit on him. I think It on him and maybe punched him too. Yeah. Yeah So but it made so much news that they had to break kayfabe to break the the the the fakeness of wrestling because it was Leaking out that this was a crazy thing that happened behind the scenes. Uh-huh. Well Brett Hart has just this past week come out and said you Know Vince McMahon would always come on these specials Whenever they were talking about the Montreal screw job and Vince's famous quote was We didn't screw Brett Brett screwed Brett Right. That was his favorite. Okay well according to Brett Hart It may be more accurate to say Vince screwed Shawn Michaels Wait There is a rumor now Brett Hart has put forth that Michaels and Vince McMahon may wear hat we're flat at that point and that is a big reason why Vince put the belt on him and went through all that rigamarole because that was his current love boy I find it hard to believe that you can sleep your way to the top and WWE under Vince McMahon I know right unless you're willing to take a shit directly to the face. It's not really You're not your career is not really going to of course, this is what happened. This is obviously what happened This man is a depraved animal. So the Montreal mudslide proceeded the Montreal Exactly exactly and that's how Brett that's how Shawn lost his smile because he got shit Yeah Pretty ridiculous Finally something that we know about Leon saying it's the Montreal steamer. That's right That's a good one Leon. Yeah, so that I didn't I didn't look into it too far I just heard enough from what I heard and I was like, okay, but Brett's usually a pretty straight shooter Or he knows this is the most scathing thing you can say about Vince McMahon I May be but why now I guess cuz I don't know I think is he just actually Levitations he wants to kick him in the nuts. Yeah, maybe he just wants to yeah He would have come out I did follow this a little bit and I think it would have come out sooner had this actually Been the case. Oh Really? Don't you think they didn't? Know media if you know anything about the ring boy scandals and all the other bullshit That's been going on and all this stuff that's followed the McMahons around for decades It's only really been having a light shone on it very recently. That's had any kind of Consequence or public discussion about it. All right, that's reached. I hear you. I hear that. I hear that that makes sense Yeah, so I feel like yeah, I feel like there's a great deal more scrutiny I just think we're more attuned to it now and it's one of those things where back in the day You get stuff like that. Well, he's a very he's a very successful man. Of course, he's got haters You know, of course, there's people after him and gonna start rumors and stuff But now with all the things that we do know about him and his and his crew I don't want to think my neck out I don't want to you know stepping at the way these guys are to the they can be very litigious But I don't think he's really that tan. I think that's I think that's fake. I think basic man is a fake Don't sue me up Okay, okay. That was that's Matt at hey scoops.com. That's who said that Tan is real. I think he's just I think he's just in a tanning bed I don't think he uses like oh, yeah, he's gone out of the beach No, so let's fight about that. No, so I Speaking of wrestling I've grown to love John Cena as peacemaker and John Cena as a comedic actor Sure, and I never watched any wrestling with John Cena. Okay So five move Charlie So he sat down to do an interview with Bill Simmons my favorite sports podcaster and talked to him for like over an hour I was like, all right, let's do it. And then it was all about his wrestling career and man You couldn't pay me to ever listen to John Cena talk about his wrestling career ever again The problem with that so I bought the I bought the problem with that Paul one of the problem I bought the WWE game from I'm gonna say three years ago two years ago three three years ago and Let's say three, let's say three, whatever The cop the conceit of this one was Cena, right? But not only Cena it was Cena recapping his biggest losses So that's the story mode that you play through you play through you play through as John Cena Through his biggest losses. Yeah, and the thing and he he entered he is interviewed between each match Talking about what he learned and what the atmosphere was like during this match and special things about the opponent I kind of thing and it just comes off so crazy Because like it's very This isn't real, right? Right. It's not real. Yeah things he's saying aren't really reason Oh boy, I knew coming into that ring was gonna be a real slobber knocker go I knew my competition with Andre the giant was gonna be exactly. It's like well I don't think you ever fought Andre But like an example because I listened to this fucking interview Yeah, like he had to lose very badly to Brock Lesnar so that okay put up against Brock Lesnar would be then considered so Amazingly great that they had to write champion. So in order to put I think it was Roman Reigns The belt he had to get beat beat up by Brock Lesnar very badly. That'd be okay They talked about like trying to like, you know way that now hard that was physically and everything else and you know No, it's not it shouldn't be No one gets hurt, I mean yes, it's painful it's stressful. It's very athletic But you shouldn't be interesting people. It's dangerous shit. It's dangerous Okay, hold on because I want to come back to this we do have to go to a sponsor real quick But I want to come back to this so we're putting a pin in this and we're gonna talk about this right after we get Back from the following sponsor who? Also, I don't know where's a lot of tight spandex shit Today's show is brought to you by tube your Closis your one-stop shop for tubes tube. Erk. Oh to her tuberculosis tuberculosis tuberculosis tuberculosis Jacob go one more time tuberculosis toss it to me Jacob following sponsor today shows brought to you by Tuberculosis your one-stop shop for tubes nailed it bells triple scoop 2025 go fuck yourself Welcome to tuberculosis Your one place to buy tubes. Yeah, I just need a tube What kind of tube do you want? Oh, it'll it'll how about a cathode ray tube for television I Just needed a drainage tube for a for an ice maker and Drainage tube would you like one constructed from? PVC Oh Yeah, that that seems yeah, it seems good very well follow me to the PVC tubile here at Tuberculosis the largest tube store in all of Transylvania Oh, I didn't see the PVC aisle over here. Yeah, this is good. This is I I can find what I need here Thanks for your help very well I leave you to the aisle Continue your shopping on Molested yeah. Yep. Yep.

Oh Ever heard the two worms make music they ever heard them sing in the moonlight No, well, you could get some and do it and the best way to hear them is by listening through a tube It will amplify the worm song You know, I thought you were nuts when I came in here, but you're winning me over and I don't have any nuts just tubes And her age check out That's a good sponsor seems like a good company. Oh, they are great. I don't know how they make any money I think from this just let people buy the tubes. They want but the guy doesn't have any fasteners To say worth shit Loose to this tube don't do fuck for you So I'm thinking about pro wrestling now, oh, oh danger zone is there Is it just impossible for people to pretend that someone is better? Than us or has won a championship or something like that Is it just impossible for us to just pretend that that's happening? Do we do we just fall into the trap of this is real? every time Is that why it matters to the WWF people or WWE people who wears the the fake championship belt? It's so strange because like I guess Cena on this last trip around came close to if not Eclipsed Rick Flair's title runs I Know he has I have seen that yeah, because it's seen it seen as like I don't remember It's been a couple more time 18 or 19 time world champion something like that. Yeah. Yeah Anyway, it's but it just like one or two above Rick Flair But you know What does it mean but having having the belt doesn't it doesn't actually mean you haven't actually won Also, you can't win it 17 times if you don't lose it 16 So what the fuck is that? I think Good point. That's just good. That's also true. That's math. Yeah, that's that's just the math checks out on what Paul just said But I mean like really like you guys there's 16 guys who are clearly better than you They are still beholden to the crowd The crowd the live crowds and they're in and their audiences for sure Yes, if they make the wrong person champion, they hear about it, right? Oh, yes You know, it matters it matters for their business that certainly matters. Yeah Is more of like the mental is it is it possible for human beings to pretend that someone is the champion Without kind of falling into that trap Well, I think we should have every mouth finger butthole champion on this podcast come back on and talk about their lives after Winning mouth good boy. Good boy. I don't know eyes have changed you watch enough of that wrestling and it just gets It gets crazy I'll never know. I will never I will not put myself to that test My kids I would have if my kids got into wrestling I would have my kids did not get into wrestling And and I think thank goodness and I still love the old classic goofy shit I think it's funny as hell but I appreciate it just for the the goofiness of it all But then you start if you start to really scratch at it. It just gets sad real fast You know, well, you know most things you know They're they're plenty of spots on me if you scratch at them long enough. It gets real sad I often just stare at Jacob until I feel sad That's basically what I do to get it going to stare at Jacob while he's scratching when I want to drum up You said this I do that Um Paul yes, what are you asking for your wife free for yourself for Christmas? Oh nothing Do you guys get each other stuff? Yeah, I got I got and a New coffee maker and a giant and of Green Gables box set. Oh, by the way Yeah, I want to step on this for a second the amount of like ho ho ho someone works for Starbucks Good coffee maker at home. Stop pretending like every fucking employee of Starbucks becomes like some coffee goddess for they have Or whatever like it was possible to be a regular human being with an aged coffee maker This is the problem get a job at Starbucks. It was only it was only like three years old It was a good coffee maker It just happened to get a stink bug in it and that made her physically unable coffee maker anymore She legit just vomited everywhere. She couldn't look at the machine anymore without getting physically sick That's the there was nothing wrong with this coffee maker. It was fancy Damn, you know you press the shit and the new one. I got hers fucking fancy Dan It's got a milk steamer thing on it and all kind of hoodly-hoo. It's fancy. It's a nice coffee maker It was like, you know almost $200 coffee maker that I got on super sale at my old Tarjay Paying for itself there a little bit milk that milk spritzer doubles as a Swedish hot bidet if you use it properly An upside-down Swedish hot.

It's great, right? Yes. What is that? That's the comic book? What yeah, yeah Scott Snyder wrote Batman for a while the the main title for a while and I loved it He did the whole court of owls and then on some really wild stuff Really loved that so I checked out his new stuff and this Absolute Batman is just knocking it out of the park right now. So yeah, I got Matt the first I guess it's the first five books. Yeah in the series Would you like about it? I like spoilers possibly I guess yeah Yeah, but it's right right at the top is Alfred's not his he's not rich and Alfred's not his butler, right? And so Alfred is just this other guy who's like a trained worldwide assassin And he's like he's actually like meant to like track down Track down a group days of tracking down He runs into Batman and they realize they have to work with each other and it's really a different deal and Yeah, it's just it's just a it's Batman is younger guy and he's more this really frustrated almost like UFC fighter type person It's really it's really clever.

I don't know how they're gonna explain it, but it looks pretty wild I guess again, I'm behind By like five or six issues I guess closer to ten by the time the trade comes out But I guess he went through his whole killer croc thing and a lot of his friends are now becoming the villains that they were Destined to become yeah. Yeah, that's happening Yeah, so it's interesting. Yeah, all all his childhood friends end up being the rogues gallery that Batman ends up fighting It's kind of wild Yeah All right is the it's just it's just take away take away his wealth being a superpower is probably one of the smartest things Coolest things you could have done. Oh, yeah, that is interesting. Yeah He's a little more Gotcha.

He's a He's a construction worker. That's what makes him such a buff freak. That's a big part of it like he's he's going to school for for you know, Kim and all kinds of Super science stuff, but he's a construction worker. So like the Batmobile is a giant dump truck outfitted with armor and shit Yeah It's me. Let's do a little we're gonna save that email.

Okay, the disco riot Kaminsky Park was not an actual event that killed disco What it was was an event that was supposed to be it was drummed up by a radio DJ a DJ I'll do it and it ended up being this incredibly racist event where everyone brought a bunch of blues and R&B records To it and then it broke out of this riot, but it was basically racially fueled So it's one of the most weirdest reported things in it Well, it's used as a cornerstone in the disco show where I'm like, that's not what happened as a baby child of the 70s I remember growing up with that whole disco sucks thing Yeah coming through his baby turns out that whole mantra that whole movement was just anti LGBTQIA stuff man, it was just yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It's all racist and racist Yeah, but I mean, you know, it's all just stems from don't let people enjoy The music that supports their their lifestyle and their culture. It's just awful. It's awful. This country is crazy Steve doll. Yeah, that's the DJ I think right Laurie. Yeah, fuck that guy Yeah, I think he ended up didn't get in trouble for all that shit Like a lot of destruction of property and stuff that happened on his yes It fucked up like the ballpark and stuff. I think yeah, I think he ended up being on the hook for some financial stuff Maybe even did some jail time I don't know back when there's a bunch of like niche cool podcast companies coming out this one I'm trying to I can't remember remember it now but there's a podcast that interviewed basically a black usher from Kaminsky Park and His and in his breakdown of what happened the day disco died It was a really great podcast At one point he basically has to like hide and run Because of what was happening in the park. What's that on? I have to find it. It's been so long It's listen to it forever ago, but obviously that a huge impact on me Swedish scoop is saying that was a double header and the second game had to be forfeited Laurie is saying it was a huge deal, but I believe they had to just call the game.
