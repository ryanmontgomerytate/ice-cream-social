1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
 Oh, it's all just great and everything's taking along just fine. There are no problems anywhere.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,240
 Ah, ha, ha, ha, ho, ha, ho.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,240
 [Music]

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:18,240
 Oh, hello there! I am so glad you're here. I would love to thank the ice cream truck drivers right now.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,240
 Thank your ice cream truck drivers. Who are the ice cream truck drivers, you ask?

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,240
 Well, these are the people that deliver that frickin' ice cream straight to your frickin' ear holes!

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,240
 [Laughter]

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:37,240
 Right now I'd like to thank Bearded Scoop 3, Blue Line Scoop, Christine Elsesser, Christy Salinas,

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:43,240
 Darren Cunningham, Darth Scooper, David Walker, Ted Laszlo, and Dirty Old Scoop.

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,240
 If you want to be an ice cream truck driver just like these fine folks, head over to PreachingFun.com.

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,240
 PreachingFun.com is where you can go to sign up to be an ice cream truck driver and who knows?

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,240
 The life you saved may be your own.

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,240
 Ah, I cut that off a little too early. Sorry. Here's the show.

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,240
 Hey, Johnny! Do you want to go to an ice cream social?

15
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,240
 Yeah, I'd love to!

16
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,240
 Great! Let's go!

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,240
 [Music]

18
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,240
 Oh, I've got a big problem.

19
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,240
 What's that?

20
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,240
 I have a Sam's Club membership and that's always been the closest big box store to my house.

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,240
 But now a Costco is opening up.

22
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,240
 And they're almost equal distance.

23
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,240
 Sophie's Choice.

24
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,240
 It's time for Matt and Mattingly's Ice Cream Social.

25
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,240
 Sitting in Las Vegas, that's Matt Donnelly.

26
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,240
 Sitting in Pittsburgh, PA, that's Paul Mattingly.

27
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,240
 Sitting in Las Vegas, it's me, Jacob the Audio Guy.

28
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,240
 We're PreachingFun.

29
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,240
 Speaking of Sophie's Choice, I went and saw Fantastic Four.

30
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,240
 Right? This is something I want to talk about. Marvel film fatigue is fully setting in.

31
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,240
 Is Fantastic Four Marvel? I guess it is.

32
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,240
 They're original Marvel.

33
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,240
 The first family of the Marvel Universe.

34
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,240
 King Kirby's grand creation.

35
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,240
 Jiminy jumped up Christmas.

36
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,240
 Oh, Lord.

37
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,240
 Boy, for somebody that was really upset about the Fantastic Four a minute ago, you are very defensive of their origins.

38
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,240
 I'm not upset about it. I didn't see the movie yet.

39
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,240
 Although, although, well, we'll see.

40
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,240
 I was upset I texted you guys in the middle of the movie.

41
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,240
 I know you were really upset. This was hurting your soul.

42
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,240
 I got a text message from Matt in mid-film.

43
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,240
 So you took your kids to go see Fantastic Four.

44
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:36,240
 Yes, I was a group of two other parents and a total of six children went to see Fantastic Four together.

45
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,240
 Summer blockbuster.

46
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,240
 Time to get out in the theaters and enjoy ourselves.

47
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,240
 First scene is a pregnancy test.

48
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:50,240
 Just her just hanging over pregnancy tests and I was like, oh, no, I really don't want this to be about a baby.

49
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,240
 Oh, you're in luck, I guess.

50
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:06,240
 And then like it's like straight up with like like all of the all like as if they made it for parents, like as if the kids like like the kids were maybe secondary to the summer blockbuster thing.

51
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,240
 They thought maybe a lot of parents, a lot of moms would come out and want to see scenes about like losing sleep.

52
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,240
 And like who's going to take care of the baby and all this other stuff.

53
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,240
 And is he normal? And let's let's let's let's look at the scans.

54
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,240
 And I was like, who is this for? Who is this for?

55
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:30,240
 And then they're like, oh, Galacticus, we got to go talk to that guy.

56
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,240
 Let's get the pregnant lady into the spaceship and get her out and out of space.

57
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,240
 Let's make sure that she's leaving the planet.

58
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:44,240
 This seems like a good job to visit a planet eating being and and see if he wants to just talk to a pregnant lady.

59
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,240
 What like why do you do it?

60
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,240
 They talk about how they struggle to get pregnant.

61
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:59,240
 All the things that like bring back all the like, you know, as my friend Matt told me when your first year of pregnancy, first year the kids on Earth, it's he called a baby nam.

62
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,240
 You're in baby now. Right.

63
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,240
 So you want to be reminded of like the time you basically went crazy and lost sight of everything that was happening in the world for a year.

64
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,240
 Let's make sure we get that nostalgic back in here. Right.

65
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,240
 And then Galacticus wants that baby.

66
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,240
 That's that's that's the deal.

67
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:24,240
 He won't eat. He won't eat out of all of the out of all the babies that could have been shot up into outer space to talk to Galacticus.

68
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,240
 We happen to shoot up the right one.

69
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,240
 Yeah, because he's the child of two superheroes. So he's special. Wow.

70
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
 That is lucky for us.

71
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,240
 Well, I'll say I'll.

72
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,240
 So I assume they just sacrifice the baby and Galacticus goes away and everything is fine from then on.

73
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,240
 I'll step in as the good of the many outweighs as a comic book nerd.

74
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
 Again, I have not seen the film.

75
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,240
 If it's fucking canon, it'll give a shit.

76
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,240
 If it's fucking from the original author, if the fucking genius from Marvel's cradle was like, no, this is sacred script.

77
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
 I don't give a fuck.

78
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:02,240
 I brought my kids to a summer blockbuster and watched him watch two hours of whether we should or shouldn't sacrifice a baby.

79
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,240
 Yeah. No, I think that's a stupid move.

80
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,240
 Now, the only my only defense and this is a very weak defense.

81
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,240
 But in many, what do you think, Marvel?

82
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,240
 Should we sacrifice this baby in many incarnations?

83
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,240
 Franklin, the baby, they did call him Franklin, right?

84
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,240
 Yes. Yeah.

85
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,240
 OK, great. At least they stuck to that.

86
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:28,240
 Franklin Richards does become a super genius capable of manipulating multiverses.

87
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:36,240
 So there is something of the of a, you know, he's he's a he's a keystone character or you know what I mean?

88
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
 I understand.

89
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:44,240
 But you know, it's the same argument when fucking we spent all of Black Widow setting up the fucking Cannonball family.

90
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,240
 What are they called?

91
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,240
 That's a Cannonball family with red, red tornado or whatever his name is.

92
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,240
 No, no, the movie that just came out with the other movie that just came out.

93
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,240
 The Thunderbolts. Thunderbolts.

94
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,240
 So I went to see I want to see Scarlett Johansson kick ass of Black Widow.

95
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,240
 And they spent half that movie setting up the Thunderbolts movie, a movie that wouldn't come out for another three years.

96
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,240
 So thanks for the prequel.

97
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,240
 And then I keep in mind, too, when they first made the movie, because remember, they held the movie.

98
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,240
 They held Black Widow for a year.

99
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,240
 So when they made it, it wouldn't have come out for four years.

100
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:20,240
 So it's like, well, I don't I don't need to keep this like encyclopedic like checklist of like, oh, good.

101
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,240
 When I'm watching a film, like if it pays off, great.

102
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,240
 If it's a building up, great, great.

103
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:35,240
 When the when the Robert Downey Jr. first Iron Man came out, you didn't sit on your hands during the movie going like, yes, but what are they going to do with vision?

104
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,240
 OK, here's a play music or something.

105
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,240
 He's a big spoiler. So play music or something. Oh, OK.

106
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,240
 We got a big spoiler coming up here. Those in the chat who don't want to be spoiled, avert your ears.

107
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,240
 So yeah, so I'm going to play a little music by the time the music ends.

108
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,240
 Fast forward until you don't hear the music. When I go like this again, you can come back on if you don't want spoilers.

109
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:59,240
 All right. Spoilers. They show her fucking dead for like two minutes.

110
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:12,240
 Sue Storm, like dead on the invisible girl, fucking dead, like on the ground, fucking Pedro Pascal weeping over her dead fucking body, like true fucking death scenes.

111
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,240
 And then finally bring the baby around so that the baby can start showing his powers for the first time.

112
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,240
 That's like punching someone in the face and saying, just kidding.

113
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,240
 Like, you can't like you made a bunch of children look at a dead woman on the ground for two minutes.

114
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:33,240
 Like, fuck off. It sounds like the first Pokemon movie, honestly.

115
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,240
 But the Pokemon movie had lots of dead women in it, but that is canon.

116
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,240
 Do you remember the first Pokemon movie? Did you ever see the first Pokemon movie?

117
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,240
 Oh, yeah, yeah, no. I watched the first Pokemon movie again last night.

118
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
 I'm not talking to you, Jacob. I know you never saw the first Pokemon movie.

119
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,240
 No, I rewatched it again last night. It was great. I loved it. All of the dead women. It doesn't bother me.

120
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,240
 The dead women in the Pokemon movie does not concern me at all.

121
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,240
 Matt, you probably missed the first Pokemon movie, too, because that was a little bit after the boys.

122
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:03,240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. We did not get into it. They collect the cards, but they're not really into any of the...

123
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,240
 So, spoiler for the 20 plus year old Pokemon movie.

124
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,240
 Yeah.

125
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,240
 Ash dies. He dies.

126
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,240
 What?

127
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:22,240
 And then the Pokemon start crying and their magical tears bring him back to life.

128
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,240
 So, it sounds like they just ripped off the Pokemon movie from 20 years ago.

129
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:35,240
 Yes. Look, I guess we can say thumbs up to rejoin, because we'll talk about it more vaguely or whatever.

130
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,240
 Yeah, yeah.

131
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,240
 Oh, scoopernova girl says that he dies in every movie.

132
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,240
 Ash knows that he doesn't die in every movie.

133
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,240
 Oh, okay.

134
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:50,240
 No, I mean, there are more dead parents in Disney's canon than there is in every horror movie franchise.

135
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
 Disney loves killing fucking moms and dads.

136
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,240
 And the canon is how they get rid of the bodies. They put the bodies in the canon, and then they get rid of the bodies.

137
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,240
 And the circus ripped that off. So, who's ripping off who?

138
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,240
 And the truth is, my kids didn't give a shit. They just liked watching Fantastic Four.

139
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,240
 R-Tax. Winners scoop fucking R-Tax.

140
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,240
 Yeah, it is R-Tax. It is R-Tax time.

141
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,240
 My kids didn't give a shit. They watched the movie. They were fine or whatever.

142
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,240
 Did they like it?

143
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,240
 They did like it. They did not love it.

144
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,240
 Right.

145
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,240
 I will tell you, there's a second movie we saw over the weekend.

146
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
 Oh.

147
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,240
 And the first movie we saw was Naked Gun.

148
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
 Oh.

149
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
 Ah.

150
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,240
 How did that go?

151
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
 I bet they liked Naked Gun.

152
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
 They loved Naked Gun.

153
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
 Yeah.

154
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:51,240
 They were just crying out loud laughing. And this is why it's so funny that we're so cool with violence and so anti-anything that might whiff of sex.

155
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,240
 Yeah.

156
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:59,240
 Right. I would take my kids to Naked Gun again tomorrow. They were laughing so hard.

157
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:06,240
 Yeah.

158
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,240
 First of all, Pamela Anderson is really good at it, which is something I was not expecting.

159
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
 Yeah.

160
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
 I expected her to be fine.

161
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,240
 Oh, yeah. I heard she's great.

162
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,240
 She's really funny in it, which I've never seen her be in other things.

163
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:25,240
 It certainly seems that as she's getting older, she is accepting more and more. I can just be funny. This is great.

164
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:34,240
 I do think it's a thing about character. I think as she got older, she's no longer this bombshell, so she's allowed to say things differently and feel things differently. It's on us.

165
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,240
 She doesn't have to worry about that.

166
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,240
 Oh, absolutely.

167
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,240
 Yes, absolutely.

168
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,240
 I agree with that.

169
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,240
 It's a weird thing. Did you also hear she and Liam Neeson are an item?

170
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,240
 They kissed on the red carpet, Paul.

171
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
 Right.

172
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
 Scandal.

173
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,240
 I mean, not scandal. It's adorable. It's a show mance, Matt. It's a show mance.

174
00:10:53,240 --> 00:11:00,240
 It is, but no, it's one of those different things. In the movie, his character is a widower and he falls for her in it.

175
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
 Oh, and in real life.

176
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:10,240
 And in real life, it's the same. But that movie is just a million jokes a mile a minute. It's what it's supposed to be.

177
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,240
 Some people I've heard speak a little snobbly about it, and I'm always like, what were you expecting?

178
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
 Yeah, it's a naked gun.

179
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:27,240
 And I mean this, not to be overly dramatic, but I remember after 9/11. I was in the New York improv scene. We're all very thick commons.

180
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,240
 Good. I'm glad we're not going to be too dramatic.

181
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:40,240
 Not that he's too dramatic, but I remember John Bowie saying, I used to not get the three stooges, and I get the three stooges now.

182
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,240
 OK.

183
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:50,240
 He was like, we were all at the UCB, we were all trying to do our own version of sophisticated improv comedy, for whatever that's worth, and sketch comedy.

184
00:11:50,240 --> 00:12:03,240
 And just like these stupid weird pratfall stuff. And he said he just found himself watching it right after 9/11, and it was like, oh, this is so soothing.

185
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:12,240
 I've been told that about the new Naked Gun movie, that it is that old school, because I haven't seen it yet, but I've been told by multiple people that it's that old school.

186
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,240
 We're just going to get up, and we're going to do a bunch of stupid bits and tell a bunch of jokes.

187
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:22,240
 Just a joke a second. Nothing's ever going to come out of our mouth that isn't a joke.

188
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:30,240
 And I've been told it's just so irreverent, and not trying to deal with issues, and it is just like an old school checkout.

189
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:37,240
 You just go check out at the movie theater for an hour and a half, two hours, and just have a nice time. Is that fair?

190
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:48,240
 Totally. It's total escapism, just a crazy amount of jokes on every level, from the dumbest jokes to really funny long bits. Really good.

191
00:12:48,240 --> 00:13:00,240
 And you're right, Jacob. When Airplane and Naked Gun were part of our regular lives when we were younger, I used to even talk about it in improv classes, the idea of stakes to jokes.

192
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:11,240
 If you want to have the most fun, you have to have high stakes, right? And then I had to stop saying that because I started teaching people younger and younger, and then no one had ever watched those movies at a certain point.

193
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,240
 Oh, yeah.

194
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:22,240
 And then there was the Children's Hospital was the only kind of slapsticky thing around to illustrate that point, and then all of a sudden...

195
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,240
 Matt doesn't mean the TV show. He means an actual children's hospital that was down the street from where he taught.

196
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:34,240
 But yeah, whatever. Adult Swim Show.

197
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:44,240
 But there just wasn't that slapstick style. I remember even literally with my children trying to explain what slapstick was and being like, "Shit, I don't have any concrete examples."

198
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:51,240
 But yeah, they're getting hurt, but it's funny. It's really sophisticated. I'm sorry, kids.

199
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:58,240
 So they were just crying laughing. They got in the car, and they were debating whether it was the funniest movie they'd ever seen.

200
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,240
 Good.

201
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,240
 So I guess...

202
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,240
 What were the other contenders?

203
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,240
 Ace Ventura.

204
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,240
 Great.

205
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,240
 That's a good entry.

206
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,240
 They really liked Ace Ventura.

207
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,240
 That's a crazy movie.

208
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,240
 It is a joke in the house to do the thing with the sliding door, like, "Ahhhh."

209
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,240
 Oh, yeah.

210
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,240
 Yeah.

211
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,240
 Good, good.

212
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,240
 Oh, yeah. Scoop of Monte Cristo in the chat wants to know, "Will you show them the original Naked Gun now?"

213
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,240
 I think so.

214
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,240
 I think now...

215
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,240
 I think so.

216
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
 I think it'd be good.

217
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,240
 We're actually now at the place where... At first we used to worry about showing certain things. Our kids watch The Simpsons all the time.

218
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,240
 Yeah.

219
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,240
 And I guess other kids aren't allowed to watch that, so they come over and they're still not allowed to watch it.

220
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,240
 Right.

221
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:54,240
 And so it was funny because my kids are just... They know how to negotiate, basically. They're sophisticated craftsmen of the deals.

222
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,240
 Yeah, that's true.

223
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,240
 So literally the next morning they're like, "Oh, Family Guy's on the channel. Dad, can we watch Family Guy?"

224
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
 And I was like, "Oh, man."

225
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,240
 It's like...

226
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,240
 The slippery slope has begun.

227
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,240
 It's like, "You can't put the genie back in the bottle, right?"

228
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,240
 And I was like, "If they watched all the Naked Gun stuff..."

229
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,240
 Well, you can start them off with Police Squad.

230
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:23,240
 I mean, that's the thing. I think we should just watch that because there's references to Police Squad in it that are direct, that you're like...

231
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
 Right.

232
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,240
 If you know the reference.

233
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:33,240
 And Police Squad is one of those shows... It's very similar to Get Smart and those types of shows where they really did...

234
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:39,240
 It'd be a little bit different each episode, but each episode was basically the same jokes over and over again.

235
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,240
 Which is kind of delightful and almost secure.

236
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,240
 Yes.

237
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,240
 Now, one of the writers on it...

238
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:55,240
 It was written and directed by one of the guys from Lonely Island, but one of the other writers on it is Dan Greger.

239
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:03,240
 Who is Rachel Bloom's husband and already a very successful movie writer and filmmaker.

240
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,240
 But I still have his number on my phone from when he used to do the Neutrino video projects in New York.

241
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,240
 And I was like, "What if he has to change his number?"

242
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,240
 And so I just shot him a text being like, "Look, I hope you're getting a thousand of these texts."

243
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,240
 Just left the theater with my kids, all of us just laughing our asses off.

244
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,240
 Yeah.

245
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,240
 And what a time for the movie to come out. I'm so happy it came out and everything else and so...

246
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,240
 We had a really nice exchange on that. So it was really fun.

247
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,240
 Oh, that's lovely.

248
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,240
 I said I was Matt Donnelly, so I would skip the new phone who dis.

249
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,240
 Oh, yeah.

250
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,240
 Get past that part.

251
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,240
 But it was a super fun thing. But yeah, very, very happy.

252
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,240
 So a lot of cinematic intake for me, guys. A lot of cinematic intake.

253
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:52,240
 Yeah. Well, I finally got around to seeing Thunderbolts and I did not enjoy that film at all.

254
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,240
 Guestimating better or worse than Fantastic Four.

255
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,240
 I don't... I can't... I don't know.

256
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,240
 That's why it's guestimating. Based on what Matt has said, does it sound better or worse?

257
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,240
 I'm guessing it's worse than Fantastic Four.

258
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,240
 Oh. Fight.

259
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:16,240
 I don't know. I've heard a lot of great stuff about Fantastic Four and I heard middling stuff about Thunderbolts.

260
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,240
 But I heard better stuff about Thunderbolts than I thought.

261
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,240
 Now, problem is, you talk about coming in with the comic book baggage, Matt.

262
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,240
 Yeah. So spoilers for Thunderbolts, ladies and gentlemen.

263
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,240
 Oh, hold on. Hold on. Yeah.

264
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,240
 Let's get some spoiler music going for Thunderbolts. When the music ends, the spoiler is over.

265
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,240
 Fast forward until you don't hear the music anymore. Thunderbolts spoiler.

266
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:43,240
 So Thunderbolts revolves around the character of the Sentry.

267
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:48,240
 The Sentry is essentially Marvel's answer to Superman.

268
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240
 Okay. Ah.

269
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,240
 Are you familiar with this character?

270
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,240
 Not at all.

271
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,240
 Superman? Yes.

272
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,240
 Sentry is a relatively new invention.

273
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:03,240
 And he's only, I don't know, probably not even 20-year-old character, I don't think.

274
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,240
 I have never enjoyed the Sentry at all.

275
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:15,240
 Because, just like Superman, it's hard to make stakes when you've got an invincible everything thing.

276
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:21,240
 So the only twist on Sentry is that he has a dark side.

277
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:28,240
 Right? So he's like Superman, but he's also evil Superman at the same time.

278
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,240
 He's got mental problems. That's the whole thing.

279
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,240
 But it's like if they made Moon Knight Superman, basically.

280
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
 Gotcha.

281
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
 Spoiler over. Spoiler over.

282
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:50,240
 Yeah. So it's just kind of bleh, you know, not great with that because, again, the stakes just don't seem to be there.

283
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,240
 Right.

284
00:18:51,240 --> 00:19:05,240
 And the characters that I did enjoy, like Yelena, whatever her name, from the Black Widow series, she just, there's really nothing for her to do.

285
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,240
 She's just, it's all, and it feels very, it feels really small.

286
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:17,240
 The movie feels really small. Everything just feels like it's shot in like five tiny locations.

287
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:23,240
 When they do get it big, it's just to show some buildings falling on each other and nobody cares.

288
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,240
 It's just because nobody cares because, again, nothing, no consequence, nothing happens.

289
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:34,240
 And according to Google AI, Fantastic Four is slightly worse than Thunderbolt.

290
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,240
 Really? Oh, well, shit. I'm in for it.

291
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:43,240
 Yeah. I just like that, like, hey, guys, we're kind of losing the handle here on phase four or phase three of Marvel Universe.

292
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,240
 Yeah. How are we going to write this shit? You're like, all right, there's a baby.

293
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,240
 You're like, there's a pregnancy test.

294
00:19:49,240 --> 00:20:03,240
 Yeah, all these ideas. And the whole thing with, God, David Harbour is just so dumb in this fucking movie as the Soviet guy.

295
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,240
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

296
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:10,240
 Yelena's dad. He comes off like he's trying to hit on her.

297
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:17,240
 It doesn't. There's no parental. It's just Red Guardian. Yeah, just garbage.

298
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,240
 Anyway, I was I was really disappointed because I really wanted to like it.

299
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,240
 And I did not like it at all.

300
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:32,240
 How old are the Thunderbolts? How are they a modern comic book introduction or have they been around for a while?

301
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:41,240
 I'm going to say that was late 90s and, you know, that was a whole thing where so fairly recent, especially for us.

302
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,240
 But but very different incarnation of who was in it, too, sort of.

303
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:53,240
 I think I think that the former Captain America wants his name super soldier.

304
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,240
 I can't remember his name, Patriot. It doesn't matter, Mr. Patriot, whatever.

305
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,240
 I think he was part of it from the jump.

306
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,240
 You know who else Mr. Patriot was in.

307
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,240
 And that's the following sponsor.

308
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:11,240
 So today's show is brought to you by Scryte Extra Sugar, the Tooth Loosener.

309
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,240
 That's from Cool Yay. I like I like glass.

310
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,240
 Wait, queer a glass. That's it.

311
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:25,240
 Twenty twenty three the product. No problem pronouncing Scryte Extra Sugar, the Tooth Loosener.

312
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:31,240
 Oh, yeah, it's me, the ghost of Macho Man Randy Savage.

313
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,240
 I'm here to tell you a little something about Scryte Extra Sugar.

314
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,240
 You ever have a tooth that's just not coming loose?

315
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,240
 It's just not coming out. Well, I've got the solution for you right here.

316
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,240
 You could get this out of your head. No problem.

317
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,240
 Cream rises to the top and so does the cane sugar.

318
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,240
 Go ahead, get yourself a tall glass of Sprite Extra Sugar and pour it in.

319
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:05,240
 You'll notice the thickening agents are going to work immediately, causing it to drip like Sunday topping right on your cold ice cubes.

320
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,240
 Go ahead and try and drink it. You won't be able to because it's 99 percent sugar.

321
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,240
 It's granulated for your pleasure.

322
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:21,240
 Go ahead and chew a Sprite Extra Sugar today. Gargle it down, bitch. Yum.

323
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,240
 I'm sorry. Did you did you say you're a ghost?

324
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,240
 I'm a ghost. I feel like that is the lead that we are burying here.

325
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,240
 What are you talking about? I'm not the only ghost.

326
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,240
 Advertisements? You're not?

327
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,240
 No, I mean, this has been going on for a long time.

328
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,240
 I remember when Gene Kelly was selling vacuum cleaners.

329
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:48,240
 You know, you have you have an excellent point.

330
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,240
 Shoot, Paul Walker's about to start another fast movie franchise.

331
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,240
 That's right. Brought to you by Sprite Extra Sugar.

332
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,240
 The tooth-loosener.

333
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:05,240
 Anyways, when we got out of the movie, I was like, should we go watch Sophie's Sophie's Choice now or what should we do?

334
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,240
 And so how did the kids like Sophie's Choice?

335
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,240
 They loved all the action. Good.

336
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,240
 Hey, speaking of Sprite Extra Sugar.

337
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,240
 Yes. Have either of you gentlemen heard of the new trend?

338
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,240
 Don't get sued by Sprite. We're only talking about Sprite.

339
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,240
 I said, did I say Sprite? I meant Sprite.

340
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,240
 You said Sprite once or twice. Oh, boy. Well, whatever. It's all the same.

341
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,240
 It's not. That's the entire point. It's not.

342
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,240
 You're right. You're right. Keeps us free.

343
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:41,240
 Have either of you experienced dirty sodas yet?

344
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,240
 Who's that? I want to experience this person.

345
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,240
 When I went to Utah, there's all those soda places.

346
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,240
 Yes. Utah is where Utah is where it's popping off.

347
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,240
 It's a Mormon thing.

348
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,240
 Yes. It's a Mormon thing.

349
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,240
 There are a few here. It is a Mormon thing and it is bananas.

350
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:06,240
 It's spread out here now. So our little local ice cream spot that we go to,

351
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,240
 they have dirty sodas now and got one the other day.

352
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,240
 I just got a regular milkshake and got a dirty soda.

353
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,240
 And I sipped on that motherfucking thing. I am a fan.

354
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,240
 Of course it's crack. Why wouldn't you?

355
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,240
 When we were kids, we had Shirley Temples, right?

356
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,240
 Which was like, hey, let's take the sweetest thing that you could possibly have on Earth

357
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,240
 and then add a sugary syrup to it and mix it up.

358
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,240
 And when you look at the ingredients of these crazy crack sodas,

359
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,240
 it is just the most caloric.

360
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,240
 It is insane.

361
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:47,240
 This one that she got was Dr. Pepper mixed with raspberry syrup

362
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:52,240
 and I believe it's a tangerine cream.

363
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,240
 Coffee creamer is one of the things that go with these.

364
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,240
 Creamer is a big thing.

365
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,240
 Yeah. So coffee creamer goes into it.

366
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,240
 Canadian Scoop Crystal asking about the dirty.

367
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,240
 So it's like coffee creamer and then syrups and all kinds of stuff.

368
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,240
 So it kind of muddies it up.

369
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,240
 As always, Canadian Scoop Crystal, dirty for Mormons, not dirty for you.

370
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,240
 Exactly. Exactly.

371
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,240
 And you're absolutely right, Scoop of Monte Cristo, the blood does thicken on this stuff.

372
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,240
 It is an extreme blood thickener.

373
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:26,240
 You know who hates that soda is your pancreas. That's who hates that.

374
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,240
 Oh, he hasn't had a lot to say around here in a long time.

375
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,240
 He really has had no voice in the conversation.

376
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,240
 He has been in the non-vocal minority for a while.

377
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,240
 He's been very much excluded from the conversation for a while.

378
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,240
 Pancre-who?

379
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,240
 Pancre-hoodis?

380
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,240
 Pancre-you, not Pancre-us.

381
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,240
 Pancre-hoodis?

382
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,240
 Yeah, here's Winter Scoop's recipe.

383
00:25:52,240 --> 00:26:01,240
 44-ounce Dr. Pepper with three creamers, also do it with root beer, make soda into the float drink after the ice cream is eaten up.

384
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,240
 Oh man, I don't think it was that much.

385
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,240
 That's real dirty.

386
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,240
 It was just a little, it was a small cup of it.

387
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:17,240
 On the show we talked about once I put French vanilla creamer into apple cider because I did it on Thanksgiving.

388
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,240
 Oh yeah, it would come off like a little ala mode, yeah, how'd it go?

389
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:29,240
 It was delicious, but again, my teeth rattle as I recall the story.

390
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,240
 I'm not watching a video of somebody make one of these.

391
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:46,240
 They're like pouring Diet Coke into a glass, pouring some kind of creamer into it on top of it, and then just squeezing a lime and now they're pouring some raspberry-looking syrups into it.

392
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,240
 There you go.

393
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,240
 Yeah, there's lots of different recipes.

394
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,240
 It's alchemy.

395
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,240
 I think it's fun that you can come up with all these crazy new things.

396
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:05,240
 Don't get me wrong, I did Mr. Pib Zero with cherry vanilla on the soda thing.

397
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,240
 That was legit good.

398
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,240
 I felt like a dirty Mormon at my movie.

399
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:21,240
 Steven Eames asking, "Wouldn't the milk curdle it?" Well, there's no milk involved in these non-dairy creamers. They're just flavored liquids.

400
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,240
 According to the Googles, some people use dairy creamers, though, and so I would think those would curdle.

401
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,240
 Those people are monsters.

402
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,240
 That sounds horrific.

403
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,240
 That doesn't sound any better or worse.

404
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:43,240
 No, no, no. What? Do you want a cottage cheese soda? That's what that would be.

405
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:51,240
 That sounds as good as everything else you're describing.

406
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:58,240
 The dairy is not what's bothering me here.

407
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:06,240
 Even when you go AL8 and Big Red, when I travel, you find a novelty soda.

408
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:14,240
 One of the reasons why they're thriving as a novelty soda is that they have 50 more calories than Coke.

409
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:22,240
 You're just like, "Oh, that's significant. That's a significant amount of sugar."

410
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:30,240
 A Thirsty Scoop had a cherry pie dirty soda. It was sprite, cream, cherry syrup, and vanilla.

411
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:41,240
 A typical dirty soda can contain significantly more calories than a regular soda, potentially ranging from 250 to 600 additional calories.

412
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,240
 For your beverage.

413
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,240
 Let's go.

414
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,240
 Yeah, that's your beverage.

415
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,240
 No, that's your meal. Now, let's be real.

416
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:54,240
 I hope so. I hope so too, but when I have just a bunch of sugar, it doesn't feel like a meal, so then I still am hungry.

417
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:03,240
 According to this thing that I found that doesn't mean anything at all, some large dirty sodas are right around 1,100 calories.

418
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,240
 There you go. You need to have a come to Jesus with your pancreas, Matt. Get them on the straight and narrow.

419
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:14,240
 My doctor already told me to have a come to Jesus moment with my pancreas.

420
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,240
 I think he meant the other direction, though.

421
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:22,240
 My metformin prescription tells me I shouldn't be hitting up these dirty soda places, so maybe...

422
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:30,240
 Yeah, it's a rare treat kind of thing, the dirty soda. Rare treat, it's a rare treat.

423
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:41,240
 What was the thing when you guys were doing the potato diet? What was the go-to thing with him to say you'd rarely feast on something?

424
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,240
 Rare and appropriate.

425
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,240
 Rare and appropriate, that was it.

426
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,240
 There's no appropriate for dirty soda.

427
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,240
 I was going to say, appropriate doesn't feel like the right word for dirty soda, no matter what.

428
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,240
 Rare and celebratory...

429
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,240
 That's it. Rare and horrible.

430
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,240
 Rare and annual.

431
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:07,240
 That old text thread with a "Hey, rare and appropriate," while I'm eating a fucking gummy worm dipped in cherry cream.

432
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,240
 Check it out, Ray.

433
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,240
 I bit the ends off of this gummy worm, and now I'm using it as a straw.

434
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,240
 Yeah, dirty sodas. Latter Day Scoop says dirty sodas are frequent and excessive, and that is absolutely right.

435
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:27,240
 It's okay, though, because while I'm drinking this dirty soda, I'm a little chilly, so that's probably evening it all out.

436
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

437
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,240
 I'm outside, and it's a bit nippy.

438
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:42,240
 Yeah, next time I sit down with my doctor, we go over some stuff, I'm going to be like, "That's so strange. I mean, other than my dirty sodas, I'm keeping it tip-top."

439
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,240
 I'm down to two dirty sodas a day.

440
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:54,240
 Oh, God. I can't... No, it was a small one, and Anne had like, not even a third of it, and she's like, "This is too sweet for me."

441
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,240
 Too much, too much.

442
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,240
 Was she bouncing off the walls? Was she a different gal all day?

443
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,240
 She was not. She was just like, "This is just too sweet for me."

444
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,240
 She doesn't have the candy addiction like I do.

445
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,240
 She got them itchy teeth.

446
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,240
 And I was like, "I'm down. Let me finish that soda." So I did, and it was good.

447
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:24,240
 We were driving by children in Las Vegas. I guess children in a lot of places, but one of the kids' wise asses goes like, "Oh, can we stop by the dispensary on the way home? We just saw a dispensary."

448
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,240
 Oh, they thought it was like a Soty Pops or something?

449
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,240
 Well, I said, I go, "What do you think a dispensary is?"

450
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,240
 Yeah.

451
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,240
 And he goes, "A place where you dispense of bodies?"

452
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:43,240
 And I was like, "In Las Vegas, that seems like a fair guess. That seems like a fair..."

453
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,240
 They're worse guesses.

454
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,240
 Like one of those enzyme pools for horses, but we have one of those at the side of the road here.

455
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,240
 Oh, horse enzyme pools.

456
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:59,240
 You know what's in that Planet 13 building? A horse enzyme pool. That's what.

457
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:06,240
 It's so big because it's Olympic size. It's an Olympic size horse enzyme pool.

458
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,240
 Talk about your fucking Artax. There you go.

459
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,240
 That's your sorrow swamp right there.

460
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,240
 So how did the kids like the dispensary?

461
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,240
 They really... it helped them really enjoy Fantastic Four.

462
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:26,240
 I bet it enhanced their dirty sodas too.

463
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,240
 But having drunk that thing, I got to believe that that's going to be the next move for Starbucks, right?

464
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,240
 Like coffee houses got to start serving these things, right?

465
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,240
 Because they got all the stuff. But Jacob, you make a face, but they got all the stuff except the soda.

466
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:45,240
 I understand. I mean, I don't think you're wrong from a business standpoint.

467
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,240
 I just don't want more of this stuff around.

468
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:56,240
 Well, oh, come on. I will also say, do you know, I tell you guys last year, it was like a year and a half ago.

469
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,240
 Your dirty sodas won't really take off when they add ghee.

470
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,240
 Thirsty scoop.

471
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,240
 Oh, I'm so mad at you, thirsty scoop.

472
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,240
 Clarified butter soda.

473
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,240
 Oh, this is the angriest I have been in a scoop in a very long time.

474
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,240
 I'm having an Iron Man soda. You want to join me for an Iron Man soda?

475
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,240
 Oh, what's that?

476
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:22,240
 It's a ghee, zero calorie soda, chicken.

477
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,240
 Chicken? Just a piece of chicken? Just a piece of buffalo chicken?

478
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,240
 That's right.

479
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,240
 A whole bone-in buffalo chicken wing.

480
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,240
 Gummy celery stalk.

481
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,240
 Bone-in!

482
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:44,240
 A whole bone-in buffalo chicken wing, diet coke, diet coke, half a cup of ghee.

483
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,240
 Bullet dirty soda, now with Mero.

484
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,240
 Bullet dirty soda.

485
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,240
 You remember that bullet coffee?

486
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,240
 Bullet coffee, yeah, you put the butter in it.

487
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,240
 Bullet proof coffee, put some ghee in it.

488
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,240
 That's what I was referencing.

489
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,240
 That's what I was referencing, and I'm going to bring that up to Ray.

490
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,240
 Oh, somebody's asking for a dirty soda bar at ScoopFest.

491
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,240
 Yeah, keep asking.

492
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,240
 Well, we'll get you a dirty soda bar, but it's not going to be what you're thinking.

493
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:18,240
 It'll be more like the Double Down.

494
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,240
 And I was like, butter and coffee is gross.

495
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:25,240
 And Ray was like, what's the difference between that and half and half from this fat content?

496
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,240
 Shit.

497
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:31,240
 And I was like, you got me again, Cronus.

498
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,240
 Did he do butter and coffee regularly? Was that one of his go-tos?

499
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,240
 No, he thought it was stupid.

500
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,240
 He just also didn't do the cream or the coffee either.

501
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:46,240
 He was calling it out. He was like, you're just sacrificing one collection of fat for another collection of fat.

502
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,240
 And both serve the same purpose, which is to make your black coffee feel more like a meal.

503
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,240
 And that's why everyone says this butter coffee makes me feel like I have energy and I'm not crashing and all this other stuff.

504
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,240
 And it's only because you put some fat in your system.

505
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,240
 You turned into a calorie machine.

506
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,240
 I've been called worse.

507
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:11,240
 I want to shout out to Jack Reisider and Darknet Diaries the other morning.

508
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:18,240
 We're in the middle of talking. My wife gets a call and she answers it because it's from a 2-1-2 number.

509
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,240
 And it's like Old Instincts from New York Actors. You always answer the 2-1-2 number.

510
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:31,240
 Says it's the bank and there's been fraud. People are tripping fraud on her Zelle account.

511
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:36,240
 And so I'm listening to her.

512
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,240
 She's concerned and my wife's very diligent. She gets a pen and paper.

513
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,240
 So I was writing down information. So I'm talking to the guy.

514
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,240
 They transferred another phone and she's going on and on with him for like an amount of time.

515
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,240
 I start to feel weird.

516
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,240
 And then I'm like, you thought she was having an affair.

517
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,240
 I was like, if she had an affair, let her have her time.

518
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,240
 I'll be over here with my ghee and my coffee.

519
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,240
 I'll be in my in my filming chair.

520
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,240
 And I'm listening to her go through certain activities.

521
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,240
 And she started to say answers that are weird to me.

522
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:13,240
 I just was like, what customer service thing would happen?

523
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,240
 I'm paranoid.

524
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,240
 When you're paranoid, you're like, I don't want to be the dumb idiot here.

525
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,240
 Right. I don't want to look paranoid.

526
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:27,240
 I don't want to look like I'm the weird paranoid guy or be dramatic or whatever.

527
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,240
 My wife is handling a very serious matter.

528
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,240
 Right. Sure.

529
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:38,240
 And but I just find myself like on my notes just typing up.

530
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,240
 Do you see fraud in your accounts?

531
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,240
 And do you trust the person you're on the phone with or whatever?

532
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,240
 Right. Now, the person on the phone, they were doing an amazing job of an elaborate con.

533
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:54,240
 This is like when people actually play chess instead of checkers, it is really hard.

534
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,240
 Because the first person said he was from Chase, but this is a Zelle account.

535
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,240
 He's going to transfer him over to a Zelle operative or whatever.

536
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:06,240
 Gotcha. And the guy says Latter-day Scoop in the in the chat just said something profound,

537
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:11,240
 which is with financial issues over the phone, you are either paranoid or naive.

538
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,240
 Yeah. And I think you're exactly right. Latter-day Scoop.

539
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,240
 I don't think you can just be right.

540
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,240
 And he was saying, like, don't tell me your account number.

541
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,240
 Don't give me any information. I don't want to know your birthday.

542
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:27,240
 We're just going to handle this, you know, whatever. And that secondary misdirection of like, let's just do this or whatever.

543
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:32,240
 And then I'm listening to her and I literally put that note in front of her.

544
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,240
 She's already annoyed that she's trying to handle theft. Right.

545
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:45,240
 And she puts on hold that she's kind of like annoyed and she's like, she gives me all the information that she has heard.

546
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:50,240
 And I said, I don't I know it's going to sound dramatic, but all the information you're telling me is coming from him.

547
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,240
 Like you have no other information from anyone else.

548
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:03,240
 The good move is always like, let me let me hang up on this call now and I will call the number on the back of my card.

549
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,240
 That's a great move. Then you just know who you're talking to.

550
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:12,240
 Because if you Google the number the call from, it was her bank, but it was just it was just a spoofed.

551
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:18,240
 It was a bad, you know, you can you can you can make numbers pop up the way you want them now with phone apps and stuff.

552
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,240
 Yeah. Yes. Is that the term spoof? Yeah.

553
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,240
 You can just say it, Paul, but just explain it as a term to me. They call they call them.

554
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:36,240
 They call them dirty sodas. They spoof. They spoof in them.

555
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:43,240
 It's all the rage with the Mormons. Mormons love nothing more than a spoofed in diet coke.

556
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,240
 So they had her typing and she's like, she's like, just stay with me on the phone.

557
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:54,240
 I'm asking questions, too. They're offering to transfer back and forth to whatever they're going to give the number.

558
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,240
 And I was like, do you mind if I spoof while you talk?

559
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:06,240
 Spoof and soak, says Sarah Miller. I'm just here for a spoof and a soak.

560
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,240
 It is 2025. I can't stop you from spoofing in your own house.

561
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:18,240
 A spoof and a soak and a dirty diet coke. That's a Mormon Christmas right there.

562
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:25,240
 A spoof and a soak and a dirty diet coke. That's a Mormon Christmas.

563
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:31,240
 That's the song that plays when you're in line with the drive through lines like down the lot.

564
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:36,240
 You can hear that when you get within the border of SLC. Oh, my goodness.

565
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,240
 These guys were great actors. We're like, listen, the seat is a little shady.

566
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,240
 And the guy's like, I can understand. I want to give you my number. I want to give you my this number, this number.

567
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,240
 I can transfer you back to your bank.

568
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:53,240
 I like how much credit you're giving the scammers on the phone here for doing a good job of a shitty thing.

569
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,240
 That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying.

570
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,240
 I know. I like it.

571
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:02,240
 Like normally we get like just a bullshit text that we can see in two seconds.

572
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,240
 Yeah. Usually just some bullshit nonsense.

573
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,240
 Thing that we don't have, right? Or whatever.

574
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:12,240
 Like this guy had some information to let Sarah know it was her deal.

575
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:20,240
 And I said, we can go to the bank and confirm that. And he said, oh, absolutely you can. No problem.

576
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:25,240
 I also transfer you back to your bank and you talk to the guy on the phone, which I was like, oh, really clever.

577
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,240
 And I was like, yeah, that's good.

578
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:39,240
 And I was like, yeah. And I said, but then he goes, but he's just going to just get you back on the phone with us because this is about Zell and not about your bank.

579
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:45,240
 Yeah, if you're concerned about it, I can easily transfer you back over to the bank and then you'll be comfortable with them.

580
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,240
 But honestly, it's just going to be a big waste of your time.

581
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,240
 Now, do you want me to do that? Do you want me to waste your time?

582
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,240
 Because I don't mind. I can just waste your time all day.

583
00:40:53,240 --> 00:41:03,240
 But if you're concerned, if you're just a little concerned little fella, I can transfer you back over to the bank. No problem.

584
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:08,240
 And then I was like, so then we let him go on.

585
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:21,240
 So suddenly they're saying like yours is set to like non transactional, but we're just going to run this message through to confirm whatever. And that's when I was like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

586
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,240
 Yeah. And that's when I was like, get get off.

587
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,240
 We have to get off. Yeah, we're done. We have to get the phone.

588
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,240
 And so we got the phone and I was like, let's go to the bank.

589
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,240
 And I was like, you don't have to come. I was like, Sarah, someone's trying to shake us down for five grand.

590
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:43,240
 I'll happily come. Yeah, I'll come to the car.

591
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:48,240
 I'll come in the car and like and let's let's let's figure this out together. Yeah.

592
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,240
 Yeah, it was a toll. We spoke to credit to the great guys at the bank.

593
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,240
 We just really were like, OK, let's just walk through it. Tell me everything.

594
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,240
 Sounds like a scam. I'm going to confirm this with right now. And just so you know, it's like a what?

595
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:05,240
 It sounds like what happened there, Matt? He said we're going to confirm that nothing has happened right now.

596
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:11,240
 Would you say this is a spoof? He just actually he didn't say it was a spoof.

597
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:16,240
 He said this is and he winked and he took his diet coke underneath the table.

598
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,240
 Well, oh, shit, that's the move.

599
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:27,240
 That's like the silent alarm. And he put it right in front of me.

600
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:32,240
 He put a second straw in the second straw.

601
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,240
 Shall we share the race to the bottom?

602
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,240
 Spoiler, Matt won.

603
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:52,240
 Oh, I'll tell you who else could win a race to the bottom against anybody, anytime, anywhere.

604
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:57,240
 And that is the following sponsor. Today's show is brought to you by, you know,

605
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:01,240
 if you guys want to do a fake commercial for Scoops Plumbing and Heating, I'm OK with that.

606
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,240
 This is from twenty twenty one Gas Man Scoop.

607
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,240
 Is he still I don't even as Scoops Heating and Plumbing still in business?

608
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:17,240
 I think he's changed it up to like I think it's it's a gas man and son kind of thing now, isn't it?

609
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,240
 I think so. I think I think you're right about the business anyway.

610
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:25,240
 Yeah. S.L.Y.D.A.T.F.O.W.I.T.F. not as catchy as fuck you in the face.

611
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,240
 I don't know what that stands for, though.

612
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,240
 Well, something about Scoops Plumbing, I guess.

613
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,240
 I don't know. All right.

614
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,240
 Or maybe it was something that we would have gotten if we had read this a couple of years ago.

615
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,240
 Probably. That's true. That's true.

616
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,240
 That's true. All right.

617
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:43,240
 Scoops Plumbing and Heating. It's time to get yourself some Scoop Plumbing and Heating, isn't it?

618
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:51,240
 Yeah. Yeah. That's right. What? What? You're too cold. Whoa. You need some firewood, huh?

619
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:55,240
 What? What? Were you too hot? I will bet some ice.

620
00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:01,240
 That's what I got. Got a truck full of it. Huh? What? Huh? Huh?

621
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,240
 I would like some firewood. That would be good. Yeah.

622
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,240
 Right. All right. Let's go to the woods then. Me and you. Come on. Come into my van.

623
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:12,240
 And also my my drink is a little a little warm. Is there anything you can do for me about that?

624
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:17,240
 Oh, hand it here. All right. Give me just a minute here.

625
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:24,240
 There you go. There's spoof now. Where? Where did you get that ice from?

626
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:30,240
 I spoofed it. Wow. You just spoofed out some ice.

627
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,240
 That's what I do. You put it in my soda.

628
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:37,240
 Fresh quality spoofed ice. Right for you. Enjoy your scoop a spoof.

629
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:43,240
 This is this is really good. Damn right. It's good.

630
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:48,240
 A scoop of your scoop of your spoof and helps the medicine go down.

631
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,240
 The medicine go down. Medicine go down.

632
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:57,240
 That's right. When it comes to your pipes, I'm not Mary fucking Poppins.

633
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:02,240
 Enter hate scoops at checkout.

634
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,240
 The price is spoofed.

635
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,240
 Have you heard? Matt's probably seen them around town.

636
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:16,240
 But Paul, have you heard about these electric cars that are the new driverless electric taxis going around Las Vegas?

637
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:25,240
 I have seen some. John and I, when my brother and I were in town, we actually saw some going around and we were kind of amazed.

638
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:33,240
 I remember when I was doing promotional work for opium back in the day, back in the day.

639
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:39,240
 And I was walking Fremont. They had them. They had them down at the end near Container Park.

640
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,240
 They did early tests of running practice loops.

641
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:49,240
 Yeah, they were doing practice loops and people could just volunteer and jump in the driverless taxi, which they're crazy looking things.

642
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:54,240
 They're mostly like open. Yeah, they don't have a driver seat at all.

643
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:59,240
 They're not set up like a regular car. They set up to two bench seats facing each other.

644
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:04,240
 And then the whole side of the of the automobile just opens up as big sliding doors that open up.

645
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:09,240
 And you just walk in and sit down in the bench seats and it takes you to where you're going.

646
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:14,240
 Oh, Winterscoop in the chat says Austin has these and says they're stupid and they cause a lot of traffic.

647
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,240
 They don't. They're not Waymo's.

648
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:24,240
 But they don't seem to cause a lot of traffic in Vegas. They really seem pretty good.

649
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:31,240
 I saw one pull up to Dunkin Donuts and it said I eat businesses and it just chewed right through.

650
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,240
 Just just the car just ate right through the business.

651
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,240
 Yeah, that is tragic. I eat businesses.

652
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:42,240
 Yeah, it is. It was like the Galactus of Dunkin Donuts Galactus.

653
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:47,240
 The automatic car, the world leader.

654
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:53,240
 But I saw one driving the other day. I was driving next to one the other day and it didn't have anyone in it.

655
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:58,240
 And so it was just an empty vehicle driving down the road with no one in it.

656
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,240
 They must send it on test runs just for advertising purposes, right?

657
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:09,240
 I think it was going to pick someone up based on where I was because I was on one of like the one of like the back roads in town.

658
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,240
 So I think I think it was just going like an Uber to go pick somebody up.

659
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,240
 Are they affordable?

660
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:20,240
 I think they're a little more expensive than a regular Uber, but I don't think that they are.

661
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,240
 I think they're made to be pretty affordable. Yeah.

662
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:27,240
 Look, I mean, on the one hand, I don't want to see like a crazy amount of jobs go away.

663
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:38,240
 Right. I know specifically there are women who've had a very tough time with specific Uber drivers and they all have a terrible one story or two to share.

664
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:45,240
 And so the idea of a robot probably is very comforting from from that perspective.

665
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:52,240
 Yeah, I don't I don't I don't think they're going to go rogue form of Ultron and destroy the city.

666
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,240
 Do you want to see my gear shift?

667
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,240
 Work my clutch, push it in.

668
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,240
 Can you please make sure it sexually harasses me when it picks me up?

669
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,240
 Can I spoof you?

670
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,240
 Can I spoof?

671
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:11,240
 I want to spoof baby spoof.

672
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,240
 I'm here to spoof your drink.

673
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,240
 Oh, God.

674
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:27,240
 So it was it was weird seeing it just straight up next to me driving along, you know, 50 miles an hour and just no one in the vehicle at all.

675
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,240
 They're just in the lane.

676
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,240
 It's a ghost car.

677
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,240
 That's a ghost car. You see?

678
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,240
 Yeah, because they're like wide open windows and shit.

679
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,240
 So you can just see right inside all of it.

680
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,240
 And it is really weird.

681
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,240
 Yeah, it was a little it was a little freaky.

682
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,240
 Kind of looks like a fish tank though.

683
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,240
 It does look a little like a fish tank.

684
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:49,240
 I like the idea of it, though, especially for cities like this, especially for like the strip area and everything.

685
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,240
 It just it makes a lot of sense.

686
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,240
 I think so, too.

687
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,240
 I'll be curious how it's going to happen in some way or another.

688
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:01,240
 You know, yeah, it's going to catch on, you know, whether it's this year or in five years.

689
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,240
 It's going to I sure hope it does.

690
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,240
 Until then, I'm so lonely.

691
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:09,240
 Jacob, have you been a robot the whole time?

692
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,240
 I've been a robot car this entire time.

693
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,240
 We've been spoofed by Jacob this whole time.

694
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:19,240
 I've been getting spoof all over your show the whole time.

695
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,240
 So caloric.

696
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,240
 I'm roughly eleven hundred calories per sip.

697
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,240
 I'll take the roughest eleven hundred calories you can give me, please.

698
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,240
 I'll loosen your teeth right up.

699
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,240
 Yum.

700
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,240
 There it is.

701
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,240
 Scoop of Monte Cristo in the chat.

702
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,240
 Yeah, that's exactly it.

703
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,240
 Yeah. What what company is that?

704
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,240
 Can somebody tell me what company that is?

705
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,240
 I think it's Google.

706
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,240
 Oh, it might be.

707
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,240
 I think it's Google company called Zooks.

708
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,240
 Zooks. ZOOX.

709
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,240
 Gadzooks.

710
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,240
 Oh, owned by Amazon.

711
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:54,240
 Oh, so just a different a different monolithic corporation, Matt.

712
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,240
 You were right about the monolithic corporation.

713
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,240
 Just wrong one.

714
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,240
 Got me again, Amazon.

715
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:04,240
 Beer Nun is saying we should put my cinema seat head as the driver.

716
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,240
 I was talking about that.

717
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,240
 Oh, yeah.

718
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,240
 I mean, that would be a serious feature.

719
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,240
 You'd have to pay extra for a solo ride.

720
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,240
 That's definitely happening, by the way, in Vegas.

721
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,240
 Oh, people are getting their bone on in those cars.

722
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,240
 That's definitely going to happen.

723
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,240
 I mean, I'm calling and I'm saying it's going to be.

724
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,240
 Sure.

725
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,240
 But they're all recorded, though, right?

726
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,240
 Like, they clearly got cameras going.

727
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,240
 Feature not a bug.

728
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,240
 Feature not a bug.

729
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:32,240
 I mean, I guess if it's consensual, then who cares, right?

730
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,240
 Oh, someone's going to care.

731
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,240
 Someone's going to care.

732
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,240
 Yeah.

733
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,240
 Scully's like, it's going to happen?

734
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,240
 It's already happened.

735
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,240
 Yeah.

736
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,240
 It's taking me a second to type that search in.

737
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,240
 Has anyone been arrested for sex in a driverless taxi?

738
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,240
 OK.

739
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:55,240
 While reports indicate some people are engaging in sexual activity in driverless taxis,

740
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:59,240
 there haven't been arrests specifically for this activity in those vehicles yet.

741
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,240
 Mostly just applause and showers of money.

742
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,240
 That's it.

743
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:08,240
 Mostly just people screaming, encore, encore.

744
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,240
 Get it.

745
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,240
 You filth nugget.

746
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,240
 Get it.

747
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,240
 All these people dogging in robo taxis.

748
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:23,240
 The galactic president says, challenge accepted.

749
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,240
 Someone has to do it.

750
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,240
 Yeah.

751
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,240
 No, baby.

752
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,240
 This thing on my phone's a signal jammer.

753
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,240
 You can't record in here.

754
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,240
 Yeah.

755
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,240
 No, no problem.

756
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

757
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,240
 It's a basic-- was it a Fermi cage?

758
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,240
 What's that thing called?

759
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,240
 That's it.

760
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,240
 A Fermi cage.

761
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,240
 What's it called?

762
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,240
 No, it's a Fermi cage.

763
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,240
 You got it.

764
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,240
 It's not a Fermi cage.

765
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,240
 A Fermi cage.

766
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,240
 Don't worry, baby.

767
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,240
 I got this digital cloaking app.

768
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:52,240
 Baby, I'm going to use this Fermi cage.

769
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,240
 You won't get pregnant.

770
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,240
 It's mine.

771
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,240
 Faraday.

772
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,240
 Faraday is what people are screaming in the chat.

773
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,240
 Faraday cage.

774
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,240
 That's it.

775
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,240
 No, Fermi.

776
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,240
 Oh, baby, I'm sorry.

777
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,240
 The people are wrong.

778
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,240
 My Fermi cage slipped off.

779
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:09,240
 You got to-- you got to go see the doctor.

780
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,940
 It's Fermi paradox, Faraday cage.

781
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:13,480
 You got to get a plan B. My Fermi cage slipped off.

782
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,480
 A Fermi cage.

783
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,480
 What would a Fermi cage be?

784
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:22,540
 The Fermi paradox is the reason why we won't encounter extraterrestrials or an argument

785
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:23,540
 as to why.

786
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,080
 What about a Furby cage?

787
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,640
 Oh, a Furby cage.

788
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,640
 Boy, that's--

789
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,640
 Oh, I had one of those in the '90s.

790
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,640
 It was great.

791
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,640
 Let's go.

792
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:31,640
 A Faraday paradox.

793
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:38,720
 On Twitch, Double O Groovy says Faraday cake.

794
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:49,040
 Been sucking all these cocks driving round in the Faraday paradox.

795
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,040
 Go on, Matt.

796
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,040
 What's the second line?

797
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,640
 Living in a Faraday paradox.

798
00:52:54,640 --> 00:53:01,820
 What's in my driveway?

799
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:02,820
 Fool.

800
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,380
 Yeah, no.

801
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:05,380
 That's coming.

802
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:07,520
 Somebody's going to really get busy in one of those.

803
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,200
 I think that's going to be the first issue that'll be popping up in the press.

804
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,280
 It won't be like the elimination of jobs.

805
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:16,600
 It'll be like too many people fucking in those things on Saturday nights.

806
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,600
 Right.

807
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,880
 But it won't stop it.

808
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:21,880
 No.

809
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:22,880
 Nothing can stop it.

810
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:23,880
 Nothing can stop it.

811
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:29,960
 Yeah, I'm not seeing any big reports about people having sex in them yet.

812
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:30,960
 Okay.

813
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,480
 But yeah, I think we can fix that.

814
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,480
 It's a pioneering activity.

815
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,320
 We can really get all the credit.

816
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,600
 There's going to be some exploration.

817
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,600
 Yeah.

818
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,480
 It's going to be great.

819
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,480
 Let's see.

820
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,960
 You guys want to do a little Scoop Mail?

821
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:45,960
 Yes.

822
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,960
 I've got a surprise for you.

823
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:48,960
 Oh shit.

824
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:49,960
 Physical Scoop Mail.

825
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:50,960
 Physical Scoop Mail.

826
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:51,960
 Zip-a-dee-doo.

827
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:52,960
 We got mail in a box.

828
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,960
 I love it.

829
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:54,960
 That's right.

830
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:55,960
 Message for you, sir.

831
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:03,680
 Oh, we got a Scoop Mail from Yarn and Sticks.

832
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,680
 Yay.

833
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:08,280
 Hello, you sexy face fuckers.

834
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:13,080
 I'm not going to read this whole note right now just because we're not all together.

835
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:17,640
 But basically, Yarn and Sticks has sent us some decorations for the new churn.

836
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,880
 Oh, cool.

837
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,680
 And they are fantastic.

838
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:28,400
 They are all knit-- hold on, I'll turn my screen thing off so you can see on the screen.

839
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,040
 But they are all knit ice cream cock and balls.

840
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,400
 Oh, hell yeah.

841
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,960
 And my question is, what else do you want?

842
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,200
 Oh, wow.

843
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,200
 That's amazing.

844
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,200
 Those look great.

845
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,200
 That's amazing.

846
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,200
 How adorable.

847
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:50,020
 And that's just one of them.

848
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,020
 How do you find this?

849
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,160
 How do you find the stitching pattern for that?

850
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,160
 Wow.

851
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,160
 Oh, that looks great.

852
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,160
 Look at that.

853
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,160
 That's just a straight up wiener.

854
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,160
 I love it.

855
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,160
 Yeah.

856
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,160
 And there's one more down here, too.

857
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,440
 But thank you, Yarn and Sticks.

858
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,680
 Yeah, Yarn and Sticks.

859
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,680
 That's frickin' awesome.

860
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,400
 Do you have an Etsy shop or something we can promote?

861
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,880
 Oh, that'd be nice.

862
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,080
 Yeah, those will go up in the new churn.

863
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:16,720
 This actually helps me-- I've been wondering, just to myself, just if we should, for the

864
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:22,360
 new churn, actually decorate it or-- I'm going to turn this music off.

865
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,520
 I've been wondering to myself if we should decorate the new churn when we move into the

866
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:30,840
 new churn or if we should do full green screen all the way around it so that we can just

867
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,000
 change the decorations any time we want.

868
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,240
 Oh, that's not a bad idea.

869
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,560
 The knit ice cream cock and balls makes me want to have them in the new churn.

870
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,560
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

871
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,400
 I think we should definitely have some green screen posters around.

872
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,720
 Yeah, maybe we can do something.

873
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:46,720
 Yeah.

874
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,720
 So you can just pop up some stuff.

875
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:54,360
 At this point, I think you just want LED walls or LED screens.

876
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,360
 So basically TVs.

877
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,360
 Oh.

878
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,360
 You can do whatever you want.

879
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,360
 We can do that too.

880
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:02,720
 I was thinking that it might be a little-- I was thinking-- my thought was it would be--

881
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:07,720
 Here, we'll just do that.

882
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:13,120
 Oh my gosh.

883
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:18,220
 So my thought was we just have a green screen wrapped around behind us all the time and we're

884
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:20,880
 just always somewhere different.

885
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,720
 And it could just be a ridiculous thing, just a ridiculous bit going on, like a visual bit

886
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,720
 going on.

887
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:31,400
 If you wanted us in green screen, then anyone could put us anywhere.

888
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,760
 That's what I thought you were going with it.

889
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:33,760
 I like your bit.

890
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,760
 Oh, we could do that too.

891
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,760
 Yeah.

892
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,760
 I like your bit, Jacob.

893
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,760
 I like the idea.

894
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,520
 I would suggest doing it with a fake window, like maybe even cut out.

895
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,520
 That's not a bad idea.

896
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,520
 A little square thing.

897
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,520
 Yeah, we could do that.

898
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,520
 Yeah.

899
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,720
 And make it like a fake window and then we can just put weird stuff going on outside

900
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,720
 the window.

901
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:50,720
 Scoop of Monte Cristo.

902
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,800
 It's just always going to be the Geekshock house.

903
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:58,800
 That would be pretty funny.

904
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,760
 That would be pretty funny indeed.

905
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:01,760
 Yeah.

906
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,760
 That would be fun.

907
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,760
 Yeah.

908
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,200
 But these are so great.

909
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,800
 And yeah, there's yarn and sticks.

910
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,400
 A screen for bucket picks again.

911
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:17,360
 Should we do that for the show this time, Matt, speaking of we're still in production

912
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,960
 meeting mode?

913
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,160
 For the Wednesday bucket show?

914
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,160
 Yeah.

915
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,680
 Should we try a bucket picks thing or maybe even just for the second show?

916
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:30,000
 We have found it increasingly difficult to broadcast from that theater.

917
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
 Right.

918
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
 Yeah.

919
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
 Yeah.

920
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
 That's the problem.

921
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
 There's no Wi-Fi there.

922
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
 We can think about something.

923
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,960
 Maybe we can do like a local bucket picks or something.

924
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,440
 Maybe we can do something.

925
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,440
 We might figure something out.

926
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,440
 Okay.

927
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,440
 That'd be fun.

928
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,440
 Yeah.

929
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,440
 Let's do a little...

930
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,720
 We are confirmed for the bucket show the Wednesday before seven and nine o'clock.

931
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:50,720
 Two different shows.

932
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,720
 Fantastic.

933
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,360
 At the Majestic Rep.

934
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,640
 I'm fucking pumped, baby.

935
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,500
 That of course is the Wednesday leading up to ScoopFest at the end of September here.

936
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:04,240
 Come join us in Las Vegas for ScoopFest, scoopfest.com.

937
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,000
 Head on over there right now.

938
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,960
 That reminds me, I have to reply to an email regarding ScoopFest that I completely forgot

939
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,200
 about until just now that I shouldn't reply to right now because we're in the middle of

940
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,200
 a show.

941
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,200
 Here's Jack vs. Nerd.

942
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,200
 Good narrating, Jacob.

943
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,200
 That was very nice.

944
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,200
 Very good.

945
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,200
 Very good.

946
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,200
 I was also looking for the right button.

947
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,200
 Jack vs. Nerd action.

948
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,200
 Oh, am I?

949
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,200
 Fuck yeah.

950
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,200
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

951
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,200
 Cock and balls.

952
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,200
 Cock and balls.

953
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,200
 Cock and balls.

954
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,200
 Cock and balls.

955
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,200
 Cock and balls.

956
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,200
 Cock and balls.

957
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,200
 Cock and balls.

958
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,200
 Cock and balls.

959
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,200
 Ice cream stock.

960
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,200
 Cock and balls.

961
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,200
 Ice cream stock.

962
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,200
 Explosion of spoof.

963
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,720
 We got a Scooperty coming at us today from Smart Scoop.

964
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:44,560
 It is the first time Smart Scoop has written us a Scooperty, so thank you very much Smart

965
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,560
 Scoop.

966
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,560
 Yeah.

967
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,280
 If you want to send us a Scooperty or a Price is Scryte Jack vs. Nerd or an Obelisk Jack

968
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,280
 vs. Nerd, HeyScoops.com is where you can go.

969
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,280
 HeyScoops.com.

970
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,040
 Make us a Scooperty just like the one we're about to play right now.

971
00:58:56,040 --> 00:59:02,880
 The categories are dead weights, or dead weight, video conferencing, educational TV, and famous

972
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:03,880
 departures.

973
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,440
 Matt, you're up first.

974
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,640
 I want educational TV, please.

975
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:14,160
 In the '90s, this former engineer from Boeing added the Science Guy to his name and attempted

976
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,400
 to educate America.

977
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,400
 Bill Cosby.

978
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,080
 Bill Cosby, the Science Guy.

979
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,080
 Bill Ma...

980
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:28,080
 Well, you know, it turns out that if you add water to a simple piece of frozen nitrogen,

981
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:34,320
 it'll foam up like that, is what it does, and also you can roofie the lady's...

982
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,320
 Science.

983
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,240
 Thank you, Bill.

984
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,240
 That was correct, Matt.

985
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,240
 Bill Cosby.

986
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,280
 The spoof, the spoof, the spoof was on fire.

987
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,920
 The spoof was on fire.

988
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,080
 We do need some water.

989
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,240
 Don't let it burn.

990
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:52,480
 I'll try Famous Departures for $400.

991
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:58,160
 After an incident with a writer, this actor was fired from Criminal Minds.

992
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,160
 I have no idea.

993
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,160
 I will pass.

994
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:01,160
 Paul.

995
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,160
 What's the category?

996
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,160
 Departures.

997
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:06,160
 Oh, man.

998
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,720
 I don't ever watch Criminal Minds.

999
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:08,720
 I have to pass.

1000
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:09,720
 I don't think I've ever seen it.

1001
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,720
 Matt.

1002
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:11,720
 Eric Danson.

1003
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:12,720
 Ted Danson's cousin.

1004
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:13,720
 Eric Danson.

1005
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:14,720
 I have no idea.

1006
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:15,720
 The Lesser Danson.

1007
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:16,720
 Thomas Gibson.

1008
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:17,720
 Thomas Gibson.

1009
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:24,640
 Eric Danson changed his name to Thomas Gibson.

1010
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,640
 Hold me closer.

1011
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:26,640
 Eric Danson.

1012
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,640
 It was because of the SAG issue.

1013
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:28,640
 Paul.

1014
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:29,640
 I'll try video conferencing.

1015
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:30,640
 Bought by Microsoft in 2011 and Sunset in 2025, this video conferencing software was

1016
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:31,640
 superseded by Teams.

1017
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:32,640
 Matt.

1018
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:33,640
 Eric Danson.

1019
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:34,640
 That's right.

1020
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:35,640
 That's right.

1021
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,640
 That's right.

1022
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,640
 That's right.

1023
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,640
 That's right.

1024
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:39,640
 That's right.

1025
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:40,640
 That's right.

1026
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,640
 What's the category?

1027
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:48,280
 2005, this video conferencing software was superseded by Teams.

1028
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,280
 Hangout.

1029
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,280
 Oh, hangout.

1030
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,280
 For hangout.

1031
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,280
 Oh, fuck.

1032
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,280
 It's incorrect.

1033
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,280
 It's Skype.

1034
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,280
 Ass my fart.

1035
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,280
 Poop my turd.

1036
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,280
 Ah, we just got demonetized.

1037
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,280
 Shit, Matt.

1038
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,280
 Educational TV for $800, please.

1039
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,280
 Daily Double.

1040
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,280
 All of it.

1041
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,280
 I will eat all of the Dunkin Donuts shop.

1042
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:03,280
 All of it.

1043
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,280
 I will eat all of the Dunkin Donuts shop.

1044
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,280
 I will eat all of the Dunkin Donuts shop.

1045
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,280
 I will eat all of the Dunkin Donuts shop.

1046
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,280
 I will eat all of the Dunkin Donuts shop.

1047
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,280
 I will eat all of the Dunkin Donuts shop.

1048
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,280
 I will eat all of the Dunkin Donuts shop.

1049
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,140
 I will eat all of the Dunkin Donuts shop.

1050
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:16,300
 This television series created and hosted originally by Carl Sagan and later revised

1051
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:20,920
 by Neil deGrasse Tyson, attempted to educate America about the universe.

1052
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:21,920
 Oh, shit.

1053
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:26,040
 I don't remember the name of this.

1054
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,040
 Let's see.

1055
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,040
 It's Daily Double.

1056
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,040
 Daily Double.

1057
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,040
 This is your Daily Double?

1058
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,040
 Oh, man.

1059
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,280
 Let's see, you remember that?

1060
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:35,800
 I can give you a hint.

1061
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,400
 Secrets of the space and time.

1062
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,920
 I can give you a good hint.

1063
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,640
 Give me a good hint, Paul.

1064
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,640
 Kramer.

1065
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:44,640
 Kramer?

1066
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:45,640
 Kramer.

1067
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:46,640
 Kramer.

1068
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:54,080
 Non-Dairy Kramer or Regular Dairy Kramer?

1069
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,080
 No, no.

1070
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,080
 Regular Dairy Kramer.

1071
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,080
 Seinfeld Kramer.

1072
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:00,600
 Michael, what was his name?

1073
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,600
 I don't care.

1074
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:03,800
 What was his name?

1075
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,520
 I know that's the hint you're giving me.

1076
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:12,080
 I know that I'm experiencing cosmic dissonance with that clouds over my brain right now,

1077
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,080
 so I know that--

1078
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,080
 Wait, cause of what?

1079
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,080
 Yeah.

1080
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,080
 What did you say?

1081
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,080
 You're close, buddy.

1082
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,080
 Cause of what dissonance?

1083
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,080
 Cosmic dissonance?

1084
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,080
 Cosmic?

1085
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,880
 So what was his name?

1086
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,520
 Oh, Cosmos.

1087
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,520
 Cosmos?

1088
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:25,520
 Cosmos.

1089
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,520
 Cosmos.

1090
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:27,520
 Hey.

1091
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:28,520
 No problem at all.

1092
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:29,520
 I'll just call it Cosmos.

1093
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:33,160
 Just a couple of very easy, no problem hints given to Matt there.

1094
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,840
 Yeah, his name is Cosmo Kramer is his real name.

1095
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:36,840
 Oh, God.

1096
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:37,840
 I was starting to think of his real name.

1097
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,880
 Yeah, you were trying to think of Michael Richards.

1098
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:40,880
 Michael Richards.

1099
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,320
 Kramer's real name is Cosmos, Cosmo, not Cosmos.

1100
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,320
 Yeah.

1101
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,320
 No, it's me.

1102
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:47,720
 Let's keep dragging this out more.

1103
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,720
 Let's keep talking about it.

1104
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:49,720
 Yeah, yeah.

1105
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:50,720
 I think that--

1106
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:54,520
 Remember how Kramer's name was Cosmo?

1107
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,520
 Amazing.

1108
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,520
 Speaking of Cosmo--

1109
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,520
 Remember that painting they did of him?

1110
01:02:58,520 --> 01:02:59,520
 How silly.

1111
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:04,960
 In shipping and aviation, what is the term for dead weight added to maintain equilibrium?

1112
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:05,960
 Paul Mattingly.

1113
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:06,960
 You're mom.

1114
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:07,960
 You're mom.

1115
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:14,560
 What's weird is now Michael Richards would just be able to tour after what had happened

1116
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,560
 to him.

1117
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:16,560
 Oh, yeah.

1118
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:20,040
 He'd now just be able to play specific comedy clubs where the audiences would cheer him

1119
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,040
 as a hero.

1120
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:22,040
 Right.

1121
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:23,040
 So gross.

1122
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,040
 Oh, yeah.

1123
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:30,840
 He could open for Gutfeld in addition to shipping and aviation-- oh, right, ballast.

1124
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:31,840
 That's ballast.

1125
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:32,840
 Yeah.

1126
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:33,840
 Ballast.

1127
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:38,320
 There's like a mine that works in an aquarium, and he does this bit where if he sees a woman

1128
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:41,820
 carrying a book bag and the guy doing nothing, he stops them and makes the guy wear the book

1129
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:44,200
 bag or makes the guy push the stroller.

1130
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,680
 Have you seen this before?

1131
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,680
 I have.

1132
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,040
 I think it's SeaWorld.

1133
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:52,280
 And I said, "No one shows this to Trump, he'll bam mimes."

1134
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:58,080
 All right, where are we?

1135
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:59,080
 Paul.

1136
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:00,400
 I'll try Educational TV.

1137
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,160
 For $1,200.

1138
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:08,560
 This British comedy quiz show hosted by Stephen Fry and Sandy Tuksvig-- I never know how to

1139
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:09,560
 say Sandy.

1140
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:12,760
 Yeah, I don't know how to say that name-- at different times is an abbreviation and

1141
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:16,840
 favors interesting and obscure facts over the traditional format.

1142
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,400
 IQ.

1143
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:23,320
 IQ is correct-- almost correct.

1144
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,320
 QI.

1145
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,320
 Oh, it's QI.

1146
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,600
 Fart on me.

1147
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,240
 Quite interesting.

1148
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,600
 Fart on Paul, indeed.

1149
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,160
 Boy, I'm getting lambasted here.

1150
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,160
 Matt.

1151
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,240
 You should get clues like I do, Paul.

1152
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,240
 It really helps.

1153
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,240
 Matt, the answer is Cosmos.

1154
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:42,440
 I don't think anybody else knew this one.

1155
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:43,440
 I didn't.

1156
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:47,520
 I knew that Penn hosted an American pilot of it, but I forgot the name of it.

1157
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,520
 Oh, really?

1158
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:49,520
 Wow.

1159
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,520
 Yeah.

1160
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,520
 It's a funny show.

1161
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,520
 I've seen it a few times.

1162
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,520
 I don't remember the name of it.

1163
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,360
 Since I'm killing on Educational TV, let's go for it.

1164
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:58,240
 All right, $2,000.

1165
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:02,560
 Produced by Jonathan Ross, Allison Hannigan, and Brooke Burke successfully, this television

1166
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:05,380
 program taught me that there are only four magic tricks.

1167
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:07,800
 The rest is just stagecraft.

1168
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:08,800
 That would also be QI.

1169
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:09,800
 That's correct.

1170
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:10,800
 QI is correct.

1171
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:14,440
 It would be Fool Us.

1172
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:19,240
 Fool Us, of course, on the-- I forgot what channel that's on.

1173
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,240
 CW.

1174
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,240
 It's easy to forget.

1175
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:22,240
 CW.

1176
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,240
 Yeah.

1177
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:26,200
 In my show, I say it's the highest rated show on CW, which is like having the best

1178
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:29,280
 Italian restaurant in Alabama.

1179
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,680
 It's not nothing.

1180
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:32,680
 It's not nothing.

1181
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:33,680
 Yeah.

1182
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:34,680
 It's me.

1183
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,600
 I'll try-- let's try Famous Departures again.

1184
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,960
 The first one went so well.

1185
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:42,880
 Successful stints on the Daily Show in the Office made this actor an A-lister.

1186
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:47,440
 He left the office in 2011 at the conclusion of the seventh season.

1187
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,920
 This is the second question, the one about the show that none of us have seen was the

1188
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:52,920
 first question.

1189
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:54,920
 To be fair, Criminal Minds is probably a higher rated show.

1190
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:56,400
 Is it the second?

1191
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:57,400
 Yeah.

1192
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,400
 Oh, that's probably true.

1193
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,200
 Steve Carell, anyway.

1194
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,200
 Yeah.

1195
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,200
 Paul.

1196
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,200
 I'll try Deadweight.

1197
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:14,680
 I know it's going to be the answer somewhere here.

1198
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:19,280
 What is the name of the exercise in which bodybuilders lift large amounts of weight

1199
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,560
 straight off the floor and hold it for several seconds?

1200
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:23,960
 A deadlift.

1201
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:26,600
 A deadlift is correct.

1202
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:27,600
 Dead Laszlo.

1203
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:28,600
 Dead Laszlo.

1204
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,600
 Matt.

1205
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:34,960
 Score check real quick, Matt's in the lead with 3,200, I'm in second with 1,200, Paul

1206
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:35,960
 is in third with -800.

1207
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,760
 He's had a couple of rough stints.

1208
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,040
 We're about halfway through the game and there's still one daily double left.

1209
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,040
 Matt Donnelly.

1210
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,040
 Wow, good recap.

1211
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:47,600
 I'll take Educational TV for 2,800.

1212
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:48,600
 I will take--

1213
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:49,600
 Not available.

1214
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,520
 Video conferencing for 800.

1215
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:57,180
 This video conferencing software rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic and continues

1216
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:00,440
 to be the most commonly used conference tool today.

1217
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:03,960
 That would be Zooks, the car, automated car.

1218
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:06,640
 Yeah, yeah, it takes you to all of your conferences.

1219
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:07,640
 Zooks.

1220
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:08,640
 Gadzooks.

1221
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,640
 Zoom.

1222
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,640
 Zoom.

1223
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:11,640
 Gadzooks.

1224
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:12,840
 We're on it right now.

1225
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:13,840
 We are.

1226
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:14,840
 We are.

1227
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,320
 And all of our Patreons are on it with us.

1228
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:17,320
 That's right.

1229
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,320
 It's pretty topical.

1230
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:19,320
 That's me.

1231
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:20,320
 I'll try Deadweight for 1,200.

1232
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,320
 Daily double!

1233
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:29,720
 Still for 1,200, the Rolling Stones have a popular song about a beast of this, a well-known

1234
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,500
 synonym for Deadweight.

1235
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:34,400
 Oh, you got this, Jimmy.

1236
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,960
 A beast of Mattingly.

1237
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:36,960
 Hold on.

1238
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:37,960
 Pause.

1239
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:38,960
 Pause.

1240
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:39,960
 Pause.

1241
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:40,960
 Wait a minute.

1242
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:41,960
 Beast of Mattingly.

1243
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:42,960
 Of course it is.

1244
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:43,960
 Beast of spoofing.

1245
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:44,960
 Beast of spoofing.

1246
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:45,960
 It's thirsty.

1247
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:46,960
 That's a good one.

1248
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:47,960
 Of course it's the beast of burden.

1249
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:51,760
 Yes.

1250
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,360
 Blue.

1251
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:55,360
 Paul.

1252
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:58,280
 I will go with...

1253
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,280
 I'll finish out Deadweight, please.

1254
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,280
 All right.

1255
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:08,480
 One half of Matt and Mattingly, this comedian and magician has been carried by Paul Mattingly

1256
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:12,360
 for so long that Paul's back hurts.

1257
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,760
 This is different than I thought it was going to go, Matt Nottingly.

1258
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:15,760
 It's a twist.

1259
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:16,760
 It's a twist.

1260
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:17,760
 It's a twist.

1261
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,760
 It's a twist.

1262
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:19,760
 Matt the Mind Noodler Donnelly.

1263
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:20,760
 Of course.

1264
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:21,760
 Holy smokes.

1265
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:22,760
 You're not wrong.

1266
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:23,760
 That's funny.

1267
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:24,760
 He's not wrong.

1268
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:25,760
 It could have gone one way or the other.

1269
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:26,760
 Right.

1270
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:29,880
 Matt, you have videoconferencing or famous departures?

1271
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:33,720
 I'll go with videoconferencing, please, for $1,200.

1272
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:39,680
 In 2007, Cisco Systems acquired this videoconferencing technology widely used by enterprises prior

1273
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:44,680
 to widespread adoption of both Zoom and Teams.

1274
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:46,680
 Pass.

1275
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,800
 Huh.

1276
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,280
 Pass to me.

1277
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:57,400
 I think Cisco was the company that bought TikTok, but that wouldn't be-- that's not

1278
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,400
 2007.

1279
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,400
 That's too early for that.

1280
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:06,400
 Oh, I was about to say, was this Teams, but no Teams is in the thing.

1281
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:07,400
 I have no idea.

1282
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,400
 Pass.

1283
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,400
 Paul.

1284
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:12,960
 Maybe Slack, but I'm going to pass.

1285
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:13,960
 Let's try it.

1286
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:14,960
 Webex.

1287
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,280
 God, I'm so glad I didn't--

1288
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,280
 Webex.

1289
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:18,280
 Webex.

1290
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,280
 That sounds like spoofing.

1291
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:20,280
 Spoofed.

1292
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:24,240
 That's what you're left with after you spoof, you get that little bit of web--

1293
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:25,240
 Webex.

1294
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:28,160
 I'm closing out videoconferencing for $2,000.

1295
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,640
 My dirty show is down to the Webex.

1296
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:32,640
 You can throw it out.

1297
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,220
 It's upsetting.

1298
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:41,240
 For as little as $2 a month, this audience member can get a podcast exclusively for them

1299
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,000
 over Zoom.

1300
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,080
 It's $3 a month now, but it's Matt and Mattingly's Ice Cream Social.

1301
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:56,280
 Oh, I was supposed to say the audience member is Scoop, not the podcast name.

1302
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,280
 Fine.

1303
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:02,960
 Paul, famous departures for $1,200 or $2,000.

1304
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,240
 I'll try the $2,000.

1305
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:05,240
 I don't know.

1306
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,240
 I still can't win.

1307
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:07,240
 Try it out.

1308
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:12,720
 After sticking it out for over 1,200 episodes, this Scoop has decided to leave the community

1309
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:16,880
 after it became apparent that the show is not for him any longer, but for the Scoops

1310
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,000
 who pay for access.

1311
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,880
 Oh, no.

1312
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:21,880
 What?

1313
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:23,680
 Oh, no.

1314
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:27,120
 I have news for that Scoop.

1315
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:32,960
 I often put out the Zoom links for all members, so actually, you can get it for free.

1316
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,480
 We just are asking generally for $3 in support.

1317
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:37,720
 Yeah, that's it.

1318
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:42,560
 But if you actually go to our Patreon and become a free member, you'll still get the

1319
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,380
 majority of the Zoom links.

1320
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:46,380
 There you go.

1321
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:48,480
 Yeah, we're not much of a paywall.

1322
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:53,840
 Way to fucking stick it to us as I've been actually giving it to you for free the entire

1323
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:54,840
 time.

1324
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,760
 I think this has got to be a tongue-in-cheek thing, right?

1325
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:57,760
 Maybe it's a joke answer.

1326
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:58,760
 I don't think so.

1327
01:10:58,760 --> 01:10:59,760
 Let's see.

1328
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:00,760
 We're going to find out in a second.

1329
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:01,760
 Paul, do you have an answer?

1330
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:02,760
 I don't have a guess.

1331
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:03,760
 Let's see what it is.

1332
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:04,760
 Smart Scoop.

1333
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:05,760
 Smart Scoop.

1334
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,880
 So apparently, it's not a fun answer.

1335
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:11,640
 It's just Smart Scoop leaving, I guess.

1336
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:12,640
 No.

1337
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,160
 He wouldn't send in a thing and then be like, "It's for you."

1338
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:17,480
 That's why I'm confused.

1339
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:18,480
 No.

1340
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,720
 You've landed on why I'm confused.

1341
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,560
 Matt, will they, won't they?

1342
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,960
 One of the most famous examples is Sam Malone and Diane Chambers from Cheers.

1343
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:31,520
 Turns out, won't they, as this actress left the show after the fifth season?

1344
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,520
 Right.

1345
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,200
 Smart Scoop.

1346
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,160
 Smart Scoop is also the answer.

1347
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:37,160
 Yeah.

1348
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,760
 Shelly Long.

1349
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:39,920
 Shelly Long.

1350
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,360
 Of course it's Shelly Long.

1351
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,360
 Good old Shelly Long.

1352
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:43,360
 She the best.

1353
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:44,640
 And that is the game.

1354
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,720
 I'm sure glad it didn't get awkward at the end.

1355
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,560
 Matt wins with 5,200.

1356
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,200
 Paul is in second with 1,200.

1357
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,320
 I'm in third with 400.

1358
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,440
 And that came to us from Smart Scoop.

1359
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:55,760
 Thank you so much, Smart Scoop.

01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:01,480

 Thank you all so much.

1411
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:49,560
 I want I just want to put a button on this and just say we probably haven't shown up

1412
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:50,560
 in a while.

1413
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,120
 You can always reach us over email.

1414
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:53,960
 Oh, yeah.

1415
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:58,000
 And our name at Hey Scoops, Matt, Paul and Jacob at Hey Scoops.

1416
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,440
 So if you if you actually want to talk to us about what we're doing, or maybe you want

1417
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:08,400
 to express your feelings or something like that, please write us.

1418
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,120
 We often write back.

1419
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:15,940
 And people send me emails on on the main line all the time that are that are just questions

1420
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:18,000
 that I don't read on the air.

1421
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,440
 So if you if you have a question or a thought on the show or anything, you can send it to

1422
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:26,240
 us over there and and we'll just reply back to you.

1423
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:29,040
 If we don't reply back to you, it's just because the email got buried.

1424
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:32,040
 Send it to us again or find us on social media.

1425
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:36,240
 You can DM us on whatever social media we're on and we'll get back to you.

1426
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:37,240
 Yeah.

1427
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:41,480
 And in the event, again, if you were serious, we decided to just try to do something fun

1428
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:47,480
 and lean in while we were homeless with our churn and knowing that we probably were going

1429
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:50,620
 to get another churn all ready to rock before Scoop Fest.

1430
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:54,960
 And so we thought this is like a fun way to shake up the format a little bit after twelve

1431
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:55,960
 hundred episodes.

1432
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:01,240
 But oh, Scully in the chat, though, wants to chat about Israel and Age of Consent laws.

1433
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:04,680
 Oh, we can just get that we can shift cleanly right over to that.

1434
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:09,280
 Let's get that up there. Oh, winter scoop says I can confirm that they reply to emails.

1435
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,280
 It's true.

1436
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:12,520
 Well, you can reach all of us on the socials in some manner.

1437
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:16,720
 We are we are remarkably easy to get ahold of if you want to get ahold of us to to talk

1438
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:18,980
 to rather accessible.

1439
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:23,520
 And we do appreciate the hell out of every one of you guys who contribute to the success

1440
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:30,860
 of this podcast, whether it is just listening or participating or actually sending stuff

1441
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:34,980
 through Patreon, whatever level you can do, we really appreciate it.

1442
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:39,080
 And it's I'm really loving this Zoom stuff.

1443
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:43,080
 I think we're going to keep this up for a while anyway and see where we can go with

1444
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,080
 it.

1445
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,080
 Yeah.

1446
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:46,080
 Yeah.

1447
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,080
 I mean, the show.

1448
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,080
 Yeah, we're always going to be changing the show up.

1449
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:51,000
 But yeah, we've got we've got the Zoom thing going now.

1450
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,300
 It is it is fun for us.

1451
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:55,880
 So we like seeing all of your pretty faces there in the Zoom chat.

1452
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:59,120
 We like seeing everybody interact with us over on Twitch as well.

1453
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:02,200
 That is TheBucketShow.com right over there on Twitch.

1454
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,920
 That's always up and running at the same time that we're on the Zooms.

1455
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,640
 You can always check us out over there.

1456
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:07,640
 And I hope you do.

1457
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:08,640
 I hope you do.

1458
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:09,640
 All right.

1459
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:14,200
 Maybe a lot of day scoop in the chat mentions, though, hopefully it was just a joke that

1460
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,200
 landed poorly.

1461
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:16,200
 Maybe it was.

1462
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,200
 Who knows?

1463
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,200
 Yeah.

1464
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:19,200
 I mean, they sent in a whole scooperty.

1465
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,200
 I think it was a joke.

1466
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,200
 And it was a brand new scooperty.

1467
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,200
 Like they just sent that in.

1468
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,280
 I think it was just a joke.

1469
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,280
 Yes.

1470
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:25,280
 Maybe it was.

1471
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:26,440
 Maybe it was just a joke that landed landed a little weird.

1472
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,440
 I appreciate that.

1473
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:29,180
 And that scooperty, too, was a good too late.

1474
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:35,560
 I'm already going for a long walk after this guy's is too late.

1475
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:36,560
 Matt's crabby.

1476
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:37,560
 Look out.

1477
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:41,800
 If you see somebody walking down the street with two kitchen tongs held over their head

1478
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:42,800
 like crab claws.

1479
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:43,800
 Going for a long walk.

1480
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:44,800
 That's Matt Donnelly.

1481
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,440
 A long crab walk to think about it.

1482
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:48,800
 Well, Scoopfest is right around the corner.

1483
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,400
 Can't wait to see everybody there.

1484
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,400
 Really looking forward to playing.

1485
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,400

1486
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,400
 Come check us out.

1487
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,400
 Improv with Matt at the show.
