1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
 Two reasons I build a Greenwood, I'm a massive fan of Mid-America, St. Louis Airport.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,320
 I love the convenience minutes from downtown.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,760
 The parking lot right there is just $9 for 24 hour parking.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,600
 Are you kidding me?

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,640
 And speaking of that, the affordability as well, great prices on flights at all those

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,040
 flights, all those destinations nonstop.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,000
 That's huge when you travel with kids like I do, and they take you to ideal destinations

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,520
 from sugar, white, sandy beaches, to the bright lights of Las Vegas.

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,480
 You want to find out more about Mid-America, St.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,280
 Louis Airport, go to flymidamerica.com.

11
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:19,560
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social?

12
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,880
 Yeah, I'd love to.

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,400
 Great, let's go!

14
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:44,240
 It's time for Madden Maddly's Ice Cream Social, sitting in Las Vegas, it's Matt Conley, sitting

15
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:51,800
 in Pittsburgh, it's Paul Maddly, sitting in Las Vegas too, it's me, Jacob the Audio Guy.

16
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,080
 Just got a video message from my friend, Alex Ramone.

17
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,080
 Oh yes?

18
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:04,840
 Because he's out in New Jersey at something called ProfitCon, nothing scratches me wrong

19
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,320
 about that in any way, heading out to the old ProfitCon in New Jersey.

20
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,320
 P-R-O-P-H-E-T?

21
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:17,080
 No, no, no, no, oh that'd be, yeah, I wouldn't have outed him if he was at ProfitCon, you

22
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,080
 know.

23
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:25,200
 Alex Ramone is the returned Profit board group in New Jersey.

24
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,520
 I think if anyone could pull off a cult, it's Alex Ramone.

25
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
 That is true.

26
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
 That is true.

27
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,480
 Let's not get it twisted, MJ can pull off the cult.

28
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,000
 Well he knows where his bread is buttered.

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,120
 Well MJ would be on all the merchandise.

30
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,120
 Profit like money, profit like money.

31
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,360
 Profit like money y'all, that's the name of this episode, profit like money.

32
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,640
 They should have just called the con Step 3.

33
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:58,600
 Right, we can start doing a Step 3 con, super expensive tickets, nothing really happens,

34
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,160
 it'll be great.

35
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:06,320
 He said, he was a magician and one of them goes, "Do you know someone named Matt Donnelly?"

36
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,320
 And he goes, "Yes."

37
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,840
 And she goes, "Well I know him but I really know his wife Sarah."

38
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,600
 I was really good friends with Sarah and her friend Jen and so he pulled out his phone,

39
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,640
 they made a video, shot a video to me and it is the woman who booked Sarah and I on

40
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,040
 a Valentine's Day morning show when we were first dating.

41
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,000
 Oh wow!

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 She was a TV producer.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 I remember this.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Yeah, she was a TV producer.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,240
 Because SJ and I were supposed to, I don't know, this was a different thing, right?

46
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,080
 Oh no, this is way earlier, this is way earlier, yeah, this is back in New York, like we were

47
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,080
 literally...

48
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,400
 Because there was another thing that happened like this in Vegas, that's what I was...

49
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,000
 Didn't you and Sarah shoot like a Valentine's thing in Vegas one time?

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Yes, yes.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Okay, okay.

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 And Jimmy and Robin were in it.

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,200
 That's what I started thinking of immediately, Jacob, I was on your page but then this is

54
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
 even earlier.

55
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,080
 There have been conspiring forces all around you for decades to make sure you and Sarah

56
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
 are a thing, huh?

57
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,000
 I think it's the only, it's possible but it's the only reason Matt and Sarah are together

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,440
 because the universe forced Sarah into it.

59
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,560
 Yeah, I mean the second one of her friends goes like, "Sarah, seriously?"

60
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,800
 And then she might just like come out of it like a hypnotist, like just go like, "Oh shit."

61
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,640
 "Oh God, what have I been doing for all these years?

62
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,000
 I have children!"

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 He's hideous.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,680
 No, no, so when we first started dating, we were hanging out, having drinks with our friend

65
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,680
 Jen, who we're still very good friends with Jen, Jen and Andy.

66
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,520
 Her husband hired me to do handiwork when I had that job destroying offices and painting

67
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,520
 walls.

68
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
 Oh, right.

69
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,720
 That's a good friendly close up.

70
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,120
 And Jen, Jen was in Miami with Sarah out here in Vegas.

71
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,200
 She later did Miami on Broadway, did Kinky Boots on Broadway, still is in New York, good

72
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,240
 friend of ours.

73
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,840
 Definitely tried to cock block us on our first date, which I always think is very funny.

74
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,280
 Just really not, not like she wanted me, but she just wanted the date to get awkward.

75
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,520
 She came and met us, she was at the bar and she got hammered and kept being like, "So

76
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,640
 you really like Sarah, you're going to mess with her, what are you going to do?"

77
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:18,840
 And really out loud in front of Sarah and I trying to destroy the date, all the chemistry.

78
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,200
 And I doubled down and go like, "No, I really like her, yeah, no it's great."

79
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,120
 And I just turned to Sarah and was like, "I really like you, I really want to keep dating."

80
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,440
 And so I just was eating all of her things to destroy it and be like, "No, I'm going

81
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,360
 to stay confident," and be like, "I like this gal."

82
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,760
 So then we ended up becoming all drinking buddies as I continued to date.

83
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:46,160
 And then we had beers with this woman, Liz, who is a producer, and she goes, "Oh, I need

84
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,320
 couples for a thing on Thursday for Valentine's Day, we need couples competing for a travel

85
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
 sponsor.

86
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,360
 We want to do a getaway or whatever."

87
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,720
 And so I was like, "Well, we're not close to married, we've been dating about like six

88
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,720
 or seven months or whatever."

89
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,680
 And because we'd only been dating for six or seven months, we crushed it.

90
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,360
 Oh, because you just knew everything about each other.

91
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,360
 We knew everything about each other.

92
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,240
 We knew everyone's favorite color, favorite movie, favorite whatever.

93
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,720
 All the things that you forget over time.

94
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,200
 Gun to my head, if you told me what Sarah ... I could not tell you Sarah's favorite

95
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,000
 color or favorite movie, and she could not do the same for me.

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,360
 Oh, Sarah's favorite color is blue, and her favorite movie is being John Malkovich.

97
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:40,400
 All right, Jacob, you and Sarah going away to Maui.

98
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,200
 Ann's favorite color is red.

99
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:48,720
 I don't know that she likes movies enough to have a favorite, but I don't know.

100
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,200
 Maybe Step Brothers like me.

101
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,720
 We both love Step Brothers.

102
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:58,560
 So we one tied with another couple, and so we had a tiebreaker, and I lost the tiebreaker

103
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,960
 because it's for a travel website, and they asked, "How many destinations does the travel

104
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
 website go to?"

105
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,580
 And I was like, "I don't know, a thousand?"

106
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,400
 And the sponsor was like, "What?"

107
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,600
 And it was like, "The answer is like a hundred."

108
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,040
 I was off by an order of magnitude.

109
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,000
 You paulmatically sponsor.

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,520
 I did, I totally paulmatically sponsor.

111
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:30,080
 So instead we got ... I don't know, all of them?

112
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,800
 Spin the globe and just hit ... Just three places in Arkansas.

113
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,400
 It's only three places in Arkansas that our company goes.

114
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
 Oh my God.

115
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
 Throw a dart at a map.

116
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,680
 I don't know who this guy is.

117
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,960
 So we ended up with, it was something like a $300 voucher or a $500 voucher or something

118
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
 like that.

119
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,960
 Oh, that's pretty nice.

120
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,960
 Second place, yeah.

121
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,240
 First place was like thousands of dollars in a real vacation.

122
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,280
 And so- But you probably had to pay taxes on that.

123
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,280
 Maybe, yeah.

124
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,280
 Maybe.

125
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,280
 Yeah.

126
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,960
 All I know is that I think it was like $300, because Sarah and I were so broke that we

127
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,840
 couldn't use the $300 as a base point, we had to use $300 as our budget.

128
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,840
 Yeah.

129
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,840
 Right.

130
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,720
 You now have a budget of $300.

131
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,960
 You've gone from having a budget of zero to having a budget of $300.

132
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,960
 Exactly.

133
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:26,880
 We did a getaway to a hotel just outside of Philadelphia from New York, and we spent a

134
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,560
 weekend in Philly.

135
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
 Ah!

136
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
 Perfect!

137
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,600
 That's pretty good.

138
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
 That's pretty good.

139
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,600
 The Paris of Pennsylvania.

140
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
 Yeah.

141
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
 Yeah.

142
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
 Yeah.

143
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
 Good Lord.

144
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
 But it was fun.

145
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
 It was fun.

146
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
 We did it.

147
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
 We did have a good time.

148
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
 Oh, that's great.

149
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
 Yeah.

150
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
 Yeah.

151
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,320
 I miss the days of just like, "Well, we're going to do something."

152
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,320
 Yeah.

153
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,320
 "We don't have any money.

154
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,720
 There's a hotel down the road.

155
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,720
 Let's go stay there."

156
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
 Yeah.

157
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
 I know.

158
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
 It really is.

159
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
 I do miss those days.

160
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,720
 Yeah.

161
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
 That was the plan in Vegas.

162
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,320
 When you're living in Vegas, what else are you going to do?

163
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,320
 Go get a hotel deal.

164
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,320
 Right.

165
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,320
 That's right.

166
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
 Yeah.

167
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
 Staycation, baby.

168
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
 Yeah.

169
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:15,800
 The weekend, it was one of my son's birthdays.

170
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,920
 Okay.

171
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,280
 He and his friend, when they were young, they used to always do joint birthdays because our

172
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:30,140
 friend Danny and Jason, their kiddo, there's no popular person on earth than their child.

173
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:35,880
 Every time they start saying a new expression, it's like, "Oh, you've been hanging out with

174
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,160
 Danny's kid again," kind of thing.

175
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:44,660
 Suddenly they want a new game, and the best was, "Okay."

176
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,560
 We're being coy about the names because it's people's children, but we know these kids.

177
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,760
 This is Danny's oldest son that you're talking about, right?

178
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,760
 No.

179
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,760
 They're the youngest.

180
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,760
 Oh, the youngest?

181
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,760
 They're the youngest.

182
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,200
 They think he's cool as hell, but he doesn't spend a lot of time with him.

183
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
 Right.

184
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
 But he's a little older.

185
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
 He's a little older.

186
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,200
 Yeah.

187
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
 Yeah.

188
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
 Their youngest son is the same as my oldest, and they're only nine days apart.

189
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
 Right.

190
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,880
 And so they used to do joint birthday parties, then different schools, different whatever.

191
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,160
 We finally decided, "Let's get together and do a birthday party."

192
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,260
 But I'm going to take a side note here to be like, I've now officially encountered my

193
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:18,700
 first ... I've been out of touch with slang that we brought up on this show, but my kids

194
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:24,680
 have now just started saying this expression that I am like, "What?"

195
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,680
 And they won't stop saying-

196
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,680
 Are they saying for shizzle?

197
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
 They're saying for shizzle?

198
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,680
 Can I take a guess?

199
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,680
 Yes.

200
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,680
 Is it 6'7"?

201
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,320
 Oh, they do that before every photo and I ask them what it means and they don't know

202
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,320
 what it means, but they do say 6'7" before every photo.

203
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,120
 I love kids saying things that they don't know what it means.

204
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,120
 It's my favorite thing.

205
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,120
 Yeah.

206
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,360
 Do you know what 6'7" is from, Paul?

207
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,240
 I have dug up a couple things.

208
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,240
 Yeah.

209
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,400
 So it's LeVar Ball's height or LaMelo Ball's one of the Balls.

210
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
 LaMelo Ball.

211
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
 LaMelo Ball.

212
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
 LaMelo Ball's height.

213
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,200
 From Charlotte.

214
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,000
 And then it's sort of like, "Oh, I would like to be that."

215
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,320
 You know, like to be 6'7" or whatever.

216
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,320
 Yeah.

217
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,780
 Like that would be cool.

218
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,800
 But it also can mean mid in certain situations.

219
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
 Okay.

220
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,720
 Like it's only 6'7" out of 10?

221
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,720
 Yeah.

222
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:27,120
 It's been co-opted to that sometimes, but also, Jacob, mostly it's people don't know

223
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,440
 what the fuck it is.

224
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,440
 They just say it.

225
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
 Yes.

226
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,760
 Like if it comes up like in a thing, "6'7", "6'7".

227
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,760
 Yeah.

228
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,760
 They just yell "6'7".

229
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,760
 Like if you guys take a photo, they go, "Okay."

230
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,760
 And everyone goes, "6'7".

231
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
 And they laugh.

232
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,760
 Yep.

233
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,640
 And we don't know why.

234
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,640
 Yeah.

235
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,640
 Yep.

236
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,280
 It's a reference to basketball players height and some other weird meanings that have been

237
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,720
 attributed to it, Jacob.

238
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,760
 So they say, "Bet."

239
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,760
 Oh.

240
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,760
 Oh yeah.

241
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,760
 "Bet."

242
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,800
 That's back now?

243
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
 That's back.

244
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,800
 Oh yeah.

245
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
 Bet's back.

246
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,760
 You know what else I heard that was back the other day?

247
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,920
 I was watching a video of kids getting their hair cut.

248
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,920
 What's that?

249
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,480
 You know what this kid said?

250
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,200
 Getting haircuts has been around for a while, Paul.

251
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
 Okay.

252
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,120
 This is a viral barbershop where the kids on their summer vacation can spin a wheel and

253
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,040
 get crazy haircuts.

254
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,040
 Okay.

255
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,160
 Oh, I like that.

256
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,560
 And they dare their friends to spin the wheel and go for the crazy haircut, like half shaved,

257
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
 half on.

258
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,560
 Or, you know, old man.

259
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,840
 You know, where they cut off all the back hair and just leave the horseshoe rim and

260
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,840
 all that kind of stuff.

261
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,840
 Good, good.

262
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,280
 So these kids, these young kids are getting these wild haircuts, this thing.

263
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,840
 But this one kid spun it and he got the half on, half off, right?

264
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,840
 Yeah.

265
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
 Good.

266
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
 Right down the thing.

267
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,800
 But then the fry tuck, that's one of them they're getting.

268
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:56,400
 So as he's getting it done, he's liking the look and he says, "Oh, that's tough."

269
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
 Tough is back.

270
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,400
 Whoa.

271
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
 Tough is back.

272
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
 It's back.

273
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
 Fucking greaser.

274
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,040
 I haven't heard tough in forever.

275
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,040
 Sorry.

276
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,040
 I have to go fight with the socias.

277
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,960
 Dude, like for real, tough.

278
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,040
 That was such a thing when we were kids.

279
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,040
 For me anyway.

280
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,040
 Everything was tough.

281
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,040
 Yes, it's from the outsiders.

282
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,400
 No, but no, it's even before that, it's like, "Oh, that's tough."

283
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
 It was like, cool.

284
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
 Yeah.

285
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,880
 I mean, it was written about in the outsiders though, in the famous book, The Outsiders.

286
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,880
 Oh, I guess.

287
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,880
 Yeah.

288
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,880
 And it was kind of immortalized in that.

289
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,440
 But yeah, I mean, it was around, the author wrote about a thing that was just around at

290
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,440
 the time.

291
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,440
 Yeah.

292
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,440
 Yeah.

293
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,440
 So my kids started saying, "Oh, bet."

294
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,440
 Like, yeah, good.

295
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,440
 Let's do it.

296
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,440
 It's on.

297
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,440
 Right?

298
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,440
 Yeah.

299
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,640
 Which my kids were already saying dubs or W, like win, like that's a win.

300
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,640
 Yeah.

301
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,640
 Uh-huh.

302
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,640
 Getting some dubs.

303
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,640
 Yeah.

304
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,640
 And also just going like dubs.

305
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,640
 Let's do it.

306
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,640
 Be dubs three.

307
00:13:53,640 --> 00:14:00,520
 And then it starts saying, "Oh, bet," well, a couple of things about that was one was like,

308
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,680
 we had the quintessential what happens with parents.

309
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,200
 I couldn't believe this conversation was happening because it's as written as every parent should.

310
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
 Yes.

311
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
 Yes.

312
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,320
 We said, "When did you guys start saying bet?"

313
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,760
 And my oldest was like, "I've been saying it forever."

314
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,760
 No.

315
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,760
 Forever.

316
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,760
 No, you haven't.

317
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,760
 No, you haven't.

318
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,400
 That is simply not true.

319
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,120
 We're very aware of your speech.

320
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:33,560
 We have paid, over the years that you have been alive, we have paid a lot of attention

321
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,320
 to you.

322
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,600
 Exactly.

323
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,040
 I was like, "What?

324
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,360
 No, you have not.

325
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,360
 You have not."

326
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,320
 That is simply false.

327
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
 That was '80s-

328
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,320
 You weren't saying it yesterday.

329
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,880
 That was '80s hip hop slang.

330
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,240
 Oh yeah, bet's been back for a couple of years.

331
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,640
 Bet's been back in a hard way for a couple of years.

332
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,640
 Crazy.

333
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,640
 Yeah.

334
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,640
 Anyways, we just had to do a joint birthday party.

335
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:06,080
 We went out to Sandy Valley, Sandy Valley Ranch.

336
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,000
 Oh, not the strip club?

337
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 No, no, no.

338
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 I mean-

339
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Oh, okay.

340
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 It was just across the street.

341
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Yeah.

342
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,880
 But it was actually driving up.

343
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,680
 I did see Ranch, Ranch, Ranch, and I was like, "Wait, where am I?"

344
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,840
 And I was like, "Oh, I'm in California.

345
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,840
 No bunny ranches.

346
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,040
 No whatever here."

347
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:34,160
 But you drive out the Gene Goodsprings Exit off of the 15 on your way out of town, and

348
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,160
 then you just drive-

349
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,160
 On the way to LA?

350
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:43,160
 Forever out in the middle of the desert, and then this is suddenly you pop a bunch of ranches.

351
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,240
 I think we would categorize it as glamping.

352
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,240
 Yeah?

353
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,240
 All right.

354
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,240
 Okay.

355
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,240
 Yeah?

356
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,960
 We had a giant teepee where the kids all piled in and stayed there or whatever.

357
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,960
 Good.

358
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:02,040
 Sarah, Danny, and I had the covered wagon, and we gave our friends, the younger couple

359
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,520
 with the two more kids, a mini house, full mini house for them.

360
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
 Great.

361
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
 Are these-

362
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,720
 Outdoor little kitchenette areas where it's a gas stove, propane tanks for showers.

363
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,720
 Yeah, perfect.

364
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,760
 So these are pretty permanent structures.

365
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
 They're not like tents.

366
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,760
 No, no.

367
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,760
 These are permanent structures.

368
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
 That's it.

369
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,760
 That's what I mean.

370
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,760
 Do they have locking front doors?

371
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,760
 No.

372
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,760
 Oh, yes, actually.

373
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,760
 Yes.

374
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,760
 Not the teepee.

375
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,760
 You can't lock down the teepee.

376
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
 Oh, really?

377
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,760
 Oh, shit.

378
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,760
 Not with that attitude.

379
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,760
 No.

380
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,760
 You're out, Paul.

381
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,760
 If you can't lock the teepee, you're not going?

382
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,760
 If I can't lock my teepee, I'm gone.

383
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,760
 I'm gone.

384
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,760
 Because I used to have nightmares about-

385
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,760
 That's the line.

386
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,320
 I used to have nightmares about that all the time.

387
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,520
 How about people breaking into your teepee?

388
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:51,680
 Well, people would break into my teepee, and then they'd break into my wigwam, and I was

389
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,680
 like, "Fuck, Doc.

390
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,560
 What am I supposed to do?"

391
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:02,920
 And the doctor said, "You're too tense."

392
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,280
 You know who else was just made a little sad by that joke?

393
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,920
 The following sponsor.

394
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:14,240
 Today's show is brought to you by Bobby Butt Stick's Blue Lingerie and Lingerie Shop.

395
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,720
 That's right, from Dave Sorensen in 2024, that's Bobby Butt Stick's Blue Lingerie and

396
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,720
 Lingerie Shop.

397
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,720
 Blue Lingerie?

398
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,720
 What's Blue Lingerie?

399
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
 Blue Lingerie?

400
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:30,600
 I think it's a type of restaurant, but let me look it up for you, Bobby Butt Stick's.

401
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
 Thanks.

402
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,920
 I'd like to advertise my establishment, but I need to know what I am.

403
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,920
 It's a Belgian bakery.

404
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
 It's a Belgian bakery.

405
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
 There we go.

406
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,920
 It's a bakery.

407
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,920
 Okay, great.

408
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,920
 Yeah.

409
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,920
 The Lingerie.

410
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,920
 The Lingerie.

411
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,920
 Yeah.

412
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,920
 Hello.

413
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,920
 I'm Bobby Butt ... I'm Bobby Butt Stick's.

414
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,840
 Where did this voice come from?

415
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,360
 It came from me, Bobby Butt Stick's.

416
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:08,120
 I started a French bakery years ago, and I had nowhere to put my buns.

417
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:17,040
 So what I decided was I would also sell lingerie, and I dressed my baguettes in badonkadonk thongs.

418
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,040
 That's right.

419
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:29,440
 You can buy the finest loaves and tinny holsters at my place of business.

420
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,360
 Bobby Butt Stick's Lingerie and ... Come get it.

421
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,360
 Lingerie Shop.

422
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
 Yeah, that's right.

423
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,360
 You heard me.

424
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,360
 You heard it.

425
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,920
 You know what I said.

426
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,440
 So also I have sweet buns.

427
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,760
 I have hot cross buns.

428
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:56,520
 And if you're lucky and you buy something very tantalizing, you'll get sticky buns.

429
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,640
 That's the Boulangerie Bobby Butt Stick's Boulangerie guarantee.

430
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,640
 Yeah.

431
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,640
 Oh, wow.

432
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:12,440
 Oh, I'm getting notifications from the ugly old woman in the kitchen that something is

433
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,920
 cooking and done.

434
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,960
 Hello, ugly old woman in the kitchen.

435
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,960
 What do we got?

436
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,960
 Oh, my God.

437
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,360
 The ugly old woman found the lingerie, and she put it on, and she's transformed it to

438
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,360
 a beautiful lady.

439
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,400
 Oh, she's gorgeous.

440
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,240
 We're going to go and get married.

441
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,240
 I'm sorry.

442
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,600
 I'm closing the restaurant and lingerie shop to spend the rest of my life with the ugly

443
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,160
 old woman who was my cook who only needed some TLC and some nice lingerie.

444
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,800
 Oh, boy.

445
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,400
 My life has changed forever today.

446
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:52,960
 Thank you, me, for selling the things that made the ugly old woman in my shop pretty,

447
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,960
 and I can marry her.

448
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,960
 Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.

449
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,960
 Don't enter Hayscoops at checkout.

450
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,960
 No.

451
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,960
 Don't enter Hayscoops at checkout.

452
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,960
 The store's closed.

453
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,400
 The store's closed for marriage.

454
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,400
 Yup.

455
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,440
 We're turning it into a house.

456
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,520
 This was an odd commercial to pay for.

457
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,480
 We charge a lot of money for these commercials.

458
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,840
 It's weird that they're paying for this commercial just to tell us that the store is closed down.

459
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:20,600
 I'd like you all to meet Mrs. Bobby Butt Sticks, AKA the ugly woman.

460
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
 There she is.

461
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
 My sweetheart.

462
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
 Hey.

463
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
 How's everybody doing?

464
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,600
 Oh, she's so beautiful now.

465
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,880
 It's a real pleasure to be here.

466
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,440
 Now, don't you give her sass, because she's wearing lingerie around the town.

467
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,440
 That's how she does it.

468
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,000
 It's the only way I look good.

469
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 That's right.

470
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 If she takes off her sexy lingerie.

471
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Until this, I was an ugly old woman.

472
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,160
 She takes off her sexy lingerie.

473
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:45,560
 It's like a magic spell.

474
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,120
 Did you guys watch any of the newest fight of the century?

475
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,120
 What?

476
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,520
 Oh, it's Canelo Crawford.

477
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,520
 Canelo and Bud Crawford?

478
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,520
 Who?

479
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,800
 I don't get to watch any of it, but it was the big fight that was on Netflix, big boxing

480
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
 fight.

481
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,480
 Yeah, it was the big boxing fight.

482
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:08,660
 So you had Canelo, the reigning defending champion, and you had Crawford, who came up

483
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:14,120
 in weight to match Canelo to do the fight at all.

484
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,120
 It was weird.

485
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,000
 They were talking about it because it's like the end of both of their careers, but it's

486
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,760
 the biggest fight that Crawford has had to date.

487
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:29,940
 Yeah, he's been a really, really renowned fighter and a crazy respected boxer, but never

488
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,240
 had any star power.

489
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
 This was his third weight class.

490
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:39,120
 This is a fight that they've been trying to make this fight happen for a few years.

491
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,560
 It was the first boxing fight in years, though, that has actually lived up to the hype that

492
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,560
 came into it.

493
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,520
 It was actually a really good, fun to watch event.

494
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,520
 Yes.

495
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,040
 Well, I didn't watch the whole event.

496
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,400
 The whole event was like six hours long on Netflix with all the pre-fights, and our friend

497
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,040
 Mitzi was texting us during the first fight and saying there were more people in the ring

498
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,120
 than there were in the stadium, because it was in Allegiant.

499
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,120
 It was in the huge stadium.

500
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,160
 They set a new attendance record in Allegiant Stadium where the Raiders play, 70-some-odd-thousand

501
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,160
 people.

502
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,160
 Oh my God, though.

503
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,480
 I really liked this fight.

504
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,400
 I watched the whole main event fight.

505
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:27,440
 You had all of this Saudi stuff, and the Saudi Crown Prince got introduced before the fight.

506
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,240
 They did a special thank you to the Saudi Crown Prince who was in attendance at the

507
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,360
 fight because I think he had given a lot of money to make it all happen.

508
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,360
 I think he was part of it.

509
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:47,080
 The crowd of 70-some-odd-thousand people loudly booed the Saudi Crown Prince live on Netflix,

510
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,800
 and it was pretty hilarious.

511
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,400
 This is a very strange thing that's happening.

512
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,160
 Did you guys see the announcement that WrestleMania 43 is going to Saudi Arabia?

513
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,160
 Yep.

514
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,920
 Dude, Tom Brady just signed a flag football thing to play flag football in Saudi Arabia.

515
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,920
 Good grief.

516
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:09,080
 I need a Saudi Prince to get into podcasting, improv, and magic like yesterday.

517
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,080
 Yeah.

518
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,880
 Oh, it'd be great.

519
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,400
 I don't know.

520
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
 It seems really scary, all of it.

521
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:23,200
 I mean, it seems like there is enough money involved that no one who is tempted by that

522
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,200
 money remotely gives a shit about the optics of it.

523
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,400
 Well, I mean, they got CM Punk.

524
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,480
 He flipped.

525
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,480
 Well there you go.

526
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,480
 There's the proof.

527
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,480
 What more proof do you need?

528
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:42,280
 No, but I told you about that a couple years ago when he was out on the outs with WWE,

529
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:47,720
 and he had an argument with one of the other guys who was going to go perform in the Saudi

530
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
 Arabian.

531
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
 Okay.

532
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
 Yeah.

533
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:57,320
 And he said, "Go suck a blood-soaked dick in Saudi Arabia," and he had to apologize

534
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,880
 for it this year when he went.

535
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,880
 Because he's taking money.

536
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,760
 He went to hell with money.

537
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,760
 Yeah.

538
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,760
 Yeah.

539
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,760
 It's weird.

540
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,840
 There just simply is an amount of money where we don't care about the murder of a journalist.

541
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,840
 That's it.

542
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,840
 That's it.

543
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:20,280
 It is, "I murdered a journalist, but I would like to give you money.

544
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:25,040
 I'll give you $50 million, and you just won't mention that I murdered a journalist anymore."

545
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:33,720
 Well, I mean, I still go like, I can't believe that Dana White being on film smacking a woman

546
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,880
 did nothing to him.

547
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,880
 Nothing.

548
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,880
 He didn't apologize.

549
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:42,840
 He didn't have to apologize, and it didn't stop him from being invited to speak at the

550
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,360
 Republican National Convention to speak at least higher.

551
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,720
 He gets these high-paid speaking engagements.

552
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,280
 It thwarted him in no way from accomplishing everything he wanted to do.

553
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:59,080
 It's because his name is Dana, and when your name is Dana, people feel like they can't

554
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:04,200
 pick on you about other things like beating women because you've already had too difficult

555
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,200
 of a life being named Dana.

556
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,560
 They just don't want to make it any more difficult for poor Dana.

557
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,560
 It's so strange to me, but yeah, that's it.

558
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:19,280
 We cared about Jamal Khashoggi for like six months, and then we're like, "Ah."

559
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,960
 The same thing ended Ray Rice's career.

560
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,960
 Right.

561
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,960
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

562
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:30,160
 All-pro football player did exactly the same thing that Dana White did, and it ended his

563
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,160
 career.

564
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,160
 Yeah.

565
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,160
 As it should, by the way.

566
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,160
 As it should.

567
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,800
 As something that should be an outlier, that's how that should work.

568
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,800
 Yeah.

569
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,800
 No way.

570
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,840
 You act like you still didn't draft Ray Rice on your fantasy football team in case he came

571
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,840
 back.

572
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,840
 Come on.

573
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,840
 Drafted him this year, motherfucker.

574
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,840
 This year.

575
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,760
 Don't call it a comeback.

576
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:56,760
 He's been here for years.

577
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,760
 But yeah, no.

578
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,760
 That fight was supposedly a great fight.

579
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,760
 I haven't watched it, but it apparently was very good.

580
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,760
 Yeah.

581
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,760
 It's really good.

582
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,760
 It's really fun.

583
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:10,680
 Watching this audio, watching him get booed, and he got booed while he was standing in

584
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,680
 the middle of the ring.

585
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,480
 They had invited him in the ring, so the camera's just on him, and he's got this deadpan expression

586
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,780
 trying to ignore 70,000 people booing him really loudly.

587
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:24,440
 He literally whispered to someone, it's like, "How much to pay the people to applause?

588
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
 I'll pay it.

589
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,440
 $1,000 a person?

590
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,440
 Yeah, yeah.

591
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,440
 Let's write checks right now.

592
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,440
 Let's do it."

593
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,080
 I think for the ticket price that was at that event, I think it's more than a grand a person.

594
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,080
 Yeah.

595
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,080
 That's true.

596
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,080
 That's true.

597
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,800
 Based on how much those people paid to be there, it's more than a grand a person.

598
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,040
 There were so many people in town.

599
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:50,520
 Now, how many people were booing because of Saudi Arabia's policy towards women and other

600
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,520
 disparaged minorities?

601
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,520
 And people that they fuck with?

602
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,520
 Yeah.

603
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,520
 Yeah.

604
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,520
 For some people, just out of racism, just saw a brown guy in a turban and were like,

605
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,520
 "Boo!"

606
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,520
 What do you think?

607
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,520
 What do you think?

608
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,140
 Like, it's not 100% to 0%.

609
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,800
 I was saying, "Boo-earns."

610
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:15,280
 I was like, "Oh, oh, was anyone else saying, 'Boo-earns'?"

611
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,400
 I was saying, "Boo-earns."

612
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,800
 Nick Newman in chat says they were saying, "Bruce," because he was Prince Bruce.

613
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,160
 Prince Bruce.

614
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,920
 Prince Bruce from Saudi Arabia.

615
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,920
 Prince Bruce.

616
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:31,720
 I want to hear that version of my hometown.

617
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:37,000
 You know, maybe the solution is, the next time they introduce him, they start playing

618
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,920
 old Ray Stevens, and he had the A-Rap.

619
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,520
 That's his intro music.

620
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,520
 That's it.

621
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,520
 Not just the streak.

622
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,720
 The Sheik of the Burning Sands.

623
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,120
 Oh my God.

624
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,480
 I had to, I didn't have to, but I did.

625
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,200
 I took my wife to the airport the next morning because she had an out of town gig, and neither

626
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,380
 of us really thought about it.

627
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:06,800
 She had a 7 a.m. flight out of Vegas, and so driving her to the airport, there was suddenly

628
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:13,040
 a line for miles of cars trying to get to the airport the morning after that fight.

629
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,040
 Oh, jeez.

630
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,040
 That early, too?

631
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:21,440
 We pulled in, and both of us were like, "Oh, oh, shit.

632
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,440
 This is a thing."

633
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,440
 And then I went to pick her up.

634
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,160
 Did you do the old Mattingly Donnelly flip around?

635
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,360
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

636
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,880
 No, we did all the back things, and we were in the truck so I could get off the road a

637
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,880
 little bit.

638
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,320
 We did the dirt patch and everything.

639
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,320
 We did the whole thing.

640
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,080
 But yeah, go ahead and pick her up the next day.

641
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,880
 It was just as bad, and I was trying to get to the pickup area.

642
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,080
 I'm on the phone with her, and now I'm stuck.

643
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:50,400
 So now I can't do any kind of flippy or go anywhere else because I'm stuck on the road.

644
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,480
 But I'm texting with her, and she's like, "The passenger pickup area is empty.

645
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,260
 I don't know what you're talking about," and it was all people going to long-term parking

646
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:05,260
 in the valets and all of the wealthy— People getting out of town.

647
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,260
 Muck to mucks.

648
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,260
 Yeah.

649
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,260
 Just getting out of town.

650
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,260
 Yeah.

651
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,260
 Yeah, yeah.

652
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,260
 That happened the same.

653
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,260
 Yeah.

654
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,260
 I went to pick me up, and I was like, "Passenger pickup.

655
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,260
 There's no one here."

656
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,260
 She was like, "I cannot get in there."

657
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,260
 And I was like, "Weird."

658
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,260
 Yeah.

659
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,260
 And it was just—I was coming in on a day when most people were leaving town, so all the

660
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:25,280
 locals were clogging up the affordable rates of overnight parking at the Vegas airport.

661
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,280
 That's right.

662
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,200
 The very affordable rates.

663
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,760
 The bad thing is there's one road that leads to passenger pickup in the A terminal, the

664
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,760
 main terminal.

665
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,960
 There's one road that leads to passenger pickup, but that road also leads to long-term

666
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:46,240
 parking and economy parking and valet, and then there's one fork off that goes to the

667
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,240
 departing flights.

668
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,240
 I mean, that thing was designed for when we—

669
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,680
 When you got all those things going.

670
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,300
 We were still calling Vegas hotels "carpet joints."

671
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,300
 Do you know what I mean?

672
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,480
 Like, that's how long ago that place was designed, and it's not—

673
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
 Yeah.

674
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:05,320
 I will never understand—I mean, I understand it, but man, they should have put that monorail

675
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,880
 to the damn airport.

676
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,000
 And now it's—Elon Musk is taking on the cab union.

677
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 Of course.

678
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 Yeah.

679
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,040
 He's trying to get the boring company to make it to the airport.

680
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,560
 Are there like two people left in the cab union now?

681
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,640
 That's a—but they are mad.

682
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,640
 Those two people are really pissed.

683
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,720
 Maybe the power has shifted.

684
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,400
 Maybe they are coming back, because I know there's been a lot of backlash with Uber

685
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,960
 and Lyft, too.

686
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,960
 Nah.

687
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,960
 So I don't know.

688
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,960
 We're not going back.

689
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,960
 That's not how things work.

690
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,960
 "Chaotic" is right.

691
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,320
 You got to play "Vegas Parking and Weather."

692
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,680
 We're crushing it right now.

693
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,680
 Oh, that's true.

694
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:45,160
 "Vegas Parking and Weather, no one does it better than ICS."

695
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,160
 Ho!

696
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,560
 You know who else knows everything about Vegas Parking and Weather?

697
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,560
 Hold on.

698
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,560
 We're going to come back to that.

699
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,160
 And that is the following sponsor.

700
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,400
 Today's show is brought to you by—nope, that's me looking up a laundry.

701
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:02,400
 Today's show is brought to you by Henry's Hobo Cafe from Dead Laszlo in 2024.

702
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,760
 That's Henry's Hobo Cafe.

703
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:22,600
 Oh yeah, all right, uh-huh, all night.

704
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,760
 My name is Henry, I'm a hobo.

705
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,760
 I got hungry sitting on the street.

706
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:35,640
 I said, "Henry, time to grab some gumbo and find a place to eat."

707
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:43,280
 So I grabbed my gumbo and my bindle, and I went on down the road to find a spot.

708
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:49,920
 I happened upon this old abandoned hotel full of ghosts and a cooking pot.

709
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,240
 So I asked the ghosts, "You want to work for me?"

710
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,240
 My name's Henry.

711
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,680
 They said, "We'll work for free."

712
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,720
 So now you can come into my house.

713
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,080
 That's not really a house.

714
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,740
 It's a place on the middle of the street.

715
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,240
 It's full of ghosts and me.

716
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,040
 You can get some old cooked meat.

717
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:10,840
 Come on down to Henry's haunted house, Hobo Havel.

718
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,840
 That's right.

719
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,320
 It's full of ghosts and also garlic toast.

720
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,120
 Come on down, get your fill.

721
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,720
 Henry's got ghosts that will kill.

722
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,720
 That's right.

723
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,800
 I didn't mention, but they're deadly.

724
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,280
 These poltergeists will eat your soul.

725
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,960
 They also make you into food and you are what becomes in the bowl.

726
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,100
 You're what we serve for lunch and dinner.

727
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,360
 If you come to eat, you get eaten.

728
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,340
 Do you understand what I'm saying?

729
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,280
 Anybody who comes to my place can kill and eat.

730
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,280
 That's what happens.

731
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,280
 I'm a cannibal.

732
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,280
 I'm Henry the Cannibal.

733
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,280
 Henry the Cannibal.

734
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,280
 Henry the Cannibal.

735
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,200
 Come on down and get eaten up by me and the ghosts.

736
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
 One of the ghosts is little girl.

737
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,200
 Do you think she'd be fine?

738
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,200
 But she's not.

739
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,200
 She's mean.

740
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,200
 She's meaner than anybody.

741
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,200
 Oh no.

742
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:59,120
 I hope it's not the girl.

743
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,960
 I'm just here for lunch.

744
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,240
 Can I get seated for lunch, please?

745
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,240
 Come on in.

746
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,240
 I'll be happy to see you.

747
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,240
 Oh no.

748
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,240
 Now it's a little girl ghost and she's murdering me.

749
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,240
 Oh, she's eating me.

750
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,240
 She's starting at my feet and eating her way up.

751
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,240
 Oh no.

752
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,240
 Oh man.

753
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,240

754
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,240
 There you go.

755
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,240
 What were you saying, Paul?

756
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,240
 Oh, I was saying, speaking of weather.

757
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,240
 Uh-huh.

758
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,240
 Speaking of biggest weather.

759
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:30,160
 How's our outlook looking as we approach ScoopHead?

760
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,920
 Oh, I think we look great.

761
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,920
 I think we're looking really great.

762
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,920
 Yeah.

763
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,920
 Here.

764
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,080
 I'll pull up the actual Vegas parking and weather.

765
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,080
 Let's do it.

766
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,080
 Yeah.

767
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,080
 We're in the middle of it.

768
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,080
 So yeah.

769
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,080
 Actual Vegas parking and weather.

770
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,080
 Uh, yeah.

771
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,560
 No, it looks like we are, oh, mid to low 90s, mid to upper 80s.

772
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,000
 That's great weather out here.

773
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 That's gold out here.

774
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 Yeah.

775
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 No, we're going to be perfect.

776
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 Sunny.

777
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 Sunny the whole time.

778
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 It's going to be so nice.

779
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 Very, very nice.

780
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000

 It is going to be a blast.

789
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,640
 I was talking to, uh, a performer last night that is going to be performing at part of

790
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,020
 ScoopFest and they were super excited about it.

791
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,920
 It is going to be so cool.

796
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,920
 I can't wait.

797
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,920
 I can't wait for you to have.

798
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,920
 I don't know.

799
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,920
 It's soon.

800
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:37,520
 It's soon enough that, uh, I am no longer getting anxious when someone mentions ScoopFest

801
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,120
 to me because I am already in that anxious cloud.

802
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,120
 There you go.

803
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
 We're there.

804
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,120
 We're in it.

805
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,120
 We're dialed in.

806
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,120
 Yeah, yeah.

807
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,120
 I just live in it now.

808
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,120
 Yes.

809
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,120
 Same.

810
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,120
 Um, yeah, yeah.

811
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,120
 It's going to be fun.

812
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,120
 We have some surprises on top of the surprises.

813
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,120
 It's going to be great.

814
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,120
 It is.

815
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,120
 It's going to be so fun.

816
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,120
 Oh.

817
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,120
 Jacob, hold my calls.

818
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,120
 I'm doing a podcast.

819
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,120
 Sorry, sorry.

820
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,120
 I'm busy right now.

821
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,120
 He's doing a podcast.

822
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,120
 Professionals, everybody.

823
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,120
 Pro aficionados.

824
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:09,560
 We were laughing the other morning, the whole family were having breakfast, and, uh, my

825
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:14,680
 wife told a story about her dad doing the pull my finger gag.

826
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,680
 Yeah.

827
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,680
 Oh, yeah.

828
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:28,800
 She said she pulled his finger, he farted, and she was shocked and upset as a nine-year-old

829
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,080
 girl was just furious.

830
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,080
 Like why?

831
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,080
 Absolutely not.

832
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,080
 That is not appropriate.

833
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,080
 You monster.

834
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:45,560
 We were laughing because I said, you know, it's funny now that we're older, you know

835
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,600
 that later on he was like having a beer with a buddy going like, man, daughters are different

836
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,080
 than sons, man.

837
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,080
 Yeah.

838
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,880
 Daughters just don't.

839
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,120
 Not the same thing.

840
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,640
 Like she was not, she didn't think it was funny.

841
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,640
 No.

842
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,640
 Right.

843
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,720
 Well, did she think she caused it?

844
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,720
 I think so.

845
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,720
 I think she didn't want that responsibility.

846
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,720
 Yeah.

847
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,680
 I think she was like, I don't want to have this power.

848
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,680
 Yeah.

849
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:15,040
 And, uh, I mean that also, I think, uh, for girls, again, I can't speak with any kind

850
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:21,560
 of authority or experience, but I've, you know, girls have a whole different road to

851
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:25,160
 go down when it comes to discovering bodily functions.

852
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,400
 Yeah.

853
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,760
 And if you suddenly throw into the mix that the pulling of a finger can cause a fart.

854
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,760
 Can trigger.

855
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,760
 Yeah.

856
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,760
 It's like one more thing.

857
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:41,000
 It's like, what the fuck is this flesh cage that I am trapped in?

858
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,240
 What kind of disaster area have I been born unto?

859
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,040
 How many booby traps are in this thing?

860
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,560
 You think this child was upset because she had learned something about the human anatomy

861
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,800
 that she didn't know previously?

862
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,800
 Right.

863
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,800
 It's just too much.

864
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,160
 This is one more fucking thing, one more fucking thing that can go wrong with human bodies.

865
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:10,160
 This is just add it to the list of the terrible shit that goes on with these meat puppets.

866
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:15,360
 Chaotically clumsy.

867
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,800
 What the fuck is the flesh cage I'm trapped in is when I yell every time I'm in a store

868
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,800
 changing room.

869
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:27,480
 No, that's not even what we're talking about, the reputation of women and wives watching

870
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,440
 true crime and true crime podcasts and true crime documentaries.

871
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,440
 Right.

872
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,080
 I was like, let's just straight up staying coached up on their most likely natural predator.

873
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,080
 This is all it is.

874
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:41,880
 This is all just, it's just absolutely just staying on top of, it's like why men watch

875
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,880
 shark week?

876
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,800
 The same exact reason.

877
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,280
 We're just staying coached up on our predators.

878
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,280
 That's all.

879
00:37:48,280 --> 00:38:05,600
 When I get in the water, when I put one toe in the water, I am no longer at the top of

880
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,160
 the food chain.

881
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:15,360
 I need to educate myself to watch shark week.

882
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:22,180
 Or in the case of that little girl, shark week.

883
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:26,680
 But I was like really, really meditating on this pull my finger gag.

884
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,920
 I was like, wait, someone did it first, right?

885
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,920
 Right.

886
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,280
 Someone was like, oh, I got to fart.

887
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,320
 I can't come up with the noise.

888
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:42,240
 Let me just, if I come up with a joke, I can fart in public no problem.

889
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,180
 This is, it's a little known fact.

890
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,760
 It is the second most famous thing that the Earl of Sandwich did.

891
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,240
 He invented the sandwich and he invented this bit.

892
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,240
 But that's it, right?

893
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,240
 How old is the gag?

894
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,240
 Right.

895
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,320
 Because that guy could be very old.

896
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:08,280
 I just saw a crazy TikTok with this lady talking about, she came home and her husband said

897
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:14,200
 he had a surprise for her and the afternoon before she had eaten a bunch of beans at a

898
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,200
 taco joint.

899
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,200
 Oh, no.

900
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,200
 She knew she shouldn't.

901
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,480
 This is the kind of humor that my wife does not enjoy.

902
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,960
 She knew she shouldn't, but she did it.

903
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,000
 She ate a bunch of beans.

904
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,840
 And he blindfolds her and sits her in a chair in their dining room.

905
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:36,360
 And she's sitting there and the husband says, oh, I'll be right back.

906
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,360
 I forgot something.

907
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:41,480
 And she can hear him leave and she's like, oh, I got to let one go.

908
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:48,200
 So she lets out a toot and then and she's like, oh boy, that's a that's a that's a real

909
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,200
 winner there.

910
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,800
 That's a woof.

911
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,200
 And then she does another one and she still doesn't hear him come back yet.

912
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,880
 And then she has like three or four and she's like, oh, geez.

913
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:05,920
 So she keeps the blindfold on, stands up and gets like a pillow from her chair and starts

914
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:13,140
 woofing it around to try and dispel the stink, you know, and then sits back down.

915
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:17,040
 And then finally, her husband comes back in, she's still worried that he's going to smell

916
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,040
 it or whatever.

917
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:23,520
 He takes a blindfold off and it's her whole family there for a surprise birthday party.

918
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,520
 Yeah.

919
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,120
 She's been sitting there cutting biscuits.

920
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:36,240
 Oh, man, what is this unsliced cheese doing here?

921
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,760
 Oh, my Lord, can you imagine?

922
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,760
 Can you imagine?

923
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:47,320
 Oh, according to this, the first time the pull my finger gag happened on film was in

924
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,320
 1959.

925
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,320
 Oh, right.

926
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:56,960
 But I'm saying we're going to get some like, you know, oh, yeah, half a man out of ice

927
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,040
 one day to revive him.

928
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,560
 Someone's going to do the pull my finger gag in front of him while they're studying him

929
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,560
 in a cage or something.

930
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,800
 And he's going to be like, you guys are still doing that gag?

931
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,800
 Yeah.

932
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,800
 Is that gag still alive?

933
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,760
 And we'll be like, yes, unfrozen Brendan Fraser, it is still alive.

934
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,600
 No, like we as comedians, we don't, you know, we say like, oh, we do is silly.

935
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,600
 It doesn't matter.

936
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,600
 We don't change the world or anything.

937
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,880
 We just make that make the day a little easier for everybody.

938
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,880
 Right.

939
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,360
 That guy changed the fucking world.

940
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,460
 That guy created a fart joke.

941
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:33,320
 For better or worse, just as just the world is a different place from the one that he

942
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,320
 found.

943
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,240
 It's the truth.

944
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,660
 Yeah.

945
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,560
 He left it better than he found it.

946
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,560
 Yeah.

947
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,560
 And Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

948
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,560
 Yeah.

949
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,560
 I put that right neck and neck.

950
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:51,200
 Basically the same.

951
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,200
 Jesus.

952
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,200
 So I've been watching.

953
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,200
 Yes.

954
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,120
 I've been watching a lot of weird reality TV lately.

955
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,120
 Okay.

956
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,880
 Especially bad reality competition shows.

957
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:06,640
 This has become my late night watch while I'm sending emails and half paying attention

958
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,640
 to it.

959
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,640
 But it is fantastic.

960
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,640
 Okay.

961
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,720
 I've been watching one.

962
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:17,120
 I finished watching it now on Netflix called Outlast, which is they just take a bunch of

963
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:24,320
 people and drop them in the Alaskan wilderness and they have to form teams and they survive

964
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,460
 out in the Alaskan wilderness until the other teams give up.

965
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,880
 And so it's an open-ended game.

966
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,300
 It lasts as long as it lasts until enough people give up.

967
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,480
 And then there's a group that wins.

968
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:46,380
 There is one dude who was on this show though that all I could think of the entire time

969
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:54,720
 watching him was if Paul Mattingly were really good at outdoor survival, this would be him.

970
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,760
 That's a big capital I, capital F pal.

971
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,760
 It sure is.

972
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,760
 It sure is.

973
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,400
 It's a whole big old if, but I'm telling you, if Paul Mattingly had made a couple of different

974
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:10,560
 decisions in his life and we're now just an outdoor survivalist guy, this would be him.

975
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,760
 And I'm going to tell you why.

976
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,580
 So to win the game, one of the rules, one of the only rules is to win the game, you

977
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,560
 have to be on a team.

978
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:24,640
 So a team has to accept you in to be even for it to even be possible for you to win

979
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,640
 this game.

980
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,740
 Got it.

981
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:30,560
 So at one point he is changing teams.

982
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,120
 All of his team is gone.

983
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:37,560
 He's the last person remaining on his team and he's going to change teams and he knows

984
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:43,280
 that one of the other teams is going to come along and loot his camp that he and his team

985
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,980
 had built up for themselves.

986
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:50,340
 They're going to come loot his camp and get his resources and everything after he leaves

987
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:53,620
 taking what he can to the, to the new camp.

988
00:43:53,620 --> 00:44:00,280
 And so this motherfucker in, I believe what would be the ultimate Paul move burns his

989
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:04,600
 house down so that the other people can't come in and get it.

990
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,880
 Now hold on, you think that's what I would do?

991
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:13,360
 I think if you had made the turns in life to become this person at all, I think you

992
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,100
 might have a little bit of this in you.

993
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,100
 Oh, I don't know.

994
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,240
 I think you'd be, I think you'd be like it go cause it's a game.

995
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,120
 So it's all, it's all a game and it's a game that now people are taking a little too seriously

996
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,320
 because they're in it and they've been doing it for weeks and they're starving and they're

997
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,780
 outside and so they've, you know, part of their brain has forgotten that it's a game

998
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:33,920
 and that it's not really real.

999
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,920
 I don't know.

1000
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,780
 This guy just struck me as, I didn't dislike him either by the way.

1001
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:42,420
 Was he a, when I watched him, when I watched him burning his house down, what made you

1002
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,300
 think of me?

1003
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:51,160
 It was, it was his mannerisms and just everything about him that it was, cause it really wasn't,

1004
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,800
 there wasn't an A to A line to draw between the two of you because you're, you're so,

1005
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,020
 you're so very different.

1006
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,520
 You just think this is alternate universe me.

1007
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,240
 I think it's just alternate universe you.

1008
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:08,000
 And he was, I should say too, I should say too that I liked this person.

1009
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 Okay.

1010
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,800
 So he was, he was burning his house down.

1011
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,800
 I got it.

1012
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,800
 Yeah.

1013
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,800
 I understood why he was doing it.

1014
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,800
 Everything about it.

1015
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,540
 I was like, this is, I like this guy, but he is on a different wavelength entirely from

1016
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,540
 where I am.

1017
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:27,600
 I'd like to think that if I really put my mind to it, I could survive in the wilderness.

1018
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,160
 Oh, I think you could.

1019
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,240
 With a couple of tools and whatnot.

1020
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,720
 I don't think you're a useless person.

1021
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,720
 I would hate it.

1022
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,720
 Yes, you'd be so mad.

1023
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,720
 I would hate it so bad.

1024
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,640
 You'd be so mad the entire time.

1025
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,640
 That was just it.

1026
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,080
 That's why I quit Boy Scouts after getting Life Scout.

1027
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:45,400
 I was like, I can't in good conscience even go through with this Eagle Scout shit cause

1028
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,320
 I despise the out of doors.

1029
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,120
 I can't in good conscience become an Eagle Scout.

1030
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:54,240
 That really, as a kid, I was just like, I was like, this is like, this goes against who

1031
00:45:54,240 --> 00:46:00,600
 I am as a human to even purport to enjoy camping in the least.

1032
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,600
 I don't.

1033
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,600
 I hate it.

1034
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,600
 I hate everything about it.

1035
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,600
 So, yeah.

1036
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,600
 I want you to watch this show, Paul.

1037
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,240
 You should come to Sandy Valley, Paul.

1038
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,240
 It's outlast.

1039
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,720
 Oh, I'm sure I'd have a great time.

1040
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,840
 Paul is a clamper.

1041
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:17,080
 Temperature controlled covered wagon.

1042
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:22,960
 I don't think I've been camping in 30 years.

1043
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,800
 Yeah.

1044
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,800
 I could say...

1045
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,400
 Is it 30 years ago you drowned that kid in a lake?

1046
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,400
 Was it that long ago?

1047
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,400
 Holy shit.

1048
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,600
 I didn't consider that a camping trip.

1049
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,160
 I didn't consider that a camping trip.

1050
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,160
 Oh, okay.

1051
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,160
 That was just an afternoon.

1052
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,160
 Oh, that's true.

1053
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,160
 Yeah, it was just an afternoon.

1054
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,160
 Yeah, it's true.

1055
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,160
 You didn't sleep outdoors then.

1056
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,160
 No.

1057
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,160
 You just were outdoors.

1058
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,160
 I was just working.

1059
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,160
 Yeah, that's true.

1060
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,680
 You're just taking out the trash.

1061
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,680
 Yeah.

1062
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,640
 My wife asked me to take out the trash, so here I go.

1063
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,640
 That's good Saudi money, man.

1064
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,640
 You can't pass up that Saudi money.

1065
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,200
 I didn't realize she hated that neighbor kid so much.

1066
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,760
 Saudi prince was like, "Drown that kid."

1067
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,760
 You got it, Paul.

1068
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,760
 I was like, "No way."

1069
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,760
 And he's like, "Here's a dump truck full of cash."

1070
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,760
 I'm like, "Okay."

1071
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,560
 Do I get to keep the dump truck?

1072
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,560
 Yes.

1073
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,560
 I'm in.

1074
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,560
 It's a tax write-off.

1075
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,560
 You had me a dump truck.

1076
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,560
 Yeah.

1077
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,560
 I don't know.

1078
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,560
 I just don't...

1079
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,560
 I don't like camp.

1080
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,440
 I don't like anything about camping.

1081
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:25,920
 Well, when we got home, we borrowed sleeping bags from my neighbor, Gary, who loves to

1082
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,920
 camp.

1083
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:31,200
 He takes his own tent and sleeping bag on a motorcycle and just goes out in any direction,

1084
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,200
 just finds places to camp.

1085
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,200
 He loves it.

1086
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,560
 Oh, I've got a sleeping bag you guys can borrow.

1087
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,440
 I've got a big double, like a two-person sleeping bag if you guys ever need it.

1088
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,440
 We did.

1089
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,440
 We should have gotten it.

1090
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,440
 Yeah.

1091
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,440
 And it's zero degree too.

1092
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,440
 It's fucking hot.

1093
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,440
 Okay.

1094
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,440
 Yeah.

1095
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,440
 Perfect.

1096
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,200
 I'm really surprised Paul hates camping.

1097
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,200
 Leon Casab.

1098
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,040
 Leon, he's talking about that.

1099
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,720
 It's the only time I've ever been able to read sarcasm.

1100
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,080
 In the chat, no problem.

1101
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,080
 Yeah.

1102
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,080
 Yeah.

1103
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,080
 Now, you know what I...

1104
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,320
 Do you know what I do like?

1105
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,320
 What's that?

1106
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,720
 The idea of having a sleepover.

1107
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,560
 Oh, okay.

1108
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,560
 In the house.

1109
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:18,680
 I like the idea of people setting up sleeping bags on a nice cushioned floor, watching TV

1110
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:22,120
 until you fall asleep, playing video games until the wee hours.

1111
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,120
 I like that.

1112
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:28,120
 Speaking of camping, I was just talking to somebody the other day about Airbnbs, and

1113
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,560
 they were saying that they had had some bad luck with Airbnbs.

1114
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:35,600
 And I said, "Yo, Matt and Paul and I had bad luck with an Airbnb one time.

1115
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,600
 I think it was in Jersey."

1116
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,600
 Yes.

1117
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,360
 And it had been listed as like a three-bedroom.

1118
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,400
 Yes.

1119
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:46,960
 And we got there, and one of the bedrooms was just a child's room with a pair of like

1120
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,280
 Ninja Turtle bunk beds or something.

1121
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,280
 Yes.

1122
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,560
 Now, that was Austin.

1123
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,200
 We would have been so aggravated.

1124
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,200
 Was that Austin?

1125
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,200
 Oh, there you go.

1126
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,200
 Yeah, because Brushwood paid that.

1127
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,600
 We would have been so aggravated if it wasn't for the fact that Paul was there and was more

1128
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,960
 than happy to sleep in the children's bunk beds.

1129
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:02,960
 Oh, yes.

1130
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,100
 The Turtle bunk beds were in Austin.

1131
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:07,880
 We did have bad luck with Airbnbs in Jersey.

1132
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,200
 We had a weird Airbnb in Jersey.

1133
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,200
 I think I'm conflating it.

1134
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,640
 We were on the third floor of a house, and the people were definitely living in the house

1135
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,640
 below.

1136
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,640
 We were trying to leave.

1137
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,640
 Oh, that was just the three of us.

1138
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,640
 Yeah.

1139
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,840
 We were in and out of that place in like seven hours.

1140
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,840
 Yes.

1141
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:21,840
 Yeah.

1142
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:25,640
 We used that place to barely sleep and take a shower.

1143
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:30,480
 That's because we took an overnight red-eye flight home on Spirit Airlines on their deck

1144
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,240
 chair that they call first class.

1145
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,240
 Yeah.

1146
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,240
 Yeah.

1147
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,240
 Oh, yeah.

1148
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:43,440
 We were trying to leave to go to Tierney's, and it was like they had a birthday dinner

1149
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,440
 or something, like one of their kids or something.

1150
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,440
 Yes.

1151
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,440
 We couldn't leave.

1152
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,320
 We felt like we were going to their backyard.

1153
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,320
 We had to leave.

1154
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:57,040
 We had to walk through their children's birthday party to get to our car.

1155
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,560
 We had to walk through the party.

1156
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,560
 It was terrible.

1157
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,560
 No good.

1158
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,560
 No good.

1159
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,560
 Oh, so funny.

1160
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:06,920
 We returned our sleeping bags to Gary, he goes, "Do you like it?"

1161
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,920
 And they both go, "Yeah.

1162
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:08,920
 Yeah.

1163
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,920
 We love it.

1164
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,920
 It was our first time camping."

1165
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:11,920
 And I was like, "Oh.

1166
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,280
 Oh.

1167
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,280
 Bad dad alert.

1168
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,280
 Bad dad alert."

1169
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:21,680
 It did not occur to me that that was the first time camping at all.

1170
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:26,160
 And that the first time camping was this really nice Sandy Valley Ranch glamping.

1171
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,800
 I was going to say you have ruined your kids now.

1172
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,240
 That's not bad dad alert.

1173
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,240
 What are they?

1174
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,240
 Eleven and ten?

1175
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,240
 Seven and nine?

1176
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,240
 What?

1177
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,240
 They're twenty-four.

1178
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,240
 No.

1179
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,240
 No.

1180
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,600
 You take kids much younger camping.

1181
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,000
 You risk a hawk stealing them.

1182
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,440
 It's not, you know, this is not...

1183
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,440
 That is true.

1184
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,440
 Yeah.

1185
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,440
 That is true.

1186
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,440
 Good dad alert.

1187
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,440
 Good dad alert, if you ask me.

1188
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,440
 Exactly.

1189
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,440
 Snakes could eat them.

1190
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,440
 Hawks could snatch them.

1191
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,440
 How many of your children got stolen by hawks, Matt?

1192
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,760
 That's zero.

1193
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,760
 Good dad alert.

1194
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:03,480
 I mean, seriously, you watch some of these, what was it, the missing 411 stuff?

1195
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,080
 All the people that go missing in the woods?

1196
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,080
 That's scary.

1197
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,080
 Yeah.

1198
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,080
 All those hawks.

1199
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,080
 Paul's drawing from experience.

1200
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,560
 He went to drown that kid and a hawk took him away and Paul was like, "Fair dinkum.

1201
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,560
 Fair dinkum."

1202
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,560
 I had...

1203
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,560
 Well, he pulled the...

1204
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,560
 "Fair dinkum."

1205
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,720
 The kid grabbed him out of the water thinking he was a fish, I guess, and the kid wasn't

1206
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:20,720
 drowned.

1207
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,880
 So I was like, "Ah."

1208
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:27,360
 So I had to train on the hawk until it got high enough and I was like, "All right.

1209
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,880
 This fall is going to be fatal."

1210
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:34,640
 So then I shot the hawk, he dropped the kid, bam, done and done.

1211
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:40,620
 You know, that was the original ending for Lord of the Rings.

1212
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:41,620
 Almost exactly.

1213
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:45,080
 It was Gandalf up on the eagle, bang.

1214
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,080
 One shot.

1215
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,680
 There's stories like that that make me think you could run UFC, Paul.

1216
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:49,680
 No problem.

1217
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,680
 Oh boy.

1218
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,680
 Oh boy.

1219
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,680
 Oh boy.

1220
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,680
 Oh boy.

1221
00:51:53,680 --> 00:52:00,280
 Well, I guess you get that government contract, do the big fight on the West Lawn.

1222
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,280
 Oh right.

1223
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,280
 Fuck.

1224
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,880
 That is actually happening.

1225
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,840
 That is going to be...

1226
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,000
 That's the thing that's so fucking crazy.

1227
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,400
 That's a big part of why I'm...

1228
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,400
 Yeah.

1229
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,400
 That's it.

1230
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,400
 Well...

1231
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,400
 That's the one thing.

1232
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,400
 I...

1233
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,080
 I can't really watch wrestling anymore.

1234
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,800
 I've stopped listening to my wrestling podcasts.

1235
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,360
 I don't really watch live.

1236
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:26,560
 I watch Botchamania and that's about it.

1237
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,120
 But it's just, you know, it's too crazy.

1238
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,160
 It's the same...

1239
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,160
 It's the government...

1240
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,160
 That's our government now.

1241
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,160
 It's the government.

1242
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,160
 It's WWE.

1243
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,160
 Yeah.

1244
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,160
 It's fucked up.

1245
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,160
 It's fucked up.

1246
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,160
 That's them.

1247
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,160
 Yeah.

1248
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,160
 I...

1249
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:46,920
 Well, on the way out, we knew one of the women who lived in that area, she came by to visit

1250
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,440
 on a golf cart and the kids took turns driving the golf cart.

1251
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,440
 Oh, fun.

1252
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,440
 Now, that's fun.

1253
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,440
 Good.

1254
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,440
 And I was like...

1255
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,200
 I turned to Sarah and I was like, "This is all they're going to remember."

1256
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,200
 This is all...

1257
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,200
 Yeah, yeah.

1258
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:04,640
 They're going to be like, "I love camping because we drove a golf cart around."

1259
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:10,480
 In a couple of years, your youngest son in the middle of a conversation is going to mention

1260
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,160
 that he's a really good driver and you're going to be really confused why he's talking

1261
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,520
 about that and then he's going to mention the golf cart and you'll be like, "Motherfucker,

1262
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,720
 you're talking about that goddamn golf cart."

1263
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,720
 Yeah.

1264
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,720
 We got to feed...

1265
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:33,640
 They were feeding the horses, we fed donkeys, goats, chickens, pigs, and they're these horses

1266
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,640
 that look like cows.

1267
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,640
 They're fat horses?

1268
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:36,640
 Are they ponies?

1269
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:41,600
 They look like they were trying to disguise themselves like it's a cow patterned skin,

1270
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,600
 a cow patterned...

1271
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,600
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

1272
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,360
 Like a mottled, a mottled, mottled...

1273
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,360
 Palomino.

1274
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,360
 Palomino?

1275
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,360
 No, no.

1276
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,360
 Is that what it's called?

1277
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,360
 That's the club, Paul.

1278
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,360
 They're called a pal...

1279
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,280
 That's the club that you love going to, Paul.

1280
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,280
 You're confused again.

1281
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,280
 It's called a palomino, right?

1282
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,280
 Isn't it a palomino?

1283
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,280
 No, I believe so.

1284
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,800
 Newman says, I don't know, he says, "I quit."

1285
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,800
 It's not a palomino?

1286
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:07,320
 I was going to say, we're getting palomino and of course, any cheap guest courses, which

1287
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,400
 is also a great name for them as well.

1288
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,720
 Is it a calico?

1289
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,720
 It's a calico horse.

1290
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,720
 Calico horse.

1291
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:19,160
 A palomino is a horse breed characterized by a pale creamed golden coat or a white and

1292
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,400
 silver mane and tail.

1293
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,400
 So that's not it.

1294
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,400
 It's not a palomino.

1295
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,400
 I know.

1296
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,080
 Nick Newman was saying, we host a horse podcast together.

1297
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,080
 It's true.

1298
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:30,800
 Yeah, but I don't know from a fucking palomino.

1299
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,400
 That don't mean we got any horse since.

1300
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,400
 El Camino.

1301
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,400
 It's an El Camino.

1302
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,400
 It's an El Camino.

1303
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,400
 It's an El Camino.

1304
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,400
 It's an El Camino.

1305
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:42,640
 There's an El Camino because of big cow sized horses.

1306
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,320
 Newman unmute yourself.

1307
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:48,200
 There's a sway back El Camino right there.

1308
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,200
 Yes.

1309
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,200
 There you go.

1310
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:54,120
 Is Newman, can you unmute yourself or no?

1311
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,800
 Who can say?

1312
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,800
 I can unmute myself.

1313
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,800
 Hi guys.

1314
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:01,560
 I'm not mad.

1315
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:04,640
 I'm just disappointed.

1316
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,960
 Newman, tell us about these cow looking palominos.

1317
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,400
 The front is like a horse.

1318
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,400
 Those are beautiful.

1319
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,400
 The back is like a truck.

1320
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,880
 The front is where you ride.

1321
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:18,400
 The back is where you fuck.

1322
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,160
 Is the picture in the chat what you saw?

1323
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,160
 Similar.

1324
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:30,120
 It was maybe more brown and black skin based and it was more of a, it wasn't a race horse,

1325
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,720
 but it looked like more kind of athletic looking than that.

1326
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:37,600
 A horse with spots is most commonly called an Appaloosa.

1327
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:41,960
 You either saw an Appaloosa or you saw a good old fashioned American paint.

1328
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:42,960
 Oh yeah.

1329
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,960
 American paint.

1330
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,440
 And that's, and that's not because they actually paint it.

1331
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,440
 It's because that's what they call it.

1332
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,480
 No, that's a Sherwood Williams, they call it.

1333
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,480
 That's it.

1334
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,480
 That is an American.

1335
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,400
 You probably, what you saw was an American paint.

1336
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,400
 Okay.

1337
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,400
 That is, okay.

1338
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,120
 Cause I didn't, what I didn't get into is that I met a guy who'd been working around

1339
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:09,760
 the ranch for 27 years who called himself Bones and I need to know everything about

1340
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,760
 Bones.

1341
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,760
 Everybody shut up.

1342
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,440
 This is the rest of the show.

1343
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,800
 We're going to talk about Bones.

1344
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,560
 I need to know about this man.

1345
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,960
 And he was like, so I said, Oh, we've got to head back to Vegas.

1346
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,360
 I was sorry to hear that.

1347
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,780
 I got out of that city for some years ago and never went back.

1348
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:29,280
 Came out here to help my friend move and never left.

1349
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,280
 Oh my God.

1350
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,960
 My spirit animal's got any bones.

1351
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:38,880
 Well, she was an American paint had a face like Sarah Jessica Parker.

1352
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:48,560
 He had like, he was joking around with me so much, you know, when someone has so many

1353
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:51,880
 bits in their head and then like, I laughed at one of his bits.

1354
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:55,580
 So that was something that he was like rapid fire, but it wasn't like, yeah.

1355
00:56:55,580 --> 00:57:00,960
 So in, in, in, in a hurricane of information, he'd use the word paint.

1356
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,680
 And I literally was like, are you saying paint like paint?

1357
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,440
 And he was like joking, like, yeah, we paint them or whatever.

1358
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:12,920
 And he was like, and like, I couldn't get to like, I needed the real answer.

1359
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,880
 I couldn't get him to stop doing bits.

1360
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:20,000
 And so when he said paint, I was like, I think he's fucking with me and I don't know what

1361
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
 he's saying.

1362
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,840
 And I can't believe I now can't believe any information he's telling me about this horse.

1363
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,200
 But he was saying what it's called.

1364
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,520
 It was called an American paint.

1365
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:27,520
 That's what it was.

1366
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,120
 That's what it was.

1367
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:33,280
 And, and here's where it gets more confusing.

1368
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:39,240
 American breeds can also be classified as paint horses by the American paint horse association

1369
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,480
 based on their coloring.

1370
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,480
 Okay.

1371
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:45,160
 So like, so we have, yeah.

1372
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:49,680
 So we had a thoroughbred named market tree, okay.

1373
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:55,760
 And market trees coloring on its leg, his leg went above the knee, which is part of

1374
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:02,760
 their requirements that the judges for this paint horse thing have.

1375
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:09,120
 So that, so he actually was dual certified as a thoroughbred and a paint horse.

1376
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,120
 Wow.

1377
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,120
 I know.

1378
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,120
 He was special.

1379
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,120
 His name is market tree.

1380
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:19,800
 And it was a bad joke because that is a French woodworking term for when you use glue made

1381
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,040
 from horses to do inlays.

1382
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,040
 Boo.

1383
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,040
 Boo that name.

1384
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,040
 Yeah.

1385
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,040
 That's fucked up.

1386
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,040
 Isn't that bad?

1387
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,040
 We didn't name him that.

1388
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,040
 I like it.

1389
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,040
 I like it.

1390
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,040
 It's macabre.

1391
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:36,960
 It's like a rabbit named possum.

1392
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:43,340
 I dated a girl that had a, a rabbit in a room in a cage.

1393
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:46,840
 And first of all, there's an odor.

1394
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:50,080
 It's mostly, it's mostly cedar chips, but there is an odor.

1395
00:58:50,080 --> 00:59:00,560
 This Nick was this one of those things where, as I've heard in apocryphal, um, Aerosmith

1396
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:08,360
 songs that she perhaps utilize this rabbit for birth, for pregnancy test.

1397
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,360
 The rabbit done died.

1398
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,360
 That's right.

1399
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,360
 That's right.

1400
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:19,160
 Is it, is it, is she, was she so promiscuous that she had several bunnies by her bedside

1401
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:22,960
 to test, rapid test, whether she was pregnant.

1402
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,640
 Is that what's happening?

1403
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:28,680
 If I made it up the bedroom to the, if I made it up the stairs to that bedroom, I'm sure

1404
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,240
 I wasn't blazing any trail.

1405
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:34,520
 That's what I'm saying though.

1406
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,560
 But so she, do you think that's what was going on?

1407
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:37,560
 She kept the rabbit.

1408
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:42,120
 She, well, I did not, I had, that's definitely what was happening.

1409
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:47,160
 I have not read nor have I seen a, a, it's still to this day, a work called Watership

1410
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,160
 Down.

1411
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,960
 You've ever seen Ridership Down?

1412
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:50,960
 No.

1413
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:58,440
 Is it, it's a book or it's a book and an animated movie and the name of break you, it will it,

1414
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,360
 the name of the rabbit was a reference to that.

1415
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:04,760
 Was it a number?

1416
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:05,760
 It was a number.

1417
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:06,760
 Okay.

1418
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:07,760
 It was a number?

1419
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,160
 This is my rabbit.

1420
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:12,520
 Unban scooped in the, and the chat says Fiverr.

1421
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,520
 That's that's the name.

1422
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,520
 Do you know that girl?

1423
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,520
 See, I wasn't the first.

1424
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,520
 There it is.

1425
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,520
 No.

1426
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,520
 Okay.

1427
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,520
 He knows that girl too.

1428
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,520
 Yeah.

1429
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,520
 The chat knows everything.

1430
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,360
 Well, I got those rabbit girls.

1431
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:27,080
 And she was kind of shitty that I hadn't seen this.

1432
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,080
 Yeah.

1433
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,840
 She's right to be shitty on that.

1434
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:30,840
 You need to see that.

1435
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:34,800
 And then you need to see plague dogs and then you'll never have to smile again.

1436
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,560
 I'll save a lot of time.

1437
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:40,080
 No, I just listened to that REM song.

1438
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,200
 Everybody hurts on repeat in my car.

1439
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:47,080
 Seriously though, plague dogs is the same animation house did Watership Down and it

1440
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:51,560
 is the most devastating thing I've ever seen on film.

1441
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:52,560
 Plague dogs.

1442
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:53,560
 Plague dogs.

1443
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:54,560
 Yep.

1444
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,560
 Okay.

1445
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:58,240
 Thanks for having me.

1446
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,240
 All right, buddy.

1447
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,240
 Thanks, Nick.

1448
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,240
 We appreciate your horse sense.

1449
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:04,240
 Let's do a little Scoop Mail.

1450
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:09,240
 We got one here from the Salt Lake Scoop.

1451
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:13,960
 Hey guys, I thought I would share something from a recent Vegas trip to let you comment

1452
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:14,960
 on it.

1453
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:19,680
 We went to Brad Garrett's Comedy Club recently until we're in the MGM Grand.

1454
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,600
 Just a quick summary of the format of the show.

1455
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,080
 Brad comes out and tells some jokes.

1456
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:24,800
 Then he introduces the first comedian.

1457
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,880
 Then Brad comes out and tells a few more jokes.

1458
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,000
 Then he introduces the second comedian.

1459
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,520
 Brad told a few jokes indicating that he was not a big fan of Trump.

1460
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:36,040
 He did a Trump voice and did the Trump dance and said it looks like he's jacking off two

1461
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:37,960
 guys.

1462
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,400
 Brad made a few other jokes at Trump's expense.

1463
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,560
 He did more Trump material than I thought someone would do at a Vegas show.

1464
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:50,160
 Yeah, Brad is a very anti-Trump fella.

1465
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,400
 We were at the show two days after Charlie Kirk was murdered during Brad's second set

1466
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,360
 that a woman across the room stood up and addressed Brad.

1467
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:01,480
 I thought I heard her say, "Can we have a moment for Charlie Kirk?"

1468
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,240
 Is this Brad Garrett?

1469
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,640
 It's Brad Garrett, yeah.

1470
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:10,440
 Is Brad Garrett on stage at the Brad Garrett Comedy Club?

1471
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,560
 I thought I heard her say, "Can we have a moment for Charlie Kirk?"

1472
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,080
 Brad responded by saying, "A moment of silence for Charlie Kirk?

1473
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,800
 You know this is a comedy show, right?"

1474
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,760
 Then he quickly followed up.

1475
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:19,760
 It is tragic.

1476
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:23,680
 Everyone should be able to say whatever they want without that happening to them.

1477
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:30,360
 With that comment, about 70% of the crowd applauded and Brad had won the crowd back.

1478
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:33,720
 At this point, the staff began to move toward this woman.

1479
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,800
 Brad said to the staff, "No, no, no, she's okay.

1480
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:40,160
 Just leave her," indicating that he didn't want her kicked out.

1481
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,440
 Brad then went on with his jokes.

1482
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:45,320
 His show was almost completely derailed by that woman and he got the control back so

1483
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,320
 quickly.

1484
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:47,320
 It was fascinating.

1485
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:50,760
 It went from cringing to applauding and back to laughing in less than a minute.

1486
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:55,480
 A few questions for you performers and Vegas insiders, was there any chance that this was

1487
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,480
 staged?

1488
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,480
 No.

1489
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:58,480
 No.

1490
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,480
 No, no, no.

1491
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,480
 No way.

1492
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,480
 No way.

1493
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:05,520
 You're just looking at a guy who has dealt with this shit.

1494
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:15,560
 I just saw Mark Maron talking about hecklers and crowd work in general.

1495
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:19,320
 I can't recall who he was talking with now.

1496
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:26,280
 But he was talking about crowd work as it being something that's currently hot right

1497
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,280
 now.

1498
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:33,280
 A lot of comedians are being praised because they do awesome crowd work.

1499
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:42,480
 And Maron was like, "Hey, it's important," to the degree that you're able to quickly

1500
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,640
 address a heckler and get your shit back on track.

1501
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:55,820
 But I don't think making your career on crowd work is really that laudable, per se.

1502
01:03:55,820 --> 01:04:02,820
 But I think what you saw there was a very experienced professional who was able to very

1503
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:09,320
 quickly turn it around and get it back on track and reset the mood.

1504
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:12,720
 But that's experience, man.

1505
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,760
 I mean, that's the goal, too.

1506
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:15,760
 It's just a reset.

1507
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:21,480
 And the brevity of it, that's the other thing, able to do it quickly, just like done.

1508
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:22,480
 You don't even realize.

1509
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,480
 Yeah.

1510
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:28,140
 No, I mean, it's a weird...

1511
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,560
 The internet makes things change so fast.

1512
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:38,360
 And so at first, standups felt like they were really hampered by social media because they

1513
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:41,920
 couldn't put their best material online because they consider it burned, something they can't

1514
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,700
 do again, right?

1515
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:48,100
 And so then they started realizing that younger people started reasoning faster.

1516
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:51,320
 They just did crowd work and put crowd work clips up, then they could protect their best

1517
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,520
 material and just do crowd work.

1518
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,520
 Right.

1519
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:59,880
 But then crowd work clips just became so much more popular and so much more viral, then all

1520
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:04,280
 of a sudden you had all these people purposely putting comedians on the spot and doing those

1521
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,280
 kind of contests.

1522
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:08,120
 Those crowd work shows and all kinds of other examples of it.

1523
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,120
 So strange.

1524
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:13,800
 And so crowd work just has become this version of it and even stranger, and I've talked about

1525
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:17,880
 this with magicians and comedians, is how much the audience now is just prepared to

1526
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,760
 talk to the person on stage.

1527
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:20,760
 Right.

1528
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,760
 Yeah.

1529
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:22,760
 Right?

1530
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:23,760
 Oh, it's amazing.

1531
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:24,760
 They're ready.

1532
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:29,000
 Back in the '80s and '90s and even early 2000s, if a comedian started talking to someone

1533
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,640
 from stage, that person would be embarrassed.

1534
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:32,640
 Yeah.

1535
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,640
 Yes.

1536
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:34,640
 They would recoil.

1537
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,640
 That person didn't want to have that conversation.

1538
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,280
 And now it's just like, "Yeah, yeah, I'm ready to talk.

1539
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,280
 What are we talking about?"

1540
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:39,280
 No.

1541
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,480
 That's why they're going to comedy shows to become part of the show.

1542
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:42,480
 It's right.

1543
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,280
 Fucking weird.

1544
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,880
 Krista Hendricks, who's crushing it, right?

1545
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:46,880
 She figured it out.

1546
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,920
 This is something that happened to her.

1547
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:51,080
 She wanted to do crowd work, so she went with the burner magic tricks.

1548
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:55,040
 And people liked her crowd work so much, she had to keep eliminating magic tricks in her

1549
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,040
 show.

1550
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:57,040
 Right.

1551
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,040
 She had to do less and less magic tricks.

1552
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:01,640
 And you can watch now in her more recent clips, when she goes to talk to the audience, they're

1553
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:02,640
 just ready.

1554
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:03,640
 They're ready to talk to her.

1555
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:04,640
 They're ready to have all the answers.

1556
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:07,000
 They're ready to talk about their occupation or the specifics of the situation they're

1557
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
 writing about.

1558
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
 Right?

1559
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,560
 No problem talking to people now.

1560
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:11,560
 They know their job.

1561
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:12,560
 So it is-

1562
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:13,560
 They know their part.

1563
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:14,560
 It's wild.

1564
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:15,560
 It is bizarre.

1565
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:16,560
 Nope.

1566
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:17,560
 Oh, that's from Saltlick.

1567
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:18,560
 Thank you.

1568
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:21,480
 Thank you, Saltlick Scoop.

1569
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:22,840
 Did Newman plug his podcast before he went?

1570
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,840
 Sorry, I had to take a call that I was gone for a minute.

1571
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,800
 Oh, no, he did not.

1572
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:28,800
 He's re-launching-

1573
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:29,800
 What's Newman's new podcast?

1574
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:32,440
 He's re-launching his podcast, Newman Unleashed, on September 25th.

1575
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:35,400
 You can start listening to his solo pod.

1576
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:36,400
 There you go.

1577
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,400
 Check it out.

1578
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,840
 Listen to Newman if you hate yourself.

1579
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:40,840
 Get that horse sense.

1580
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:41,840
 Wait a minute.

1581
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:42,840
 Here's some Jock vs. Nerd.

1582
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:43,840
 You want to do a little Jock vs. Nerd action?

1583
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:44,840
 Oh, am I?

1584
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:45,840
 Fuck yeah.

1585
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:46,840
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1586
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:47,840
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1587
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:48,840
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1588
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:49,840
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1589
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:50,840
 Oh, that sucks.

1590
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:51,840
 We got an old school Jock vs. Nerd coming at us for Nesticles!

1591
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:52,840
 We got an old school Jock vs. Nerd coming at us for Nesticles!

1592
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:53,840
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1593
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:54,840
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1594
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:55,840
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1595
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:56,840
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1596
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:57,840
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1597
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:58,840
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1598
01:06:58,840 --> 01:06:59,840
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1599
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:07,980
 We got an old school Jock vs. Nerd coming at us for Nesticles, Scoop!

1600
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:14,040
 Nesticles sent this in a while ago, he reconstructed it for me because I missed it back then.

1601
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:20,400
 Here are a dozen episode titles from our show, from our very own beloved Matt and Mattingly's

1602
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,680
 Ice Cream Social.

1603
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,560
 Here are a dozen episode titles.

1604
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:29,200
 The question is very simply, figure out which of these titles are real and which ones Nesticles

1605
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,200
 Scoop made up.

1606
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,200
 That's it!

1607
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,200
 That's it!

1608
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:33,200
 Easy game, fellas.

1609
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,200
 Easy game.

1610
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:39,800
 I'm going to tell you a title, you're going to tell me is that a title of our show that

1611
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:43,240
 the three of us produce and put out on the air?

1612
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:48,120
 You're just going to tell us, is that a title that we produced or is that just a made up

1613
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:49,120
 thing?

1614
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:50,120
 First one.

1615
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,120
 Paul, I'm thinking of a number.

1616
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:52,120
 What is it?

1617
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,120
 Two.

1618
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:54,120
 That's it.

1619
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,120
 That's exactly right.

1620
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:56,120
 You're first.

1621
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:59,680
 Bleach Thy Crevices, Bleach Thy Crevices.

1622
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:02,400
 Is that an ICS title or is that made up?

1623
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,400
 Made up.

1624
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:07,040
 Matt, is that an ICS title or is that made up?

1625
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:09,440
 Say it again.

1626
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,440
 Bleach Thy Crevices.

1627
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,020
 I think it's made up.

1628
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:14,020
 It is made up.

1629
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:16,200
 Good job both of you.

1630
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,200
 All right.

1631
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:24,280
 We played a game like this before and I have an unfair advantage in that I go back and

1632
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:29,760
 forth with Slaking Fool about titles for each episode before they go up every time.

1633
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:34,160
 I'm the one who uploads the episode, so I type it twice before I put it out into the

1634
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,160
 interview.

1635
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:38,000
 This is on a curve.

1636
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,080
 I usually retweet it and I usually see it.

1637
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:42,080
 That's true.

1638
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,080
 Oh yeah.

1639
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:48,480
 I usually pay some measure of attention to it.

1640
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:52,560
 Rich Men Knit, Rich Men Knit.

1641
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,440
 Real or fake?

1642
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:55,440
 Rich Men Knit.

1643
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,320
 Matt, you want to go first on this one?

1644
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,960
 Rich Men Knit.

1645
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,080
 Rich Men Knit, K-N-I-T.

1646
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,080
 Fake.

1647
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,080
 Paul.

1648
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:07,280
 Sounds real to me.

1649
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,720
 Point for Paul.

1650
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:09,720
 Point for Paul.

1651
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:10,720
 That was episode 602.

1652
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:11,720
 All right.

1653
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,000
 Rich Men Knit.

1654
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,640
 The twerking disaster.

1655
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:15,640
 Real.

1656
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:16,840
 Shout them out.

1657
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,840
 You know them.

1658
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:19,840
 Real.

1659
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:27,520
 The twerking disaster.

1660
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:29,400
 I'll say fake.

1661
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,400
 It is fake.

1662
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,840
 Two points for Paul.

1663
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:37,320
 Pete, Pete Seeking Missles.

1664
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:38,320
 Real.

1665
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:39,560
 S-E-E-G-I-N-G.

1666
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:40,560
 That's real.

1667
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:41,560
 That's real.

1668
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:42,560
 That's episode 780.

1669
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:43,560
 Yeah.

1670
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:44,560
 So Paul's up.

1671
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:45,560
 Shalali Leg.

1672
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:49,280
 Paul's up by two now, yeah?

1673
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:50,280
 I think so.

1674
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,280
 I think Paul's plus two.

1675
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:52,280
 Yeah.

1676
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:53,280
 Shalali Leg.

1677
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,280
 True.

1678
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:55,280
 Yeah, that's a real one.

1679
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,680
 That's a real one, 733.

1680
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,880
 The Moist Horizon.

1681
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:03,640
 Oh, that sounds like us.

1682
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:04,640
 It does.

1683
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:05,640
 It really sounds like us.

1684
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:06,920
 But it doesn't ring a bell.

1685
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:07,920
 Yeah, right?

1686
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:08,920
 I'll say fake.

1687
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:09,920
 Okay, Matt.

1688
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:10,920
 I still say fake.

1689
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:11,920
 I should do it for gamesmanship.

1690
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:12,920
 I should change it up.

1691
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:13,920
 I think it's fake.

1692
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:14,920
 It is fake.

1693
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:15,920
 It is fake.

1694
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:16,920
 It is fake.

1695
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:21,200
 Good call, buddy.

1696
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,200
 Good call.

1697
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,200
 Good work.

1698
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,200
 You put us on a deal.

1699
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,200
 The Androgynous.

1700
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,200
 The Androgynous.

1701
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,200
 Fake.

1702
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:31,040
 Oh, I think that might be real.

1703
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,040
 It is real.

1704
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:33,040
 1081.

1705
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,040
 Yeah.

1706
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:35,040
 That's lazy.

1707
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,040
 Ah!

1708
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:37,040
 That's a lazy title.

1709
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,040
 That's exactly what I thought.

1710
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:39,040
 I was like, "The Androgynous.

1711
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,040
 That's not real."

1712
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,040
 I scrolled down.

1713
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,040
 We have a show called The Androgynous.

1714
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:51,520
 The Gospel of Jacob.

1715
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:52,880
 The Gospel of Jacob.

1716
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:56,680
 I mean, on a chat GPT level, we must have, right?

1717
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:57,680
 Right.

1718
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:58,680
 Right.

1719
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:02,080
 That just seems like at the end of 1,000 episodes, we must have done that.

1720
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,080
 The Gospel of Jacob?

1721
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:04,080
 Yeah.

1722
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,900
 The Gospel of Jacob.

1723
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:07,900
 Did you say real, Matt?

1724
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:09,520
 I said real.

1725
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,320
 I'll say real.

1726
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,320
 It's fake.

1727
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:13,320
 It's fake.

1728
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,640
 We never did The Gospel of Jacob.

1729
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:15,640
 Out of town.

1730
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:16,640
 Let's call this episode that one.

1731
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:17,640
 The Gospel of Jacob and the moist horizon.

1732
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:22,160
 We didn't use both of those.

1733
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:23,160
 Chili Chilis.

1734
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,160
 C-H-I-L-L-Y.

1735
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:28,400
 C-H-I-L-L-I apostrophe S.

1736
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,400
 I'll say that's real.

1737
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,400
 Chili Chilis.

1738
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,400
 That's real.

1739
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,400
 Oh, that is fake.

1740
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,400
 That is fake.

1741
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,400
 What?

1742
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,400
 Stop it.

1743
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,400
 I know.

1744
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,400
 That's three that we have to use now.

1745
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:38,400
 My brain is confused.

1746
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,400
 Porn sniffing dog.

1747
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,400
 That's real.

1748
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,400
 Yeah.

1749
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,400
 That's definitely real.

1750
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,520
 That's episode 679.

1751
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:47,280
 The fifth nugget hits rock bottom.

1752
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:52,800
 I'm already upset with how poorly I'm doing on this, by the way.

1753
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,900
 Three wrong is unacceptable.

1754
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:59,800
 It's not like you gave a speech talking about how you had an advantage in this game at the

1755
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,200
 beginning of the game, though.

1756
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,200
 I think that's real.

1757
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,200
 Exactly.

1758
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,680
 That's why I was putting myself on blast on purpose.

1759
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:07,280
 I wanted to stay sharp.

1760
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,280
 Yeah.

1761
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:10,560
 I'll say real on the nugget.

1762
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,960
 What is it?

1763
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,880
 Oh, Paul says real on the nugget.

1764
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:15,480
 The fifth nugget hits rock bottom.

1765
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:18,000
 I'm going to say false.

1766
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
 It is real.

1767
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
 Episode 1133.

1768
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,880
 I'm running away with it, Matt.

1769
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:22,880
 I'm running away.

1770
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:23,880
 That's a recent one.

1771
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:24,880
 Yeah.

1772
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:25,880
 Paul's destroying me on this.

1773
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:28,640
 At 1133, you say recent, Matt.

1774
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,760
 That's like three years ago.

1775
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:32,760
 Maybe four.

1776
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:33,760
 It's a year ago.

1777
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,320
 No, it's like six months ago, right?

1778
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:36,320
 It's a year ago.

1779
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:37,320
 No, no, it's not.

1780
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,320
 Yeah.

1781
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,320
 I don't know what number we're on now.

1782
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:40,320
 What number are we on now?

1783
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,320
 What number is this show?

1784
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,320
 We're on 1240 something.

1785
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:43,320
 Yeah.

1786
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:44,320
 So it's been about 100 episodes.

1787
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:45,320
 Yeah.

1788
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,320
 It's been a year.

1789
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,320
 It's a long time.

1790
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:48,320
 Yeah.

1791
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,360
 This is the last one.

1792
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:56,080
 And of course, as tradition dictates, this one is worth 18,000 points.

1793
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,320
 Don't leave me gross.

1794
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:00,320
 That's real.

1795
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:01,320
 That's real.

1796
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:02,320
 That's real.

1797
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:05,200
 You both get 18,000 points, but Paul wins by three.

1798
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:11,280
 That was episode 454, and that is from the Nesticle Scoop.

1799
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:15,520
 Thank you so much, Nesticle Scoop, and thank you for rebuilding that Jock vs. Nerd that

1800
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,880
 you had made a while back.

1801
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,240
 We really appreciate it.

1802
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:22,720
 If you want to send us a Scooperty or a Price of Skryte Jock vs. Nerd or an Obelisk Jock

1803
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:27,480
 vs. Nerd, or just send us an old school Jock vs. Nerd like Nesticle Scoop just did, or just

1804
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,520
 go over there and send us some Scoop mail.

1805
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,120
 You can do all those things over there at Hayscoops.com.

1806
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,400
 Head over to Hayscoops.com.

1807
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,400
 Do all those things.

1808
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:35,400
 It's going to be great.

1809
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:36,400
 Buy yourself tickets to Scoop Fest.

1810
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:37,400
 Yes.

1811
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:40,520
 You don't have to hear us plug Scoop Fest a whole lot more coming up in the next couple

1812
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:41,520
 of weeks.

1813
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,520
 Get them now.

1814
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:43,520
 Do it.

1815
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,520
 You're going to miss it.

1816
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,520
 Awesome.

1817
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,560
 Who sent that in?

1818
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:50,560
 Nesticle.

1819
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,560
 Nesticle Scoop.

1820
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:54,320
 Thank you, Nesticle Scoop, for making me doubt myself.

1821
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:58,120
 Really now, I'm a terrible podcast host.

1822
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,520
 I don't think that's why you're a bad podcast host.

1823
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:01,520
 Thank you, Jacob.

1824
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,520
 Those were great, though.

1825
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:03,520
 Even the made-up ones were really tricky.

1826
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,280
 Oh, there were the made-up ones.

1827
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:08,960
 I'm just upset that we haven't already used them.

1828
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,240
 Jacob, you're right.

1829
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:16,400
 Why I am a bad podcast host is I muted my Zoom because I had to take a call, but then

1830
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:21,480
 I didn't mute my recorder.

1831
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:24,480
 So in the middle of the Newman interview, you have to figure out ...

1832
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,480
 That's where Newman's talking, right?

1833
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:26,480
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1834
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:27,480
 Yeah, yeah.

1835
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:28,480
 I got you.

1836
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:29,480
 I got you.

1837
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:33,840
 I'm just going to make a note about that right now.

1838
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:38,280
 It'll be fine to just hear Matt's rando conversation in the middle of the interview.

1839
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:39,800
 With my corporate magic booker.

1840
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:40,800
 That'll be great.

1841
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:41,800
 Yeah, that'll be great.

1842
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:42,800
 Professionals.

1843
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:43,800
 That's right.

1844
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:47,920
 Nicholas Newman in the chat, great time to take a call.

1845
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:51,080
 Yeah, yeah, Richard wants us to leave it in.

1846
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:53,540
 Thirsty Scoop wants us to leave that in.

1847
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:54,540
 There's a Patreon level.

1848
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:55,540
 There's a Patreon level.

1849
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:59,720
 I do notice, and I don't know what to do about it, because I don't know how to mute the recorder,

1850
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,000
 so I just leave the room.

1851
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,320
 So it's only the beginning of the conversation before I leave.

1852
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:08,040
 It will not be hard to find.

1853
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:14,240
 When you hear a different voice on the phone on my audio, you'll know.

1854
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:15,240
 That's it.

1855
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:16,240
 That's it.

1856
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,240
 Holy shit.

1857
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:22,240
 That's why I'm not a good podcast host.

1858
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:23,240
 Other reasons.

1859
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:26,280
 I want to thank Ben Jalef creating this podcast.

1860
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:27,280
 Thanks, Ben.

1861
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:33,800

1862

1863
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,800

 I want to thank the following people who know the old song from the Half Cow, Half Horse

1875
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
 show.

1876
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,880
 Of course is of course, of course, of course.

1877
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:48,720
 That's Doc Scoop, Don Donnie, Don't Say Scoop Name, Doug Lay, Dr. Science Scoop,

 Marcus, Ed Ondrick, Ed Wagner, and Ed Les Scoop.

1880
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:08,280
 Big thanks to these individuals who have far better bathroom luck than Jacob usually does.

1881
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:13,460
 Even though we didn't have a fun Jacob bathroom story this episode, I'm sure we'll have one

1882
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:14,880
 very soon again.

1883
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,600

 I'd like to thank Heather Divine Hansen, Holly Marshmallow Lightly, Horse Dad, or House Dad

01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:45,880

01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:19,520
 Thank you so much.

1897
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:23,440
 If you'd like to be thanked on air, if you want to hop on our Twitch broadcasts, all

1898
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:27,560
 you have to do is get on over to "Why can't I finish this plug?"

1899
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:31,000
 It's literally the thing that pays us.

1900
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:50,480
 Go to PreachingFun.com so that we don't do this for free.

1901
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:54,200
 Or if you want your kids to sleep in a teepee while you sleep in a chuck wagon, head on

1902
01:18:54,200 --> 01:19:05,560
 over to fartsinabag.biz.

1903
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:09,600
 That's fartsinabag.biz, that along with PreachingFun.com, it takes you over to our Patreon page where

1904
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:13,920
 for as little as $3 a month, you can help keep this show on the air.

1905
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:17,120
 Like Matt said, that is how we do the show, it's what makes the show possible.

1906
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:23,720
 So if you think this show is worth more than $0, PreachingFun.com, fartsinabag.biz, those

1907
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:27,480
 are the places that you can go to support this show and get some cool stuff.

1908
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:29,920
 Like you get to hang out in the Zoom with us.

1909
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:37,880
 Our Zoom attendance today got full on spoilers for ScoopFest this year, just in the pre-show.

1910
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:41,480
 So there is something worth coming over and hanging out in the Zoom chat with us if you

1911
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:43,740
 are on Patreon, so do that.

1912
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:48,360
 Look at your Patreon messages, we send out the Zoom link twice a week, every week, no

1913
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:49,360
 matter what.

1914
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,800
 Well, unless we're not going to do it, then we wouldn't send the link out.

1915
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,920
 But other than that, no matter what.

1916
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:54,920
 Yeah.

1917
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:55,920
 Right.

1918
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:56,920
 Right.

1919
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:57,920
 All things considered.

1920
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:58,920
 Pretty much all the time, though.

1921
01:19:58,920 --> 01:19:59,920
 Alright.

1922
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:00,920
 Usually.

1923
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:01,920
 Thanks for listening, everybody.

1924
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:02,920
 Stay safe out there.

1925
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:03,920
 We love you and we'll see you soon.

1926
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:04,920
 We'll see you soon.

1927
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:04,920
 We'll see you at the cone!

1928
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:44,480
 Generally, Tom had no problem hitting his opponent with the supremely epic ultimate legendary

1929
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:45,480
 long-range blaster.

1930
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:51,280
 But with his spotty Wi-Fi, his target skipped around like a second-hand CD.

1931
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:56,080
 The story you're hearing is 30 seconds long, which is the amount of time needed to unplug

1932
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:58,080
 and restart your modem.

1933
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:02,680
