1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 That's wrong.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 That's wrong.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 How's that wrong?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Off to a fantastic start.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 I should put my headphones on.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 That's how it's fucking wrong.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 I don't know how to do things.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 It's an abomination your lack of headphones is disgusting to watch.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Hello!

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 I'd love to thank all you ice cream truck drivers out there.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Who are the ice cream truck drivers?

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Well these are the folks that deliver that fucking ice cream straight to your fucking ear holes.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Right now I'd like to thank

 Here's the show!

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social?

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Yeah, I'd love to!

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Great, let's go!

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 We've got our friend Jonas Wolferton stopping by the churn today.

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Paul created a profile on Patreon with the most ridiculous post ever.

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 We can finally announce, we can finally announce where we were.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Our mystery show that we were talking about.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 It's time for Matt and Matt Hickley's Ice Cream Social.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Sitting in Las Vegas, it's Matt. Sitting in Pittsburgh, it's Paul. Sitting in Vegas, it's me, Jacob the Audio Guy.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 We're PreachingFun.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 I want to start with an apology. I just blamed Paul for something that was Jacob's fault.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 That was me, that was me.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Jacob took credit on it, which is great. I mean, eventually it will be my fault.

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Yeah, yeah.

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Very soon, I'm trying to...

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 I thought Paul had already done it, so I jumped on it the last second and did it.

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 This is for the Zoom hangout. I already told the people that were in the Zoom early, but yeah, that was my fuck up.

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 I thought Paul had already done it. Paul thought I had already done it, so I just jumped on it and did it real quick.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 It didn't think about any problems that I was going to create in the future.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 So I get all the Patreon emails and it just was like, "Wait, what? What's that? When? Where? What's going on?"

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Yeah.

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 See, you get those and you were bothered by those. I get the Zoom email, so every time somebody tried to click through the link and go, "I was getting an email as well."

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Oh, man.

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 We offered a new feature for Patreon off-air hangouts on Zoom. Paul was going to host the first one, and then we're going to be more detailed going forward.

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 I did, but we did get it cooking. Yeah, so I got to still chat with you, Matt, a little bit later about Patreon stuff getting in there.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And then I'm going to get myself all situated with the Zoom coordination stuff so I can actually send those out real soon.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 So I'm going to do that, and then I'll talk to you, Matt, later this week about getting all that.

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 I'm busy.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 But congratulations to Casey and Josh on their recent marriage.

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Yes, that's great.

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Such a lovely tag. And there was a surprise.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 The reason why we did the Tierney show is because Paul and I were hired to go surprise a groom on his wedding by having his two favorite podcasters stop by and do improv on their rehearsal night dinner.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And we surprised Josh by pretending to call him on our way to another gig, and then we walked out of our car into the wedding venue.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 And there's nothing more special as improv comedians to walk into a room where two people are very excited to see you and 50 people don't know what's going on.

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 But to their credit, they got on board real quick.

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 My son was like, how'd the show go? I go, well, no one was expecting to watch the show.

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 So the fact that they watched the show and participated was a real...

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Why was everyone polite?

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Imagine if I just came into your classroom with Paul and just did an improv show. That's the same feeling as everyone else at that dinner.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 But they were down and they loved it. And the main thing, Josh was super surprised, really shocked, and Casey was very pleased that we got the desired effect out of him. So that was it.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 No. And again, we say we have the best listeners in the world because we attract the nicest people. Sure enough, that wedding was filled with just amazingly awesome people who were very kind to us.

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 I was playing chess with their son. I was invited on the dance floor numerous times at the wedding. It was just a lot of good hanging. So, yes.

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Incredibly delicious food, libations, games.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Oh, Paul, that actually brings up a sticky subject. I did get a note. You were only hired as the guest. You weren't actually supposed to eat anything. So I do have a bill.

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 It was an invoice.

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 They did send a bill over.

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 I get it. I had an extra ravioli or two. That's for sure.

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 That is noted on the invoice.

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Extra ravioli or two.

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Yeah. We should maybe address basically how this all snowballed in a way that made sure that Jacob wasn't there. I think maybe we should get into that as well.

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Okay.

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 So originally I was called and I was emailed because I was a magician. And she said, I think my husband likes your podcast, but he likes magic. And so I think you did a duo. And she brought up Nick Paul. Nick Paul, who I just did the Magic Castle with.

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Yeah, yeah.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 I said, oh, so you want the magic show that Nick Paul and I did at the castle? And she's like, yes. And I said, great. So I called Nick Paul. Was he available? Yes. And then I basically on a follow-up email was like, so you guys saw us at the castle or whatever?

85
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 She goes, no, we've never been to the Magic Castle. And I said, so how did you find about the Nick Paul and I show? Because Nick Paul and I do shows together, but like at the castle and a few other places, but not often.

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Right. And she was like, well, I just knew that my husband listens to the podcast. And then I started going like, uh oh. Nick Paul, Paul Mattingly, she might think she has the name right.

87
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 And I said, listen, right now, you have a magic show booked with myself and Nick Paul and Nick is available.

88
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 This is far enough away that maybe you want to, without giving anything away, figure out whether he wants you to show up with the magician that maybe your husband's never heard of or the podcast partner that she has heard of.

89
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Which is really funny. If you show up at somebody's wedding with a magician that the groom has never heard of, it's great.

90
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 And he's like, Hey Matt, and hi sir. Hey pal, thanks for being away. What a surprise. I'm Josh.

91
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 And so like a month later, she's like, yeah, that, yep, you were right. I'm wrong. And we do not.

92
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 So I had to call Nick Paul to be like, Hey pal, you're no longer one. No one likes you.

93
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 You sure have a popular name. That's his name. Yeah.

94
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 So all that kerfuffle, you know, booking an improv show with Paul and I had it come earlier to my attention that just simply about ice cream social.

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 I might've said, do you also want Jacob there? But it was such a kerfuffle and a hubbub to pull it off that I totally, it wasn't until I was at the wedding and everyone was talking about how much they liked the podcast.

96
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 It was, we met another scoop that was there. Ryan, Ryan, who actually turned, uh, Josh on to us. Yeah. Way back in the day. Yes. Yeah. And he didn't make it to the rehearsal dinner and was so pissed when he found out we were surprised.

97
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 There I did a show. He's like, but anyways, it was, I really had a lot more fun at the wedding, knowing that Jacob probably should have been there too. And he wasn't. And that made me really feel great.

98
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Well, I wasn't at the party. I was at home working on things. I will say, uh, not having any fun. It would have been nice to have Jacob there to deflect from the, uh, possibility of your early onset death.

99
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Uh, he would have, he would have advised me, uh, or more to the point, he would have been in charge and knocking on your door and he would probably would just wouldn't have stopped knocking until you. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

100
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 He would have said Matt, he would have said Matt and I would have heard a voice that wasn't housekeeping is what would have happened. I just knocked twice and assume you're dead. Yeah. In fairness, every time I do go to wake Matt up, I do impersonate a housekeeper.

101
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Yeah. I don't always do the same accent. Sometimes I go Dutch. Sometimes I go Slavic. You know, it just depends on my mood. And then my instant boner wakes me up and I have to go like, all right, I'm up. That's right. That's right. But it was amazing. It was so wonderful.

102
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Uh, we're going to bury that right now because we have our friend Jonas Wolverton here. Exactly. Speaking of instant boners.

103
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 He, uh, he, he headlined our, our, our variety show at Scoop Fest this year. The balls on him. Jonas, how you doing, pal?

104
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Uh, my balls are doing well. Good. Good. We were worried. I could tell you. I could see the fear in your eyes. All good. Uh, hi. So you have a solo show coming up at the, um, uh, uh, it's not art square theater anymore. What's your biggest theater company? Yes.

105
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Biggest theater company. Yeah. So I'm doing my solo Mack and fro show and Mack and fro is the bad boy of tennis who you guys saw at Scoops Fest. That's right. Uh, so you were a variety artist. You, you, uh, you juggle, you do a seer wheel. Uh, where did you end up, uh, coming up with the John Mack and fro idea?

106
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 I have always loved John Mack and roe. Yeah. No relation. Oh, interesting. If you're listening lawyers, no related. Nothing related. Did you play tennis in your youth? Um, very rarely. Okay. I was in New York city kid. I played baseball. All right. Um, thick ball, but, uh, no bad. Second base. Watch John. Uh, shortstop and third. Oh, come on. I call, I call infielder. He had infielder vibes. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's pretty good. Infielder vibes. Come on.

107
00:10:49,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 I feel pretty good. I still feel good about that one. Yeah. Yeah. So I grew up watching John Mack and roe have some serious, uh, blowouts. Oh yeah. Yeah. He is the most, uh, New Yorker of all of the tennis players from that time period for sure.

108
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 That's why I love him. He is the most likely for a New York kid to enjoy who doesn't play tennis. That, that, that, yeah, that's where New York kids are going to gravitate to is John Mack and roe. Exactly. Exactly. That and the 86 Mets who are all like high on cocaine.

109
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Oh man, I got caught watching like a documentary on Dwight Gooden and, uh, uh, uh, Darrell strawberry. And, uh, it just kept getting like the clickety click of the roller coaster. All the heights are right at the very beginning.

110
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 And then it just goes down, down, down, down, down, down. And I was like, Jesus, will someone stop this documentary, please?

111
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Somebody stopped this documentary before someone gets hurt. Get the present day. Get the present day. It's so dark. The whole thing. Oh my God.

112
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 These are my heroes when I'm, when I'm eight. Perfect. Perfect. Yeah. So I, I loved Mack and roe and, um, uh, I love the sort of performance art aspect.

113
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 I'm not really knowing what performance art was a kid, but later on from reflecting about it, I got a gig, uh, with world team tennis to, uh, do seer wheel, which is what you guys see in the back there.

114
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 And, uh, I was like, Hey, I've been thinking about this, doing this bad boy of tennis character kind of an homage to Mack and roe. Um, would you guys be cool with that? And they're like, yeah, absolutely.

115
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 So I got hired to do a gig. Um, I did a seer wheel act as him and also interacted with the crowd, um, and filmed the whole thing as a sort of, I didn't know what I was going to do with it. Make it like a documentary, a mockumentary or something.

116
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Cause, cause Mack and roe, I mean, you know, for people of a certain age, he's, he's an iconic character, but like in the circus world, especially most people like sports, let alone famous tennis players. So like, was there any time where you were floating the idea of doing Mack and fro and just another circus guy was like, what the hell are you talking about? Please don't do this. What are you doing?

117
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 No, my world is the, the world of the clown. And so I, I, that's actually my first entrance into circus was through clown. I went to, I went to the clown conservatory in San Francisco. Yeah. And, uh, I did a whole year long program in clown.

118
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 And so my attraction to, um, the circus is originally through clown and through character. And I'm a theater kid at heart. And, uh, that's my, you know, my first passion. And so I wound up, um, there was no, like, and that's the cool thing about the clown is you can literally draw from anything in the world and, and find what's ridiculous about it and find what's funny about it and find the absurdity in it. Right.

119
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 How old are you when you go to the clown conservatory? Like where are you in your, in your life?

120
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Uh, this would be in 2001, 2002. So I'm, I'm, I just graduated from college and in film and was working in film and was like, ah, man, I was making a documentary about a sideshow circus and wound up getting like literally ran away with the circus was like, this is so cool. I don't want to be making the film. I want to be the film.

121
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 So we actually had a stand up comedian. Come on. That happened with his documentarian as well.

122
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Yeah.

123
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Yeah. So, so you literally, here's the good news is like, if you turn to your parents, it's like, you know what? I don't want to do stuff in the film. They're like, Oh, thank God. But I do want to be a clown.

124
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Shit.

125
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Absolutely.

126
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 We failed as parents more than we thought we did.

127
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 We got monkey pod.

128
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 No more film bad news. I'm a clown in San Francisco.

129
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Gift of the mad ride.

130
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 But they, but they were behind you in your choices.

131
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Thousand percent.

132
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 That's great.

133
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Yeah. Always, always, always. I mean, um, that's, that's, are they artists also?

134
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Uh, no, not at all. Not at all. My mom like worked in book publishing. My dad's a, um, a political guy in Brazil.

135
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 A political guy in Brazil? That sounds like mafia. That sounds like mafia to me.

136
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 He's kind of like the fixer for the president.

137
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 This is not, you're not dissuading my, my conclusion.

138
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 I'm nailing it. Infielder, mafia dad. I'm nailing it left and right.

139
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Yeah. Yeah. But, but for good, because he's actually a good president. He's, he's, he's on the side of the people.

140
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 So yeah, he's, he's not one of those assholes that's, you know, he's, he's very much against the current American regime.

141
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 So, you know, let's, let's get on this for the second year, but like, how do you keep up with all that?

142
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Do you follow, uh, like, uh, Brazilian news and stuff?

143
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Um, I am, I have Brazilian citizenship, so I try to keep like one eye open to what's happening in Brazil.

144
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 Also as an exit strategy for this, uh, country.

145
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 Oh, really? Are you, I didn't realize people were thinking about what other countries they could live in right now because of, uh,

146
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 It's just in the back pocket.

147
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 I, I wasn't immediately jealous of your Brazilian citizenship. I'll tell you right now.

148
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Wait till you hear about my Canadian.

149
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Fuck yourself.

150
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 I mean, I'm also a spy in addition to being a mafia.

151
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 So, uh, so that's, that's gotta be crazy to follow your dad's career a little bit. Yeah.

152
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Yeah. And the thing is, my dad is actually the one who got me to circus. You can think about it. Like he, he was always into clowns, uh, growing up.

153
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Uh, I hear stories about him, like, you know, back in Brazil in, in, in the, in the center of town, like the circus would still come through the town.

154
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 And they would, uh, do this thing. The clown would do this thing where the kid that would help the clown out to get all the other kids to come to the circus.

155
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 They'd put a little bit of ash like behind their ear so that when they showed up to the circus, they could like see the kids who had the ash behind the ear and they would get in for free.

156
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Oh, that's, that's really romantic. I like that.

157
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Yeah. So there's, I, I, and I was very small when I saw my first circus in Brazil. I was like five years old, I think. Um, I can't, it was either Ringling in New York or I was in this small, like rural circus in Brazil.

158
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 And, um, I just fell passionately in love with it. And so it's been, it's always been this idea of, of, of, oh, I really want to be involved in the circus in some ways, always been in my mind.

159
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Um, and it, it just, it just came out after I went to college and, and got, had a film career and I was like, fuck it, circus. This is it. This is the new thing. We're going this way now.

160
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 As someone who works in a circus, I am always fascinated, fascinated by people who see that and go like, I gotta do this.

161
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 I, I'm, I'm someone who is in like, uh, uh, in that area, you know, mainstream kind of like show business and then saw variety arts. It's like, oh, wait, variety arts. You can work all the time. You don't have to try to chase fame or awards. You can just get work. And I think that's, I think that's what's really attractive.

162
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 It really is, but there is this thing of, cause it's so much of showbiz. What people, I, this is probably wrong because I'm in showbiz. And so I'm trying to picture what people who aren't in showbiz think about it.

163
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 But it seems like, you know, from the, from the movies and stories and everything, people are attracted to the kind of glitz and glamor of showbiz and circus has very little glitz or glamor.

164
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Oh, hard to disagree. Hard to disagree.

165
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 When it has its own type. Sure. But it's not, it's not that red carpet.

166
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 I can't think of any more glamorous than Jonas wearing a giant Afro wig and a G string and having all these scoops Pelton with tennis balls. Name anything more glamorous than that.

167
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 I stand corrected.

168
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Yeah. I mean, I've, I've, I've performed in, you know, um, like dirty rock clubs, like the Double Down.

169
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 You have done a show with the Double Down.

170
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Yeah. Double Down.

171
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 The clowns, uh, wheel of misfortune.

172
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 What's it called? Wheel of Paul.

173
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Just, you know, that, that club is not named after the KFC to fry chicken breast sandwich.

174
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 It was not going.

175
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 It's a happy accident.

176
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 No, I, I, I know about the Double Down.

177
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 I've been to the Double Down a time or two.

178
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 What's, uh, ass juice.

179
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 That's the, uh, the, the, that's the, the bartenders at the end of the night will take the trays where they catch all the.

180
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Detritus and they will even, they will pour you shots of whatever is in there and you can.

181
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 And it's in a little toilet bowl too.

182
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Yeah. There you go. It's a, it's a specialty of the house.

183
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Yeah. I know me some Double Down.

184
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 A specialty.

185
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 But I've performed a Double Down, but I've also performed for the, uh, the spoltan of Oman.

186
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 Get out of here.

187
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 As a Double Down?

188
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 As Mac and Pro.

189
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 You've done the Mac and Pro?

190
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 No, not as Mac and Pro. Just, just generally over my career.

191
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Okay. Nice.

192
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 So that's, that's a, that's a good spread for sure.

193
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 You started in clown, but you've learned other skills.

194
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 When, when do you like, when did you start figuring out like the seer wheel?

195
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Like what, sometimes it's like, Hey, you're too athletic to just be a clown.

196
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 You should maybe do other things.

197
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Yeah. I thought I was a clown, but I started, I was like, Oh, I'm old for the circus.

198
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 I'm like 25 or whatever.

199
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 And, uh, and then I saw Daniel seer, uh, he of the seer wheel.

200
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Uh, the inventor.

201
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 The inventor of the wheel.

202
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Yeah. He invented the wheel.

203
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 I didn't even realize it was that new.

204
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Yeah. He, he premiered his, his, uh, act in Paris festival of,

205
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Paris is one of the largest circus festivals in the world.

206
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 So we should say quickly that like for anyone, seer wheels, like a giant metal

207
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 hoop, you kind of say like a giant metal hula hoop or whatever.

208
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 That a person can fit inside.

209
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Yeah. Yeah.

210
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 So the person kind of.

211
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 You can picture the, the, the Vichy, Vitruvian man.

212
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Ah, yes. That's a great, yeah.

213
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 You're basically the spokes of a wheel and you are generating the, the,

214
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 the spin in the wheel.

215
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 Um, and you can roll and there's, and there's, um, you can manipulate it.

216
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 There's a whole bunch of like, uh, vocabulary that when I first started out

217
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 working with Daniel seer, um, yeah, which is, it's, it's a six foot tall.

218
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 Well, for me, it's my height.

219
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 So it's six foot tall ring that I get inside of and spin around.

220
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Um, I started working with Danielle, uh, seer in Montreal in 2003.

221
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 He just won the, um, the silver medal, I believe at the Paris festival.

222
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 And he premiered a brand new circus discipline.

223
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 And so when I started out, there was four people.

224
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 And before that I saw him and what got me interested in it was I was in clown

225
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 school and we had to choose an apparatus.

226
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 We had to choose like juggling or, or, um, hand balancing or, you know,

227
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 whatever circus discipline or apparatus you wanted to choose.

228
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 And I, um, saw Daniel seer perform while I was in clown school right at the

229
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 beginning of it.

230
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 I was like, that's it.

231
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 It didn't even exist back then.

232
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Right.

233
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 There was nobody had a ring.

234
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Right.

235
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Just kind of, right.

236
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 You know, it was just Danielle and I was like, he make his own, I guess he

237
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 had to.

238
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Yeah.

239
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 He manufactured his own ring.

240
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 And then, uh, I, he, and then he's like, they're on Amazon.

241
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 They're not there.

242
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Nope.

243
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Nope.

244
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Yeah.

245
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 You can, you can get them online now.

246
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 They're, they're, they're more accessible and stuff.

247
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 And a lot of people, a lot more people are doing it now, but, um, I fell in

248
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 love with it.

249
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 I, the one thing that did exist that was kind of similar was a German wheel,

250
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 which has two rings.

251
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Um, so I started training on German wheel and then, um, wound up creating an

252
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 act in German wheel, a clown act.

253
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 And then, um, audition for Daniel Sears company in Montreal circle was, and

254
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 got hired to, to create, be one of the creators, one of the creative artists

255
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 that originated the show called rain that toured the world.

256
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Oh yeah.

257
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 Rain.

258
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 We should, we should actually put it like, you do love the sear wheel because

259
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 you, you, when we asked you to do school fest, you said yes.

260
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 And you said you had a version without a sear wheel, one with, and I said, okay,

261
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 what, what, what conditions do you need for the sear wheel?

262
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 And you laid out like three factors and we met none of them.

263
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 We asked for one thing.

264
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 It had to be a wooden stage and not carpeted.

265
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 We had a carpeted stage stage had to be very, very big.

266
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Uh, our stage was very small.

267
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 And so it's the record.

268
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 That's the record.

269
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Yeah.

270
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 I just kept saying, I kept saying, maybe do the version without the wheel.

271
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 And you just kept being like, I'm going to bring the wheel anyway.

272
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 I'm going to bring it just in case.

273
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 And we had, we had some rather messy acts before you.

274
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Yes.

275
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 I was legit concerned.

276
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 We could not.

277
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Oh, Paul was worried the entire time.

278
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 I was going to have your wheel at the end of the show.

279
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 All he was thinking about was your wheel at the end of the show.

280
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 I'm kicking banana husks and goop and pieces of lettuce and tomato off the

281
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 side of the stage.

282
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 I'm like, fuck.

283
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 You should have brought a sandwich onto the stage in the first place.

284
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Banana, tomato, and lettuce.

285
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 You even added a criteria that would made it even more difficult for me to

286
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 perform. So thank you guys so much.

287
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 You literally did a banana peel.

288
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 What's funny?

289
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Tell me one thing funnier.

290
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 That's exactly it.

291
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 I was, I was like, this is, this is, this is the shit show.

292
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 This is what it's going to be.

293
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 It's perfect for the world of Mack and fro.

294
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Cause the world of Mack and fro he's, he's, he's on the, he's on the outs.

295
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 You know,

296
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Yeah. If you're not, if you're not frustrated,

297
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 if you're not the butt of the joke, then it doesn't really work.

298
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 Great. Yeah.

299
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 Yeah.

300
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 The more obstacles you can put on in front of Mack and fro.

301
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 What is the seer wheel tiny stage record?

302
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Do you know or do you have it?

303
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:29,920
 I mean, really, did that to me? But I mean, seriously, is there anybody that performs seer wheel on a smaller space than eight feet? Do you I mean, talk, get a hold of Guinness are you asking Jonas is someone dumber than him? Is that what your eyes? No, it was fucking it was fucking fearless. It was producers less considerate than us. That's what Paul is asking. I know that I know the answer to that. I fucking know the answer to that. But it was great. And yeah, it was just so cool to see.

304
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,600
 And I was legit worried, but it went off.

305
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:42,200
 Though there is the world record for seer wheel performance does not currently have a smallest stage category.

306
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:53,240
 Okay, however, oh, the minimal the minimum space generally required for a professional artist is 15 foot by 15 foot.

307
00:25:53,280 --> 00:26:06,760
 Look at that. You math wiz is out there might notice that that is bigger than eight. Yeah, I didn't know that we were actually the measure how professional we are, which is we are 56% professional.

308
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:14,800
 Well, we've got that shit on video. You can just you can just send that into into Guinness and be done with it.

309
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:32,040
 It is now that you've challenged me, I'm going to do it. I think about this all the time where I think my kids who want to go to college, I've said this on the on the podcast many times as like or I have said, or they can learn the seer wheel and just work the rest of their lives, right?

310
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:38,640
 Training for the seer wheel. Do you do you accidentally at least once crush your fingers on the wheel?

311
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:46,200
 Yes. Oh, I did it. Oh, that's the only thing that bothers me when I think about it all the time. I feel like it has to be more than once.

312
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,040
 No, it's like Johnny dangerously one.

313
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,280
 And then that's the lesson learned, huh?

314
00:26:53,280 --> 00:27:03,760
 And it's it's it's when you do the coin spin. So you're like, you're you're you're spinning like a coin. Yeah, and you're kind of kind of wobbling down to the ground. Yeah, yeah.

315
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:17,600
 Back with your with your head like throwing down to the stage and coming back up and you're letting you pushing the wheel and you're grabbing and pulling it up and you're pushing it and pulling it up. And yes, that is the trick that everyone inevitably will crush their fingers on. That's the one I crushed my fingers on.

316
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,880
 And then I learned, I learned how not to do that trick.

317
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:27,440
 When you crush your fingers with it, is it is it just painful or does something usually break?

318
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:38,640
 No, just, you know, just put a little ice on it. Just paint. OK, good. Yeah. Or just like, you know, slamming your finger in a car door. This isn't like the story of our all seer wheel artists don't have fingernails or something.

319
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:50,120
 Because when I first watched that act, I always thought I thought, are there designs where there are handholds inside the wheel or anything? Or was that like an early on?

320
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:56,560
 Some people do that, but it's very rare. I think it's it's just the simplicity of having a ring that's so

321
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:06,280
 Right. You don't have to. Yeah, it makes it clear you don't need any any excess stuff. It's just like the the the focus is on the figures that you're creating with your body as opposed to

322
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:20,080
 Your eye getting distracted by some kind of unnecessary thing. It's just like the German wheel that you mentioned earlier, like your hands are inside of two rings in the in the German wheel already. So there's already kind of an apparatus that does that anyway.

323
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,840
 Yeah, it's it's it's very German and efficient in that way.

324
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,760
 Like, this is Rebecca. Oh, Rebecca.

325
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:48,960
 She got unmuted because she had to answer. We, we, it reminds me of contact. Remember the spaceship and the scientists decided that they had to have a seat in the spaceship, but didn't need a seat. So you're probably right. It makes it a much more elegant beast when it doesn't have the extra constructs in it. You're right.

326
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:57,640
 That's exactly the the analogy I was going to use. And also the wheel I saw that had handholds on it. It shook so violently when the guy was using it.

327
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:11,400
 I also have a theory in that in that that I spin left. So I'm spinning counterclockwise. Okay. And I'm getting I'm is that a choice.

328
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:23,400
 It's just the way that Danielle spin when he taught me. He spun left. Some people spin right. But I spin left and I have I have a theory that that keeps me young.

329
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,600
 Oh, you're Supermanning it.

330
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:34,400
 Turning back time. Yeah, that's right. You're running the car reverse. Take the miles off. Taking that odometer back.

331
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,920
 So your show you do two nights.

332
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:54,960
 Yes. So I'm doing two nights November 21st and 22nd at the Vegas Theatre Company. It's called the Mac and fro show. And then I'm also doing the Mac and fro show in LA. Okay, at the legion theater, which is going to be December 3 at the legion.

333
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,760
 It's a big hub for

334
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:17,160
 Comedy. Also, the same exact show. It's going to be my debut in LA on December 3. No clown is huge right now in LA. Like it's very. Yeah, it's blowing up on the internet too. I follow like three or four very specific strange clowns on Instagram.

335
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:29,120
 Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And that's kind of the hub is at the legion. So I'm going to go I'm going to take my clown to go meet their clowns. Nice. Oh, that's going to be so fun. That's awesome.

336
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,480
 Is there a website or anything that people can see the dates and times on and maybe buy tickets.

337
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:52,000
 Yes, for Vegas. It's theater spelled in the British way T H E A T R E dot Vegas. And then for the legion theater. I believe it's a legion E L Y S I A N theater spelled the American way dot com.

338
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,840
 Still, we fight over tea and how to spell theater. That's just the way it goes. Up with that. Let's just figure that out.

339
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:13,840
 Also, we should decide right now. Should we should we just make this call right now. I always default to the British spelling. It looks more elegant. I also do R E. Matt, do you do R E or E R. Motherfucker.

340
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:34,000
 And I just like jersey trash. I mean, I just had a petition of Toby Keith to the halftime show. The zombie body of Toby Keith. This happened to me this week. I'm bringing up a real thing. Yeah, that's real. They're going to AI him as the halftime.

341
00:31:35,120 --> 00:32:04,080
 No, there's a petition to make him be the halftime performer. Performers in American but has tan skin and speak Spanish. There's a legit petition to have Toby Keith instead. Yes, because the NFL is going to listen to a petition of 50,000 bigots. You have to you have to you have to say yes to that. You have to you have to look. I understand being a bigot. I don't understand spending your effort on the halftime show.

342
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:25,680
 I don't understand burning these calories to be a more effective bigot. There's so many other companies that have DEI policies. Why are you going to the Super Bowl? There's so many ways to be a bigot where you're you'll affect a group of people. This case, you're only affecting bad buddy. And he's already doing very well. Yeah, exactly.

343
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:55,280
 I went to Home Depot this week to get a piece of hose. I needed a piece of hose and it needed a very specific diameter for this hose. And I was like, I think it is a seven eights or I know I think it's a 7/16 rather. And so me and me and the guy we find 7/16 so we find a piece of 7/16 hose. I have a little piece of hose that I brought with me and I hold them up and they don't match.

344
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:25,600
 The 7/16 is a little big. Let's drop down to 3/8. So we find a 3/8 hose. Paul, this is all math. Don't worry about it. I'm not worried. We find a 3/8 hose. And sure enough, it is a little small. So somewhere between these two 16th of an inch is where the hose that I have is. And I say to the to the guy, I go, maybe it's metric. Do you think it could be metric? And he gets the most offended look on his face.

345
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:55,440
 Genuinely. He goes, well, because I told him it was for an ice maker. He goes, did you buy it in the United States? And I kind of chuckled a bit like, well, sure. He goes, well, then it shouldn't be metric. And I thought he was joking. And I kind of played along with it. They get these metric things and they bring them into the things in the United States. And yeah, I bought this thing in the U.S. but who knows where it was made. You get it.

346
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:11,440
 And he, to my horror, he didn't get it. Was not joking and continued on that conversation and felt very strongly that something that was purchased in America should have freedom units. It shouldn't be in metric.

347
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,840
 Your first mistake was Home Depot. I mean, we got to boycott that fucking place.

348
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:30,400
 Scuba Diver girls, right. It's George Strait, not Toby Keith. I got, I got George Strait. He's been dead a lot longer. Either way. Just speak English. You know what I mean? That's all we're saying. I'm going to get the artist wrong.

349
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:43,600
 Speak English. Don't use metric. It was metric, by the way. It was 10 millimeter. This is what I mean. This is what I mean is like, OK, we have known that we've had an undercurrent of racism as part of our culture in this country for a very long time.

350
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:56,000
 No, this is the problem. We thought it was only an undercurrent. But now it's becoming an overcurrent. And the fact that like this person literally is spending their emotions, being upset about metric units for metric, dude, it's metric.

351
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:04,960
 You have things in this store that are metric. Look, it's just there's ways to build stuff. And yes, fuck Home Depot. They're the option. Correct me if I'm wrong.

352
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:19,560
 But from the jump, feet as a measurement started as being measured by the Royals foot length. So if you're sticking to feet, I thought it was a Roman thing.

353
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:29,040
 No, it was the length of the length of the king's foot. So you're telling me that you're down a mile is something like a Roman thing, I think.

354
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:41,120
 I don't know. But but I know with feet, it was and it changed from king to king. So you're just telling me your measurement system is so fucking crazy and it all depends on one dude's fucking feet.

355
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:45,120
 So you're going to just bow down and kiss the foot. That's what you're telling me.

356
00:35:45,120 --> 00:36:01,800
 Literally in the chat is telling me that a mile is not the length of a king's foot. So sorry, sorry, Rich Scoop for clearing that up. Well, I mean enough inbreeding. You never know what you're going to get. Oh, I forgot I forgot my crown. Let me turn around.

357
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:23,760
 No, no, no, no. Sideshow Bob to the extreme. Anti-royal anti-fascist metric system is actually the way to go. That's what I'm saying. Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. It comes down to more democratic to use the metric. Far more democratic.

358
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:36,720
 Actually, Paul and I saw Kirk Brattler do a bit to stand up about the way to convince Americans, like the metrics, the more is by start submitting our dick length in centimeters, then everyone's going to feel like a lot better.

359
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:47,400
 Do you want a three inch dick? Or do you want an 18 centimeter cock? That was the bit is really good.

360
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:52,360
 I'll tell you who else wants an 18 centimeter cock. And that's the following sponsor.

361
00:36:52,360 --> 00:37:10,640
 I'm sure that math is completely wrong. Don't convert Paul's math on that. Today's show is brought to you by Gregorius Griffin's Gardening Gadzookeries. That's right. That's from Danny Olwein in 2021. Gregorius Griffin's Gardening Gadzookeries.

362
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:26,640
 Hey everyone, it's me, Gregorius Griffin. Are you here for gardening? Well, Gadzooks, I've got the gear. You go ahead and grab a garden weasel and get to scrubbing. Scrub out all them weeds, scrub them with your hands and your fists, twist it and pull it.

363
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:41,280
 The gardening Gadzookeries will clear up and open ways and pathways for the seeds to take root, don't you know? Make sure that they're planted in rows. Rows are where it's at. And make sure you measure it with the metric system.

364
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:50,000
 You don't want feet of crops. You want metrics of crops. Think about it.

365
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:59,920
 Do you want a foot of cabbage or a meter of cabbage? Get right. Make your crops more metery.

366
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:07,200
 Enter Hayes Group's checkout. Jonas, did you ever finish your documentary? Did you ever finish the doc that you were shooting?

367
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:13,920
 No, I didn't. I wound up making a short doc on it.

368
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:28,400
 But that's funny because the sideshow troupe is the Bindlesit Family Circus in New York City. If anybody out there in New York probably knows who those guys are. And they actually hired me 20 years later to do a gig for them.

369
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,920
 Oh, funny.

370
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:37,840
 After I left Cirque du Soleil, which I performed in Zumanity for 10 years, I've been freelancing since about 2019.

371
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:43,360
 And nobody was like, hey, where's that doc, buddy? Where's that film?

372
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:52,080
 They did ask for the footage, though. And I was like, you know what? I'm not going to make this into a film. But so you guys, please have this for your for your archive.

373
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:59,440
 So they copied all the raw footage and everything. And back when we were shooting on tape. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Back in the day.

374
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:06,000
 Now, Scott, was your gig for the Sultan one of the craziest gigs you've ever done?

375
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:18,400
 Yes. So I was on that gig with Daniel Sear and one other performer, a woman by the name of Valerie. And it was in Oman. And we were treated like royalty from the get.

376
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:28,240
 Like, I literally if I wanted to like a legit massage, I want to massage like any time of the day, I could have one.

377
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:33,520
 I literally did two back to back 90 minute massages on the open of Oman's dimes.

378
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,480
 Well, they got a lot of oil out there for the massages. That's the whole thing. That's that's it. It's all oil.

379
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:44,800
 A lot of you were like Kobe beef by the time you went out there from the marble.

380
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:56,720
 So it was the randomest thing. It was it was for a Toyota dealership opening, which I guess Toyota trucks are like big in in the middle East trucks, which is random.

381
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:08,880
 But anyways, we're like, OK, we're opening this dealership. And they hired Sear Wheels. And and about an hour before the show, this massive sandstorm kicked up and like like biblical.

382
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:21,880
 Yeah. Yeah. Oh, no. And so we were on stage in these white, flowy outfits that were the giant sales.

383
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:31,080
 While you're in your Sear Wheel. While we're in the Sear Wheel getting blown around, that's exactly what you didn't really have to do any effort to move.

384
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:35,280
 You just kind of go with the wind. That made it much easier, much easier.

385
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,040
 We were getting blown in one direction, like off the stage. And Sear literally got blown off the stage.

386
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:44,480
 Oh, my God. Yeah. Were they OK? What happened? Not happy.

387
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:51,160
 I know they're still they're still rolling. It's terrible. It's the worst thing that can happen to a Sear Wheel artist.

388
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:56,360
 They know that's how they also disappear. And he just kind of like rolled away.

389
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,640
 Yeah. But yeah, so like we get blown one way.

390
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:05,000
 And then like I'm doing actually two people in one in one wheel with this woman, Valerie.

391
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,040
 And we're spinning together and getting blown like towards as if we're getting blown off stage.

392
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:14,760
 And we had to like find a way to maneuver ourselves to get back towards the center.

393
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,120
 And you had more than eight feet to work with at that point still.

394
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:23,080
 Thank goodness. Goodness sakes.

395
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:28,920
 Yeah, there's at least nine feet on that stage. Wow. That is that's bananas.

396
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,400
 Yeah, that was the wild one. That was the wild one.

397
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:36,240
 So people were staying there in the sandstorm to watch the performance.

398
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:45,840
 Yeah, but I didn't see them.

399
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:51,480
 I really could not see the audience. I think they were there.

400
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,040
 I was assured later that they very much enjoyed a full sand out.

401
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,080
 Now, what's it like with the sand underneath? I mean, that's also a slippery kind of thing, right?

402
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,560
 Was that even? Yeah, I mean, it was not it was not good.

403
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:12,120
 It wasn't quite scoops level conditions, but sand, more grit than old tomato hunks.

404
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:17,320
 OK, the sandstorm was not quite as bad as scoop vest. It was close.

405
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,960
 Did they did they did the sound affect the performance, too?

406
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:28,440
 Because I know when those things comes in, it's all that it did.

407
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:34,520
 You can't you can't hear anything. Yeah. It's that it did.

408
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,320
 He honestly waited longer to make that joke than I expected.

409
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,880
 And thank you. Thank you. I'm I'm I'm nothing.

410
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,840
 You're not patient. Start that song and then just like stop it.

411
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's how the town knows it's coming.

412
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,440
 That's the seven air horn. Yes.

413
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,280
 Yeah, you're just walking around all seizure.

414
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,440
 What? What? Oh, no. Oh, no.

415
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,440
 I'm going to get inside. Oh, shit.

416
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,320
 Was that it? Oh, yeah, that's definitely coming.

417
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,960
 And that song gets me pumped up. It's a great song.

418
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,560
 It's a great song. You know, pumped up to hide from sandstorms.

419
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,720
 We should we should write some lyrics to it on this.

420
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,800
 I don't think I could do that. I don't think I could do that.

421
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:17,360
 And you think that those are the lyrics.

422
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:33,120
 I guess. That's it. Yeah, I love it. Sandstorm.

423
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:38,600
 Yeah, sandstorm. And yeah, it's been just been

424
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,560
 some crazy wheel gigs.

425
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:46,280
 You know, I toured with the Dresden Dolls and, you know, that that band

426
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,720
 from the 2000s. Yeah.

427
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,920
 Sort of cabaret, punk duo.

428
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:58,000
 And I performed in the on a U.S. tour with them.

429
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,600
 So I had to clear out tire like rock venues, like the floor of the rock venue,

430
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:10,320
 the pit area, and then I would do Sear Wheel in in in rock venues and stuff like that.

431
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,840
 And that's always fun to do. I love I love rock clubs.

432
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:17,240
 I performed at the Roundhouse in London with with them and cleared out the pit

433
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,640
 and did Sear Wheel in there. That was fun.

434
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,760
 So this is really taking you literally all over the world.

435
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,320
 Yes. Yes. I have five continents.

436
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,600
 That's so cool. I prefer five continents.

437
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,280
 Yeah. Which one? Which two are you missing?

438
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,200
 Australia. Australia.

439
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,760
 That seems like an easy one to get. You should be able to get one of those.

440
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,280
 Yeah. You know, I love I love Australia.

441
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,800
 I was honestly before I before Cirque hired me to move to Vegas.

442
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:49,040
 I was going to move to Australia and just overstay my visa and marry an Australian.

443
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,320
 Just do that. No problem.

444
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:57,440
 Yeah. That's just, you know, that's what you do when you're a vagabond circus

445
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,160
 carny. Yeah. Yeah.

446
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,160
 Yeah. And then and then I say also France, even though it's not a continent,

447
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:07,960
 France, the theaters in France always had like lovely cheeses,

448
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:13,280
 like really stinky French cheeses laid out on the board of stinky French cheese.

449
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:20,440
 And and France, I think I think I not only spent all my per diem,

450
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,840
 I may have spent most of my salary on food in France.

451
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,800
 That's fair. That's pretty fair.

452
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,840
 That's fair. The food is better over there.

453
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:36,800
 I hear good things. You should go theater re in France, too.

454
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,160
 That's why Matt will not perform at those theaters.

455
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:43,560
 Is that the best kind of pre sear wheel move to cheese up?

456
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,040
 Is it does that help you?

457
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:50,480
 Oh, yeah. You don't want to you don't want to be flowing free while you're spinning

458
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,440
 around that sear wheel. You want to you want to clog that shit up.

459
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,880
 I guess that's true. You want to be bound up like a cat in a cage before you hit that wheel.

460
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,840
 One thing, the fun thing to do is to chug a bunch of water.

461
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:07,880
 Oh, shit. And then do a coin spin and then just feel the water sloshing around in a circle.

462
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,640
 Oh, you hate that. I honestly so much.

463
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,880
 I honestly thought for a second you were going to tell me you pissed while you did it.

464
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,240
 That would have been wild, like some kind of avant garde design that you make on like a canvas.

465
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,440
 Do a sear wheel on a camera. Have you done it with paint?

466
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,760
 Have you made like sear wheel art yet on a giant paint?

467
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,960
 Now, let's skip over the urine, but let's go back to it.

468
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:33,360
 Let's think about paint. We could we could use the wheel on a giant canvas.

469
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:37,800
 I don't know. I don't know why Paul is naysaying my art here.

470
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,400
 I have I have tried with with paint on the wheel.

471
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,760
 It's a little slippery, so you can't really do very much.

472
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,680
 You can create patterns of that.

473
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:51,240
 I've also drank a glass of wine while spinning in the wheel, holding the wine at the same time.

474
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:58,080
 The wine glass, you kind of have to tilt it ups because, you know, the the G force is taking it out.

475
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,800
 So you can tilt the glass and drink it like that.

476
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,640
 Well, that's fine. Drink a beer or two.

477
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:06,400
 You know what you're spinning as well.

478
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,240
 Since you've worked with Sear himself, does he have like pet peeves?

479
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:15,120
 Has he seen people do stuff with the wheel that he considers an abomination or anything like that?

480
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,360
 Oh, no, he's actually really just impressed.

481
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:23,000
 And, you know, Sear is very impressed with the way the discipline has been expanded upon

482
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,520
 and just completely taken to really wild, wild lengths,

483
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:32,760
 doing things that we never could have imagined when we were first starting the discipline.

484
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,320
 There's some things that the kids do nowadays.

485
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:40,960
 And I'm like, yeah, that won't work on a scoop stage.

486
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,320
 Does he have the market corner?

487
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,520
 Does he have some merchandise yet? He needs some merch, right?

488
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:50,120
 Does he not have a searing is believing T-shirt yet?

489
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:53,520
 Because that's no, you've got to have it.

490
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:57,080
 I know, I know. He's he's he's kind of like been in the shadows.

491
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:00,640
 He kind of like made this thing, made his just circus discipline.

492
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,480
 Yeah. And then kind of like just dropped in a couple.

493
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,840
 Yeah. He kind of did the show that I was working on.

494
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:11,240
 He did a couple. I did a Cirque show as well.

495
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:19,880
 Corteo, he designed that act and then he kind of just like was like like like Homer Simpson.

496
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,920
 Like my work here is done.

497
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,880
 I have accomplished all that I need to.

498
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,280
 Yeah, he was a wonderful, wonderful mentor.

499
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:33,920
 And this is what what a what a right place, right time.

500
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:40,080
 You know, honestly, like I just it's just when you hit it just reminds me like to whenever I'm kind of

501
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,680
 need to make a choice on what I want to do on something, a creative project, whatever.

502
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,600
 I'm just like, what is the what is the best possible scenario?

503
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:52,880
 What what what what what's the thing when I have a vision or an inspiration hit me?

504
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:58,520
 I really got to follow it to its to its conclusion because you never know what can come from that.

505
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:08,520
 You know, literally, I have had a 22 year circus career based on one, seeing clowns in Cirque du Soleil,

506
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:12,840
 Dralian, a clown troupe called Les Voila that inspired me.

507
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,320
 It was like, oh, God, clowning. That's it. Yeah, of course.

508
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,840
 Duh. I love Charlie Chaplin. I love Buster Keaton.

509
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,280
 Like I'm going to I'm going to be a clown.

510
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:26,680
 And then the second sort of lightning flash was seeing Daniel Sear perform and being like that Sear wheel.

511
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:34,600
 Yeah, that's amazing. Like really to just hone in on my intuitive sense of like what's going to inspire me,

512
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:39,760
 what's going to what's going to make me what's going to fulfill my soul?

513
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:51,920
 You know, like what's going to what's what's the thing that's going to make me passionate to get out of bed in the morning and and or not sleep and travel, you know, halfway across the world and do a show.

514
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,760
 John McEnroe, John McEnroe is the answer to that question.

515
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,320
 Well, I I got a friend.

516
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:07,640
 I got a friend in mime, no relation, Lauren Saul and Lauren got to work with Marceau before he passed.

517
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:16,320
 And like, I feel like you've got kind of a similar thing here now that you are a direct line from Sear into this unique art form.

518
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,080
 So have you already been approached by people?

519
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,840
 Are you are you an instructor at this point in that way?

520
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:28,240
 Are you are you leaning into that kind of bearing of the torch for this art form now?

521
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,880
 I definitely can instruct.

522
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:36,520
 I do private lessons for people that want to I'm really more into the creation side of it.

523
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:45,520
 I've realized that I'm not really teaching for me is is it's cool, but I much rather make a one man show.

524
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,320
 Sure. You know, a character based one man show.

525
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,360
 That's where I like my I find my passion.

526
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:54,720
 I mean, I am going to have you teach my children just so that just to save me on college money.

527
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:59,560
 Just really don't want to go to college. At this point, it's as good an option as anything.

528
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:05,400
 It really is. No, for real. Like, that's the thing is like you can like and you can go to circus college in Montreal.

529
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:10,880
 They have the Ecole Nationale de Cirque, which is it's a university.

530
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:18,400
 It's in Montreal. And if they are passionate about circus, kids who are 18 can audition.

531
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:28,080
 Well, I'm one who's not passionate about anything, so I feel like I am going to be sending him to that school just because I find a passion there.

532
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,520
 Yeah, for sure. Like it's such an amazing program.

533
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:37,400
 I actually funny thing I auditioned for the National Circus School of Montreal the same week I auditioned for Cirque El Oise.

534
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:44,800
 So I had two intense days of auditioning for the National Circus School of Montreal back in 2003.

535
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:51,520
 And then also I had three intense days that turned into four because I got a callback for Cirque El Oise.

536
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:56,320
 You grew up in New York, right? Yeah, originally in New York City.

537
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:59,000
 Was anyone in the circus starts or anything like that when you were growing up?

538
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:09,520
 No, we had we had Ringling Brothers, Barman Bailey Circus every year, which I would go see at Madison Square Garden and we had the Big Apple Circus.

539
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:14,960
 Yeah. All right. But all these circus performers were like of circus families, right?

540
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:21,120
 So everybody was they had generations of circus knowledge.

541
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:24,520
 Our friend is ringmastering the Big Apple Circus right now.

542
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:28,200
 That's right. Red Alters, Red Alters. So I just saw that.

543
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,880
 That's amazing. Yeah. So happy him.

544
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:38,320
 And so I figured out I didn't figure out that circus could be a possible thing that I could do.

545
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:43,960
 I literally until I was 25 and I was like, oh, there's a clown program at that's amazing.

546
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,960
 Like, let me let me let me audition for that.

547
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,680
 And I think that's the whole movement of new circus. Right.

548
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:55,280
 And and Cirque du Soleil is like you can have diverse you come from diverse backgrounds.

549
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,200
 So a lot of the house troupe comes from gymnastics. Right.

550
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:04,040
 You can have a soloist that comes from the dance world that then trained in circus.

551
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:10,840
 Like, it's it's actually to your benefit to have an to have a new family history.

552
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:13,720
 The contrary to popular belief. Yeah.

553
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:18,480
 Yeah. No, it's like it's a it's a whole new world where you can train yourself in

554
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:24,160
 in a year or two or maybe more, depending and really get to a high level of circus.

555
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:30,840
 There is there is a whole new breed of circus artists out right now that are doing what he's talking about.

556
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,320
 This is a brand new thing. It's really great.

557
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:36,400
 Social media has done that. It's like it has to the magic world.

558
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,520
 Right. Is the reason why magicians are finally a more diverse group of people.

559
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:44,560
 We're not like going like what a woman doing a magic trick is.

560
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,920
 I still say that. Come on.

561
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:53,520
 But yeah, that's one of the one of the many positive aspects of the Internet is

562
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,600
 one of the three positive aspects of the Internet.

563
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,120
 It's more people are getting into circus arts.

564
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:04,280
 That's pretty cool. Well, Jonas, we'll send people to theater Vegas.

565
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:09,240
 The other Ari Vegas or the at least inside if you go see them in L.A.

566
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,680
 What do people follow you in general?

567
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,480
 Because you travel, obviously, you travel over the world, perform over the world.

568
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,520
 What do people follow you in general?

569
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,480
 Yeah, you can follow me on Instagram.

570
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:22,520
 That's usually where I put all my shenanigans at Zoo Punk Cirque.

571
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:28,600
 So it's spelled Z-U punk P-U-N-K Cirque C-I-R-Q-U-E.

572
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,640
 OK, I'll put it in chat for anybody.

573
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,120
 Yeah, we'll put in the bio of the episode as well.

574
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:41,000
 OK, perfect. Yeah, that's Instagram is usually where you can find information about Mac and Fro Show.

575
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,120
 I'm also in puppetry of the penis.

576
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,360
 We didn't even get to that. Right. Oh, right.

577
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,320
 Yeah, sure. That has its own.

578
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:52,280
 There's literally puppetry of the penis as an ice cream cone.

579
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,760
 Well, ice cream. Next Scoop Fest.

580
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,920
 We I mean, we know we know a lot of puppetry of the penis people.

581
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,640
 Like I'm buddies with Jamie and well, you know, Jamie, of course, too.

582
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,440
 And you know, you know, he hired me.

583
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,040
 Well, you know, tons of puppetry.

584
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,840
 Well, we had the original, the guys that came out here.

585
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,120
 Barry and Mike and Rich. Yes.

586
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,400
 They did our first Scoop Fest.

587
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,600
 Yep. And it was really funny because there was two hundred people laughing, applauding and one person

588
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,320
 who just turned and looked at a wall during that performance.

589
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,280
 It was awesome. It was amazing. Yeah, they couldn't.

590
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:26,920
 It was a fascinating wall in my defense.

591
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,520
 That paint was nearly dry.

592
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,960
 I got to watch that paint just completely dry.

593
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,240
 It was amazing.

594
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,720
 I still remember because, you know, Scoop Fest, we just say like, hey, if you want to do a slot, do whatever.

595
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,960
 We just want you to do it. You just tell us what you want to do.

596
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,520
 And so they said yes to doing it.

597
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,760
 And then I never clarified what they were going to do.

598
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:47,240
 And so before the the show, I was like, I don't know what you guys want to do.

599
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:52,600
 We guess if you guys feel comfortable where you're at or like how much longer of a slot do you want, blah, blah, blah.

600
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,360
 They go, oh, we're ripping our dicks out.

601
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,840
 I go, OK, OK, OK.

602
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,240
 And that was the full conversation.

603
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,160
 That was it. OK.

604
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:05,800
 The most important question of today is how much space did they need to whip their dicks?

605
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,200
 Yeah, see, it was 16 by 16 foot stage.

606
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:15,240
 Yeah. Get us on the horn, folks.

607
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,000
 They had so much room for activities.

608
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,200
 Metric, Metric 16 by 16.

609
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:25,600
 15 meter for all all you listeners out there that can't see this podcast.

610
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,600
 I'm making the hamburger right now.

611
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:33,880
 I like that you're like you saw I must do the clown.

612
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,160
 You saw the sewer. I must do the cereal.

613
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,000
 You saw the hamburger. I must make ships in the shape of my penis.

614
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,720
 I must. I must do it.

615
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,240
 It was already doing it, right?

616
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,920
 And then I get paid, sure.

617
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,600
 It's like every man's dream to get paid.

618
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,920
 Now, how often do you do that show?

619
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,200
 That's Thursday through Sunday in Vegas at the Erotic Heritage Museum.

620
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,640
 OK. 8 o'clock show Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

621
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,920
 OK. And then I'm also at the Wizard of Oz

622
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,960
 doing this really cool immersive

623
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,680
 experience after the after the movie at the Sphere.

624
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,640
 I like right now there's some listeners who are like, yeah, whatever.

625
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,320
 I'm just going to go see him play with his dick.

626
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:20,600
 Like Wizard of Oz, sure, but I'm going to go to the dick thing, I think.

627
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:27,000
 I mean, it's it's the last one of its kind.

628
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,960
 Like they, you know, it's it's it's holding on as we're celebrating

629
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,480
 10 years of puppetry of the penis in Vegas.

630
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,600
 Oh, I thought you were talking about the Wizard of Oz at the Sphere.

631
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:40,480
 Although I do have to make a couple of jokes about,

632
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:44,080
 you know, in puppetry about Wizard of Oz, I'm like, well,

633
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:48,280
 you know, you had all these choices in entertainment and you decided to come to

634
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:52,240
 you could have went to the Wizard of Oz at the Sphere.

635
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:57,960
 You chose this. That is it.

636
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,200
 A different kind of flying monkey, that's all.

637
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:03,200
 Choose your flying monkey.

638
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,960
 Oh, you got to come up with a new a new cock and balls trick

639
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:10,080
 called the flying monkey in honor of the Wizard of Oz.

640
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:13,040
 Oh, I'm we got Halloween coming up.

641
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,840
 I'm trying to like, yeah, this week, I figured out what the best trick would be.

642
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,800
 Well, yeah, you guys do the batwing, right?

643
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,320
 You could do batwing.

644
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,000
 Yeah, I want to maybe the vampire.

645
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,920
 Like I've got these teeth. He's going that are.

646
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:26,640
 There you go.

647
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,440
 I'm trying to I'm trying to work that into the show for the Halloween

648
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,120
 for on Friday, the dick that sucks itself.

649
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,760
 The vampire.

650
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:39,120
 Healing. You can have it.

651
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,480
 Take it. Take it.

652
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,000
 I want that show to run forever.

653
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,800
 I have news for you.

654
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,920
 Paul's not going to do it. I'm not.

655
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,320
 Although if you want me to open for cock, you could.

656
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:56,560
 And some one of these that had to develop some kind of stand up bit.

657
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:00,960
 Yeah, something I could just these guys are going to do the hamburger later on.

658
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,400
 I can only do the slider.

659
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,320
 I need to go back to my ventriloquist days.

660
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,480
 I need to get a ventriloquist bit worked up.

661
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,720
 That's what I need to do.

662
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,760
 And honey, I need to move back to Vegas.

663
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,600
 That's important work.

664
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,000
 Yeah, I really got to go.

665
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,680
 And yeah, I know we just repainted the house and we're loving our life out here.

666
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,280
 Time for me to go play with my dick.

667
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,240
 You'll support me, right?

668
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:28,680
 As long as I don't have to.

669
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,520
 OK, great, great, great.

670
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,680
 Somebody said the Marilyn Manson trick.

671
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,160
 Oh, I don't know. Is that for a dick trick?

672
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,080
 Is that just sucking your own dick?

673
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,880
 Oh, that's the way you cut your ribs out.

674
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:45,560
 That that whole David Gahan from Preshmo.

675
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,000
 Do that to the legend.

676
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,320
 Yeah, urban legends. Yeah.

677
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:53,120
 Well, we're about to descend into a bunch of Halloween bits,

678
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:57,800
 so you're welcome to run away at this point if you want to go live your life.

679
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:02,400
 I'll stick around because I'm going to practice my my vampire trick.

680
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,600
 Oh, good, good, good.

681
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,040
 I'll tell you who else is going to practice their new vampire

682
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,000
 dick and balls trick while we wait.

683
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,480
 And that's the following sponsor of today's show.

684
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:18,080
 Men, men, this social is brought to you by Black Hole Baby Diapers

685
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,960
 from Teddy Officer Scoop, also in twenty twenty one.

686
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,200
 That's Black Hole Baby Diapers.

687
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,160
 Hello, it's me, Carl Sagan.

688
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:31,320
 I'm here from beyond the grave to tell you about the billions

689
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:35,440
 and billions of infants shitting and pissing themselves throughout the nation.

690
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,120
 The high time that you buy them the proper undergarments.

691
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:42,640
 What I have is Black Hole Diapers.

692
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,840
 What these will do is, of course, open a rift in space time

693
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:49,480
 that we're not really certain what's on the other side of it.

694
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:55,240
 But the piss and shit of the children will get instantly sucked into it,

695
01:00:55,240 --> 01:01:00,000
 spaghettified into the tiniest, smallest form that it can be

696
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,280
 and thrown into some alternate dimension or whatever.

697
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,560
 Again, it's all theoretical.

698
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:09,440
 We don't know what lies on the other side.

699
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:14,400
 However, we can, with some assurance, state that on the other side

700
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,440
 of our black hole diapers, there's a great quantity of piss and shit.

701
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:22,400
 Go ahead and buy these black hole diapers for your children.

702
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,520
 Make sure that they don't sit directly on the hole.

703
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,080
 That's the trick.

704
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:32,200
 You don't want to spaghettify your babies or maybe some of you do.

705
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,160
 I don't know this demon haunted world.

706
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:37,320
 It's enveloping all of us.

707
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:41,080
 Why not let it envelop your piss and shit from your children?

708
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:45,360
 Do the environmentally sound thing and send all the piss and shit

709
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,880
 from your babies into the nether regions of time and space.

710
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,800
 That's Black Hole Diapers from Carl Sagan.

711
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,080
 Enter hate scoops at checkout.

712
01:01:56,080 --> 01:02:01,000
 Well, let's see what. Oh, oh, oh, my.

713
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,680
 My Uber Eats is here.

714
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,440
 Hold on. I just have to go get my Uber Eats here.

715
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,680
 It's oh, my Uber Eats driver.

716
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,520
 It's vampire Bill Cosby.

717
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,520
 Well, what do you know? What do you say?

718
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:14,520
 How you doing? Hey, hey, hey, well, it's Bill Cosby.

719
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:18,520
 I'm here to give you what you ordered from the store on some things.

720
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,680
 Oh, thank you for sundries.

721
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,120
 Oh, you have what you need.

722
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,000
 Theo is dead.

723
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,120
 Boo. He's a ghost this year.

724
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:28,280
 Yeah, that's right. He came with me.

725
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,160
 He's right here. This is my son.

726
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,280
 Leo, who's a ghost now.

727
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,280
 He's going to scare the fuck out of you.

728
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,240
 That's what he does.

729
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:38,000
 That's scaring you. Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.

730
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,760
 Was he scared?

731
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,320
 Well, you should be good.

732
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,200
 I'm glad you scared of my ghost son who died in the ocean

733
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,560
 trying to save his baby, but he did.

734
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:50,080
 And he did. Oh, boy, it's too bad.

735
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:52,320
 It's a terrible thing.

736
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,120
 I well, well, thanks for coming by.

737
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,720
 Thanks for bringing my my groceries.

738
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:59,160
 I'm never going to miss a chance to come and hang out during.

739
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,440
 This is my favorite holiday.

740
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,480
 It's all the holiday I get released.

741
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,480
 It's not true. I'm free man now.

742
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,280
 I can do whatever I want.

743
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,480
 That's right. No.

744
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,360
 No jail can hold the cause.

745
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:15,960
 Oh, that part will cause me.

746
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,640
 I'm so sorry I have to answer the story here.

747
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,360
 Well, I'm going to turn into a bat then.

748
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,000
 Poof. Goodbye. Flap, flap, flap.

749
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,120
 I'm gone. Oh, that's too bad.

750
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:27,680
 He would have really loved to have met our next guest.

751
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,600
 It's actually Piff the Magic Dragon. Piff, come on in.

752
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,120
 Right. I'm a magician, isn't it?

753
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,760
 Hey, what do you want? We got some free candy for me, mate.

754
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:37,840
 Oh, come on in. Where's your grub?

755
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,960
 Give it over. I want some M.P.A.Y. days, right?

756
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:44,200
 Yeah, I'm a dragon. Yeah, I mean, here's some candy.

757
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,760
 Yeah, too. Right. I'm going to sit on a hoard of candy.

758
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,320
 Uh, Piff, I just want to congratulate you.

759
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:52,240
 Uh, your 10 year anniversary is coming up soon.

760
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,040
 Ten years of being a Las Vegas headliner.

761
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,800
 It's got to feel pretty good, huh, buddy?

762
01:03:55,800 --> 01:04:00,040
 That's right. It's a decade of decades for Mr. Piff the Magic Dragon.

763
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,800
 What, what, what, what, what? I'll be entertaining everybody.

764
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,440
 Can't nobody hold me down.

765
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,960
 Hey, look, guess what I'm going to do?

766
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,320
 I'm going to make all you bitches disappear.

767
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:11,480
 Poof. Where'd Chris Angel go? Oh, fucking no, do I?

768
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:15,240
 I'm taking over his spot. Yeah. That bitch is off. Done.

769
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,880
 I'm the king. One king.

770
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:20,000
 Are you still going to use the wind machines and blow garbage on people?

771
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,800
 I mean, I wouldn't be much of a dragon if I didn't blow off people

772
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,280
 with some fire and stuff. That's kind of what I'd do.

773
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,200
 That's fair. That is fair. That's right.

774
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:32,120
 And you're going to be touring next year with, with Penn doing Piff and Pop.

775
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:34,800
 You say so.

776
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:38,160
 No, I do say so. It's happening.

777
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,360
 All right. I'll take you word out. Oh, no.

778
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:43,160
 At least I got top billing, didn't I? What? Isn't it?

779
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:48,000
 It sounds like you need some, maybe some, some legal advice

780
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,360
 on how to deal with this tour coming up with, with Penn here.

781
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:53,040
 I don't know. I don't think so.

782
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,400
 I think, I think this whole sale, I got top billing.

783
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,320
 That's all I need. Oh, somebody else here.

784
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,520
 I'll bet. Runway. No, no, this is great.

785
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,240
 Stick around and chat with.

786
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:04,160
 This is our friend, the forgetful goldfish lawyer.

787
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,160
 Maybe the forgetful goldfish lawyer can help you out a little bit.

788
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:11,480
 What is it you need?

789
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:14,160
 Piff wants to make sure that he understands he's protected

790
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,400
 in this tour, that he's coming up with Ben Gillette.

791
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,200
 OK, let me look into my briefcase here.

792
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,960
 Well, it looks like all I've got in here is tetra flakes.

793
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,320
 What were you asking me again?

794
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:28,000
 You want to if you want to pick the magic dragon as a client.

795
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,520
 Who's that now?

796
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,680
 He's a magician in Las Vegas.

797
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,800
 What's your name, sir?

798
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,160
 Oh, I'm Matt. I'm the co-host of this podcast.

799
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:40,360
 OK, let me go ahead and call somebody.

800
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:45,760
 I've forgotten all the phone numbers.

801
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:49,320
 Well, OK, well, OK, that's that's what goldfish do.

802
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,880
 We just forget. I understand.

803
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:57,320
 What you forgot something, I forgot to breathe for about a minute there.

804
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,160
 Oh, no. Oh, gosh.

805
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,600
 It happens. Yeah. Yeah.

806
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,040
 But, you know, you don't have to make any calls now.

807
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,200
 I just want to know that you're, you know.

808
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,480
 I'll tell you what I don't want is this fucking idiot

809
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,680
 representing me for anything.

810
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,640
 It's a bullshit.

811
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,360
 This is a great lawyer, Piff.

812
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:13,400
 The fuck he is.

813
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,600
 I'll tell you, I only think he's got in common with the law.

814
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,680
 He's got the scales of justice. That's about it.

815
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,160
 He can fend his way right out of here.

816
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:23,960
 Go on swim away, you dumb bitch, isn't it?

817
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,880
 Oh, the lawyer is leaving.

818
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,160
 That is that is horrible.

819
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:28,640
 He was upsetting.

820
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:31,040
 It's hard to see. Oh, he just he ran into a light post.

821
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,600
 Oh, my God. Oh, you're fucking idiot.

822
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,480
 He is. I'm going to go chase him.

823
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:41,040
 I will see you later, Piff.

824
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,080
 Thanks. Thanks for coming by.

825
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:44,000
 Bye, Piff. Happy holidays. Fuck all of you.

826
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,760
 Wow. Jesus.

827
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,320
 He's got really, really a cervic over these 10 years.

828
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,720
 That was that was by far the most.

829
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

830
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,720
 He's changed. It's gone to his head.

831
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:59,280
 All that all that success, all that instant ease.

832
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,120
 All that all that gold and princesses.

833
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,640
 It's really gone to his head.

834
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,880
 You know, being a Las Vegas headliner is so easy.

835
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,960
 It's all gone to his head. So easy.

836
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:12,280
 Well, it's been a good week, everybody.

837
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,600
 How do you guys have a good week?

838
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:17,920
 I had a great week. Are you asking me?

839
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,480
 I am. Sorry. Yes, I was asking you.

840
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:23,320
 And then three notifications somehow popped up on my screen

841
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:24,800
 all at the same time.

842
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,280
 It really distracted me.

843
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:34,520
 I got to rewatch Groundhog Day this week.

844
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,400
 Oh, yeah. That's a Groundhog.

845
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,200
 Yeah, it was on over and over again.

846
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:41,680
 And it really struck me how much faster he accepted

847
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:44,520
 that the day was happening over and over again to him

848
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,000
 than I believe I would have in that situation.

849
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:49,680
 Oh, he's just like the second day.

850
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,360
 He's like, Oh, I guess this is happening.

851
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:52,920
 Yeah, I've got it.

852
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,480
 He really just kind of took it all in stride pretty well.

853
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:58,560
 I watched on the plane. I watched Sinners.

854
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:01,520
 Oh, yeah. How was that?

855
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,200
 Love it. It's a vampire movie.

856
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,440
 But I don't know if you I don't think anyone's talked about this.

857
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:08,240
 There are some like racial undertones to it.

858
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,640
 Oh, boy. I just I was very subtle.

859
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:11,960
 I picked up on it.

860
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,720
 Interesting.

861
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:17,360
 You know, I saw some stuff in the trailer that made me think

862
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,760
 that that might be part of what they were going to talk about.

863
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,280
 But I but I couldn't really tell.

864
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:23,280
 Yeah, I saw no seeds until I watched the movie.

865
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:25,280
 I was like, wait a minute. So good.

866
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:27,760
 I fucking love Sinners.

867
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,240
 It's a great it's really good.

868
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:32,640
 Michael B. Jordan is so good. He. Yeah.

869
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:37,640
 What when they really kind of

870
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:41,320
 really try to anchor the whiteness of the vampires,

871
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:46,080
 they do it with specific kind of like Irish music.

872
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,880
 And I felt like a little a little a little attacked then.

873
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:51,920
 Not the white part, but the Irish part, the Irish part.

874
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:56,560
 As you should. Wait a minute.

875
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,560
 But yeah.

876
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:01,440
 Oh, that is that is terrible.

877
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,320
 Oh, gosh. Oh, oh, shit.

878
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:07,240
 It's B. Arthur's candy cooter corn now with nuts.

879
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:10,480
 That's a commercial, not a character.

880
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,400
 I I agree.

881
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:18,160
 These people are sneaking in extra commercials into our social media feed.

882
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:23,400
 Picture it. Sicily, 1939.

883
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:27,520
 My daughter's cooter is overflowing with waxy candy.

884
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:34,560
 We should say that all these characters are submitted

885
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,560
 by our listeners on all of our social media channels.

886
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:41,720
 So these were all put on our Facebook and Instagram posts yesterday.

887
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:46,080
 So if you're not following us on social media, we do the Halloween episode

888
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,680
 and the Christmas episode where people stop by.

889
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:52,000
 That's right. And we just pimp Paul all all episode.

890
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,840
 That's right.

891
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:58,240
 Who's next? Whoa, bring it says Paul.

892
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:02,200
 Paul's like, wow, ring the bell, ring the bell, Jacob.

893
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,680
 I could out of that cooter corn.

894
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:09,360
 Holy shit, it's Ding Dong Mitch, the guy who doesn't understand

895
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,800
 how to ding dong ditch.

896
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:18,160
 Oh, hello. Hey, there, gotcha.

897
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:20,880
 Hi, gotcha, gotcha.

898
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:24,160
 What do you mean? What do you mean?

899
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:25,760
 You answered the door.

900
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,440
 Yeah, got you already.

901
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,760
 Did you ring the doorbell again?

902
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,480
 Might have been me. Got you.

903
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,200
 We you. But what?

904
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,720
 How did you get us? Yeah, I should.

905
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:38,800
 Most people answer their doorbell. Hey, check, check this out. What's that?

906
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:43,240
 Gotcha. No, I don't think that's how you get me, buddy.

907
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:46,760
 We saw you ring it. I don't feel gotten.

908
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:48,040
 Yeah. You understand? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

909
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,520
 OK, OK, OK. Like most.

910
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:53,360
 There you go. Got you.

911
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:56,560
 Because my doorbell works, is that how you got me?

912
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,320
 Look, is there somebody at the door?

913
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,600
 Yeah, you better go better go answer the door.

914
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,440
 Hey, check it out. Hi.

915
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,400
 Could be your other door.

916
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,880
 OK, I'm going to check your other door.

917
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,120
 Yeah, I'll go walk to my back.

918
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,000
 Gotcha. It was this one.

919
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,640
 It was this door.

920
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:23,000
 Hey, hey, I hate this guy.

921
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,640
 Still me, still me at your door.

922
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,400
 Gotcha.

923
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:32,320
 Gotcha. Ding dong, Mitch.

924
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,280
 Basically, a force of nature over here.

925
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:36,120
 Check it. All right.

926
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:37,840
 Thank you. There you go.

927
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,040
 OK, you're all right.

928
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,320
 One more.

929
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:45,120
 Gotcha. Bye.

930
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:48,960
 I hate that guy. I'll see you in a little bit.

931
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,000
 Mike in chat says he submitted characters on our Truth Social account.

932
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,960
 Are you getting any? Are you reading from those, Jacob?

933
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,400
 No, I've got I've got our Truth Social account pulled up here.

934
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:00,440
 Yeah, I definitely I'm definitely reading all of those.

935
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:05,240
 Oh, actually, from the Truth Social account, we have the woke truck driver.

936
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,680
 Here he is.

937
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,800
 Hey, God damn it.

938
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,160
 Where's your pride flag?

939
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,960
 Just they break down with the wind.

940
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:17,080
 Oh, yeah. Oh, we got a little sun bleached.

941
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,280
 Oh, I just I just didn't have time to put it up this year.

942
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,040
 Well, eat shit.

943
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,560
 Well, I was I was trying to.

944
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:24,880
 Yeah, sure, sure, sure.

945
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,680
 But I had to get to my my friends.

946
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:29,160
 I'm going to my my friend's daughter's basketball game.

947
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:31,680
 And so I wasn't able to get the flags up on time.

948
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:32,480
 But I got to go right.

949
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:35,840
 I'm sure your friend's daughter's basketball game, where I'm sure

950
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:39,760
 they've talked a bunch of shit about trans athletes participating

951
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,320
 and they haven't allowed some, isn't that right?

952
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:45,120
 Outrageous behavior. Absolutely outrageous.

953
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,040
 All right.

954
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:48,400
 You know, trans rights are human rights, you piece of shit.

955
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:49,600
 You know that, right?

956
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,640
 Fuck you. OK.

957
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:54,240
 Apparently, you don't know that.

958
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:56,960
 Why don't you go eat your own shit, you non pride flag

959
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,560
 having son of a bitch? Wow. OK.

960
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,040
 Yeah, I'm sorry.

961
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,080
 Yeah. OK. Yeah.

962
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,960
 Well, apologize to my fucking fist when it goes to your head.

963
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:09,120
 I will. Yeah, you better.

964
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,520
 Do you want some candy?

965
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:16,200
 Only if it's been made with LGBTQIA professionals.

966
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:20,360
 OK, I want the gayest candy you can give me.

967
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:23,000
 I have skills.

968
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,720
 That is it. You win.

969
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:27,960
 OK, all right. Back in.

970
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:31,880
 Top of the day to you.

971
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,000
 Top of the day to you.

972
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,600
 I'm going to taste the rainbow.

973
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,400
 Sounds good. Have a good night.

974
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,200
 Thank you. Thank you very much. You too.

975
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:39,720
 Yeah. Thank you, both truck driver.

976
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,600
 Yeah. Fuck y'all.

977
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:45,280
 Oh, it's Truman Capote.

978
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:48,040
 Truman, what brings you by?

979
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:53,080
 Well, I'm just terribly excited and I was hoping there'd be some candy here.

980
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:56,480
 Oh, that last guy just took the last of the Skittles.

981
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,440
 That's all right.

982
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:02,600
 Those don't feel nearly as good inside of me as a mounds bar does.

983
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,800
 Sometimes you do feel like a nut.

984
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:08,800
 I do every time.

985
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,520
 Oh, that's all I'm enjoying. Sometimes you don't.

986
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:13,480
 That's mounds. Fair enough.

987
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:16,760
 Now, Truman is a movie out right now.

988
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:20,440
 Springsteen was obsessed with the Nebraska, the murders of Nebraska.

989
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,880
 You wrote the book In Cold Blood, right?

990
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,800
 That's right. I did.

991
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:28,000
 The Stark weather events, they were terrible tragedies,

992
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,760
 but very American, if you know what I mean.

993
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:34,880
 But ultimately, it's good that we're talking of this on Halloween

994
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,880
 because it really comes down to the boy didn't get enough candy.

995
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:41,880
 That's it. Oh, is that the that that was the root?

996
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,320
 That's really the crux of it.

997
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:46,040
 Yes. Stark weather was starved for some chocolate.

998
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:49,880
 OK, well, that's a shame. That's good to know.

999
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:53,080
 Yes. So, you know, is that something that could happen to future people

1000
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,280
 if they if they don't get enough Halloween candy?

1001
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,600
 Give your children lots of kisses.

1002
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,440
 Or they might murder people.

1003
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:01,720
 They might murder people.

1004
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:04,880
 Hershey it up every Halloween.

1005
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,320
 All right. Hashtag can't bury it up.

1006
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:10,160
 You had buried up, I should say.

1007
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,400
 You heard it from Trudeau.

1008
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,400
 Can't bury it up.

1009
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:16,200
 Did I can't bury the lead?

1010
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,400
 Now, Truman, did you get to see the Bruce Springsteen movie?

1011
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:22,160
 I certainly did see it was something.

1012
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:25,040
 What do you think? The boss is the boss.

1013
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:29,240
 Did you have a favorite moment in the in the film?

1014
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:31,360
 I enjoyed the credits rolling very much.

1015
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:36,360
 I like people to get their due.

1016
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:37,840
 My exit of the theater was lovely.

1017
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:41,920
 Yes, I appreciate seeing all the hard work that went into that mediocrity.

1018
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:47,920
 And it just reassures me that, you know, even when I'm working with Harper Lee,

1019
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:51,120
 you know, nothing's guaranteed.

1020
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:57,160
 Harper Lee, you know, I wrote that book, essentially.

1021
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:00,240
 OK, yes, what I was to say, thank you for coming by, Truman.

1022
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:02,040
 We appreciate it. You would say that.

1023
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:03,520
 Have a good night.

1024
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:08,440
 This is you did not see the Springsteen movie, is that correct?

1025
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:10,320
 I have not seen the Springsteen movie.

1026
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:11,600
 I'm actually going to watch it tomorrow.

1027
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:15,880
 OK, OK. We'll see if Paul and I did go see it together

1028
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:19,840
 the day of the day of the wedding and stuff.

1029
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:23,680
 I did get the re-release Nebraska album, though, that I've been listening to.

1030
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:28,280
 Oh, cool. And there's some gems on there. It's a fucking banger.

1031
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:31,440
 Yeah, no kidding around that re-release Nebraska.

1032
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:35,240
 I haven't listened because it's a multi album release.

1033
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:39,800
 And one of them is the him doing Nebraska at the Count Basie Theater.

1034
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:43,040
 Oh, I have that out myself.

1035
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,200
 Yeah. So it's really good.

1036
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:48,720
 I've listened to the to the 2025 remaster of it so far, and it is excellent.

1037
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:53,120
 I have a very exciting interview, actually, for you guys.

1038
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:54,800
 I haven't told you guys about it.

1039
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,560
 We're closing out the show with it.

1040
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:59,200
 The guests should be here any moment now.

1041
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,560
 This is really going to be exciting.

1042
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:05,760
 It could it could possibly be the last interview on Ice Cream

1043
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:09,360
 Social, depending on who is touched by who in this.

1044
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:12,760
 Oh, oh, good. They're here. They're here.

1045
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:17,280
 Ah, this is our guest for the end of the show here.

1046
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:20,040
 It is the death snail.

1047
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:24,200
 This is the snail that slowly crawls after all of us.

1048
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:27,440
 And if it touches us, we die. That's right.

1049
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:30,960
 So we have to we have to avoid being touched by this snail during this interview.

1050
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:34,400
 Thank you for coming by, snail.

1051
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:39,240
 I'm just going to start it walking towards your house last Thanksgiving.

1052
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:42,480
 Oh, well, I'm glad you could finally make it our way.

1053
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:45,280
 Are you aware that you were part of our

1054
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,840
 merchandise sales?

1055
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:51,400
 Our Kiss the Snail campaign is actually sold very well at our store.

1056
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:55,560
 Yes, I saw.

1057
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:58,480
 Boy, I hope I can one day afford a new shell.

1058
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:01,520
 Oh, sorry.

1059
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,920
 Is it a burden to kill everyone you touch?

1060
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:08,160
 Burden is a heavy word.

1061
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:11,040
 I do like my powers.

1062
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:14,120
 Oh, you like you kind of like being an arbiter of death.

1063
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:17,360
 When you're an incredibly slow moving mollusk,

1064
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,600
 you have few options in life.

1065
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:22,960
 But having the ability to kill things instantaneously

1066
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:26,360
 evens the odds a bit.

1067
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,720
 OK, I suppose it would.

1068
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,120
 I suppose it would.

1069
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:33,960
 Do you do you leave a traditional snail trail behind you after taking these lives?

1070
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:38,160
 It's somewhat traditional, but it has a design in it.

1071
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:43,240
 You know, that special S that people always make on their folders and things.

1072
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:44,440
 Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

1073
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,320
 That's what I leave behind me.

1074
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:51,080
 You leave the weird little S thing that looks the same, no matter how you look at it.

1075
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:54,320
 That's right, because I don't know if you're aware of this.

1076
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,640
 I'm also an automobile engineer.

1077
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,920
 I was not.

1078
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:02,120
 No, that's do you work for a specific dealership or anything?

1079
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:03,920
 No, I'm a self-employed.

1080
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:07,960
 I make my I'm kind of like, you know, make my own sort of deal.

1081
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:11,840
 You know, the tires have that S on it as well.

1082
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:15,720
 And, you know, that's to make the imprint very clear.

1083
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:21,760
 So when you drive one of my autos, everybody knows where your S car goes.

1084
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:28,440
 I want to thank Pinch, that's great.

 and for staying around for this bullshit.

1087
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:42,600
 If we can't go out on an S car fun,

1088
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:45,720
 I don't know what we can do.

1089
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:48,040
 I look at that S car go.

 I actually bake my wheels at a low temperature over a long period,

1153
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:44,320

01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:32,400
 on the top side of the thing. They'll be like, they're just crossed out.

1166
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,560
 They just took a sharpie to it.

1167
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:38,160
 Sharpie just blacked out, just cheap, just blacked it all out.

1168
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:42,480
 You motherfuckers. It's still blacked out.

1169
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:43,960
 I can't do the conversion in my head.

1170
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:45,960
