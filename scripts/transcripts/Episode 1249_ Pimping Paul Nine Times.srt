11
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:20,200
 It's time for Matt and Mattingly's ice cream social sitting in Pittsburgh

00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,780
 Pennsylvania that's Paul Mattingly. Sitting at sea it's Matt Donnelly sitting in

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,400
 Las Vegas the bad-ass me jacking the audio guy. We're preaching fun.

14
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:36,840
 I'm doing wonderful I'm out on the the seas outside of Canada. I said last week

15
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,680
 that I was gonna go to st. John Newfoundland and I was so excited. Turns

16
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,400
 out Canada's wicked wicked crazy with st. John's so it turns out it was st. John's

17
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,940
 New Brunswick and not St. John's Newfoundland. They're lousy with St. John's. Now I already have an

18
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:59,000
 affection for St. John and the Virgin Islands plus St. John's Newfoundland that I

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,600
 wasn't about to get off the boat for this St. New St. John. I was like I don't have room in my

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,760
 heart for a third St. John's. You have plenty of St. John's in your life you

21
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:15,120
 don't need more. Do any of these locations go by St. John's? Because that's a

22
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,920
 real thing you know. What going from St. John's to St. John's? Yeah well it's a

23
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,520
 there you remember Airwolf right? Of course I remember Airwolf. So Stringfellow

24
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,480
 Hawk yeah he was always looking for his brother

25
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,840
 St. John and that is a shortened way of saying St. John. So there were kids that

26
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,840
 were named St. John I just wondered if they ever if that ever applies to like

27
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:46,560
 cities. I'll open my porthole and ask. Okay. Anyone go by St. John? I'm just kidding my

28
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:57,680
 porthole over looks out into a wall. A wall in the boat? Yeah. My porthole looks out

29
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,800
 into the vast six feet away is a wall. That's what I. Oh you're just docked

30
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:14,200
 right now. No no no no. Oh no it's an internal porthole. It's an internal porthole. Oh my god. It is a glory porthole. I mean he might be docking

31
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:20,180
 right now as well. Oh yikes docking in a glory porthole. That's cameras from the

32
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:25,760
 waste up so we have no idea. We never will know. Are you ever gonna be on boats

33
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:33,040
 with Pipe to Plain again soon? I don't know. I'm on there they're joining the

34
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,760
 boat the ship that I'm on right now next week. Okay so ships in the night.

35
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,800
 We would have crossed paths on the day. Yeah. Like them getting on the way. Me

36
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,520
 getting off except that I am and now I have to get off early. Right. Here's the

37
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,320
 thing so I'm on the ship for four days and that's because originally they wanted

38
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,880
 me here for the week but the week started at Scoopfest and I said I can't

39
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,420
 do it I gotta go to Scoopfest. Right. Then I got this offer for Virgin Voyages to

40
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,360
 join Virgin and that was a two-week gig so I want to say yes to that and basically

41
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,640
 saying told by agent I will I will let go of this gig if it means you know if I

42
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:18,080
 have to just just to still do Virgin. Right. Yeah. And that would give me days

43
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,880
 off after Scoopfest. Would that be nice? So I was like there's no way they're

44
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,120
 gonna agree just to have me on this ship for four days but they're just going to

45
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,080
 just truncate the front and back end of the week and they did. Now you have

46
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:39,280
 discovered the true infinite money glitch that is cruise ship lines apparently.

47
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,120
 What also meant that means that I knew that I was getting on a performing like

48
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:52,560
 those I was doing shows. Right. And so was it when you got on? Yeah. I didn't do

49
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,340
 two shows that night. Wow. And then two shows the next night. Holy shit dude. How did that

50
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:03,840
 go? Luckily you were nice and rested. So yeah. So at Scoopfest I had the already

51
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,080
 had this hard task of it that I've never go away for three weeks and I'm away for

52
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,120
 three weeks and then on top of the three weeks I'm gone for on cruise ships I

53
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,320
 have two shows in Sparta New Jersey on October 16th and the Improv Jam reunion

54
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:21,320
 on October 18th. October 17th is the Sparta shows and so I had to pack for

55
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:27,200
 magic shows for all of those things plus materials you know I could go you know I

56
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,440
 go through materials things like that and and and so I was already pretty

57
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,700
 nerve-wracked plus I did magic at Scoopfest which means I had to bring stuff

58
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,240
 to Scoopfest so I had to bring it I had to perform and bring it home or whatever

59
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:46,000
 so the only chance I had to really pack with sanity was in the dinner break

60
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,460
 between daytime Scoopfest and nighttime Scoopfest. On Saturday. Yeah. Right. Which

61
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,680
 was a two-hour break and it was like a true two-hour break because we finished

62
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,400
 up right before the break started in the daytime session until we actually had

63
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,800
 about two hours between the daytime session and the jog versus nerd ball. And

64
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,840
 during Ice Cream Social I was getting notifications on my phone from Air

65
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,900
 Canada. Right. And I was like that's weird I mean I'm flying tomorrow but I can

66
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,320
 check in sure whatever. And they were and they were inappropriate messages right

67
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,120
 they were like dick pics and a lot of stuff. They were showing me that. They're

68
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,360
 basically saying no there was they were showing me mine and they're saying if

69
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,840
 you don't respond to these text messages we're putting these on the internet. So

70
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,240
 you didn't respond. And now they're out. Holy Mike Johnson!

71
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:46,400
 I don't know. Paul. Air Canada. Okay. I'd gotten an email like a week before

72
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,760
 whatever and I saw that they were shifting the time of my flight to like a

73
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,000
 half hour earlier and I said okay great. What I didn't realize was that they also

74
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:04,120
 shifted it to a day earlier. A day earlier than a half hour earlier. God damn! 24 hours and a half hour earlier. Yeah and this is Air Canada not not not my cruise

75
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,800
 booker right. Yeah right. The ticket was booked and then the airline moved it's the thing well they

76
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:15,600
 moved. Oh it's Air Canada so the times are metric. That explains it. That

77
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,000
 explains that explains the disconnect. It goes by how long it takes ice to melt.

78
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,040
 That's how they that's you know ancient ancient Phoenicians had sundials. Most

79
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:34,000
 things in Canada are based on how long it takes ice to melt. That's right. So I

80
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,920
 just spend the dinner break rescheduling my travel frantically just on the

81
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,080
 emergency line lines because suddenly I was not on the flight that I'm supposed

82
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,240
 to be on. Right. And and I should have been on there like the whole that's the

83
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,200
 whole thing and so I could. You know how to take the reservation but you don't

84
00:07:53,200 --> 00:08:02,040
 know how to hold the reservation. And I so I basically had to come back to the

85
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:07,120
 jack-versus-nerd ball without knowing what I was doing the next day and then

86
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,480
 at the end of the costume parade I got an email saying that I had to be on a

87
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:20,160
 flight at a 6 a.m. flight so I had to be at the airport at 445 in the morning.

88
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:28,000
 That is some bullshit. Bullshit. And then because it was a last-minute flight it

89
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,880
 wasn't direct so I had to take three flights to get to Canada. Holy fuck man.

90
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,640
 So I was three flights total of 15 hours by the time I got to my hotel. They let you

91
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,920
 sit on the wing. And then I had to sleep and get up right away and just get to the

92
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,040
 ship. And it was like go to the ship there's a guy on a bike who just goes

93
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,640
 Matt Donnelly he goes yeah he goes forgive me it's my day off and he's just

94
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,080
 dressed in like head-to-toe and beautiful biker riding bike outdoor gear.

95
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:05,200
 Right. And I was like. Forgive it. Stranger? Yeah. But they're waiting for you get in

96
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,520
 there. And I was like oh I said I can't have gotten here any faster than me

97
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,400
 meeting my driver on time and my driver getting me out of time. I don't know what

98
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:19,040
 I could have done. Yeah. Step on it. What do you mean they're waiting for me what yeah.

99
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,400
 There's an extra C note in it for you if you get me there in time for my show.

100
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:31,240
 I get around to the port and the port because we have no record of you being here.

101
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:37,560
 I was literally just told two minutes ago and a hundred feet ago that you were

102
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:46,280
 waiting for me inside. Yeah. Apparently not that guy. So finally a guy from business

103
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,960
 comes out and basically reprimands someone at the dock for looking up my

104
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,080
 thing improperly. And then that person being very defensive and I was listening

105
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:01,200
 to a very snippy conversation. Guys guys guys could you please have this

106
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,200
 uncomfortable conversation after I get on to the boat. I would like to get on

107
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,720
 to the boat. You guys could have this conversation for as long as you want

108
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,680
 after I'm gone. And so this is like normal little gangway that goes right up

109
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,080
 to the fourth deck. Yeah. And then there's a zigzaggy gangway really long

110
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,080
 gangway that goes up to the seventh deck. And the person from Princess

111
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,040
 gestures me to the zigzaggy gangway that goes up three stories and I have two

112
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,440
 giant banks and my my backpack and bags and I was like are you sure I can't go up

113
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:42,040
 the little one yeah. Yeah. But there's like no that's where most of the guests

114
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:52,840
 are getting off to go into it's a Saint Joe to Halifax. And so I go to move like

115
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,520
 all my stuff and there's a guy you know working for the cruise like an eager

116
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,920
 young young guy English out of first language goes can I help you with that. I

117
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:07,320
 was like boy can you. You sure can. And he takes me up but I'm in a crew cabin not in a

118
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,960
 guest cabin. Yeah. And so we get on the ship and I was like showing him my room

119
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,400
 number and he's trying to get me to this the seventh deck where the crew for the

120
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,200
 regular cabins. Right. I'm trying to explain to him no no I'm in a crew

121
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,840
 cabin. Yeah. So he's stopping as he stops like a janitor and they and they speak

122
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,480
 Spanish to each other and the janitor's like no follow me. And I go through this

123
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,800
 ornate path where all said I'm like outside of the ship on this weird deck

124
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,200
 area where I'm like I don't know if this is supposed to be here then boom I'm

125
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,440
 into a crew area and then into finally into my cabin. And the good news is my

126
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,200
 cabin is 50 feet from the theater. Oh that's nice. Oh that's that's big. That's

127
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,200
 big. Yeah. Yeah. So I get all my stuff from the theater I'm back in the thing

128
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,400
 and then I realize I should go get like a cup of coffee or something to eat or

129
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:03,880
 something and I am walking aimlessly in the crew area. Please someone give me

130
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,200
 coffee. Try to find your way out. Yeah. No one no one showed me how to get out to the

131
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:14,600
 regular ship. Yeah. And so I see two guys and I'm like I'm just trying to get to

132
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,240
 like the I don't know regular part of the ship or like where the passengers go or

133
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,920
 whatever and they go who are you are you supposed to be back here what are you

134
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:27,080
 doing and I was like oh no. You've done it now. There is a there is a hard line

135
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,560
 like I said when we were doing second city tours we had a very fortunate

136
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,280
 situation where we had passes that were literally crew and passenger status.

137
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,640
 Right. We had both so we could we could go anywhere but yeah if you haven't been

138
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:47,360
 designated they get snippy. Yeah. But they they they figured it all out. Did you do

139
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,720
 a little quick bit of table side. Honestly or did they harpoon you. I straight up

140
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,760
 just I straight up just walked away. I walked up to another floor. I'm good. And

141
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,440
 then I went up there. You just left them arguing about who you might be. I was

142
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:09,440
 like I don't want to I don't want to do this. And now that's awesome. That's

143
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:20,760
 awesome. You know what I can find it on my own. You guys have a good day. Never

144
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:28,040
 mind. Yeah. So yeah it was it was it was it was a it was a big adventure to get

145
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,960
 here and then just do two shows right away and they went really well. Good. I

146
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,000
 was like I was like this could get this could have gone a lot better if I had if

147
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:46,320
 I was able to sleep. Yeah. Those shows were all right. Imagine if I had slept. So

148
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,000
 listener Chris Lowry is on the the he listens to the show and he and his wife

149
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,560
 book book travel for people. Yeah. Go with Lisa.com that's where they help set

150
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,080
 up people want to see me on the ship and stuff. And so Lisa his wife is on on the

151
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:07,800
 ship and I met her before. She's come to my Elton shows. They offered to take me

152
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:13,000
 out to dinner at the beautiful Crown Grill. Nice. On my on the second night I

153
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,600
 was on board and then they were telling me about how they ran into people who

154
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,480
 saw my show on St. John. I was like oh I don't think they're gonna tell me a

155
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,400
 story where they complimented me. She was like yeah one guy was like yeah it

156
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,480
 wasn't really for me a mind reader guy or whatever and I was like why are you

157
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:39,480
 telling me the story? Yeah. What the hell? Oh that's gonna make this next story super awkward then

158
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,760
 because I just saw several people that hated your show. I understand. I'm not

159
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,880
 for everyone. As I said as I said at Scoopfest you know you know you're not

160
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:53,040
 for everyone but as soon as you hear it it's devastating. They were also very

161
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,800
 critical about my outfit that I was wearing at the time. It really hurt. But

162
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,240
 they talked about how they basically said like oh we're going to the and

163
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,720
 basically the Crown Grill but they said the other name for another ship's

164
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:18,240
 steakhouse. Yeah. Cagney's I think it was called. Okay. And so then that so I go oh

165
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,040
 so they were coming here to this thing tonight that's what they told you they

166
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:28,480
 invited you to dinner to join them here and I go yeah so they're here yeah and I

167
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,040
 go like oh okay and we look around or whatever we don't see them. Just now

168
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:39,000
 getting back to my room from getting coffee for this episode I end up taking

169
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,720
 an elevator and two guys are like oh you're the mind bender guy and I go yeah

170
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:52,080
 yeah we saw your show the other night. I go yeah and then nothing.

171
00:15:52,080 --> 00:16:00,320
 Yeah okay and then we saw the whole thing we saw all of it and then the

172
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,240
 awkward silence the guy goes I think we saw you the night at Cagney's you're

173
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,040
 having dinner with Lisa and I go oh my god it's them. It's the guys they were

174
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:17,200
 talking to. It's the eyes not for me. It's not for me guy. Amazing. I'm face to

175
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:26,360
 face with two guys who definitely did not enjoy my show. Fucking shit. That's

176
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,200
 great. And it was like a tea like a bet like a murder she wrote mystery novel

177
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,600
 where like I had the key I had the key that they they named the steakhouse the

178
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:41,360
 wrong steakhouse and it's the only thing they could have said to clue you in. This

179
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:48,240
 is confirmed but they did not enjoy my show. Yeah. We saw your show the other

180
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:59,040
 night. It was a show. There were chairs and everything. Hey Eureka is making a

181
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,080
 great point in the chat here. She's saying Matt is upset that Noah

182
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,920
 compliments his show but when he runs into audience members he doesn't

183
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,620
 compliment them either and that's a really good point. Yeah. I have to go

184
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:14,360
 back and tell those guys nice hats. Nice hats assholes. We have to do that. Oh you

185
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,520
 guys were great at Cagney's the other night. I saw you order that steak. Amazing

186
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,520
 work. Yeah well Eureka I'm not upset that no one compliments my show. I'm thrown

187
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,360
 off when people insist on telling me a story that someone did not enjoy my show.

188
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:34,200
 That is weird man. That's weird. I have no problem hearing nothing. That's

189
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,640
 different. That's different. Is that what is that where your brain goes after you've

190
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,960
 booked people on thousands of travel experiences is that you just get to like

191
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,800
 oh yeah well you know a lot of people just hate you and they don't really. Yes.

192
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:54,360
 I mean people definitely get into that state of mind of like none of this

193
00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:00,320
 matters to me so why would it matter to you. Right. Yes. Right. That's the

194
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,480
 energy of like we're just shooting the breeze I just know this I know that. Yeah.

195
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,240
 These guys hated your show but it like in their mind she's sitting there

196
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,600
 thinking like oh Matt has done this show so many times. Well surely people have

197
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,320
 disliked the show before. It can't bother him it's just water off a duck's

198
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,720
 back like who cares. We're being harsh too. It wasn't that he hated it just wasn't for

199
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:30,000
 him. Oh no no he actually sent me a message as well. I have that to read in school mail. He did. He hated it.

200
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,360
 The way the story actually goes is that the subtext of the stories is told to me

201
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:42,800
 is basically didn't didn't believe I was an actual mind reader. Oh really. Well in that case I've got good news for them. They were they were right. So this is

202
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:50,120
 Simon Cowell's cousin. I should make no claims during my show that I am like I

203
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,760
 set the premise of the trip but I do I do know I basically like all of my stuff

204
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,440
 as if I'm doing any mind reading bits it's all comedic. Right. Like I get the

205
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,600
 results correct but I all I'm trying to do is make sure it's funny along the

206
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,560
 way and that's the it is the weird it's the weird thing I imagine but you it's

207
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,440
 a you can't deny it if someone goes like I don't think you really do that you're

208
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,680
 like that's right that's correct and so if you're upset with me for even towing

209
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,240
 the line for claiming to have superpowers I could if that upsets you I

210
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:25,640
 get it like I can't do anything about it. It's it's it's it's the deal. Right. All

211
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:33,480
 right I did it Jacob. Nailed it. I said Orica's name correctly on air. Oh nice. Oh

212
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,880
 I am impressed. I know I noted that I have never heard I'd never heard the

213
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,960
 pronunciation correct and I was like oh it's Orica. Yeah yeah took me 12 years and

214
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,560
 and herself in my abracadabra to get it right but that's what happened. Finally

215
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:55,440
 got it. Oh man Jacob you're gonna ask me for a sponsor and I can't access my

216
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,760
 phone so I'm gonna go over to a webpage and open it up there. Oh nice. Well while

217
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,600
 you're doing that we'll just we'll just talk a little bit about scoop fest here

218
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,040
 we just had our big scoop fest. It was amazing. It was fantastic. We are all

219
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,960
 almost recovered and by all I mean like fucking everybody I imagine. I mean I

220
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:19,680
 don't buddy. Yeah everybody got beat. I didn't get COVID this time. Well there's

221
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:27,120
 that. That I know of. Yeah but also like legit like I felt like everyone not just

222
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,040
 us I felt like the attendees were like Jesus by the end of it. Yeah well

223
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,560
 actually I was having a conversation with Ryre the night of the loadout

224
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,200
 because we even commented during the during the show during the scoop fest

225
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,680
 podcast that the energy kind of like went weird in the room for a while and

226
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,440
 we and we were kind of chatting about that and the energy of the of the whole

227
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:56,760
 thing and it really seems like everyone came to scoop fest as you know in a way

228
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:02,600
 that you would expect which is a relief you know they're coming to scoop fest as

229
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:11,400
 this as a big energy relief thing and especially by the end of it everyone was

230
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:18,240
 kind of like sitting in that lull. Yeah I don't know it was it was a it was an

231
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,080
 interesting it was an interesting thing. Yeah I think I think so I think I think

232
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,560
 this I really you know we talked about this on a few episodes back but like I

233
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:34,280
 that is it is a crazy time yeah and I think and I think during Penn Sunday

234
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,720
 School live like Penn really hung a lantern on it in terms of talking to his

235
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,640
 children yeah you guys don't know but this actually is incredibly unusual

236
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,440
 right and like what's happening is impossible yeah and so you know none of

237
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,280
 this that is happening can happen it's none it's all impossible but it's

238
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:56,320
 happening anyway yeah yeah yeah and the show's also 12 years old or whatever 11

239
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:02,280
 years old and so are indeed our we've all gotten older we're older and so is

240
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:09,880
 everyone else maybe the evening festivities started 7 and not 8 wrap up

241
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:15,320
 around 7 I don't know I don't know about all that we're all gonna go to the

242
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:24,160
 sizzler and have dinner around 4 no I mean like something to spearheads the

243
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,600
 the the nighttime programming and stuff I was like panicking trying to add stuff

244
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,720
 and then by the time it all went down I was like oh I put a lot of stuff up here

245
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,960
 oh yeah we need we need I did have I did maybe over program some some of some

246
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,240
 nights there was activities no lulls though that's for sure no I mean to go

247

249
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,360
 it was the first time they'd seen a bucket show and I was like well hope you

250
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:05,120
 like that one because it's never gonna get any better that was actively telling

251
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,640
 people to not come back to future bucket shows because that one was that was to

252
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,620
 be the best one I don't know if I went quite that far but I just said that is

253
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:19,240
 the best it's close yeah as close if you came to see both those shows shit I

254

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,800
 got really red to the point where scoops were like are you okay I had to let them

294
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,400
 know that that's just what the Mattingly jeans do I just get real red looking I'm

295
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:02,880
 fine I didn't I didn't burn like you can see I don't have a sunburn at all but I

296
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,440
 just I got really red I look like I'm gonna explode when I'm mowing the lawn

297
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,400
 out here like if I come inside just be at and hands it's like oh my god you're a

298
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,400
 lobster I'm like it's just what I do my body just it gets that's you know that's

299
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,480
 how I'm getting the heat out it comes to the front but yeah I do I radiate

300
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:29,600
 exactly a pine of plane played the barbecue they were fantastic that was

301
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,320
 the that was the biggest swing I did I pulled for this one was that my friends

302
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:40,760
 from Ireland were all off they weren't they weren't obligated to be on ships so

303
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:45,840
 I said if you're available let's get you in here and so they I flew them in from

304
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:55,280
 Ireland to be here is their first time in Vegas and they just were absolutely

305
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:01,480
 blown away by the exhausted and I had to write them a note being like you know

306
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:07,820
 it's very common that people love Las Vegas and also think three days is

307
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:13,080
 plenty right oh yeah and that was the case for them they were definitely like

308
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:19,520
 just wiped at the end sure but they yeah they crushed it at Jacob's house and

309
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,880
 they're they're just that I love those guys so much and they're so charming and

310
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,560
 they're such they're great at what they do and it's they've such different

311
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:32,240
 personalities and they all find a way to really shine and it's really funny and I

312
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,320
 like them and so yeah they I was I was very emotional watching them play in

313
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,640
 Jacob's backyard yeah it was great it was a very scary deal for me we were

314
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,600
 supposed to have you you're talking about the wind we were supposed to have

315
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:49,320
 another entertainer at the at the barbecue but the wind kept Michael Doe

316
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:54,640
 from being able to juggle at the barbecue right so much no it's Parkinson's yes

317
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,120
 and he asked it he said yes to doing school first before he knew he had it

318
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:03,600
 right because obligation and then he has to juggle you know 500 throws every day

319
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,320
 to make sure he can keep movement in his body and be able to do what he does for

320
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,960
 a living while he fights this vicious disease and then it's fucking windy as

321
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,900
 hell yeah it's windy we might not go and I said oh you can't you don't want to go

322
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:22,480
 he goes well I can do it the show will be funny but there will be no juggling in

323
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:31,120
 it and then he said no successful juggling throwing but not not catching

324
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:38,800
 okay let's let's let's just call it so I was aggravated too because it was like

325
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:45,520
 it was perfect all afternoon and then like 20 minutes before Godot was was

326
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,760
 set to go up that's when the wind kicked up yeah like it was it was and then like

327
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,920
 half an hour later it was it was back to being like there was a light breeze but

328
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:58,360
 it was fine after that still but yeah it was crazy it was crazy for a minute yeah

329
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:04,000
 yeah oh and then but he still was phenomenal yeah one then he did the

330
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,880
 variety show yeah yeah yeah so then that night we surprised the audience with a

331
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,560
 reuniting of two characters in a clown shortly after the very recent breakup of

332
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:22,480
 the podcast to do a podcast battle Jimmy Sonina dressed in full clown regalia he

333
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:29,080
 did was delightfully ironic because in their Cirque show it's Johnny and RJ

334
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,500
 have to wear a lot of makeup and Jimmy doesn't and so it's very funny for Jimmy

335
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:39,760
 coming full makeup while they were there goes and we had delightful trivia

336
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:46,000
 battle hosted by Mikey for between between us and they won yep they did

337
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 spoiler alert because we're gonna put those in our patreon feed like always

338
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,680
 and so that was really fun then while I was doing my shows at the Magic Castle a

339
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:02,240
 month ago someone on my special like touring company feed on my abracadabra

340
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,820
 babble which is a whatsapp thread right I share my my all my all my adventures

341
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:11,400
 and someone said why aren't you and Nick doing scoop fest and I literally just

342
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,240
 turned to him backstage like good point Nick what are you doing this dates like

343
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:22,160

344
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:27,520

345
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,600

348
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,240
 assistant Matt this is this is a running gag right that was really funny that bit

349
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,400
 was funny Alex Ramone had a bit in his show where he has someone called

350
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,920
 misdirection and then his regular show he used to show girl as misdirection and

351
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,880
 we did the Magic Castle I came out as misdirection and the foolers tour I came

352
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,200
 out as misdirection and telling me to just improvise and dance and pretend I'm

353
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:08,160
 a showgirl is not a tall not a tall ask for me in any way no I I will I will fake

354
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,640

357
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:30,120
 I still get credit great even better and so yeah we have to do that bit and man

00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,880
 yeah the show Nick and I have done is really come together now we've done it

363
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:01,160
 you're gonna see right now because you're like I guess she's a juggler but

364
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:06,440
 like not really a juggling show like it's just this beautiful piece she does

365
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,800

 she told me you know I hope I'm not betraying any confidences but she said

369
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,200
 that they were a little like what I don't know or whatever and she basically

370
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,560
 was like just let me do it yeah yeah because like whenever she does she did

 on board up until like days before bailing out there are people who want to

414
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,920
 do it but then like took jobs a month ago that left town like and it just was

415

00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,880
 we did this really weird thing in the show hot trashed or the pandemic where

443
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,680
 he tries to make a banana daiquiri while trying to still hit a triangle on the

444
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,060
 notes during this one song it's this conflict between trying to make the

445
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:49,080
 daiquiri and at the triangle all while he's wearing just a banana a skirt made

446
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:56,040
 of actual bananas right and it was great to have some equal representation from

447
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:01,800
 the male side of the burlesque world and then I had Jonas Wilburton and I forgot

448
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:08,680
 that I was also burlesque a bit yeah yeah but he was a very funny John John

449
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:15,360
 McEnroe uh-huh where he has the audience hit him with tennis balls and so he does

450
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:20,000
 a seer wheel which you know those of you in the circus world are familiar but

451
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,360
 those you may not be it's a big giant steer steel wheel it looks like a giant

452
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:31,000
 hula hoop a steel ring that he is able to manipulate and swirl around and this

453
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,880
 was a steel ring with a radius of about what six and a half feet or not radio

454
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,920
 yeah what's the thing across the circle whatever that distance is radius right

455
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:46,560
 yeah this was the smallest stage he'd ever perform this yeah we only gave him

456
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:53,120
 eight feet of space he had done it on a on a nine-footer I think maybe mm-hmm he

457
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:56,280
 he had kept next to me like there's a version I can do without the wheel I

458
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,200
 said then let's do that and he goes well just send me the dimensions anyway and I

459
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,720
 said the dimensions and he goes oh that's pretty small I go then don't do

460
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:06,440
 the wheel just do the other part and he goes okay well I'll bring the wheel just

461
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,760
 in case and I go okay and then he sends me we load in and I see it's a carpet

462
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:16,200
 and stage which is again not ideal for zero it's carpeted so if you don't want

463
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,400
 to do the wheel do not do the wheel and yes all right I probably won't but I'll

464
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:24,440
 bring it just in case yeah and then not only was it carpeted but it had ent

465
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:32,800
 leaves and leftover banana daiquiri all over it tomato juice yes it had tomato

466
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:41,280
 seeds banana juice and fucking leaves so I would I had been sketching stuff away

467
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,560
 with my foot the whole time because I knew that wheel was coming trying to

468
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,920
 make sure that was oh yeah but we all were we were all like try to clean the

469
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,160
 stage as much as possible I told him afterwards I said that was fucking brave

470
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:59,200
 dude and it was amazing but it was it was also really really funny and really

471
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:04,840
 really awesome one coming up on in November he's doing a show over at the

472
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,120
 Vegas Theatre Company so we're gonna have him on as a guest oh great great

473
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:15,120

474
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:20,620
 Stephen Roberts came by crush to do a stand-up yeah that's not a not a show

475
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:26,240
 without Stephen yeah and without personal highlight for me was Michael

476
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,560
 Gudeau yeah yeah and seeing Mike do it seem like you don't do it it was so good

477
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:39,520
 it was so funny and holy fuck yeah we talked about it at the at the con but

478
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:45,360
 uh you forget we're friends with Michael Gudeau we hang out we chat with Michael

479
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:50,040
 Gudeau we all forget that you get Michael Gudeau on stage and he's a

480
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:54,520
 goddamn killer I mean it's just what he's gonna get on stage and just do it

481
00:43:54,520 --> 00:44:01,800
 it's crazy to me too I was lucky enough to go see him with the Lance Burton show

482
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,760
 way back in the day right and this is when I was first working with second

483
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:15,480
 city as a full-time second city and a class act that Lance Burton is he called

484
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:20,640
 me out in the show had me stand up and wave to the people cuz nice cuz Lance

485
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,080
 Burton knows how to be a fucking entertainer yeah you know we help each

486
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:29,760
 other we talk each other up right that's what it's about and that that had that

487
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:38,160
 moment has stuck with me and just like the fact that Michael Gudeau and Mac

488
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:45,000
 King both specifically came out to watch us do the bucket show I got I put it up

489
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,920
 on our Facebook and whatnot Mac tweeted about it because he loves come see us

490
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:55,820
 which is just so amazing to me cuz he's one of my heroes too we have we have

491
00:44:55,820 --> 00:45:02,920
 fucking strip performer royalty at this fucking thing yeah like real deal you

492
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:08,520
 can't get any higher on the totem pole how many shows did he say he'd done it

493
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:14,880
 was 19 years 19 years thousands and thousands yeah I mean it's nuts and I

494
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:21,360
 just forget like he just gets the audience right in that pocket and as soon

495
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:25,720
 as soon as they're there you're like oh I forgot it's just cruises yeah from

496
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:31,040
 here like it just he just is so funny and there's so many gags and he just

497
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:36,920
 nails them and it just was like oh god it was great he really you really that

498
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,080
 was the second time I was very emotional at scoop fest was was that right there

499
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:44,040
 was really awesome it's a big moment it's a big moment I again I'm just I'm

500
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:49,800
 just honored that that not to say that Harrison's ice stacking prediction via

501
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:55,840
 9/11 theme didn't really I loved that too my brother was involved in that trick

502
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:00,560
 and that made it even more special for me it's only it's only appropriate

503
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,520
 because your brother was involved in the in the real day too right involved

504
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:09,720
 involved is a big way to say helped out with building seven but I mean you know

505
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:21,480
 you sure you say what you want to say involved masterminded I know he won't

506
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,480
 take credit for the master minding of it but that's only because he's modest

507
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:31,360
 then we had our mouth finger bottle competition oh yes oh my gosh it gets

508
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:38,000
 better every year I so all through scoop fest I make it a point so we you know

509
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,360
 our room there at the Orleans our big our big convention room there at the

510
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:45,000
 Orleans it's right off of the main hall in their convention space there's other

511
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,320
 conventions going on while we're there there was some religious thing going on

512
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,320
 on one side of us there was a family reunion going on on the other side of

513
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:59,160
 us so I made it a point to as much as possible keep those main doors open

514
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:04,860
 but no no no figure but I'll just during the whole goddamn thing it is it is

515
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:09,300
 entertaining for me to watch people walk past those doors it's the reason that I

516
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:12,360
 keep them open I love watching you watching watching people look in and be

517
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:18,520
 like oh I do it every year I love it during my there was a crowd of people at

518
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:27,880
 the doors with just pure confused look it was great at one point I went to you

519
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:32,360
 know use the facilities and I was in a bathroom stall in the men's room and I

520
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:36,320
 heard two guys talking go like yeah they're not really checking any badges

521
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,040
 over there that whatever that scoop thing is going over there and then the

522
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:45,200
 other goes yeah but like what the hell's going on over there one guy's like we

523
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,800
 could just go in there they're not gonna stop us and the other guys like yeah but

524
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:56,560
 should we do I want to do that dare I dare I let my freak flag fly what I'm

525
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:00,320
 trying to put an obelisk I believe inside of me I don't know how they were

526
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,840
 gonna do it that makes me laugh they're not checking badges like you wouldn't

527
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,120
 know like you wouldn't stick out like a sore fucking thumb if you weren't a

528
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:13,160
 scoop or if you weren't at least down to clown this year our mystery our mystery

529
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:17,120
 gift was a fez yeah where you could bejeweled so we had a bejeweling

530
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,480
 station you could you could you could which was a stroke of genius by the way

531
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,880
 that bejeweling station was that worked out well that goes that I mean easier

532
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,080
 than that goes up Michael Osroth is basically our director of scoop fest at

533
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:34,760
 this point he really is he did a fantastic job with these these turned out

534
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:39,320
 awesome he kicks everything uphill for us well we tried it well we all pull our

535
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:44,800
 hair out trying to pull off school fest and and acts as a wonderful ambassador he

536
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:51,360
 and Laurie in the party room to help really initiate and introduce other

537
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:55,080
 scoops to each other in the party room really gets the conversations going and

538
00:48:55,080 --> 00:49:01,560
 that that vibe carries on the show itself we were running in the new tariff shit

539
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:06,960
 we were running all kinds of stuff yeah and I we really wanted pink robes to

540
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,480
 continue the robe theme to figure out the Neapolitan effect we had vanilla now

541
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:18,400
 we have a strawberry and and and then what's coming next chocolate robes I

542
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:27,880
 said get warm and some experience pain I do an idea to mess with it okay but but

543
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:34,200
 I don't remember the game of the idea of Fes but then Fes is like I think it was

544
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,520
 me it might have been you I mean we could look through that we could look

545
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,560
 through the text but I think it was me I'm not taking I know it wasn't me so

546
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,440
 that's I'll give you full credit okay it was me it was it was you or it was you

547
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,920
 or Michael yeah me and Michael I think but Mike but again so many times were

548
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,340
 like oh because of this is getting expensive because of this we can't do it

549
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:54,760
 or whatever and else fraud just kept after it yeah to make sure that we had

550
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,160
 everything we wanted to deliver to the scoops the way we wanted yeah I have

551
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:02,480
 ideas and Michael actually makes them happen

552
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:09,040
 it's yeah exactly ideas yeah those of you guys listening just just picture

553
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:13,840
 casino floor and a bunch of people in pink robes and maroon fezzes with a big

554
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:18,280
 not a cult on the back we're going in and out of the casino right and it is

555
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:24,680
 the best site it is the funniest thing to walk into it's just so funny it's so

556
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:32,840
 good it's just great so yeah and during all this yeah I think I think we'd figure

557
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:38,640
 it out we had a documentary crew running around during all this yes

558
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:48,000

 outdid himself again this year oh uh we should say on the show too several

600
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:22,160
 people asked about it at scoop fest people saw some medical attendance

601
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:28,200
 checking out Mikey at one point that was just a it was a very minor thing no big

602
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:33,400
 deal everybody is perfectly fine it was the casino being a little overly

603
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:39,200
 cautious just having their people check check Mikey out after a little slip and

604
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:43,320
 fall that we checked on him he was okay yeah everybody's good they were they

605
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:49,840
 were everybody was healthy and happy oh then we had oh Celestia thank you

606
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:54,800
 scuba cabra in the chat for reminding me Celestia was there doing caricatures

607
00:54:54,800 --> 00:55:01,160
 yes jock versus third ball whole every time I walked over to see what she had

608
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:06,680
 done for for a new group of people over there it was more disgusting and more

609
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:12,240
 wonderful well anything I will say my brother was like oh we should get a we

610
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:18,080
 should get a caricature and so I did play my scoop card and got cut sees in

611
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:25,640
 line to do a dare you I know but it was you know I see my brother maybe twice a

612
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:31,720
 year if I'm lucky in person so it was really nice to actually get a moment to

613
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:37,480
 come to have this and we've got a year we have to get Celestia to do one of the

614
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:42,640
 three of us yes yes we should well I mean shit she'll do that hard to go sit

615
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:47,360
 for that anytime you know what maybe we can have her do that during the zoom

616
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:52,000
 because we're having her on soon we can do that because I'd love to I'd love to

617
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,240
 get one and put out put it up in the new chart well we'll talk we'll talk to her

618
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:59,680
 about that when we have her on next and see if she can just watch us during a

619
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,440
 zoom if that would be enough for her to get us I'm sure it would would work yeah

620
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:10,280
 so she was incredible like and also I had a personal highlight with the

621
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:18,000
 Pollywood Squares that fucking tell us about Pollywood Square what happened

622
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,960
 there so I was a little worried because of the board I was kind of like all this

623
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:27,840
 work into this fucking thing and if this doesn't go well it's gonna be the worst

624
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:32,560
 but then Ryar summed it up. Last year at SkooFest I was like the only note I have was

625
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:37,040
 not enough Paul was not enough Paul that was my whole thing and so like like we did a

626
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,840
 lot of stuff a lot of things but Paul you know was not I basically was like

627
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,840
 Paul is funny we're trying to get him involved we were trying to get you to

628
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:47,680
 host a little bit of the trivia battles and so the adjustments we made was let's

629
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,280
 let's take on everybody in trivia so that it's right it's it's Paul and us

630
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:56,400
 against everybody instead of having two podcasts face each other right and then

631
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,880
 my brain was like oh Hollywood Squares but everyone's Paul that's Paul's

632
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:06,120
 characters all of Paul's characters and I we reach out big there's a way to do

633
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:11,400
 with technology but I go no no I want a physical clunky awkward big square yes

634
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:17,000
 where we have to move squares around Paul and I of course turned to Ryar

635
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,600
 Appledorn to be like you you know what I'm talking about you know what this

636
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:27,600
 means so Ryar Appledorn made the biggest clunkiest Hollywood Squares board that

637
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:32,080
 could even fit through the door right with hangable X's and O's it was like

638
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:37,800
 nine feet what was it was like nine feet by nine feet it was huge yeah yeah and and that

639
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:44,000
 was the the thing Ryar and and Mike were bringing it out and Ryar said they

640
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,760
 couldn't hardly fit it through the door right and it started off well they

641
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,360
 couldn't fit it through the door that's why they had to come through the a

642
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:53,920
 different area from backstage on stage it started to crumple and bend and fuck

643
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:59,400
 up and the moment it started to just fall apart Ryar was just like oh this is

644
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:04,320
 gonna be perfect and he was right he was right the stupidity of it all just

645
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:10,840
 added just layers of dumb and it just oh it was so good it was down you were you

646
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:17,360
 were Paul Lind Johnny Australia yeah Truman Capote which is a new one in the

647
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:25,400
 day Mumra Mumra my favorite Paul Stanley vampire Bill Cosby

648
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:32,080
 barrel child barrel child yeah oh man and it was we were just asking trivia

649
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:37,160
 questions and making Paul's characters answer all of them Paul just came

650
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:41,520
 buckled right into the format of knowing how to play Hollywood Squares and I

651
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:48,280
 watched a lot as a kid yeah yeah and it was hysterical it was so fun it's really

652
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:52,800
 good I was like and I was like you were like I would know I was like this is I

653
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:57,960
 as soon as it came in my head I was like hit it's in and it was floating is like

654
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:01,760
 I could we could do this multiple times like I was like if anything short I was

655
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:09,880
 like do another round with more care even one point Jake was like well if

656
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,320
 it's good and I was like no this is good I don't know why there was doubting I

657
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:21,720
 don't know why there was doubting this pimping Paul nine times is exactly what

658
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:25,320
 the show needs and at the end Paul was almost guilty about how well I went he

659
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:34,160
 said so it felt a little self-indulgent and I was like you're festival it's true

660
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:40,240
 yeah yeah we're at a festival of you talking about that's all good we're at a

661
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:45,660
 festival about you yeah and we are celebrating a show that has your name in

662
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:51,520
 the title it was it's it's possibly a little self-indulgent in some way the

663
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:55,240
 whole thing is self-indulgent right now on the list right with mouth finger

664
00:59:55,240 --> 01:00:00,120
 butthole it is now just a it's just on the list yeah yeah it's like that could

665
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:08,560
 be done at churnouts too yeah yeah well now we've got an idea for it for for

666
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:13,880
 zoom too I've got an idea for it for on camera oh hell yeah yeah yeah mini

667
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,720
 version that Paul can just stick his head through that sounds fucking

668
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:25,200
 fantastic it's gonna be great that is good good good it was fucking hot shit

669
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:30,840
 and it made me laugh too so that was great yeah I'll tell you what else Paul

670
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:35,040
 is gonna stick his head through and that's the following sponsor pizza for

671
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:39,480
 your hands that's right no more chewing with that pesky mouth of yours now

672
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:51,900
 there's pizza for hands hello I'm Reginald Felicity Guinevere and I have

673
01:00:51,900 --> 01:01:00,000
 invented pizza mittens that's right pizza mittens cooked fresh every day

674
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:08,520
 made to order slathered in the finest of pasta sauces and mozzarella cheese the

675
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:14,440
 mittens are then placed on your hand piping hot and it's like the old Edward

676
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:18,900
 40 hands days remember those days remember being an Edward 40 hands do

677
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:23,340
 you ever have friends do that to you and when 40 hands they would take a cold 40

678
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:29,320
 of alcohol and they would duct tape the 40 to your hand and then you had to

679
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:34,140
 drink the 40 because it was so cold to drink the 40 quickly to stop all the

680
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:43,280
 cold really fast is a similar thing but with pizza as mittens and so the pizza

681
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,900
 comes on it's pretty hot so you got to eat the pizza very quickly to get the

682
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:50,840
 heat off your hands but then the heat goes in your mouth and you burn your

683
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:55,720
 mouth but it's still really good it's still really really good yes yes yes

684
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:05,040
 yes and her haste groups to check out pizza mittens

685
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:10,800
 so then what else what else was oh Gabrielle Lester just destroyed she

686
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:20,560
 just crushed Gabrielle yeah so fun and that was Carrie's mom who was up there

687
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:27,000
 with her I believe she's just known as mama scoop now yeah so so for those of

688
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,880
 you who don't know I hope I'm not putting anybody on blast here but Carrie

689
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:35,920
 brought her sister and her mother which is great and I think her sister spent

690
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,200
 more time than she thought she would hanging out with some of the events her

691
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:43,240
 mom certainly did her mom wasn't sure she was gonna enjoy it at all clearly

692
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:47,560
 she did oh by the end of it her mom was in yeah and I thought even by the end of

693
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:52,400
 it halfway through it mom was in I believe this was on Friday they got the

694
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:58,640
 hard news that their brother had suffered a stroke mmm oh jeez yes and so

695
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:03,560
 that yeah mom was upset sister's upset or Carrie's upset they're all fucking you

696
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:08,520
 know it's rough because it's in fees in Florida right what can you do

697
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:16,080
 luckily scoopfest acted as a distraction and by the end of the event his health

698
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:21,240
 had improved he was doing much better of course still you know not an ideal

699
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:30,800
 situation but things are going better and yeah yeah yeah so I think not only

700
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:35,640
 did it like it helped as a distraction and everything but yeah it was really

701
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:41,160
 cool seeing mom scoop find out what this community is all about and kind of just

702
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:45,880
 get with it it's pretty crazy the shenanigans that is involved in this

703
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:55,280
 community yeah yeah but yeah Gabrielle was was great and then we brought back

704
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,960
 the pie the plane people to play for everybody to play for all the people not

705
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:03,960
 just the barbecue and of course that culminated with sweet Caroline we finally

706
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:08,680
 got to combine the the two bits the one the one that we knew yelling fucking

707
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:15,480
 whore in between the bits and then again a great time to be looking out of the

708
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:22,520
 front door of the convention hall and watching the people walking by oh I bet

709
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:26,720
 I bet did they lose their fucking minds I bet those oh pure confusion it's

710
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:34,440
 wonderful and then adding in I don't believe you you're making it up and so

711
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:40,000
 we finally got both bits combined into sweet Caroline yeah and while we were

712
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,800
 shouting it Phil just turned the Fionn and said what is happening right now

713
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:49,800
 right who knows they know they were confused but they loved it right I mean

714
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:53,360
 they they just yeah well here's the funniest thing okay so one of the things

715
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:57,200
 that happened behind the scenes was you know they say we'll take requests and we

716
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:02,000
 hadn't take a break to do Hollywood Squares and so in the break people

717
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,640
 come up to me give me different songs you know one of things that what's it

718
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:08,860
 called Princess of the City or whatever that's not the famous Irish song is by

719
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:15,520
 the Pogues oh it's a what's it called a New York City fairy tale or something

720
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:19,120
 like that yeah fairy tale of New York that's what it's called very very New

721
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:23,040
 York it's a traditionally Chris it's a Christmas song but it's it's crazy it's

722
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:28,160
 about the deterioration of this long-term relationship these two people

723
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:32,920
 that grow to hate each other and yeah it's real it's a beautiful song but it

724
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,280
 isn't originally traditionally a Christmas song they're just cracking up

725
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:39,360
 going like I guess we'll just play it even though it's a Christmas song Merry

726
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:44,720
 Christmas yeah and then another song someone came up to Fionn and again just

727
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:48,720
 like you know time and culture and everything else he's the he plays the

728
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:53,060
 flute in the band and someone came to feel it was like oh would you play like

729
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:57,080
 the orange flute of blah blah blah or whatever I don't know the name of the

730
01:05:57,080 --> 01:06:03,760
 song no that was it and film just dead face was like ah maybe I don't know if

731
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:09,560
 we know that one and in this face is that it is a song about the English like

732
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:15,760
 conquering the Irish like the orange flute is about like the orange like yeah

733
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,360
 it's like you were not playing that it's like when I first when I first start

734
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:22,520
 when I was first sitting there at the barbecue watching I was like I wonder if

735
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:26,040
 they'll do like the the Outlander theme and I was like that's Scotland you

736
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:36,720
 dumb I didn't say anything but I was like the Outlander theme that would be

737
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:40,600
 and I went that's fucking Scotland you don't even doubt shut your fucking yeah

738
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:44,080
 people who are from Scotland do not want to be told they're from Ireland and vice

739
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:48,560
 versa and vice versa it's very key thing I don't know why anyone would do it yeah

740
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:53,320
 very crazy Ozzy no I'm not gonna I'm not gonna touch that so there we go and they

741
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:56,320
 never played long distance no they didn't play long distance we didn't ask

742
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:00,600
 we didn't ask them to learn long distance that's okay I'm sure they know

743
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,520
 it I'm sure I'm sure they've just picked it up by just hearing it on the radio on

744
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:11,440
 the international radio stations all the time so that being like I can't believe

745
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:17,400
 somebody's ass that's great basically get any other situation we would just be

746
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,440
 entirely offended but it was like let's just let it go I'm sure it was just an

747
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:25,680
 earnest request and not a lot of behind it not realizing what it meant and yeah

748
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:42,120
 yeah that's amazing that's amazing orange flute that's it the old orange flute

749
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:50,120
 oh yeah yeah this is just this is about this is the story of the Irish version

750
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:59,920
 of Benedict Arnold basically betraying the Irish to the English yes so now so

751
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:03,800
 now it's not a song that they play all the time is it but it but is it a

752
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:08,640
 traditional Irish song and not it it recounts a terrible time for the Irish

753
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:13,640
 but it is the one that I'm finding here is by the Dubliners and it was done in

754
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:19,200
 19 it was released in 1965 so that would be that would seem to say it well it is a

755
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:27,160
 traditional Irish song but just of a very sensitive topic yeah it'd be a

756
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:31,560
 different thing we've gotten out of the knowledge that I have okay I have is

757
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:36,720
 entirely based on reading these lyrics here and that's it I love that they did

758
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:42,260
 a wild Rover because when I used to sing at the bar at Star Trek the experience

759
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:46,720
 when I was doing I'd do a Klingon opera occasionally we would get some Irishmen

760
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:51,880
 in who and we'd swap songs it was great and they did Wild Rover and I learned

761
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:59,120
 Wild Rover yeah and so I knew Wild Rover and then but I knew a call for Wild

762
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:02,440
 Rover it's an offensive call I don't know they were ready for it I don't know

763
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:07,080
 if they've ever heard it but it's you know that I've played the Wild Rover for

764
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:15,000
 many a year and I don't know this but then he goes and it's no name never

765
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:22,480
 right up your ass no never her no more will I play the Wild Rover no never no

766
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:28,440
 more so but that I learned that from other Irishman so it is a legit call

767
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:35,840
 response move for that song but yeah that was great they played that one too

768
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:40,600
 yeah yeah they were just it was great and I sent them to they got to go to

769
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:45,640
 Mystere while they were here oh fantastic did they get to do a backstage tour - no

770
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:49,000
 they had to get back and play the show at least they got to see it that's cool

771
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,640
 I said I sent it to Piff Piff the next day so you'd see Piff show the next day

772
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:59,240
 yeah next day Penn Sunday School live if you it's coming out this week just just

773
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:03,400
 check it out Penn coming back from England fighting a nasty nasty cult yeah

774
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:09,280
 tough it out for scoop fest of him telling a story about Piff Piff is there

775
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:13,240
 so Piff comes out from backstage and surprises the audience very funny Jets

776
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:18,600
 it's Piff the magic dragon and he's got a steel chair I got to do my if

777
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:23,560
 impression spot-on yeah oh yeah yeah I could oh said and there's a really good

778
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:26,480
 it was a really really fine episode of Penn Sunday School especially all things

779
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:30,480
 considered Penn's health but it was it was great yeah then Piff stayed by he

780
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:34,640
 broke down his appearance on foolish with Hondro that was funny that's the

781
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,360
 funniest thing is that you know Penn want people I know if Penn was sticking

782
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,880
 around Penn can stick around cuz he was sick you want to know if Hondro's gonna

783
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:43,760
 call in the Hondro wasn't available to call in sent a small video but I was

784
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,960
 like I was there I'll help or whatever and I just should know better by now the

785
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:52,640
 Piff the magic dragon is always ten steps ahead of everyone got it has

786
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:57,560
 already planned everything yeah and so I tried to you'll hear if we play that it

787
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,840
 will play it on those feet or not I'm not sure I don't think it's maybe it's

788
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:05,320
 good audio that video but I try to help early and then there's a point where I

789
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:11,120
 just realized I should just shut up he's got it he's got it yeah yeah and and he

790
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:15,780
 just it just did a very funny presentation of all of breaking down his

791
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:22,480
 this is disastrous appearance it was a disaster it was it was funny to watch

792
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:29,000
 live yeah I mean it really is it's up there with your cutting the tip of your

793
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:34,560
 finger off at that performance that you did I mean it's the same kind of thing

794
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:38,400
 yeah yeah and Piff had a perfect sense of humor about it it was great oh sure

795
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:45,000
 yes and Hondro will probably develop a sense of humor about it one day well I

796
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:51,300
 mean he was good enough to leave a message that was nice yes their trivia

797
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:56,240

893
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:25,000
 corned beef with the nacho beef yeah no wasn't corned beef it just the regular

894

 regular ground beef okay they're spiced ground beef yeah oh but the way they

895
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:33,440
 make it at the at the McMullin's they're like this tastes like Irish like stew

896
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,660
 beef this doesn't taste like nacho beef and they were like flipping out about it

901
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,560
 country's time again it's the same beef they use in their shepherd's pie there

902
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:13,160
 yes and this is why it's like it's like it's actually why I like I like that we

903
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:15,800
 do every year and a half for a variety of reasons one is right now to give us

904
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:22,400
 breathing room to not think about the next one oh to like that extra six

905
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:25,280
 months ago our lives change enough that different people come into our lives to

906
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:30,760
 bring to scoop fest yes you know we get to include different people in it and so

907
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:37,000
 that's like really always kind of exciting to do and and and also we lose

908
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,680
 track of how many we've done so it makes them all very special because I'm like I

909
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:42,080
 don't know how many like how many businesses I'm like I have no idea I

 able to buy super early bird tickets for the next event yeah yeah yeah but that

917
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:40,560
 just I was one to say with that was that it just to me speaks so highly of people

918
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:45,120
 trusting us and then being enthused about this event yeah that's not even

919
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:51,280
 announced yet well the people basically okay the people that come year after year

920
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:55,480

921
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:58,740
