1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
 It's that time, it's my favorite part of the show, this is the part of the show where

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,200
 we thank you, the Ice Cream Truck Drivers, thank you Ice Cream Truck Drivers.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,880
 I want to thank Scoop Brady, Scoop Dijor, Scoop Cotta, Slippery Caye Motherfucker, The

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,200
 Lost Ice Cream Truck Driver, Thunder Cougar Falcon Scoop, and Travis Jaguare.

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,000
 If you want to be an Ice Cream Truck Driver just like these fine folks, deliver that fucking

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,520
 ice cream straight to people's fucking ear holes, head over to PreachingFun.com, PreachingFun.com

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:40,440
 is where you can go to sign up, and who knows, the life you save may be your own.

8
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,880
 And now, a program.

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,960
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social?

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,800
 Yeah, I'd love to.

11
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,640
 Great, let's go.

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,960
 I confirmed that my wife's band that we talked about on the last episode is in fact not a

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,960
 secret.

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,000
 So I am not in trouble.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Okay, great.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 That's good.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,280
 It's time for Matt and Mattingly's Ice Cream Social, sitting in Pittsburgh.

18
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,280
 That's Paul Mattingly.

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,040
 Sitting in Las Vegas, it's Matt Donnelly, and in Las Vegas, it's me, Jacob the Audio

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,040
 Guy.

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,040
 We're PreachingFun.

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,040
 We're PreachingFun.

23
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,680
 Yeah, my wife's band.

24
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:29,160
 Next year, 2026, is the 250th anniversary of the United States of America.

25
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,160
 And so all of the-

26
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,480
 Are you sure we're going to make it to that?

27
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,960
 No, I'm not.

28
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,600
 We're prepping just in case.

29
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,760
 But yeah, next year is the 250th anniversary of the United States of America, which also

30
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:48,920
 means a bunch of cities and towns across the country are also turning 250 years old.

31
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:55,120
 So this coming summer, there's just going to be an assload of town festivals and city

32
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,040
 festivals and fairs and all this stuff.

33
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,960
 And so SJ and one of her agents had this idea, like, let's put together just an American

34
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,600
 rock band.

35
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,200
 And I just kind of do, yeah, so that's the style.

36
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,520
 My favorite band name that I've come up with so far is Imminent Domain.

37
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,340
 It's not quite right, but we do really like that name.

38
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,960
 That's beautiful American stuff though.

39
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,560
 That's right there.

40
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,040
 Really ties in.

41
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,480
 With us in studio, we have Dr. Mike is here.

42
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,480
 Dr. Mike.

43
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,480
 Dr. Mike.

44
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,480
 Thank you guys.

45
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,040
 In studio, I mean, we're on zoom and you're in Australia.

46
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,040
 Right.

47
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,040
 Yes.

48
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,040
 As close as I could get.

49
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,440
 In a room, it's Dr. Mike.

50
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,440
 Now how old is your country?

51
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,800
 What birthday are you guys celebrating?

52
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,880
 Depends on who you ask.

53
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:54,800
 If you ask the indigenous population who have been there for 65,000 years, I would say that

54
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,560
 the country is many, many, many thousands of years old.

55
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,480
 But if we're talking about colonial, 1788.

56
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,480
 Okay.

57
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,480
 All right.

58
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,480
 Yeah.

59
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,480
 So what does that make it?

60
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,480
 Not that old.

61
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,480
 Not as old as the US.

62
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,480
 Just a little behind us.

63
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,480
 Not far.

64
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,480
 Yeah.

65
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,480
 We're 1776.

66
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,480
 Oh, there you go.

67
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,040
 Is that a number, is that, is that year a number that Australians just know?

68
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,560
 Like I think, I think most citizens of the US know the, know the name or they don't know

69
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,560
 the date 1776.

70
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,320
 Is that a, is that something?

71
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,320
 You know what?

72
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,920
 The reason why I know it is because there is a part of Australia called 1788, which

73
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,160
 is where they landed.

74
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,800
 And that's the only way that I remember it's despite history, you guys don't agree on what

75
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,800
 your oldest bar is.

76
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,040
 Don't you have three bars that argue that's their oldest bar?

77
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,240
 That's the oldest bar.

78
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:46,520
 Oh, there's one down the road for me, which is supposed to be the oldest bar in Australia.

79
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
 Yeah.

80
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,680
 And then you go for a drive down the road again and there's another one.

81
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,340
 I like this, but you wrote a book.

82
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,340
 I did.

83
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,340
 Yes.

84
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,340
 The Body A to Z.

85
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,240
 You've sent me a blurb to, to preview it and I read none of it.

86
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,120
 I read none, not a single part of it.

87
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,600
 And I appreciate it.

88
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,200
 I think it's, I think, I think it's a, it's fine.

89
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,240
 I only sent you the blurb with 24 hours ago, so that's not your fault.

90
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:27,600
 And I was like, I said, now the procrastinating is on my end.

91
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,420
 But I know you've been working on this book for a while.

92
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,280
 So tell us what went into the book is you always know the title.

93
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,120
 What motivated it?

94
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,740
 The book's called The Body A to Z, I'm a professor of medicine in Australia.

95
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,880
 I've got a YouTube channel where I teach people how the human body works.

96
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,800
 I've got a podcast where we do the same thing.

97
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,640
 And I'm on social media talking about, you know, this and that in regards to people's

98
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,240
 anatomy and physiology.

99
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,920
 And in all honesty, the only medium I hadn't touched yet was book form.

100
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,640
 And Matt, who I do all my YouTube and podcast stuff with, likes to joke that the people

101
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:13,440
 who watch my TikToks, probably the Venn diagram of those that watch my TikToks and read, it

102
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,340
 doesn't overlap significantly.

103
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:21,960
 So let's reach two distinct circles, two very distinct circles with a big gap in between.

104
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,920
 I've got bad news for you if you think you're finding readers on our show.

105
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,920
 Hey, hold on.

106
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,560
 So, yeah, and the book came out a couple of weeks ago.

107
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:41,120
 It's an alphabetized, it's not a textbook, obviously, it's an alphabetized journey through

108
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,640
 some of the lesser known structures and functions of the body.

109
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,600
 It's for anyone from 12 to 112.

110
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,440
 We go through topics like the external anal sphincter.

111
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,840
 We talk about why, for example.

112
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,160
 That is important for 12 year olds to talk about, I'm glad you said the age thing before

113
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,560
 talking about that.

114
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,560
 Yes.

115
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,840
 There's a lot of interesting topics.

116
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,440
 I think the Scrotox topic, have you guys heard of Scrotox?

117
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,520
 I have, sadly, I know what it is.

118
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,760
 So I believe I know exactly what it is.

119
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,840
 I can't wait to hear you describe it.

120
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:27,000
 And Matt, if you are worried that your ball sack looks older than it should, all you got

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,880
 to do is put a little Botox in that bad boy to de-wrinkle it.

122
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,840
 Smooth it right out.

123
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,840
 Yeah.

124
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,840
 Man, who is that for?

125
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,440
 Smooth it, smooth it, a baby's ball sack.

126
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:42,160
 I met a guy who actually had Scrotox and I was like, run away.

127
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,200
 I mean, it's true that one third of the ICS hosts have had it done.

128
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:58,000
 Dr. Mike, regarding Scrotox, is that something you would advise or recommend?

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,720
 No, I wouldn't for a couple of, I mean, one, I'm not sure.

130
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:09,280
 I mean, the aesthetics, I don't know who is staring, who is staring at that part of the

131
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
 body.

132
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,280
 I don't know who is that.

133
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
 That's a common misperception.

134
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,320
 It's a common misperception that people do it for vanity.

135
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
 It's for aerodynamics.

136
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:22,480
 Well, okay, Jacob, if it is for aerodynamics, I'll give you, if it's for aerodynamics, because

137
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,680
 then that means you're already shaving.

138
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,680
 Right.

139
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,920
 But if you do that without the intent of shaving every day, you're just wasting your time because

140
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,520
 you can't see the non-wrinkle with the hair in the way.

141
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,400
 That's why I started putting Botox in my chin.

142
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,360
 Frozen cusser is right though.

143
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,880
 It helps with some people who have excessive sweating of their balls.

144
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:53,220
 They will do that as well because Botox paralyzes the muscles in that area.

145
00:07:53,220 --> 00:08:05,920
 So one, the aesthetics, two, the sweating, but the ass sweatings, three, the aerodynamics.

146
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:11,400
 So you have a very informative YouTube videos, you have over a million subscribers.

147
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,960
 You must get some strange questions to answer as a doctor from YouTube.

148
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,560
 What are some of the strangest questions you've been asked?

149
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:29,680
 I would say the strangest questions, I did call back radio for three years on our ABC

150
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,840
 radio station and the people that would call and the questions that were asked, I mean,

151
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:46,440
 there was one guy that said he could smell snakes so he could walk into a shed and know

152
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:52,760
 where a snake was in the shed by his nose and he wanted me to explain how he could do

153
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,760
 it.

154
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,200
 He doesn't know why?

155
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,720
 He just said, I knew where it was and I said, what did it smell like?

156
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,280
 I said, I had a musky, musky smell and I could pinpoint exactly where in the shed this snake

157
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
 was.

158
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,280
 Did you just tell him he's clearly house-slytherin?

159
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:16,960
 There was another guy that said, he wasted a genie's wish, like what'd you do for the

160
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,960
 other two?

161
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,960
 Right.

162
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,960
 I know.

163
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,240
 It was the oddest superpower I've ever heard.

164
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,640
 I'm getting a thing.

165
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,640
 I'll be back.

166
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,160
 Paul has announced that he was getting a thing and left.

167
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,760
 Hope is okay.

168
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,840
 Paul's scrotal Botox person has arrived to the house.

169
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,840
 He's got to let them in.

170
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,840
 They have a lot of setup.

171
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:45,520
 Paul's going into his garage, maybe he'll smell a snake while he's in there.

172
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,240
 Oh yeah, there you go.

173
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,480
 Maybe he can locate one for us.

174
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,440
 In Australia though, isn't it, I mean, isn't that kind of a bullshit trick to be able to

175
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,080
 be like, this shed has a snake in it?

176
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,840
 That's just a safe bet, right?

177
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,800
 Like, yeah, yeah, there's a snake in that shed.

178
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,560
 Point, point in the corner and there's a snake.

179
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,200
 It's not even 50/50, it's just, it's likely there's a snake.

180
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,960
 Now I've got a lot of strange calls.

181
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:23,280
 One guy that was trying to argue with me about, for some reason, sunglasses don't protect

182
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,320
 your eyes in any way.

183
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,320
 I didn't understand his point.

184
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:33,320
 And he kept referring to his, his Turkish friend as evidence and saying that I've got

185
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,500
 a Turkish friend who's never worn sunglasses and his eyes are okay.

186
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,240
 So explain that, which I found difficult.

187
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,600
 I cannot, I can't explain that.

188
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,280
 So he had, he had a one person case study.

189
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,200
 Yeah, he just called up, he called up and he goes, I've got one for you.

190
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,400
 I've got a Turkish mate, never worn sunglasses and his eyes are totally fine.

191
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
 Explain that.

192
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,400
 Did he believe it was tied to his friend being Turkish?

193
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,400
 Was that part of the deal?

194
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,840
 Did the Turkish have heartier eyeballs?

195
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,320
 He did refer to him as a Turk at least a dozen times in the question.

196
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:22,280
 I don't know why he was so focused on the fact that his friend is a quote unquote Turk.

197
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:27,240
 How long have you been working on the book?

198
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,840
 So the book took us about 12 months to write.

199
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:37,000
 God, I have to say, writing a book is not an enjoyable process.

200
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,640
 Many people refer to it as like, like, like, like in like surgical ways, like it was like

201
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:47,200
 losing a limb or like, like they basically just all talk, most authors talk about writing

202
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,680
 a book as if it's torture.

203
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,680
 Yeah.

204
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,680
 Yeah.

205
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,680
 I would say it was.

206
00:11:51,680 --> 00:12:00,640
 It was like losing every limb and then getting pushed down a hill and try to keep your, keep

207
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
 your balance.

208
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,320
 It was, it was just trying to find the time to write a book and then, you know, you've

209
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,600
 got to, you need a lot of intense time.

210
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,560
 You can't write 30 minutes of a book.

211
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,520
 You've got to sit down and get into it and, and figure out how you're going to present

212
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,520
 it.

213
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,080
 And Matt and I aren't writers, so we have to learn how to write during this process.

214
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,080
 We're academics.

215
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,240
 We can't write academic papers, but to write something that is fun and enjoyable for everybody

216
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,520
 to read was not easy.

217
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,840
 Now Paul helped you a little bit with, with, with jokes.

218
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,840
 Is that right?

219
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,840
 Yeah.

220
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:38,480
 So we're writing a second book at the moment and Paul, which is going to be A to Z of Diseases

221
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,360
 and Paul is helping us punch it up.

222
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:49,040
 So we're throwing him some of our draft chapters and he's sending back some of his, so, you

223
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:56,880
 know, he's got some very good, very funny quips, but he's also got his typical obscure,

224
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,520
 you know, metal lyrics from a band that nobody's ever heard of.

225
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,340
 We might not necessarily keep that particular reference.

226
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,340
 That's your mistake.

227
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,340
 That's good.

228
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,300
 I actually wanted you to talk to you about Paul when he wasn't on air and then you did.

229
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,300
 So it's good.

230
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,600
 This is a, this is what now he's coming back.

231
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,800
 No, no, he's been, he's, Paul has been.

232
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:26,880
 Paul has been fantastic, which is definitely all that was said.

233
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,640
 Dr. Mike said that you've, you're, you're, you're, you're doing some additional writing

234
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,440
 for A to Z diseases.

235
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,920
 I am working on some a punch up, uh, editing for, uh, the chapters.

236
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,920
 Yeah.

237
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,920
 It's been a lot.

238
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,920
 How do you think that's going?

239
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,040
 I think it's going great.

240
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,040
 I think it's going great.

241
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:50,860
 Um, I mean, I can only say they've been very kind, uh, in their responses to my, uh, silly

242
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,860
 stuff.

243
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,860
 You've been fantastic.

244
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,860
 So all has been silly.

245
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,860
 Yeah.

246
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,860
 You've been absolutely fantastic.

247
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,860
 It's been great.

248
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,860
 It's been wonderful.

249
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,920
 Uh, I can, what, what's fun for me is having this, this, uh, opportunity with Dr. Mike

250
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,760
 allows me to now proudly say I am juggling basically four jobs at once, which is awesome.

251
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,200
 Uh, welcome to America 2025.

252
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:17,920
 Well, you've been, it's, it's been super helpful for us.

253
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,240
 Um, you know, Matt and I, we think we're funny.

254
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,040
 We're by no means funny.

255
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,720
 And when we get into that mindset of writing something about the body, we tend to lose.

256
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,620
 I'm worried that we lose humor because we're trying to get facts and you're pulling us

257
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,920
 back in with the humor, which is brilliant.

258
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,840
 Uh, it's been, it's been really fascinating for me.

259
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,100
 I'm learning a ton of stuff.

260
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,880
 This latest chapter that you just sent me, can I speak on that at all?

261
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,080
 Yeah, go for it.

262
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,080
 Absolutely.

263
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,920
 So it's all about the dancing sickness, which I am actually familiar with.

264
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:54,620
 So what I'll do is Michael send me this stuff and I'll, I'll read it and then I'll just

265
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,520
 let it go for a day or two and let it percolate and then come back to it.

266
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:03,760
 Um, but yeah, the, the dancing sickness, I don't know if you guys are familiar with this,

267
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,320
 but it was a, uh, mold in the bread.

268
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,320
 You remember this, Jacob?

269
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,400
 Well, it's shaking like you got the St. Vitus dance.

270
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,400
 That was it.

271
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
 It's the same thing.

272
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,320
 That's exactly the town that it happened in.

273
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,800
 And so, yeah, people, uh, people got affected by this and they've just danced themselves

274
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
 to death.

275
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:28,980
 Uh, many people did because it gave them these weird, uh, brain conditions from ingesting

276
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,480
 this bad mold that came from, what kind of grain was it, Mike?

277
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,560
 Oh, that's a good question.

278
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,760
 I can't remember.

279
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,240
 I think it was oat grain.

280
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,240
 I'm actually wrong.

281
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,240
 Someone should write a book about this.

282
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,680
 I think it, I think it was oat grain, but anyway, it was moldy and that's what it was

283
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,920
 and it, and it caused people to get sick.

284
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,920
 Nobody knew what it was.

285
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,680
 You know, of course everybody thought it was possession or some kind of, or something wrong

286
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,680
 with the water.

287
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,880
 A million different theories came up, but then it spread to a bunch of different places.

288
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,240
 It's crazy, but they finally figured it out.

289
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,500
 God, our FDA is rolling back protections on shit so we can get this dancing going again.

290
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,500
 That's right.

291
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:17,860
 You're that, that is a bit frightening that last point because I mean, well, we said,

292
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:22,720
 we said Paul, a chapter on, um, lead poisoning and the potential link between lead poisoning

293
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,000
 and mass murders.

294
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:32,140
 Um, you know, the, the way things can become contaminated quite easily and without oversight,

295
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,040
 that can lead to huge amount of issues.

296
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,480
 I think one of my favorite chapters with the new book that that Paul's helping us with

297
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:46,520
 at the moment, um, is, uh, a disease called Monday disease in which, so, uh, this is great.

298
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,520
 This was great.

299
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,320
 I've got a case of the Monday.

300
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,200
 You think, but this is awful.

301
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
 Yeah.

302
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:58,720
 It's a, so Alfred Nobel, he basically created nitroglycerin, the explosive and felt bad

303
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,200
 for the amount of lives he potentially has have lost because of that.

304
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,900
 So he decided to put money into, you know, the Nobel peace prize and so forth.

305
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,720
 And that's where that's gone from there.

306
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:17,320
 But, uh, nitroglycerin and, and, uh, nitro or nitrous oxide, nitrous oxide is a vasodilator

307
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:22,400
 tells your blood vessels to relax, but very chemically similar to the explosive.

308
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,020
 And the people that were working in the factories making the explosives were exposed to this

309
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,760
 chemical and it would dilate or relax their blood vessels very easily absorbed through

310
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,880
 the skin.

311
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
 Exactly.

312
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,880
 And the, when you get a headache or a migraine, that's because your blood vessels are suddenly

313
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,520
 relaxing too quickly.

314
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,800
 And so they'll get headaches coming back to work on Monday, but because it relaxed their

315
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,400
 blood vessels, those who had heart disease got relief while they were at work because

316
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,160
 their blood vessels were relaxed.

317
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,640
 And then they'll finish work on a Friday, go home for the weekend, start to get chest

318
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,940
 pain over the weekend again, potentially suffer angina or even heart attacks, and then come

319
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,120
 back to work on the Monday and then get the headaches all over again.

320
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:12,580
 And that was the Monday disease, but the Monday disease was a temporary relief for people

321
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,840
 with a heart condition.

322
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
 Yeah, exactly.

323
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,840
 Right.

324
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,840
 Yeah.

325
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,840
 And that was through that.

326
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:25,760
 They discovered how that could be utilized for the alleviation of vein type problems

327
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,440
 in the body.

328
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,440
 But can you guess?

329
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,480
 That happened to me when I had that scary incident before I was put on blood pressure

330
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
 medication where I came in.

331
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,480
 Oh, really?

332
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,480
 I came in to just get it.

333
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,480
 What happened?

334
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:45,280
 I came in, I talked about this a long time ago on the show, this was, I went in to get

335
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,760
 a sign-off because I was going to get sinus surgery to remove polyps from my nose, which

336
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,660
 I still never had.

337
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,660
 And my-

338
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,920
 You never had the polyps or you never had the surgery?

339
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,920
 I never had the surgery.

340
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
 Okay.

341
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:02,760
 No, I was convinced by a hypnotist, a stage hypnotist, that I had nose polyps and he never

342
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,760
 snapped his fingers.

343
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,760
 That's horrible.

344
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:11,760
 Anthony Cools played a terrible prank on Matt Noddely.

345
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,080
 What a bastard.

346
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,680
 Anthony Cools, come on, man.

347
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:20,780
 Give me back my sinuses, Cools, uncool, Cools.

348
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,200
 And my blood pressure was like through the roof.

349
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,640
 And they literally were like, and then so I was like, so I can't get surgery tomorrow?

350
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,320
 They're like, you can't leave this office.

351
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,600
 And I was like, oh.

352
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,960
 And they took a big nitroglycerin, I don't know, they took a big clear gel and just put

353
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,800
 it right on my, all across my chest.

354
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
 And it was awesome.

355
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,280
 And I was like, I, cause I take pills now to keep it regulated, but that gel thing was

356
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,280
 so cool.

357
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,640
 I was like, I would like to do the gel, but apparently it's like, it's like, you can't

358
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,640
 control it or whatever.

359
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,640
 Yes.

360
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,640
 It's only done.

361
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,460
 It's hard to, it's hard to get dosage right when you're smothering someone in a gel.

362
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:05,400
 Say it again, but slower, Dr. Mike.

363
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:11,120
 But that's exactly what happened with the, with the stuff they've, you know, they found

364
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,820
 all these different uses for this, for this heart condition medicine.

365
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:22,120
 And they had a controlled test, a controlled experiment with these miners who were coming

366
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,880
 in and they kept giving all these miners, these blood pressure.

367
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,880
 No children.

368
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,880
 Wait, how old were they?

369
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,400
 No, they were actually in the hole digging miners.

370
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
 Still not children.

371
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,360
 Cause that's coming back into America as well.

372
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,520
 We're letting 12 and 14 year olds dig holes.

373
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,520
 No.

374
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,520
 They're smaller.

375
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,520
 You don't have to dig as big a hole.

376
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,520
 You're right.

377
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,520
 And hey, they haven't lived a life.

378
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,520
 They don't care.

379
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,520
 Exactly.

380
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,520
 Yeah.

381
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,520
 They don't count.

382
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,960
 So, but all these miners come in and finally, after months of these tests, one guy goes,

383
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,940
 Hey, uh, I don't know if this is anything, but I had a raging boner at night.

384
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,280
 And the other guy's like, Oh, well yeah, me too.

385
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,280
 Yeah.

386
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,280
 I did also.

387
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,280
 Yeah.

388
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,280
 Yeah.

389
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,280
 We all had raging boners all the time.

390
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,600
 And so finally they go, Oh, fuck.

391
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,620
 Now we can make some money.

392
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,620
 That's how they discovered.

393
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,640
 That's how they discovered my Ankara.

394
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,640
 It's amazing.

395
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,640
 I have a boner over over four hours last night.

396
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,640
 That's just it.

397
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,240
 But they're so embarrassed to even talk about it.

398
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,560
 They almost missed it.

399
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,840
 God damn it.

400
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,160
 We need sex ed everywhere.

401
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,160
 God damn it.

402
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,400
 No, I looked up, uh, Dr. Mike, I looked up the St Vitus dance and this one's talking

403
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,120
 about being a neurological disorder, not that was, that was thought to be caused by mold

404
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,120
 and it's something else.

405
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,120
 Is that something different?

406
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,120
 Yeah.

407
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,720
 There's, there's another condition, which is St Vitus disease, um, which is a neurological

408
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,360
 and it affects the way that the body moves.

409
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:52,160
 So the person moves rhythmically because of the way that the motor system is being affected.

410
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,160
 So that's a different condition.

411
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,560
 Oh, but that's not, that's not like a life threatening disease.

412
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,560
 Yeah.

413
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,160
 Richard in the chat was mentioning it was ergot.

414
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,680
 That was the specific mold that caused the problem.

415
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,680
 Oh, gotcha.

416
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
 Yeah.

417
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,680
 Oh, neat.

418
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:11,080
 Ergot the rhythm, ergot the music, ergot my brain exploding on the floor.

419
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,080
 Yeah.

420
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,720
 Uh, I'll tell you what else ergot and that is the following sponsor.

421
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,720
 Yeah.

422
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,440
 Today's show is brought to you by of course, dr Mike and dr Matt's book, the body eight

423
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,880
 is ed, which you can get somewhere.

424
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,880
 Yep.

425
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
 And that's correct.

426
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,880
 You can't get it somewhere.

427
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,880
 It's your local Walden books.

428
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,720
 Is it available in America yet or no?

429
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,880
 Well I, I don't know if you guys know this, but there's these things called tariffs that

430
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,320
 are happening in the U S but is it affecting the economy at all?

431
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:48,280
 Um, well, I don't know again, Matt, you might not be aware, but um, yes, significantly.

432
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:54,880
 Um, and it's affecting my book sales in the U S because it costs, if somebody in the U

433
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,920
 S, uh, well, if my publisher wanted to make the book and sell it in the U S people would

434
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:07,800
 have to pay about 60 U S dollars for the book and my book's not worth 60.

435
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,940
 What is your MSRP on that bad boy?

436
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,720
 What is it normally going for?

437
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:17,640
 Uh, well in Australia, I think what Paul's trying to ask is how much for raw book?

438
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,640
 Right.

439
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,880
 I'm asking for raw book.

440
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,160
 I'll rule book you Paul.

441
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,160
 Okay.

442
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,160
 Don't worry about that.

443
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,160
 I appreciate it.

444
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:33,240
 You can get it in Australia for $37, uh, which is Australia, which is a little more three,

445
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:39,920
 three U S dollars probably, but yeah, but, but you can order it, uh, and they can share

446
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,680
 it to the U S through ratings.

447
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,800
 It's, it's, it's a publisher, a distributor called ratings and they will ship it to you

448
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,840
 or you can get it as a Kindle through the, uh, U S Amazon.

449
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,840
 Okay.

450
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,840
 Okay.

451
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,840
 So there are options.

452
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,840
 There are options.

453
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,840
 All right.

454
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,840
 Yeah.

455
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,400
 The body A to Z, uh, Dr. Matt and Dr. Mike, uh, they are the authors on there and yeah,

456
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,160
 it's on Amazon, uh, for a Kindle and get the physical one in all those ways.

457
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:12,160
 Also $37 Australia is about $24 U S there you go.

458
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,600
 And now I've answered all the questions that today's show is also brought to you by the

459
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,480
 hemorrhoid razor, a razor to cut your hemorrhoids.

460
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,920
 That's from Nola school in 2021.

461
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,560
 I'm glad this is a doctor present tells us about how well this works.

462
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,560
 The hemorrhoid razor.

463
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,560
 Yeah.

464
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,560
 What's going on?

465
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,800
 I'm the hemorrhoid razor cutter.

466
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,800
 That's right.

467
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:41,360
 Looks like you've got a polyp on your bottom bud time for the hemorrhoid razor.

468
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,400
 This sharp one's going to slice you clean.

469
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:52,040
 Come on over, spread those cheeky weakies and let me get a slice in I've cut you to

470
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,320
 the quick I have slippery slice.

471
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:00,920
 No preparation needed for this H E double hockey sticks.

472
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,920
 That's right.

473
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:07,000
 I'm taking you to hell as first with my hemorrhoid razor.

474
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,480
 It's a simple slice right around your colon, but just before it, your GI will never be

475
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,120
 the same.

476
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,220
 Look here.

477
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:23,840
 When you clench that sphincter, I'm going to make it pink to when I slice with my hemorrhoid

478
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:32,480
 razor slice, your little chocolate starfish better make its last wish as I come in with

479
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,720
 my hemorrhoid razor.

480
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:48,120
 Your eye of Sauron is going to be a power on blood when I get my hemorrhoid razor slice.

481
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,120
 Please do not shit for four to six weeks after the use of the hemorrhoid razor.

482
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:59,000
 It's smart and it scoops a checkout.

483
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,680
 So Dr. Mike, let's, let's talk hemorrhoids for a second.

484
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,200
 There are several different causes, right?

485
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,200
 Yeah.

486
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,600
 What's the ultimate, what let's describe.

487
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,420
 What is the hemorrhoid?

488
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:20,120
 So there are veins that sit around the anus and they can basically enlarge

489
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,640
 cause they're lazy and don't want to get a job.

490
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,000
 My hemorrhoids sit around the anus all day.

491
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:35,400
 They sit around the anus.

492
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,720
 So it's an, and why should we, and why should we razor blade them?

493
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,720
 You know what?

494
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:46,920
 I've been a listener for 10 years and I had to be part of the episode where it was the

495
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:53,760
 like Geo said, it's the worst, most disturbing ad I've heard so far, putting a razor blade

496
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,000
 to a hemorrhoid makes me feel sick.

497
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,080
 That would do a lot of damage.

498
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,400
 That would really not help, right?

499
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,800
 That would exacerbate the problem.

500
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,360
 I mean, if you think about how much blood can come from a hemorrhoid, just from excoriation,

501
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,160
 and I do often, and Jacob often does putting a razor blade to it wouldn't be good.

502
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,720
 I mean, some of the ways they get rid of it, banded surgery.

503
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,400
 So they band it up to get rid of a sheep's tail.

504
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,400
 Oh my God.

505
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
 Nice.

506
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,400
 That's gotta be a big hemorrhoid.

507
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
 Yeah.

508
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,400
 Yeah.

509
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,200
 So some people will have challenge accepted Paul external.

510
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,200
 Okay.

511
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,200
 All right.

512
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,880
 Ben, have you ever met anyone with a prehensile hemorrhoid?

513
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:41,280
 Use it to climb a tree when I'm scared.

514
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:48,280
 I could hang from a branch by my hemorrhoid.

515
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,280
 Oh my God.

516
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,160
 There's a new way that they're doing it, which is they sonicate it.

517
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:58,080
 They actually use sound and what the sound does is, I actually don't know what the mechanism

518
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,080
 is.

519
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,360
 I don't know if many of the colorectal surgeons.

520
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,280
 It's a guided by voices album.

521
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:08,480
 Look man, not a lot of hemorrhoids here.

522
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,480
 So thank you.

523
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,480
 That's right.

524
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,880
 Now we have a very specific follow-up coming from a listener here, Jacob, can you also

525
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,440
 highlight Jessica Jane Peterson, please?

526
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,080
 Jessica Jane is in chat there.

527
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,840
 Oh, where is, where is J.J.?

528
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,840
 Oh, there she is.

529
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,840
 Hey, J.J.'s here.

530
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,840
 Hey.

531
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:31,360
 I was trying to get J.J. to join us in our first episode, but she's here for the second

532
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,760
 episode and she just texted me with a question that has to go directly to Dr. Mike.

533
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,760
 Did you want to ask her J.J.?

534
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,760
 Ah, good.

535
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,680
 You know, I feel like, okay, I should say I escaped from a straight jacket eight times

536
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,600
 a week hanging upside down on 35 feet in the air.

537
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,360
 But if you know about straight jackets, which I'm sure you do, you know, it has that special

538
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,760
 crotch strap.

539
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,640
 Can that strap cause these hemorrhoids?

540
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:04,720
 So how is this strap wrapped around the back, but then I'm hanging upside down.

541
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,560
 I was like, it hasn't happened yet, but I'm wondering if like there's preventative acts

542
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,200
 to prevent the hemorrhoids that could be caused by the straight jacket.

543
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,400
 You think you need to do like a water tank?

544
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
 Is it like a G-string bungee?

545
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
 Okay.

546
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,400
 It is.

547
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:25,040
 It's like a G-string bungee made of canvas through Spanx with fishnet.

548
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,040
 Okay.

549
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,040
 Okay.

550
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,040
 I think your hemorrhoids are safe.

551
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:33,840
 You think the Spanx and the fishnets probably do enough cushioning to prevent the...

552
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,440
 There's no preventative measures that I need to take because I just, this sounds terrifying.

553
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,040
 There aren't any stretches?

554
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,800
 I didn't know any of these things.

555
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,800
 I texted Matt.

556
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,480
 I'm like, I am learning so much about hemorrhoids.

557
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,480
 My Lord.

558
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,720
 Well, the fact that you're upside down means that the pressure is probably reduced in that

559
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,720
 area.

560
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
 And it's all going to your...

561
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
 Right.

562
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,720
 Or at least going to your head.

563
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,720
 Sorry.

564
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,720
 Where's my...

565
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,720
 Your hemorrhoids are...

566
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,800
 My tight wire act where I just taint myself across, where I just keep shaking my legs

567
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,000
 until I inch myself across...

568
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,360
 Oh God.

569
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,320
 That's maybe a bad idea.

570
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,040
 Keep going, Matt.

571
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,040
 Keep doing it.

572
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,040
 Taint.

573
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,040
 Taint shaking.

574
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,040
 Matt's raking his asshole across a tightrope.

575
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,040
 Look, man.

576
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,040
 It's the only way Popov will let me into his pet circus.

577
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:22,040
 So I have to do that act.

578
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,360
 Damn you, Anthony Kuhls.

579
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,480
 Ouch.

580
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,040
 So when can we expect the diseases A through Z?

581
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:37,320
 Do you expect it to sell more or less than the body A through Z?

582
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,800
 I think the diseases A to Z is going to be really fun because Paul's helping us punch

583
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,440
 this up.

584
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,080
 I think it's also going to be very funny.

585
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,000
 It's coming out same time as this book.

586
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,560
 So this time next year, a Christmas book.

587
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,880
 I just got to get it done by...

588
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,680
 We've got to get it done, Paul, by June.

589
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,880
 Oh, easy peasy.

590
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
 Yeah.

591
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,880
 Cool.

592
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,880
 I'm stepping it up.

593
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,880
 Paul will not be done by June.

594
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,880
 Now I'm going to tell you that right now.

595
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,880
 He's killing it.

596
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,880
 He's killing it.

597
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,880
 We send it to him.

598
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,880
 He's back in a couple of days.

599
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,880
 He's killing it.

600
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,880
 Yeah.

601
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,880
 I'm trying to get faster on it now.

602
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,880
 Yeah.

603
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,080
 I've got a much more full schedule, so that allows me more...

604
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,600
 Funny, I allocate time better now, so that's good.

605
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
 Thanks.

606
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,440
 And where do you want to send people, Dr. Mike, to check out where your stuff is?

607
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,480
 If you, I think, go to our YouTube page, Dr. Matt and Dr. Mike, have a look.

608
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,440
 There's videos there for everybody or our podcast.

609
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,360
 And yeah, if you want to consider buying the book, go for it.

610
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,000
 Otherwise, hit us a subscribe and a like, and I'll be happy.

611
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 All right.

612
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,480
 Well, thanks for coming by.

613
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,000
 Thanks for waking up early.

614
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,300
 You woke up at like four o'clock in the morning to be on the show at your time.

615
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,300
 So thank you.

616
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,300
 I appreciate it.

617
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,300
 I did.

618
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,300
 But it's all good.

619
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,300
 All good.

620
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,300
 Thank you, guys.

621
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:57,840
 You've been with us for a decade now and I will continue to be a listener.

622
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,120
 Please clear up anything we misquote medically.

623
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,120
 Please always fact check us.

624
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,760
 I'll be too busy if I did that.

625
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:13,720
 And I can tell you, honestly, the new book that we're working on is fascinating.

626
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,560
 And I'm sure A to Z with the body is just as fascinating.

627
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,440
 You're going to learn a ton.

628
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,780
 So check it out.

629
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,780
 Give it a read.

630
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:25,680
 I've already learned a ton of stuff just in my editing of this new book.

631
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,840
 So I can't wait to pick up the other one.

632
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,800
 Paul, bad news is that now you have to become a doctor by June as well.

633
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,760
 You have to also because good news, good news, Matt.

634
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,100
 Those kind of degrees in the states are now not professional any longer.

635
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,440
 So I I'm technically a doctor already.

636
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,740
 I'm technically a doctor.

637
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,920
 I have only come at me, bro.

638
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,960
 I've only seen the reactions to this.

639
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,680
 I don't know the core event that happened that has caused talk about medicine not being

640
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,680
 professional.

641
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,680
 I can tell you what's going on.

642
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,600
 You want me to break it down for you?

643
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,680
 What the way they're doing this bullshit because it's always some bullshit loophole.

644
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:10,960
 What they're doing is they're using this formula wherein if a degree's income, if when you

645
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,920
 graduate college, the money you make from your income is not significantly greater than

646
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:22,900
 what a high school graduate would make, then it is rendered as though it is null and void

647
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,560
 beyond a high school diploma.

648
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,560
 By who?

649
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,560
 Right.

650
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,560
 By who?

651
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
 Who?

652
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,560
 What are you saying?

653
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,560
 Who renders it null and void?

654
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,560
 Yeah.

655
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,800
 What's left of the goddamn Department of Education that's being systematically dismantled.

656
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,800
 Okay.

657
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:46,560
 So what they're saying is that degrees that do not provide a significant monetary payout

658
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:53,560
 can be compared to the money that a high school graduate makes in its first year.

659
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,840
 Now that does not take into account that as you go through the ranks of these things,

660
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,120
 you make more money and of course, especially with nurses and internships and that kind

661
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,700
 of thing, it is a gradual progression, especially with education.

662
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:09,720
 A lot of that early education is being pulled out from this stuff too because it takes a

663
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:14,600
 little while to get your feet under you and make actual money and tenuring and all that

664
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,780
 kind of thing.

665
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:22,280
 So that's the loophole that they're using to undermine many of these degrees as being

666
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:28,160
 anything more than what would essentially be a high school diploma equivalence.

667
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:32,920
 And so they're labeling them as unprofessional or nonprofessional through that loophole.

668
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,120
 Does that mean the government does have to fund things?

669
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,120
 Does that mean the government has to do things?

670
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,360
 It means that you don't get recognized as professional.

671
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:46,360
 The biggest thing about it and shock of all, this giant pedophile ring is deciding that

672
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:52,980
 these specific careers that also happen to be mandatory reporting careers, which means

673
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:58,320
 that if they are informed of any kind of sexual abuse from a minor, they have to report it

674
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,660
 to the authorities.

675
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:02,840
 These are also being undercut as nonprofessionals anymore.

676
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,880
 So that's going away too.

677
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,960
 What do you know?

678
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,080
 Shock and surprise.

679
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:12,920
 So that's what's really at the heart of it, is making it so it's harder for crimes against

680
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:17,960
 children to be systematically reported and cataloged.

681
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,240
 Guess what is not being systematically eradicated through this?

682
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:30,520
 Degrees such as fucking religious studies, which are not having to be reporting because

683
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,520
 that's where it's happening.

684
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:38,360
 I'll tell you what else they're not paying attention to, the body A to Z and you should

685
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,340
 be paying attention to it.

686
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,840
 You should be paying attention to that.

687
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,520
 Can we move to Australia, please?

688
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,520
 I know, right?

689
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,520
 Do you have room?

690
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,520
 Come, come to Australia.

691
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:50,960
 I've been trying to get the boys to Australia for a long time and they refuse.

692
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,000
 We want to go, we want to go.

693
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 We want to go.

694
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 At this point, I think all of our visas would be flagged, but what are you going to do?

695
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 Who the fuck knows?

696
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 Arms wide open.

697
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 Arms wide open.

698
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 Well, thank you, Dr. Mike.

699
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 Thank you, Dr. Mike.

700
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 Thanks for your time, Dr. Mike.

701
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 Appreciate it, man.

702
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 Thank you all.

703
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 Have a great day.

704
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 You too, buddy.

705
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 Hey, you too, buddy.

706
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 You rock, dude.

707
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 All right.

708
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:18,640
 I'll tell you who else is punching up Dr. Mike's next book and that's the following sponsor.

709
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:25,920
 Today is brought to you by 19th Deck Handjobs from Captain Scooper in 2025.

710
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,720
 It's 19th Deck Handjobs because sometimes I'm tired of just walking up there.

711
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:37,120
 Well, I was born one day shuffling spades.

712
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,240
 I finally decided to change up trades.

713
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,080
 I went ahead and I jacked off 18 dudes and the next one showed up.

714
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,780
 He was already nudes.

715
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,080
 You got 19 decks.

716
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,080
 What do you get?

717
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,040
 A whole bunch of slop and stuff on your neck.

718
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,480
 You can't escape all the jizz that comes and goes.

719
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,480
 I owe my soul to these jacked off hoes.

720
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,080
 Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

721
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,120
 Well, after 19, I thought, where do I go?

722
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,880
 I went back out and found another hoe.

723
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:16,240
 Number 20 came and number 20 went, but number 21 was already spent.

724
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,760
 You jacked 19 decks.

725
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,640
 What do you get?

726
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,360
 Your face covered in jizz and soaking wet.

727
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:27,280
 Saint Peter, don't you call me unless you are the actual Saint Peter who has Peters

728
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,280
 by far.

729
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,280
 Yeah.

730
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,520
 Give me those Saint Peters.

731
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,400
 Saint Peter's got Peters by far.

732
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,400
 Me her.

733
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,760
 And her hate scoops are jacked out.

734
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,760
 There you go.

735
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,360
 Oh, you know what that horn means.

736
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:45,640
 Matt Dolly's heading up to old 19.

737
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,560
 I can only listen to books on tape for so long.

738
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,520
 I'm about to head out to the-

739
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
 Board.

740
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,520
 Yeah.

741
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,480
 Right after Thanksgiving, I head back out to the old Sun Princess.

742
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,480
 Miss the old gal.

743
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,480
 Going to be there.

744
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,480
 How long are you going to be out?

745
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,960
 Just a week, which is good.

746
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,960
 Nice.

747
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,240
 Jessica Jane, are you at sea?

748
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,240
 Yeah.

749
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,240
 I think so.

750
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:13,400
 I joined the Disney Destiny in, oh God, in three days and I still have to write two more

751
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,400
 routines.

752
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
 Crap.

753
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,880
 They work you hard on that ship.

754
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,880
 But then I go to Star Princess.

755
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,000
 So wait, when are you on Sun?

756
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:31,120
 I'm on the Sun in December and then I don't go to the Star until March and then I'm on

757
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,480
 the Star in May and June.

758
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,480
 Okay.

759
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:41,200
 Well, you don't know whether you're booked there or you're already booked out.

760
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,160
 Disney's got stuff till like 20 to 27 because they don't want me to have a life, so they

761
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,160
 own me.

762
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,160
 I am owned by the mouse.

763
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,440
 I was just saying, I'm even on the Star in August.

764
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,640
 I'm on the Star a ton, but I won't run into you.

765
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,880
 You won't get booked as a, because Jessica Jane gets booked as a stage magician.

766
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,360
 I get booked in Little Magic Castle Experience, so I could be on this ship.

767
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:04,200
 And then we can do a show together in the pavilion thing.

768
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,200
 Yeah.

769
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:10,360
 No, I do have two Star Princess dates in March, so we'll see.

770
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,360
 Oh, good.

771
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,360
 Yeah.

772
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,360
 Okay.

773
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,360
 Yay.

774
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,360
 I miss you guys though.

775
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,360
 Hi, JJ.

776
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:21,940
 You were supposed to come to Scoop Fest and you bailed on it because we were working on

777
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,940
 a project together.

778
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,940
 I was going to say, yeah.

779
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,940
 Yeah.

780
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,440
 We need you to block out some dates on the next Scoop Fest, so yeah.

781
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,440
 Yes.

782
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,440
 Yes, we can, JJ.

783
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,200
 We can definitely talk about whose fault that was.

784
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,200
 Vinnie Grasso.

785
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,760
 Can we talk about Vinnie Grasso?

786
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,800
 Fucking Vinnie Grasso.

787
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,800
 Yup.

788
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,800
 Yup.

789
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:45,640
 Because who got sent to the Virgin Cruise thing because Matt wasn't available and what

790
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,640
 Mike had what?

791
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,520
 His daughter's dance recital or something and Vinnie's like, "I don't want to do it,

792
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,960
 so send JJ."

793
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,960
 That's right.

794
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,960
 That's right.

795
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,120
 But we missed you.

796
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,120
 You recently-

797
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,120
 Vinnie came by though.

798
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,120
 Vinnie came by Scoop Fest.

799
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,120
 He was there for all of it.

800
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,120
 He came by and really hug out.

801
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,120
 He was there?

802
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,120
 Yeah, yeah.

803
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,120
 He came by and hug out for a lot of Scoop Fest.

804
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,120
 Are you freaking kidding me?

805
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,120
 Vinnie went to Scoop Fest?

806
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,120
 You're freaking kidding me.

807
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,120
 Matt Foster.

808
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,120
 I knew that'd make her mad.

809
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:16,080
 I believe Jacob is kidding you.

810
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,680
 I believe he's kidding you.

811
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,160
 Vinnie was not there.

812
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,160
 Oh, he's kidding.

813
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,160
 I was so mad.

814
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,760
 Vinnie was in Italy.

815
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,360
 That's why you had to go on.

816
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,360
 Oh, okay.

817
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,360
 It was all just not available.

818
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,360
 I can't accept that.

819
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,160
 You weren't at Scoop Fest because I was supposed to be on the ship during Scoop Fest and I

820
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,880
 said no because of Scoop Fest.

821
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,880
 So you were there.

822
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,880
 JJ, Vinnie-

823
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:41,600
 When I was near in spirit, just a lot taller.

824
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:47,800
 You talking about Michael Elsroth dressing up like you for the Scoop Fest?

825
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:53,760
 Can we please, for the next Scoop Fest, Mike, can we wear the exact same outfit and walk

826
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,760
 around together arm in arm?

827
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,560
 It would make me so happy.

828
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,880
 You do not need to ask Elsroth twice to do an elaborate bit.

829
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,880
 I'll tell you that much later.

830
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,520
 No, he will very quickly commit to that.

831
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,520
 He'll run with it.

832
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,520
 Yeah.

833
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,520
 He'll do it immediately.

834
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,520
 You should both be mermaids.

835
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,520
 Oh my God.

836
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,520
 Wait a minute.

837
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,520
 He was there.

838
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,520
 He was there.

839
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,520
 That bastard.

840
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,520
 That bastard.

841
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,520
 I'm texting him.

842
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,520
 You were at Scoop Fest?

843
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,520
 You told me that you were in Italy.

844
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:37,240
 I just saw a picture of you at Scoop Fest to go to the ship, to do the Virgin gig.

845
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:43,520
 So let's talk about that, Vinnie Grasso.

846
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,520
 I love it.

847
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,520
 Drama.

848
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:52,680
 I'm just there to ruin J.J. and Vinnie's relationship.

849
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,680
 I believe in truth.

850
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,280
 I believe he came by for about five minutes one day.

851
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,480
 I think he came through on his way to the airport.

852
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,240
 He was there just in time to grab a Fez and run.

853
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,240
 Yeah.

854
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,240
 Okay.

855
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,240
 Okay.

856
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,840
 We got to get you a Fez, J.J.

857
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,720
 Oh, I would love a Fez.

858
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,720
 Yeah.

859
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,720
 Yeah.

860
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,720
 That would be awesome.

861
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,760
 J.J. is now our neighbor, Jacob.

862
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,760
 Yeah.

863
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,760
 I knew you were in town.

864
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,760
 Where are you?

865
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:24,320
 I'm on Bracken, so I'm really close to the downtown arts district area.

866
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,320
 Wow.

867
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,320
 I think I'm a 10 minute walk from the Haunted Museum.

868
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,320
 Oh, how nice.

869
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,320
 Have you been yet?

870
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,520
 No, I have not.

871
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,680
 That was one of my gigs.

872
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,400
 I worked at the Haunted Museum.

873
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,400
 Really?

874
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,400
 Yes.

875
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,440
 Before they opened and during the opening months, I was there for just about three

876
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,440
 months.

877
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,440
 Yeah.

878
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,440
 Vinnie Grasso got Paul the job there.

879
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,440
 Yeah.

880
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,440
 Vinnie got everybody who he really liked jobs at the Haunted Museum.

881
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,440
 He did not.

882
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,440
 I got that job myself.

883
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:54,400
 No, but I worked with Zach on, I helped write a lot of the pattern that the guides use throughout

884
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,120
 the entire museum and I worked there for several months.

885
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:03,880
 I was there for, we had to postpone our opening because October 1 happened, so the next Monday

886
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,960
 we were going to open and we had to postpone it until Tuesday because it was too crazy.

887
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,960
 We had to just chill.

888
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,200
 Mass shooting in Las Vegas, that's what October 1 is.

889
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:19,600
 So then I was there for Friday the 13th and for Halloween and it was in fucking sane.

890
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,760
 Yeah, Halloween was nuts.

891
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,600
 We had some crazy shit go down during Halloween.

892
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:31,040
 Yeah, I never had anything too crazy happen to myself, but it's an interesting place at

893
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,560
 the least to check out.

894
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,000
 There's a lot of really cool stuff to see.

895
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,720
 Did you ever have any moments though where you got freaked out?

896
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:43,040
 I actually had to go turn off lights at the end of the night because I was like a mid-level

897
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,240
 manager type.

898
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,880
 So I did always say hi and bye to Peggy, Peggy the doll.

899
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,280
 So I didn't even fuck with that.

900
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,840
 The only weird thing, there's a couple of weird things.

901
00:43:53,840 --> 00:44:01,420
 There was a latch on this gate that opens and closes for the basement and I would constantly

902
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:04,440
 have to relatch that basement gate.

903
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,960
 That latch was always coming loose.

904
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:13,100
 then upstairs in the room that held the Dibbock's, which was right next to Peggy's room. That's

905
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:16,100
 the golf thing, right? Yeah. Dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip,

906
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,100
 dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip,

907
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,100
 dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip,

908
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,420
 dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip. So the Dibbock's, which is basically

909
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:25,160
 based around the conjuring stuff, the Dibbock's room, I had to go in there to turn on lights

910
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:42,120
 one morning, and I went to try the doorknob, and you know, did you ever grow up with siblings

911
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:49,120
 of any kind? Yeah. I felt that feeling, and I couldn't get the door to open, and I tried

912
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:53,960
 it again, and it was the same kind of thing, and I just had to let it go, and I was like,

913
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:58,400
 "Okay, I'm going on." Paul's brother was on the other side of that door holding it. You

914
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,360
 never know. Those were the only really weird things that happened to me, but plenty of

915
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,680
 other stuff happened to people that were around, but a lot of it is because he doesn't let

916
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:11,280
 people have drinks in the place, and they all get dehydrated and pass out. That's really

917
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:17,720
 a lot of it, yeah. A lot of it is just people suffering from Vegas and just passing out

918
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:22,120
 because it's a lot to take in. Pass out saltines and espresso on your way in, and then you

919
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:27,560
 can't drink water. Honestly, yeah. Spraying you with salt. Well, there's a lot of fog

920
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:32,520
 machines and stuff in there, too, so that can affect people, too. Can we have a scoop

921
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:38,160
 group visit to the museum? An excursion to the museum would be really, really fun. Yeah.

922
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:43,040
 That would be really fun. I know somebody had contacted me from over there about some

923
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:48,880
 of my Houdini stuff, because I was like, "Well, I live close by, and it'd be safe there."

924
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:57,400
 You should chat him up. Drop my name. I mean, he'll remember me. I left on good terms. They

925
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:03,800
 said, "Come back any time," so it's all good. Yeah. Bacon was his right-hand man while I

926
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:08,680
 was there. He might still be his right-hand man. I don't know. No, I think Vinnie Grasso

927
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:15,400
 is just running the place now. Could be. Vinnie Grasso just texted back. He goes, "I stopped

928
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:21,040
 by on the way to the airport to give Matt a magnified for Oscar. Nothing to discuss,

929
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:29,640
 Ms. Peterson." Oh, boy. Giving you the business. Ms. Peterson. He was only there for two and

930
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:39,840
 a half days. But seriously, JJ, your routines would be a huge hit there. He is a mega circus

931
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:47,600
 fanatic. He has an entire area dedicated to classic circus memorabilia, and he has a giant

932
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:53,580
 circus diorama built out with little tiny pieces that move and little elephants that

933
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:57,080
 jump through hoops and stuff like that. He's a sideshow fan and stuff, too, because this

934
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:02,040
 shit I have in my house. Big time into that. Oh, my God. You're right next door. You should

935
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,760
 absolutely stop by sometime and say, "Hey, if you've got special events happening anytime,

936
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:11,040
 I'd love to come by as a performer," because he's always looking for that kind of stuff.

937
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:18,800
 Paul, some of the stuff I have here is hardcore, because I lived in Gibsonton, Florida when

938
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:25,480
 we would winter with a sideshow. I lived in the trailer outside Ward Hall, the king of

939
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:31,880
 the sideshow's house. Holy shit. He had all the stuff from the early 1900s. I have jars

940
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,720
 of things where I don't even know what they are. You got pickled punks and shit back there.

941
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:40,080
 Oh, yeah. I know where all the pickled punks are buried in Gibsonton, Florida. Get the

942
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:49,360
 fuck out. Yeah, they made it illegal to put actual dead bodies on display. It used to

943
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:53,280
 be the blow off of the sideshow. You go through the sideshow, and at the end, you pay an extra

944
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,680
 dollar to see what's behind the curtain. Then they open it, and there's these babies in

945
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:04,280
 jars that were real. Right. They would talk about, "This is why you don't do drugs, people.

946
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:11,040
 Cha cha cha." Then you leave them. Apparently, when it was made illegal, they were worth

947
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:17,360
 too much money. All the people that live in Gibsonton, it's a law that you can have anything

948
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:21,240
 on your property as long as it has to do with circus. Government can't do anything about

949
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:26,880
 it. There's freaking half set up rides and a tiger over here. It's insane. There's a

950
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:33,000
 field where all the pickled punks are buried, hundreds of them. Oh, Jesus. Wow. Now see,

951
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,640
 that's the kind of stuff he would- This is why you don't let circus people make the rules.

952
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:41,120
 No, but that's the kind of stuff he would buy. He went out and bought David Koresh's

953
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:46,400
 hot rod a couple years ago and stuff like that. Yeah, I don't think Zack should be in

954
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,860
 charge either. He's always looking for that kind of stuff. You guys would hit it off.

955
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:55,180
 You should definitely look him up. I feel like we'd be friends. You would. You guys

956
00:48:55,180 --> 00:49:00,580
 would be. Paul, you can vouch. Zack pays really well, right, Paul? Here's the thing. I was

957
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:04,720
 just about to say, whatever you're thinking of charging, just charge double and you'll

958
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:13,520
 be good. Yeah. Okay. He's classic sideshow in every way. Classic sideshow is GTFM. Get

959
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:20,360
 the fucking money. He loves Barnum. He loves P.T. Barnum. That's his whole, that's his

960
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:24,880
 ideological guru. And that's why he's got all that- Oh, I've got a Barnum letter in

961
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:30,440
 the back room that's written by Barnum. I've got like- Hey, you looking to make some quick

962
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:35,200
 cash? Honestly, that's the kind of shit he will buy in a fucking heartbeat for his museum.

963
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,640
 Well, you've got me wondering. Yeah, I've got, there was a murder in Gibsonton, Florida.

964
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:44,400
 There was this guy called the Lobster Man and the Lobster Man abused his family. So

965
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:50,520
 they hired a hit on him. His name was Grady Styles. And I have an impression of his hand,

966
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,640
 like in like the actual impression of his hand. He was the one that was murdered. And

967
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:59,440
 there was this crazy story around it. You've got Circus Freak and Murder Mystery Story and

968
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:05,920
 Murder Mobilia all connected. He will pay you crazy money for this shit. This is exactly

969
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,040
 the kind of stuff he loves to have in his place. Wow. Yeah, you guys will hit it off.

970
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:14,240
 Yeah, if you guys don't know that story, look up Grady Styles, the lobster boy. It's been

971
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,880
 a long time since I've heard that, but he had hands kind of like the penguin in the

972
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:26,140
 Batman Returns. Yeah, yeah. The pincers. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Oh, fucking shit. You guys

973
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:32,120
 absolutely have to chat at some point. We got to figure that out. Yeah. A pickled graveyard.

974
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:37,040
 Yes, Andy. It's a pickled graveyard. All right. Shout out to Richard Bruins for doubling his

975
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,720
 Patreon while we were on air. I'll keep doing this if people keep doing it. So I'll just

976
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:45,560
 keep doing it. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you, Richard. This is great. Yeah. We love you guys so much.

977
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:49,640
 Thank you so much for sending us. Coach Rat Bastard just became an ice cream truck driver,

978
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:56,440
 buddy. Yeah, Coach Rat Bastard. Yeah, baby. That's what I'm talking about. Welcome to the

979
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:02,360
 feed. Is Mike technically an ice cream truck driver all the time since he's actually driving

980
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:07,960
 his truck? Yes. Hi, Mike. Kind of. Yeah. Oh, yes. Yeah. And he was kind enough to say that

981
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:12,680
 he's going to up his Patreon as soon as stuff gets squared away from the holidays. So yeah.

982
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,960
 The people who are doing it can fit it with their budget. Obviously, we do not want people

983
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:20,760
 to take any financial risks to up their Patreon. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. But we desperately

984
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:26,280
 appreciate everything that everybody does for us. So yeah. There's still the experiment

985
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:31,480
 that we're going to run after we get $3 billion. That's right. We're going to give each of

986
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,360
 us a billion dollars and see how we spend it. We're going to see if we can be better people

987
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:39,720
 than the billionaires that we have today. So we'll see how that goes. I know I could.

988
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:44,820
 My guess is no. I could. Well, once JJ sells all of her memorabilia to Zach, she'll be a

989
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:50,160
 billionaire as well. I'm telling you, you got some money. Well, at the very least, yeah,

990
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:55,400
 you guys would actually hit it off. Yeah. First of all, JJ hits it off with every single

991
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:00,840
 person on the planet. Yeah, I know. I know. I'm not like breaking news here. JJ gets along

992
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:04,880
 with someone. Yeah, but we've got sawdust in our blood. Yes. Yes. No, I think you guys

993
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:11,480
 because of the circus thing. Yeah. For the Zach Bagenstern, I was trying to get to the

994
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:15,680
 lead of why we had you on here is you just did a concert with Alice Cooper in Arizona.

995
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:22,080
 Oh, you did that one. Yeah, that was interesting. That was very interesting. What happened?

996
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:26,260
 Well, here's the thing. I'll just tell you what I saw. I saw that you were at one point

997
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:29,980
 you're eating fire. And at one point there's a picture of you eating fire and you're and

998
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:34,000
 normally when you fire your head is back, your neck is up. There's a picture of you

999
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,080
 eating fire and your face is forward and you're just shoving a ball of fire into your face.

1000
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:46,560
 I hurt my neck. I couldn't put my head back. And then I just did it. And I had no eyelashes

1001
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:55,040
 afterwards. They said I looked like a badass. There's no doubt. No doubt. So sorry. Tell

1002
00:52:55,040 --> 00:53:00,640
 us all about the gig. So David Menken was the one that got it because he's been friends

1003
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:05,800
 with like Alice and his wife for years and they are the nicest human beings in the world.

1004
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:11,160
 And the gig was for this thing they do called Alice Cooper solid rock. Basically in Arizona,

1005
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:16,500
 any kid that wants to learn an instrument, learn an art, anything, they can stay after

1006
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:20,960
 school till 10pm at their facilities. They get their instrument for free. They get training

1007
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:28,440
 for Alice. Oh, that's awesome. It's insanely cool. And so they had the winners of like

1008
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:34,120
 their annual like School of Rock type thing in this concert. And then it was me, David

1009
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:43,120
 and Chris Mitchell, Collective Soul, Don Felder, his guitarist that was insane. I forget what

1010
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:47,440
 her name was. Nina, I think something. And then Alice Cooper performed at the original

1011
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:55,080
 band. Whoa. Oh, cool. Badass. But so I got there and obviously I'm like, we're the magicians.

1012
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:59,360
 We're not going to get a dressing room or anything, which I was right. So we go downstairs.

1013
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:04,120
 I'm trying to find a place. I was like, I gotta curl my hair. I just got off a cruise

1014
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:08,520
 ship on a plane and I said, is there any place with a plug? And they, they pulled me down

1015
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:12,240
 the hallway and he said, oh, and here's fine. I was like, oh, this is nice. There's nobody

1016
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:18,000
 in it right now. So I curled my hair for like 20 minutes and you guys know I shed like a

1017
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,640
 Siberian husky in summer, like there's red hair everywhere all over the floor. And so

1018
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:28,200
 I'm trying to collect some, like I could make another JJ out of actually Mike, I should

1019
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:32,800
 just give you my hair for eight years. That's what I should do for your next. Else Roth

1020
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:39,920
 for Else Roth to get JJ's hair. Well, I got, so I, I, I finished and I just had a feeling

1021
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:45,760
 like I need to get out of here. I leave, I leave the dressing room and my shoulder brushes

1022
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,520
 somebody going into it. They have put me in Alice Cooper's dressing room thinking he wouldn't

1023
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:54,760
 be there yet. And I literally just made a mess of his dressing room with my hair. It

1024
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:59,120
 was so embarrassing. And I saw David Lincoln and Chris Mitchell on the other side of the

1025
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:08,040
 room going, Oh no. And then my other fail moment. Have you guys ever misquoted lyrics

1026
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:17,960
 to a person who wrote them? Oh no. Something I'm very capable of. So Jacob, what, what

1027
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:24,120
 was your misheard lyric that you quoted to that person? It was, it was an Ozzy Osbourne

1028
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:29,400
 lyric. Uh, not, not too Ozzy, but to the person that had written this song. Uh, I, I don't

1029
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,520
 know what the lyric was, but I was definitely just like singing part of it with, uh, like

1030
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:40,200
 through with this guy and he was like, that is not the lyric at all. It was, it was embarrassing.

1031
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:46,440
 Oh shit dude. So collective soul. I love collective soul and Ed Rowland, like the lead singer

1032
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:54,000
 for it. And you know that song that, Whoa, I thought it was never let your light shine

1033
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:02,200
 doll. Oh my God. And I didn't know what the real lyrics were until yesterday when I told

1034
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:06,520
 the friend this story and they're like, they didn't correct you. And I went, no. And then

1035
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:12,360
 the other one, Ed Rowland filmed on his phone to send his family cause he loved it. You

1036
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:17,840
 know that song that, that dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, I thought it was turn

1037
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:22,120
 your head now, baby. Just say meow.

1038
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:31,600
 Turn your hair now, baby. Just say meow and, and he laughed so hard during the show when

1039
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:41,440
 he sang whatever the real lyrics. Oh, it was bad, but no one corrected me. Like my wife

1040
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:48,480
 thought the collective soul was, Oh, physical attraction is what she thought it was. What

1041
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:54,680
 do you guys, what is wrong? Everybody just got hearing problems. What's happening? Baby.

1042
00:56:54,680 --> 00:57:04,400
 Just physical. No, Jacob, not everyone has hearing problems. I used to think the boots

1043
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:09,080
 are made for walking. I thought it was one of these days. These boots are gonna walk

1044
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,080
 on over to you.

1045
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:21,880
 Wow. It's much harder than that, JJ. It's much harder. Oh God. As a kid, I thought jump

1046
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:32,920
 and drive was drink and drive a beautiful anthem to drunk driving. Like this wonderful

1047
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:56,520
 party song. My favorite, my favorite song is manslaughter three. Oh man. Good parents.

1048
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:04,800
 You genuinely believed the lyric was now baby. Just say meow. Yeah. I didn't, you know, when

1049
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,520
 you hear something and you just sing it that way and you never even think about what you're

1050
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:13,240
 actually singing, it never occurred to you to even think about it. And this is, and this

1051
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,840
 is all like these songs all came out when we were younger and this is before the Shazam

1052
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:20,840
 and iPhones and stuff. You couldn't look up this was dentist jargon though. It's dentist

1053
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:29,720
 jargon. What's dentist jargon? Turn your head and spit me out. That's what it is. Turn your

1054
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:34,400
 head and baby now baby. Just spit me out. Yeah. But it's talking like a dentist, but

1055
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:40,080
 like who's given head in a dentist's office. I mean, I mean, you gotta go to the right

1056
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:45,800
 place. I guess I can tell you right now. It took me forever to find one of those covered

1057
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:52,960
 by insurance. Yeah. But turn your head and spit is a, is a dentist thing. But if you

1058
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:59,800
 break that down, turn your head and baby just spit me out. I hear it now that you're saying

1059
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:07,040
 it. JJ, I get it. Turn your head now, baby. Just say meow. Yeah. But he sings with a very

1060
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:12,320
 affected way. I, I'm going to be, I'm, I want, I don't like collective soul, but I know a

1061
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:16,520
 ton of collective soul songs because when I was coming up as a young man, that was on

1062
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:21,240
 the radio 24 fucking seven, their stuff was huge. You couldn't escape their songs. Yeah.

1063
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:25,560
 It's very funny that I thought, I think it's funny that you think it was turn your head

1064
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:31,000
 now baby. I want to, I want an all JJ cover band that just sings her lyrics, the wrong

1065
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:41,080
 lyrics. Yeah. Jacob, the wrong lyrics. That's a band name. The wrong lyrics is a good band

1066
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:49,640
 name, right? Yeah. Speaking of all these bands, I saw bowling for soup. They had a free concert

1067
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:55,200
 on Fremont street the other night. They are great live. Oh, they're so good live. They're

1068
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,920
 so good. A friend of ours was opening for them. And so we went down and saw our friend

1069
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:03,560
 open and then we hung out and watched bowling for soup a little bit. They were so good live.

1070
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:08,120
 They were so funny. They talk, you know, they, they, they do the songs and everything. Uh,

1071
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:14,240
 Cooper Nova girl in the chat saying 1985. Uh, so that's one of their big songs. It was

1072
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:18,320
 so goddamn funny. They're up there. They're playing and we're kind of on the, on the side

1073
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:23,760
 of the stage and uh, we, we, we see them, we see all the signs and you know, people

1074
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:28,960
 are holding up signs. This is 1985 between every song that they do. People are yelling

1075
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:36,040
 for 1985. They, they want to play it. And finally the front man chefs fucking kiss to

1076
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:42,880
 this guy. He goes, Hey, Hey, how many hits do you think we have? We've been doing this

1077
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:51,160
 a long time. We're going to play our big hit last 1985. Now we're going to play it. It's

1078
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:55,880
 going to be last. When I saw them, they were playing the small room. It was still the hard

1079
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:59,920
 rock instead of Virgin. It was still the hard rock and they were playing the smaller room

1080
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:06,560
 and they vinyl, they they were playing vinyl and they go like, uh, we're going to play.

1081
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:09,480
 Um, uh, this is a song we wrote for Katy Perry and they played, uh, you're hot. Then you're

1082
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:14,520
 cold. You're yes. Then you're no. And they played it awesome. They played it fast as hell.

1083
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:18,600
 They just rocked it out. And then when they finished, they go, we didn't write that for

1084
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:23,760
 Katy Perry. They go, do you think we'd be playing this room if we wrote that song for

1085
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:35,420
 Katy Perry? We just be at home swimming in our money. We wouldn't be here. That's great.

1086
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:45,040
 I love so hard at that bit. They wrote a song for Katy Perry. So smart. Uh, it was just

1087
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:50,000
 the funniest bit, but they were great. They were so great to see. I could hear them from

1088
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,560
 where I live because Fremont street is so close. So like there's a lot of times I can't

1089
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:59,120
 go to bed early because there's stuff going on. Oh yeah. It's so confusing because I heard

1090
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:03,840
 that concert and then I look out and I see Disney drones and I'm like, God, I thought

1091
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:17,560
 I got away from them. Fantasmic. Freaking Belatio was like, they found me. He gads.

1092
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:22,960
 Well, if you ever, if you're ever downtown again, you hear bowling for soup playing just

1093
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:29,440
 come on over. Cause I'll probably be there. We're going to play that one last. It's our

1094
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:36,320
 big song. Let me explain to you how show business works. That's very funny. You're going to

1095
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:42,400
 be on Disney for Thanksgiving. You'd be on Disney for Christmas. I'm traveling to Disney

1096
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:49,200
 on Thanksgiving and I will be on Disney for Christmas. Yes. And New Year's Eve. What's

1097
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:54,040
 the point of us becoming neighbors? If you spend all your holidays doing cruise ships,

1098
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:59,840
 JJ, but I'm here. I'm here December 3rd to December 13th. And then for next year, I've

1099
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:06,400
 taken off two weeks of every month because my body, apparently I, my cortisol levels

1100
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:13,120
 are 42 and they're supposed to be not higher than 28. And, and they're like, it's burnout

1101
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:17,720
 and stress. So I'm, Oh, where's Dr. Mike? We should let Dr. Mike go. We should've talked

1102
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:23,200
 about your cortisol level. I need Dr. Mike. What is, what is a cortisol level? What does

1103
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:30,360
 that do? It's basically what regulates stress. I think, right? Okay. Yeah. I hear people

1104
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:33,000
 talking about it. I don't know what it is though. It's, I gotta tell you, you don't

1105
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,320
 want a high cortisol level. Instagram says I need to treat it like crazy. Um, in terms

1106
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:46,000
 of a targeted ads. Yeah. No, every targeted ads. It is all BS. Oh, the Instagram medical

1107
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:51,560
 advice is, is not a solid. Not to be trusted. Not at all. Nope. It's very hard to treat

1108
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:56,360
 your cortisol levels with an herbal supplement. Um, I don't think we need Dr. Mike back on

1109
01:03:56,360 --> 01:04:01,280
 to tell you that's true. Um, but I did switch to actually, it was a quarter. There's after

1110
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:05,640
 it was a cortisol, cortisol supplement, but it was advertised to me as like, if you're

1111
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:09,760
 taking melatonin, you should maybe switch to this. And I've been taking melatonin since

1112
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:14,320
 the pandemic and then, and then the study came out that was like, Hey, taking melatonin

1113
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:20,320
 every day might not be good for your heart. And so I would, I forget what the name of

1114
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:23,720
 the study is, but the study is the placebo's work. Even if you know the placebo's, do you

1115
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:28,400
 know the study? I mean, I know of studies like that. I don't know what the, uh, with

1116
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,400
 melatonin, it wasn't a melatonin based study, but there's a particular study that just basically

1117
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,640
 said we're giving you placebos for the symptoms and people would knowingly take the placebo

1118
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:42,520
 and still report improvement in their conditions. So I've switched to this herbal thing and

1119
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:47,320
 stop taking melatonin and it, and I've been falling asleep, uh, better on this herbal

1120
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:54,080
 supplements than this. And I'm, and I'm positive. It's just the placebo effect. I can't, I cannot

1121
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:58,320
 positively endorse this product. I just simply am happier that I'm not taking melatonin.

1122
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:04,640
 So I'll do it. I'll take it. It's called Ambien. Yeah. Matt's going to sleep really well on

1123
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:08,500
 this new supplement Ambien. It's, it's, it's a, it's actually, it's, it comes in a rock

1124
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:20,080
 form and you hit your head with it until it absorbs the bus. Oh yeah. On the bus, I was

1125
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,880
 always so tired on the bus. I was actually ended up taking Advil PMs, which I knew is

1126
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:27,720
 something you shouldn't take longterm, but I was taking, I was doing, I was doing anything

1127
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:33,000
 to fall asleep on that bus. Uh, yeah, I was not, I was never falling asleep on that, but

1128
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,840
 Matt, here's a trick that I've tried and it's worked for me that I just heard about. Uh,

1129
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:44,920
 get yourself a cooling pad. Do you have like, um, little ice pack type things? I do. Okay.

1130
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:48,240
 Uh, and you've got it where you can either wrap it in a cloth or something where it could

1131
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:55,920
 be safe for skin contact. Okay. All right. And before you go to bed, once you're in bed,

1132
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:04,080
 you put it on your forehead for 20 minutes and that will chill out your frontal cortex,

1133
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:10,600
 your frontal lobe and seriously send messages to like, go to sleep. And so it really, really

1134
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:16,040
 helps. So try it. This is what you need. I was just about to say, I know JJ invested

1135
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:21,040
 in some old timey ice bag and she, here it is. There it is. Here's the thing. Here's

1136
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:25,300
 the thing. So if you're at a hotel, you can fill it with ice. If you buy a drink at the

1137
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:29,760
 airport before I get on a plane, I buy a fountain soda, fill it with ice. There you go. Use

1138
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:36,400
 it on the back everywhere. Yeah. Cruise ship, fill it with ice. This is, I live by this.

1139
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:44,120
 That's a genius idea. To be accurate, how much soda do you pour into that ice bag? It's

1140
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:50,160
 not none soda. No, but that's great. It has happened once when I was very tired. But that's

1141
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:57,480
 great. And yes, I did drink it out of the bag. I assume you drank it. Yeah, that's awesome.

1142
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:03,280
 Oh yeah. So I get water as soon as the ice melts. I'm like, I'm not paying $6 for water.

1143
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:09,280
 I'm just drinking out of a plastic ice bag. Genius. It works. That's how you get that

1144
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:19,240
 sawdust in your veins. You absolutely could. There you go. Yep. Yep. Yep. Genius. Genius.

1145
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:28,520
 You say that like you drink. You don't really drink. No, not much, but I could. She just

1146
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:36,320
 wants to have the option. Yeah. Guys. Guys, I'm icing down my knees every night with old

1147
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:45,880
 fashions. It really works. It absorbs through the skin. Natural medicine, baby. Natural

1148
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:51,680
 medicine. Oh, you don't know nothing about no natural medicine and you don't know nothing

1149
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:55,120
 about nothing because it's Jack versus nerd. All right. You're going to find out who knows

1150
01:07:55,120 --> 01:08:19,080
 nothing about something. Ladies and gentlemen, it is time. Time for Jack versus Nerd. Explosion

1151
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:26,340
 me accidentally deleting the scooperty before I got to it. We got a scooperty coming to

1152
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:33,480
 us today from ML Kennedy. The categories are how it started dot dot dot. What's their number?

1153
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:39,400
 Turkeys and potpourri. Oh yeah, it's the Thanksgiving one. Happy Thanksgiving everybody. JJ, what's

1154
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:47,400
 your Instagram? Wait, my Instagram? Yeah. At Jessica Jane Magic. Jessica Jane Magic.

1155
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:53,840
 Leave JJ a follow. She always does. Oh yay. I'll follow you back. I put weird stuff up.

1156
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:59,120
 You document your weird life on ships all the time. It's a good follow. It's good adventures

1157
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:08,280
 of someone. I'm very honest. That's what I don't like about her. That's how I knew about

1158
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:14,760
 the old timey ice bag. I do post that on my Instagram like you guys, but I'm going to

1159
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:23,520
 mention the alcohol thing now. That's going to be fun. Life hack! Matt, you're up first.

1160
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:27,520
 What category do you want? Oh, I have to put it back on the screen, don't I? How it started.

1161
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:31,960
 What's the number? Turkeys or potpourri are the categories. Matt, what you want? How it

1162
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:39,480
 started please. For 200. This 1996 Tim Burton movie was based on a series of tops trading

1163
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:47,960
 cards from the 1960s. I feel like this is obvious, but I'm trying to think of tops trading

1164
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:53,800
 cards. A league of their own. I know. It's like major league, but that wasn't a Tim Burton

1165
01:09:53,800 --> 01:10:00,440
 movie. That'd be a weird Tim Burton movie. That'd be a great Tim Burton movie. I'll pass.

1166
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:09,840
 Oh, that passes to me. I have no idea. Pass. Mars attacks. Oh, sure. Mars attacks. Good

1167
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:17,800
 call. That's from a trading card game. Oh, it's me. I'll try, what's their number? 200.

1168
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:30,840
 The King of England during the American Revolution was King George the... Infallible. I want

1169
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:37,360
 to say fifth. King George the fifth is what I'm saying. Third. Oh, you overshot it. Overshot

1170
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:44,140
 it by two, Jacob. So close. Yep, yep. Wrong George. My bad, George. Paul. I'll try potpourri

1171
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:53,160
 for six. For 600. How tall is Hello Kitty? Please give the answer in apples. Oh man.

1172
01:10:53,160 --> 01:11:01,380
 So Smurfs are three apples high. Famously. Okay. I'm going to guess Hello Kitty is also

1173
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:09,320
 three apples high. Okay, let's try it. Five apples. Of course she's bigger than a Smurf.

1174
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:15,040
 Fucking shit. What are you thinking, Paul? At F1 there was a Hello Kitty booth this year

1175
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:20,400
 because it's so funny because they added this Formula One Academy, which is all about training

1176
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:25,900
 up women racers. So they had a big Formula One Academy race and they had all women drivers.

1177
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:30,200
 And so one of the sponsors is Hello Kitty. So all these people who weren't aware of this

1178
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:36,320
 new thing were just like, what the hell is this Hello Kitty thing doing here? Oh, that's

1179
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:43,280
 great. They didn't like Hello Kitty? They're just confused by it. A lot of basically car

1180
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:47,920
 dealers who won some contests that their dealership sent them to F1 did not appreciate the Hello

1181
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:52,520
 Kitty thing. Yeah. Well then they're idiots. Mickey Mouse and the gang and Hello Kitty.

1182
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:59,280
 They're absolute idiots because any car dealer, no seriously, if you were lucky enough to

1183
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:05,600
 be like, let's just say a Toyota dealership and you were lucky enough to get like a Hello

1184
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:11,600
 Kitty limited edition Avalon made, holy fuck, those would not stay in stock for five minutes.

1185
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:16,200
 Good point. They have no idea what they're doing. Fuck those idiots. From your mouth

1186
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:21,360
 to Theodore Toyota's ears. Theodore Toyota, send me a message. We'll talk. It's weird

1187
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,360
 to have Paul cursing out because I feel like Paul would get along with all of the opulent

1188
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:31,560
 people that go to F1 normally. I would get along with the rich people? No, I'm being

1189
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:36,200
 sarcastic. He'd be so mad the whole time. Yeah, I would be throwing shit in their face.

1190
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:42,800
 You'd just be furious. I'd be throwing shit in their faces. Matt, you're up. JJ, where

1191
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:51,760
 should I go? What's your gut? Turkeys for $400. All right. Turkeys for $400. The budget

1192
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:58,720
 of this Gina Davis pirate movie was around $100 million. It grossed about $18 million

1193
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:03,080
 at the box office. You know this, Matt. You know this, Matt. I do? What is it? I don't

1194
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:08,440
 know. What is it? I know this one. JJ, you can tell me. You can just tell me. It's Matthew

1195
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:17,840
 Modine. Gina Davis is a hot pirate? And Matthew Modine? Where do pirates hang out, Matt? On

1196
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:22,760
 a ship in a harbor. Yeah, and that ship takes them to a piece of land that's in the middle

1197
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:28,420
 of the ocean called a? Island. It's an island. Yeah. What do they do on that island? Look

1198
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:36,800
 for treasure? Nope, they kill each other in a very specific way. Murder Island. Close.

1199
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:42,840
 Getting closer. Who are you? JJ, you're a horrible lifeline. Just tell me the answer.

1200
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:50,360
 We can move on. Actually, I forget. I was just hoping you'd get to it. Matt. Shipwreck?

1201
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:58,720
 It's a good movie. Imagine you had to go down on a sword. Okay. What would happen? Cutthroat

1202
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:04,720
 Island. There you go. Cutthroat Island is it. All you have to do with these clues to

1203
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:13,840
 get Matt to figure them out is reference fellatio. That's right. Got it. It is a good movie though.

1204
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:19,720
 Come on now, JJ. I believe Cutthroat Island was the reason that movie studio had to fold.

1205
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:24,080
 Yeah, it's a terrible movie. It destroyed a movie studio. It's damn near unwatchable.

1206
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:30,600
 It was hot. Oh my God. Yeah, everyone's attractive. The movie's terrible. What were you for when

1207
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:34,200
 that fucking thing hit the theaters? And you were like, wow, of course it was cool to a

1208
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:40,800
 four-year-old. JJ watches that shit on mute. She sips from her ice pack. All right. Fair

1209
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:46,520
 enough. I mean, I ain't taking nothing away from Gina Davis and big old pirate boots. Good

1210
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:52,880
 stuff there, but you know. I'll try turkeys for 600. You would. This film developed in

1211
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:58,600
 part by the four-year-old son of the president of Paramount grossed $65 million on a budget

1212
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:06,560
 of $125 million. It's about trucks with hive mind creatures living under the hoods. Oh,

1213
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:12,360
 is that though? Oh, what was the, the, the, it was like the, the Loch Ness monster looking

1214
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:20,120
 thing. What does your, what did your wife work for, for a minute there? Uh, pimp. Okay.

1215
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:25,640
 After she got done being turned out on the street, she decided to go get turned out on

1216
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:31,840
 the tracks with those machines. Was it just called monster truck? It sure was. We just

1217
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:40,160
 called monster trucks. Yeah, there you go. Monster trucks. Yep. Yep. There you go. Uh,

1218
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:46,600
 Paul, you're up. I'm going to go, I'm going to take Turkey 800 please. I got to get back

1219
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:52,160
 on the board. This 1999 movie based on Michael Crichton's novel Eaters of the Dead grossed

1220
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:58,320
 about $62 million worldwide on a bigger than $100 million budget. I guess that was an unlucky

1221
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:02,000
 number. I'm going to tell you what this movie should have made way more money. This is not

1222
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:09,180
 a Turkey. This is an exceptional film. Antonio Bandara's puts in a superstar performance

1223
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:16,800
 in the 13th warrior. The 13th warrior is correct. It is such a good movie. It is good. I have

1224
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:21,280
 that on DVD. That is one of my favorite movies. It's great. JJ was just talking about how

1225
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:27,380
 good cutthroat Island is Paul. Don't be too excited to be on her team. I'm on, I'm on

1226
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:33,160
 team 13th warrior. I don't give a shit. Cutthroat Island, whatever. But yeah, 13th movie all

1227
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:39,480
 time is the Phantom with Billy Zane though. So stop it. Stop it. He was the bomb in Phantom's

1228
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:48,920
 yo anyone who's like absolutely repping Billy Zane first. Yeah. It's an insane person. No,

1229
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:54,240
 that's just, that was just, uh, JJ, I know somebody else in town that that is their favorite

1230
01:16:54,240 --> 01:17:00,760
 movie. I'm going to make sure the two of you meet. Holy shit. I'm going to introduce you.

1231
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:07,160
 You don't know them yet. God. You're going to, you're going to, you're going to be better

1232
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:12,400
 be careful, Jacob. You don't want to get too zaniacs in the same room together. Like a

1233
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:23,120
 little too zany. It's, it's Matt Franco. It's always been Matt Franco. He's got it on a

1234
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:29,060
 loop in his dressing room. Uh, Frank and I literally can talk to each other in quotes

1235
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:34,920
 from nineties magic specials and only quotes from nineties magic specials. All right. Raise

1236
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:40,940
 your hand if you're surprised. Okay. Raise your hand if you want to be in that room.

1237
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:52,080
 No hands free. JJ, where do we go? Where do we go? Um, um, maybe a how it started. How

1238
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:57,800
 brave are you? Let's do it. How it started for 400. This six film franchise originated

1239
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:03,020
 from an unused spec script for an episode of the X-Files. It's latest entry grossed

1240
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:21,920
 over $300 million this year. Six films, aliens or conspiracies guy, girl, guy, girl investigators.

1241
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:30,040
 Paul, you know this one? Uh, it could be something like the nun, you know, they have those one

1242
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:35,320
 off kind of ghosty stuff, you know, monster of the week kind of thing. But I'm thinking

1243
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:42,160
 six films. When was this, when was this, uh, scooperty? Uh, it's recent. It's a, it's

1244
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:47,880
 a Thanksgiving. It's a Thanksgiving scooperty for 300 million this year. So it's a film

1245
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:55,160
 that came out this year. It's part of a horror movie. Uh, is what he called up to six movies

1246
01:18:55,160 --> 01:19:06,720
 now. Um, Oh, you know what? I think it might be paranormal activity. Oh, that gives that

1247
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:14,920
 come out this year. I think there was another parent. I don't know activity or the, I'm

1248
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:21,080
 definitely passing Paul. What is it? I mean, paranormal activity or the conjuring is the

1249
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:27,080
 conjuring up to six. I'm going to get, I'm going to guess conjuring. I'm guessing conjuring.

1250
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:32,480
 Let's see. Final destination. I eat my own butt fart on a shit. Okay. I should have known

1251
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:36,360
 wait. All right. My first thing was found as a nation, but it initially bombed. So the

1252
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:40,080
 fact that said it reached over 300 million, I'm surprised because yeah, this latest reboot

1253
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:44,100
 was really hot. People were really, I think this, I think it got like a cult following

1254
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:48,400
 thing with the sequels and all. I think it's just one of those. And it also got real viral.

1255
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:52,240
 I thought it was opening weekend this week and so I didn't guess that millennials are

1256
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:59,720
 desperate to get killed by a log carrying truck. Who is it? Oh man, sign me up. I'll

1257
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:05,880
 try potpourri for 800 right back to zero fart. This is the only current flag of a sovereign

1258
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:17,720
 country without elements in white, red, or blue. I got this white, red, or blue. Is it,

1259
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:23,800
 I'll take a guess on this one. Brazil. Is it, is it Brazil? Maybe Jamaica. Y'all think

1260
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:30,080
 it's Brazil. Oh, I think you might be right. It is Jamaica. You were right. Yeah. Got that

1261
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:35,520
 one wrong. Wait, can I get it right? What the hell? He didn't pass you jerk. I didn't

1262
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:39,840
 pass. I just got it wrong. I don't give a shit. I still want the points. I lost points.

1263
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:50,240
 That's how the game works. Fair enough. Paul, you're up. Potpourri. 200. This name later

1264
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:55,080
 shared with Star Wars characters was given to the Mohawk steelworkers who helped build

1265
01:20:55,080 --> 01:21:12,440
 modern New York City. Ewoks. Ugnaughts? Sure. Wait. Yeah. I'll go with Ugnaughts. All right.

1266
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:18,160
 Skywalkers. Right, right, right. That makes a lot of sense. See Paul, since that was your

1267
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:27,680
 turn, I'm going to address your points with that question. Thank you. Matt. JJ. JJ controls

1268
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:37,640
 me. What's their number? 600. What's their number for 600? Daily Double. Oh shit. Yeah,

1269
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:47,040
 it's on the line now. The current Pope. Oh Jesus. Is Pope Leo the what? Oh shit. I don't

1270
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:54,680
 give a shit about the popes. The American from Chicago. The popiest pope that ever poked.

1271
01:21:54,680 --> 01:22:01,600
 Oh, I love it. Richard. Pope Leo to Bears. I would rather be locked in a Scottish basement

1272
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:09,640
 than figure out whose pope is whose. I will. If you would ask for his name, I could not

1273
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:15,080
 have given you Leo. Right. Like I said, I know he's from Chicago. I know he's Chicago.

1274
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:18,880
 That's all I know. Yeah, I know. We're so. He literally had a rave at the Vatican like

1275
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:24,880
 last week. I get it, JJ. I hate people trying to make these popes hip and likable. It's

1276
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:32,280
 like, okay, okay. Yeah. Yeah, but this pope has really good drugs. And good pizza. All

1277
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:41,360
 right. Six. Two. Let's try six. 14. Oh, missed it by that much. Close. There's been a lot

1278
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:50,080
 of Leos. Good Lord. It's me. I'll try. How it started. 600. This 1992 movie turned Tony

1279
01:22:50,080 --> 01:23:00,240
 winning musical was originally conceived as an entry of Tales from the Crypt. Ooh. 1992

1280
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:08,780
 movie turned Tony winning musical. Tales from the Crypt. That is, of course, The Lion King.

1281
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:18,840
 The Lion King. Really? Huh? No, I don't know. Well, what do we suppose? What do we got?

1282
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:27,600
 92. 92 musical. I think I know. I think I got it. I think I got it. I mean, I got to

1283
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:34,000
 pass. Paul, it passes to you. What do you think? I got to guess Beetlejuice. Yeah, that's got

1284
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:40,560
 to be it. Yeah. Oh no. Death Becomes Her. Death Becomes Her. I lost more points. Paul,

1285
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:46,440
 he lost the point. I heard that show's amazing though. SJ saw it right before it got nominated

1286
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:51,320
 for the Tony. She saw it like with a half empty audience with the original cast and

1287
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:54,920
 was like, oh, this is just spectacular. She was so mad that I didn't see it with her.

1288
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:58,880
 Oh wow. Paul, you're up. I'll do how it started for eight to try and get back into negative

1289
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:04,800
 nothing. Get in there. This four-time Golden Globe nominee was originally cast as Sonya

1290
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:10,560
 Blade in 1995's Mortal Kombat. Unfortunately, or fortunately, she broke her wrist while

1291
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:15,360
 training for the role and was replaced by that lady who married Pete Sampras. Right.

1292
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:31,000
 This was Kate Winslet. Her name was Carmen in that fucking thing. Carmen Electra? No,

1293
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:36,800
 it's Cameron Diaz. Cameron Diaz. Cameron Diaz is correct. I know my Mortal Kombat Trilogy

1294
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:44,080
 trivia. You do. Yeah. That gets Matt all the way back to zero, which puts him in the lead

1295
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:50,200
 with zero points. Matt is at negative 200 and I am at negative 400. Thanks a lot, ML

1296
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:56,000
 Kennedy. Matt, you're up. You got four questions left. It's anyone's game. I think there's

1297
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:07,080
 a daily double left too. Let's go with potpourri for 400. The roots of this ice cream come

1298
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:18,880
 from Greek words meaning new and city. The roots of this ice cream name? Huh. Ben and

1299
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:34,560
 Jerry. Haagen-Dazs. JJ, you don't need Greek words for new? Nope. Moose tracks. So I'm

1300
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:42,600
 just repeating everybody in the chat. What's my yogurt? What's on my yogurt container?

1301
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:47,040
 What do all the captains say? You probably know some Greek. All the captains are Greek.

1302
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:55,680
 That's true. Is it Haagen-Dazs? Haagen-Dazs is a made up name. No, it's not a daily double.

1303
01:25:55,680 --> 01:26:00,240
 Oh, then what am I doing? Pass. I don't give a shit. Yeah, I passed too. Paul. No, I passed.

1304
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:07,880
 I have no idea. Neapolitan. Oh man. We're so dumb. If only any of us had thought about

1305
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:11,760
 the show that we're currently on. Let's see. I'll try to get some points. What's their

1306
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:20,960
 number for 800? The youngest of George Foreman's sons is named what? I believe it's George.

1307
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:27,640
 I think they're just all named George. It's George the sixth, little Joey. Little Joey.

1308
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:35,080
 Wait, do I get credit for George? Wait, no. It was in the category of what's the number?

1309
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:42,200
 I don't know. Was it? If it was what's the number then I got it wrong. I did not answer

1310
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:48,800
 a number. Oh, how it started. Oh no, it was what's their number. Yeah. So no, I didn't

1311
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:52,840
 deserve those points and I didn't get them. Paul, you're up. You got what's their number

1312
01:26:52,840 --> 01:27:00,680
 for 400 or turkeys for 200. I'll try turkeys for two. This 2012 Disney movie based off

1313
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:06,400
 a princess of Mars managed to lose somewhere around $200 million for the studio. The movie

1314
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:15,680
 isn't bad. John Carter. Paul has other thoughts. John Carter of Mars. John Carter of Mars.

1315
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:20,000
 Oh, it was just John Carter. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you got that wrong. You said of Mars. I

1316
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:25,180
 did say of Mars. And that is incorrect. And Matt closing out the category and the game.

1317
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:30,640
 Going for the tie. Going for the tie. High stakes. What's their number? And it's a daily

1318
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:36,160
 double. Oh shit. It doesn't increase anything. Oh, that's right. It doesn't. The current

1319
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:42,800
 King of England is King Charles the what? The gracious. The King. Charles's have there

1320
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:49,960
 been. Boy, if there was ever a time to start up a new Charles in charge. Let's see, Elizabeth

1321
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:58,040
 was Elizabeth the second. So that would make King Charles got bail is King Charles. Daily

1322
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:05,480
 double. So I have to guess. The good thing is you know that it's a number. So it's not

1323
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:14,240
 like there are infinite wrong answers. I'll go with third King Charles. The third is correct.

1324
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:22,960
 Wow. Well done, Matt. That is the game. Matt and Paul are tied at negative or at 200 points

1325
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:29,000
 apiece. I have negative 1200 points. But since of course, Matt and Paul tied, cat's game.

1326
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:35,520
 I win. Jacob wins. Jacob wins. Congratulations, Jacob. I know that's from ML Kennedy. Thank

1327
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:38,960
 you. Thank you. I hope I hope when they because we get we get updates over who writes them.

1328
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:44,360
 They score them right. But I hope they get it right. They score your win for Paul and

1329
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:50,960
 I tie. I hope that was you guys get the points. Yeah, you get the points in the points totals.

1330
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:54,840
 But yeah, yeah, but I should get credit for the win. That was a really good one. ML Kennedy.

1331
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:59,000

1337
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:24,760
 guest of mine brought for you. Oh, well, there you go. Our friend Scott Burrell from Natchitoches

1339

1340
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:41,240
 That was when they reunited. Yeah. So I've got I've got a hat here for you. Freaking

1341
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:46,360
 awesome. Yes, I'm very excited about that hat. I want to thank Dr. Mike for stopping

1342
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:50,280
 by today. Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Dr. Mike. He and I've been texting since he got

1343
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:54,640
 off air. Next time we do a double episode because because when we do two episodes, he

1344
01:29:54,640 --> 01:30:01,000
 can wake up at a reasonable hour and join us. We're going to do a Dr. Mike answers all

1345
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:06,000
 of our medical questions episode. We'll tell the scoops in advance. Oh, good. Yes. All

1346
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:10,160
 the scoops. That's a great idea. That's a brilliant idea. Yeah. We should do that sooner

1347
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:16,760
 than later. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, I feel like most of the scoops questions involved

1348
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:21,440
 hemorrhoids and I feel like we covered most of that today. We did cover a lot of hemorrhoids.

1349
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:26,360
 There's no doubt that's going to be hashtag butt stuff. That's there's no doubt. Well,

1350
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:31,720
 I mean, it's Dr. Mike's personal hashtag. Did we did we where did we come down on the

1351
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:36,720
 razor in your hemorrhoids or no? That's a bad idea. Okay. Okay. Yeah. You're saying

1352
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:44,440
 like it was up in the air. It wasn't 100%. I wasn't 100%. I also want to thank JJ, Jessica

1353
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:51,440
 Jane for stopping by. Thank you, JJ. I love you guys. Thanks for coming by. Magic over

01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:58,360
 follow her on Instagram. Follow her in real life. She's going to follow. You're going

1356
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:02,200
 to follow her down alleys. You're going to find single shoes. It's going to be a whole

1357
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:11,160
 thing. Listen, I am so lonely. I was just going to say if you think you're going to

1358
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:14,880
 follow her physically, you get in line. There's at least there's at least four other people

1359
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:20,560
 trying to do that. They're all magicians. Well, they're not trying hard enough because

1411
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:41,480
 send her a nice gift. What should you send her? Send her a Fart in a Bag. Fartsinabag.biz.

1412
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:44,480
 Farts, farts, farts, farts, farts, fartsinabag.biz.

1413
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:54,120
 That's fartsinabag.biz. Not along with, what's the other one? PreachingFun.com.

1414
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:55,120
 JJ's all faster.

1415
01:36:55,120 --> 01:37:03,120
 JJ distracted me with her farts in a bag. Not along with PreachingFun.com. It takes

1416
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:07,320
 you to our Patreon page where for as little as $3 a month, you can help keep this show

1417
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:12,880
 on the air. Of course, we are funded by our Patreons, so head over there, fartsinabag.biz,

1418
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:17,400
 PreachingFun.com. Go over and do it now. Another thing you can do after you have gone over

1419
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:22,600
 and given us most of your money at PreachingFun.com and fartsinabag.biz, if you have any of it

1420
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:28,240
 left over, you can go over to GoFundMe and they are funding the last of the Hey Scoops

1421
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:34,760
 the Movie. Help finish Hey Scoops the Movie. If you look up Hey Scoops GoFundMe on Google,

1422
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:38,480
 it takes you right to the page. The page is actually called Help Finish Hey Scoops the

1423
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:43,120
 Movie. They are currently 70% on their way to the goal.

1424
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:45,560
 We want to push it past the goal.

1425
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:49,840
 And we want to go past the goal, of course. Because there's going to be more expenses

1426
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:54,640
 and everything. It's going to be a bit of a moving target, but it's going to be all

1427
01:37:54,640 --> 01:38:00,160
 reasonable and great. So if you're interested at all in the Hey Scoops Movie, go over there.

1428
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:02,960
 How big of a role does Vinnie have in the documentary?

1429
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:08,960
 I was going to ask if he's in that day movie. The day that they were filming the movie,

1430
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:09,960
 I'm sure he did.

1431
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:17,440
 I think he's the narrator, right? He's the Jiminy Cricket, I think, of the movie.

1432
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:20,800
 No, no, no, no. Not okay.

1433
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:26,400
 Yeah. Happy Thanksgiving. Oh, yeah. And just a shout out to all of those. Well, I guess

1434
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:32,880
 it's too late now. But I'm hosting the Hangout tomorrow at seven o'clock. Oh, yeah, it's

1435
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:41,000
 too late. Last episode, you would have heard it, but whatever. Yeah. Good job. Put a button

1436
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:46,520
 on that one. Thanks, guys. Glad we circled back. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I'm on top of

1437
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:47,520
 it.

1438
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:55,000
 Oh, right. Does anyone else have any announcements? Yeah. Tomorrow, Hangout, 7 p.m. But that's

1439
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,480
 Wednesday. That was last week, Paul. That was last week. And this is going out Thanksgiving,

1440
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:02,040
 right? Monday. This technically our Thanksgiving episode, yeah? Okay, great. This is our post

1441
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:05,760
 Thanksgiving episode. This is our Monday after Thanksgiving episode. Oh. We're all so full.

1442
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:11,560
 This is our tryptophan episode. Yeah. Yeah. So we hope that you use some song lyrics if

1443
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:16,840
 you got challenged to say grace at your table. Yeah, don't forget to do the... Bermuda Bahama,

1444
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:21,760
 come on, pretty mama. Yeah. The Kokomo challenge. The Kokomo challenge. How much Kokomo can

1445
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:29,200
 you fake for grace? That's always... If you didn't do it at Thanksgiving, Christmas is

1446
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:33,560
 right around the corner. That's right. They always get a chance. I want somebody to get

1447
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:37,200
 through it 100% one of these days. It's going to be awesome. I think the Kokomo challenge

1448
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:41,200
 is one of the funniest things we've ever done. It is. It really is. It really is. We should

1449
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:47,480
 have stopped there. Because a lot of it sounds like a prayer. Yeah. All right. Thanks for

1450
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:55,080
 everybody. Stay safe out there. We love you and we'll see you soon. We'll see you soon.

1451
01:39:55,080 --> 01:40:07,760
 That dreamy look in your eyes gives me a tropical contact high. Thank you, Jesus. Pass the gravy.

1452
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:22,760
 We're preaching fun. See ya.
