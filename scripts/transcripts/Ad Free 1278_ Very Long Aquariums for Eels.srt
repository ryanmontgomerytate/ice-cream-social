 that space it has like it has a pool and workout equipment are you just going to

40
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,160
 so it's going to be another gym oh yeah i forget about the pool sure that makes

41
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,200
 sense the pool does it's why it's why i had joined that particular gym is

42
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,720
 because all right because you could go in there and and uh and and stare at the

43
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,920
 young ladies who were swimming exactly i mean you can go swim exactly but i have

44
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,760
 those glasses that look like eyeballs that are looking up and so therefore you

45
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,120
 can't tell that i'm staring at the spring ones yeah but i i taped them so

46
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,960
 they just look like they're looking up good smart so that way that way i'm not

47
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,440
 creepy that's right that's why he's the best folks

48
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:05,680
 that's why he's the best and i uh uh go so what i do is i go to the community

49
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,760
 center it's called the multi multi multi-gen multi-gen center multi-generational

50
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,400
 center right okay so they have you know kids camps they got swimming lessons

51
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,640
 they have like uh classrooms for uh to teach classes for adults it's a big it's

52
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,800
 a big big outfit over there and one of the houses is a gym and a walking track

53
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,640
 and a pool but a big like okay it's like where the where the competitions are

54
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:34,640
 where the swimming competitions are uh locally for for for the schools got you

55
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,160
 and so i go to the gym in the evening around like 5 30

56
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,000
 which means the sun has just gone down and it was super windy yesterday like

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,360
 really windy crazy breezy yesterday and i look out the window and there's a

58
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:55,040
 fucking swim meet happening

59
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:02,240
 i was like what fucking hell on earth why why it's it's still january i know

60
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,280
 we live in the desert but it's still january

61
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,120
 yes why on earth is an outdoor swimming meet happening

62
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,720
 i mean best case scenario in the pool and i assume an unheated pool in the

63
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,840
 desert in january it's not pleasant it's not nice

64
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,440
 no like without a breeze it's just it still was a cold day

65
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,480
 but it was like that means like you know like oh man when when you get wet

66
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,720
 and then there's a breeze i mean that's all right yeah

67
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,240
 i couldn't believe it's all these kids it's honestly the reason that i don't

68
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,040
 swim half the time i don't swim it's because

69
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,960
 right now i'm i'm just not swimming in case a breeze comes up

70
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,920
 i mean it's been a minute but i that story where i was hired to be a

71
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,000
 bathing suit model by accident i think i've told the story on air

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,680
 it's been a while it's been a while though but uh yeah so so they'd cast just

73
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,280
 off of headshots and then it was me three male models and four gorgeous

74
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,000
 women models and then a bunch of bathing suits that didn't fit on my fat body

75
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,040
 and then that's right i forgot they had the bathing suits

76
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,320
 so i stuffed into one of them like a sausage and then yep good

77
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,760
 we had to go do like a pool shoot and there's literally like two pools like a

78
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,680
 giant lap pool and this beautiful kind of

79
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,000
 circular fountain pool for like um hanging out and renting cabanas

80
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,920
 right and so they set this really fancy camera

81
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:34,560
 and they art directed me to the furthest place away from the camera

82
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,320
 they put a fake that that is good art direction

83
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,440
 they put a fake drink in my hand and put me literally

84
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,520
 200 yards away from the camera all right so they had the hotter people closer to

85
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,000
 the first pool i was just supposed to be decorative

86
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,080
 like background in the second pool here's what they did they put all the

87
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,280
 they put all the super hot people in the close-up pool

88
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,840
 and they put me behind the camera with a jib

89
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,120
 can you can you hold this this bounce this light bouncer

90
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,200
 this reflector can you hold it i don't think i'm even on camera over here no

91
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,680
 you are you are don't worry about it you're fine

92
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,600
 the look i remember still in the art dresser's face when i was trying to

93
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,680
 squeeze into a bathing suit and him just going like why

94
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,120
 why are you here what have i done to deserve this

95
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,760
 hanging out in the tent and listen to all the hot people talk about all the

96
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,880
 different things they have for their veggies vegetable smoothies and which

97
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,800
 blenders they use and stuff i was like i was like i know what a

98
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,360
 blender is

99
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,240
 i just put snakes in mine but it was freezing cold it was like a free it was

100
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,720
 it was like uh it wasn't as cold as today but it was it was probably like

101
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,120
 50 degrees still very cold to be in a pool and so

102
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,120
 i uh being the only person in pool b uh really took my time getting in trying

103
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,000
 to not even let it ripple it was like even if i just got up on my on my

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,200
 stomach like the wind was blowing and it would just freeze right

105
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,360
 so i was staying like perfectly still in the water to like not like to

106
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,120
 establish a level and not change it right that was yeah that's what i was

107
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,280
 doing and then at one point they want to shake

108
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,560
 things up i'm gonna shake things up and decide to move people around

109
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,720
 except me they said to keep me right where i was

110
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:23,920
 well they had taken the first shoot to uh build a wall

111
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,640
 but they set the wall up between me and the camera they told one of the hot

112
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,840
 guys pretending your friends with fatso back there right so they sent him back

113
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,800
 there and uh and you said that's not how you

114
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,520
 pronounce my name

115
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,000
 and uh and he was a big old beautiful dummy

116
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,680
 so he ran great and just jumped in the pool

117
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,200
 yes ran and just leapt into the pool and i was like no

118
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,280
 i've established i've established a level

119
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,320
 you're interfering with my level you're ruining it for both of us

120
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,520
 you're gonna be mad about this too and then he gets up he's wet and then we

121
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,080
 start staying still and pretending to talk and gesture one another while they

122
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:19,680
 do this right and uh and he is like man it sucks uh it's cold

123
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:26,000
 i was like yeah sure does buddy uh he was like because the wind's

124
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,760
 blowing i was like no one of us has already figured that out

125
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,440
 yeah the other of us knows which blender to have to make the best vegetable

126
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,440
 smoothies and the other knows how wind works on

127
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,960
 cold skin but we both got this gig didn't we

128
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,720
 we're both getting the same check buddy

129
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,720
 uh i still remember that shoot came out uh it was uh

130
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,160
 it was it was not uh i was not in the pool stuff

131
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,600
 i was in the uh at one point they like decided like

132
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,160
 center attention on me and like do things with like they were pushing me in

133
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,360
 the pool right and that was oh okay those were the those are the final shots

134
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,240
 the pool was me getting pushed in the pool

135
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,000
 while girls with their dad showed up like

136
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,080
 give us money and let us gamble go away

137
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,680
 the those those didn't make it because they probably looked over things like it

138
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,320
 just looks like we're picking on someone right now i was just fat this time i was

139
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,880

00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,880
 trouble for yeah me too yeah my kids throw out like

171
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,440
 it's nothing all the time really yeah

172
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,960
 do you smack them just give them a one point give them a taste of the back of

173
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,760
 the hand at one point i was like you know i offer to

 and my youngest goes well that sucks and i i didn't go like hey time out

177
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,520
 let's hold up that was an extreme thing to say

178
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,320
 when i was a kid you guys throw it out like it's nothing

179
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,480
 and when you directed at me it's very jarring and it makes me really angry

180
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,080
 sorry i'm making you breakfast sorry your spoiled ass has done up waffles

181
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,720
 today mother right but uh yeah so my kids say

182
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,880
 sucks like no problem i hear other kids say it

183
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,920
 so i guess it's just okay to say sucks maybe maybe um

184
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,680
 i definitely have a memory of me saying something sucks to my dad

185
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,520
 and him stopping and just just looking at me and saying something along the

186
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,320
 lines of sucks what go ahead what does it

187
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,520
 suck

188
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,560

189
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,360
 taking titties dad titty

190
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,400

191
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,640
 although you can't you still can't say shut up

192
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,960
 my kids now just say shut up um we got in trouble when we were little for

194
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,480
 i remember really getting in trouble

195
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,480

00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,120
 which i don't even think people understand

198
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,680
 i don't even think that's like even on the radar as an insult anymore

199
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,920

 getting ready to take a shower uh-huh and i'm scrolling on my phone

210
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,240

211
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,720
 but the local toy shop going out of business sale

212
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:31,760

00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,720
 the fact that he came back is just uh i'm honestly surprised he's here now

214
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,240
 i know no no i would tell it's only 10 minutes away from my house

215
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,640
 so uh i was down there it was basically the bad signal went to the sky

216
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:49,120
 yeah yeah i had no choice i answered the siren call

217
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,600
 and went to the toy store and just was zombieing out for an hour

218
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,800
 just oh what can i get you know i got i got a couple good little little

219
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,960
 trinkets nothing too crazy and go too crazy too crazy local toy

220
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,240
 stores also go get a business so pour one out yeah

221
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:13,520
 no this was uh this place this place is called toy land

222
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,680
 if anyone has ever thought paul isn't that selective with his rage

223
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:24,640
 okay no i this place is uh okay you guys have you guys don't have

224
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,880
 you guys don't have ollies on that side of the world all this

225
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,960
 was ollies so ollies for the us east coasters

226
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,840
 is this discount chain that's sort of like big lots was in its heyday

227
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,680
 i'm from the east coast so is it like a newer east coast thing i think so

228
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:48,320
 yeah okay so uh you remember big lots when it first popped off

229
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,320
 yeah you could get some really amazing as a kid

230
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,520
 you could get some amazing deals you could take five bucks down there

231
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,120
 and come home with something significant yeah you know

232
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,440
 oh yeah yeah so ollies does this they get warehouses full of

233
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,120
 old toys and things and put them at pretty deep discount and

234
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,880
 sometimes they you know clearance them out even there

235
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,160
 what this toy store toy land was doing was clearing out the best of ollies

236
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,200
 sales oh bringing them to their store and repricing them

237
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:29,840
 above and right at msrp or higher so i was kind of like well this isn't a

238
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,520
 business plan that can work i mean there you go so their business

239
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,000
 plan was take things out of the bargain bin

240
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,440
 mark them up and then try to resell them yes

241
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,160
 that's already called ebay i know i don't know why it's basically like an

242
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,280
 ebay but but not as many good items

243
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,840
 now occasionally i found some deals at the when stores start doing corporate

244
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,440
 dumpster diving uh things are bad all over things are

245
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,400
 bad all over and i hate to see a small business go under

246
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,040
 but i also know that they are straight up just resellers

247
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,400
 and they put everything at a price that no one could deal with

248
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,680
 and they were doing big time pokemon scalping as well

249
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,120
 so i'm just like man do you think it's possible that they're just faking the

250
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,520
 out of business sale and they're just going to be one of those stores that's

251
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,240
 perpetually going out of business that's just their new thing

252
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,720
 no uh i the owner was there and i heard you guys are listening to the last

253
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:31,040
 episode of matt and madely's oh shit see this is how it goes

254
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,240
 now the owners the owners were there and they were talking about

255
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,880
 the next chapter or whatever so clearly they've got some other scheme up their

256
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,400
 11 is the next chapter chapter 11 you're right

257
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,840
 you're right uh that's yeah there's two locations in the pittsburgh area that

258
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,000
 are going under uh wait again it it uh makes me sad

259
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,240
 but uh you know not that sad because it was a dumb model

260
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,000
 and i would go like i'd been there like four or five times they'd only been

261
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,560
 open about a year and i'd been there a couple times to

262
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,360
 try and support them and the last time i went i just walked

263
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,520
 right out with nothing because i was like there ain't shit here you know it's

264
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,040
 just sad did you ever talk to him like did they

265
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,640
 properly nerd out about toy products were they no it's not like that they're

266
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,840
 not in it for the love he's not in it for the love he's just a scalpy

267
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,320
 he's a scalpy scalp this is it paul needs some heart in there

268
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,760
 i imagine he has i imagine he has probably

269
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,160
 one fixation i don't know what that might be

270
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,160
 most when you come back to vegas you always go to the same toy spot around

271
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,720
 the corner from my house yeah ralph's name right well ralph's

272
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,080
 is the comic book shop okay oh right right and then and then

273
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,520
 ralph's just happened to have a new toy store

274
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,880
 rogue toys built a place right in that same slot

275
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,480
 that's a total nerd cave now man it's got rogue toys

276
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,760
 it's got that uh smashing grounds rogue toys has always been in that uh in

277
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,240
 that ballpark though they they've always like when they were downtown and

278
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,960
 everything they were always that like real nerdy

279
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,760
 spot like yeah no rogue toys is great i had

280
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,960
 wonderful i always i always knew that if paul got a divorce

281

 and then got remarried i could go get his remarried gift

282
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,840
 at that rogue toys you could you could buy

283
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,480
 half my collection i sold nearly four thousand dollars worth of toys to them

284
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,440
 and oh and that was at a loss for me so you know uh when i was moving i had to

285
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,080
 get rid of so much stuff but they were cool about it

286
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,280
 the only thing that really bugged me is i went back in and i'd sold them some of

287
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,840
 my uh mega blocks turtle stuff and i

288
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,680
 i let go of a piece that i came back and i was like what are you charging for

289
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:46,080
 that that i gave you for ten dollars jesus

290
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,360
 so yeah there were there were one or two things i was like go back and look again

291
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,480
 well i mean well that was the thing i went back and i was like oh look

296
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,000

00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:20,480
 do they even have card catalogs at the library more

464
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,480
 yes i don't know sure because we've all been to the library recently

465
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,080
 um i have why i was late to the podcast i have

466
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,920
 everything was 50 off i think i take i take my kids to the library but we

467
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,040
 rarely we don't usually use the dewey decimal system over there

468
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,920
 no i guess most of it's all been transferred to

469
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,120
 computer but i wonder if they ever i guess did they

470
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,760
 i know there's no reason to keep all that data i guess on cards

471
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,360
 uh i wonder what the i should look online i'm just asking questions into the

472
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:54,400
 fucking void but what can you consider a good repurposing

473
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:59,920
 of those dewey decimal card holders all those huge those huge like very

474
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,680
 specifically sized drawers well what would you imagine would be a good

475
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,400
 second use for those spice rack comes to mind a very large

476
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,320
 spice rack i mean for a for like a for like an industrial kitchen

477
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,240
 i don't i mean that's a lot of spices it would take up a lot it does take up a

478
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,200
 lot of space gun rack could you fit a rifle in some of

479
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,440
 those long boxes probably oh be kind of cool to just pull out a

480
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,000
 shelf of guns i've got it i've got it what do you got

481
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,960
 don't even move them out of the library turn them into beehives

482
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:42,160
 in the library just in the library beehives an apiary i mean they would

483
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:48,640
 work as hives i suppose yep no no i think that i figured it out

484
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,400
 canada library crystals saying business cards

485
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,120
 uh ravi saying storage of chinese medicine yeah that's how i think uh

486
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:02,080
 rhino penises would slide in there pretty good

487
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:08,960
 um well once you dehydrate them of course j i wasn't talking about non

488
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,200
 dehydrated rhino penises those are what you're always talking

489
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,880
 about hydrated rhino penises paul

490
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,040
 you won't shut up about hydrated rhino penis

491
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,960
 just because it was my band in college you'll have that one single we did have

492
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,080
 that one single it was good the shirt was the thing that

493
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,000
 kept us going we had a really cool shirt for hydrated rhino penis

494
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,520
 oh yeah yeah what was the three-dimensional aspect of it that i

495
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,240
 think people really appreciate it people liked it it was made of that

496
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,880
 remember that puffy paint that was such a rage back in the late 80s

497
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,280
 it was all puffy paint puffy paint shirts were terrible

498
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,560
 puffy paint dehydrate or hydrated rhino penis shirts

499
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,000
 were all the rage at my school

500
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,240
 modern day apothecary tables yeah that could be cool

501
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,040
 oh my god they could store pokemon and magic cards holy shit

502
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,000
 that'd be an awesome way to store your pokemon and magic

503
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,040
 card i like all these suggestions like we have a giant card catalog what could

504
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:18,400
 we repurpose this as oh a card holder i know i know it's dumb but it would work

505
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,560
 exactly right exactly okay all right yeah you're right

506
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,400
 all right what else what other thing could you do

507
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,840
 that i already said beehive already got the right answer what about

508
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,880
 a bunch of weird long ways aquariums

509
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,000
 but that would have to be just fish that like living in the dark most of the time

510
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,720
 or or he left the drawer oh eels eels that don't want to turn around

511
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:50,960
 drawers of eels and snakes that don't want to turn around

512
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,400
 eels that hate turning around

513
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:03,680
 oh my god oh it would be great for organizing lego

514
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:10,080
 yes would be awesome for that i keep waiting for paul to move on to

515
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,360
 anything else but he just keeps listing off things that people are saying that

516
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:17,200
 you can do with a card catalog i think it's a great topic we're not

517
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,080
 talking about enough because think about the thousands of

518
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,320
 libraries that are out in the country right now

519
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,760
 and think about the disused uh-huh dewy decimal card catalog holders

520
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,440
 i mean it's our universities those probably took up a room

521
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,240
 sure right sure and did this is the problem we need to be dealing with are

522
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,320
 we just destroying this furniture are we just throwing these out is that

523
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,760
 what's happening no they repurposed it a very long

524
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:49,600
 aquarium repurpose recycle reuse into very long aquariums for eels that

525
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:55,040
 don't need to turn right yeah or we could you need directional

526
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:00,800
 eels we could put uh beta fish they don't move around very much

527
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,560
 or is that just because people are cool to them the who kind of fish

528
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,960
 the alpha fish uh alpha fish don't don't aren't that's not real

529
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,680
 that the guy who wrote about the alpha fish regrets his paper about the alpha

530
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:19,120
 yeah but you got that whole gig you you got that whole gig teaching alpha fish

531
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:23,440
 how to talk to people i did i did but i misconstrued it and i

532
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,600
 thought it was part of the whole alphabet i thought it was a alphabet fish

533
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:34,240
 but you do love a bit i do yeah don't get me started omega fish

534
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:40,400
 the alpha fish oh mega oh mega me

535
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:46,240
 oh i can't believe i'm gonna move on from this but let's do some scoop mail

 message for you son you you can move on all you want i am continuing to come up

537
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,320
 with repurposing ideas for disused card catalogs

 and i'm continuing to use greek letters with aquatic animals

539
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,080
 next up zy dolphins

540
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:10,480
 zy dolphin sounds like a fucking new medicine for ed

541
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,960
 i would like to introduce everyone to this my epsilon seahorse

542
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,320
 i was like uh i got targeted on instagram for

543
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,800
 like basically like don't get the wrong ed meds if you have to pee urgently

544
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,200
 after you have an orgasm do you like do you sprint to the toilet after

545
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,520
 after you have an orgasm there must be there's a greater

546
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:42,560
 there's a greater scientific uh uh area of concern uh going on

547
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,400
 and i was like wait wait isn't that isn't that the whole thing you orgasm and

548
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,880
 then pee like that's the whole thing it's like

549
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,520
 it's that's your doctor paul that's your doctor it's just one continuous stream

550
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,640
 right you just wait for you for you guys orgasm

551
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,520
 and peeing is different

552
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:07,520
 wait what's happening the ad is like why is the world spinning

553
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,480
 do you think you're into golden showers you're not

554
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,320
 you have a scientific health issue that needs addressing

555
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:26,080
 oh no boy oh boy that the the amount of treatment for that shit

556
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,560
 i mean i guess it's whatever well no i know for me i was like wait i'm not

557
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,760
 i'm not even at step one of this medical thing yet so like why are we

558
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,680
 how did i end up how did you get on that targeting on the long end of the arc of

559
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,800
 that yeah that is that is very specific

560
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,880
 like yeah do you find yeah have you experienced slight green

561
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,360
 discoloration in your balls after ejaculating using this

562
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,160
 medication you might be using the wrong stuff

563
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,080
 you have food coloring you have food coloring you've been eating green eggs

564
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:05,200
 and ham we got an email from scoopy ramon

565
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,080
 hey gentleman of the churn and possible guest

566
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:12,080
 nope uh through a series of random mental connections not worth detailing

567
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,400
 here i recently found myself regaling someone

568
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,760
 with a story of enthusiasm over experience from my past

569
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,440
 it made me think that one or all of you might have a story that fits this

570
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,600
 category okay most of my most of my stories are

571
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:32,000
 enthusiasm over experience wait a minute are we are we insinuating

572
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 that our enthusiasm outpaces our experience

573
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,440
 well when you when we say i love boobies what does that sound like does it sound

574
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,080
 like we have experience or does it sound like we're just enthusiastic

575
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,840
 enthusiastic yeah i mean we are enthusiastic

576
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:51,760
 in that respect my enthusiasm far outpaces my experience there you go

577
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,600
 so here's my example of enthusiasm versus experience in high school

578
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,440
 i first caught the acting bug by doing the school plays a friend of mine i'll

579
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,160
 call him chuck because that was his name had played an extra as a freshman and

580
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,840
 had told me repeatedly about how much fun it was and how many girls were in the

581
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,720
 school plays one of those two things convinced me

582
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,440
 to audition fast forward a bit and chuck and i are

583
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,160
 now both extras in the next school play the play was the crucible and as

584
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,360
 freshmen we were both relegated to extras in a

585
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,840
 scene where two or three other characters are talking

586
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,520
 chuck and i were to play jail guards or something but they were of course

587
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,600
 non-speaking parts but shouldn't we do be doing something

588
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:36,640
 dumbass attention starve 16 year old me asked that exact question

589
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:44,240
 fine just don't steal focus was the reply and thus in the production of the

590
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,640
 crucible in my high school there were two puritanical jail

591
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,560
 guards who so fervently believed that the rest of the world

592
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,800
 was too chill about armageddon and stuff to stay in england

593
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,120
 did their best to not make any noise as they shot dice in the background of the

594
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:05,600
 salem witch trials also i can't tell if it makes it better

595
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,360
 or worse that we uh all my calls check up i'm doing

596
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:13,920
 scoop mail there you go sorry i can't tell if it makes it better or

597
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,520
 worse than we fashioned our own dice out of play from the art room

598
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,600
 so that they would be period in hopes that the director would let us do more

599
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:26,880
 in the play that is way worse definitely worse but

600
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,120
 definitely hilarious that is hilarious period dice

601
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:35,120
 and there's no way no way those dice rolled true

602
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,480
 right so they could have rigged some kind of gambling scheme

603
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,480
 because they certainly always rolled you know six or something like you know

604
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,920
 right there's no way they built great evenly weight distributed clay dice

605
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,200
 probably you uh you guys want to get into my dice game here i got a i got a

606
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,760
 dice game going on over here i got a special homemade dice i just got to sell

607
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,560
 them hard on the whole you gotta sell them hard on the

608
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:03,120
 crucible thing and that these are you know era appropriate gambling

609
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:07,600
 that's right once once they pre-script me for a craftsman we could take them for

610
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,880
 all the money we have you remember how back in back in the

611
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,880
 day it was all dice in the alleys down those

612
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,200
 puritan streets that's why they were

613
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,000
 anyway ever get it over your head on something with enthusiasm

614
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,520
 for something that now you have some more experience and it was an obvious

615
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:33,520
 rookie mistake much love f-y-i-t-f-y-d-a-t-f-o-w-i-a-t-f

616
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,880
 that's scoopy ramone thank you scoopy ramone

617
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,720
 thank you and i appreciate this on a deep level

618
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,880
 uh i had this experience when i was in kindergarten

619
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,080
 and was in a school play and i was an elf

620
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:52,960
 sneaking onto the stage backing up and i was to bump into santa claus and be

621
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,280
 surprised and i insisted i insisted that i hold

622
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,680
 a toy and then drop it in surprise and shock

623
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,800
 i was like how about i tell you i was i was giving i gave myself business

624
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,080
 i was like how about i take a toy and i and i well

625
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:11,920
 when i bump into santa oh that's good that's good i dropped the toy

626
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,160
 and they were like fine whatever you know and i did i was obnoxious and i was

627
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,520
 you know 18 19 is my freshman year and only year

628
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,720

630
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,000
 yeah and i got cast as just polonius right it was just really

631
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 in that show like not you know in hamlet and vital character but still like a

632
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,120
 you know like a a tertiary role kind of thing and

633
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:43,120
 rosa gilbert are dead i really just came in to illustrate that what's happening

634
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:48,960
 throughout hamlet right and i did so much business

635
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:55,600
 and i tried to get so much laughs for being like a baddie old man like i

636
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:59,920
 was obnoxious looking back i'm like so ashamed

637
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,080
 like if i if i were me now in a play with me then i would be like

638
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:08,320
 can you chill the fuck out and play your part can you just

639
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:12,080
 accept that you didn't get cast as rosen krenzer gilbert's turn

640
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:17,440
 can you just move on uh you know it was uh it was it was it was

641
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,840
 obnoxious i i got to bust out

642
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,840
 during my mad donnelly has a question that's correct that's exactly

643
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:30,800
 that's exactly the level it was at during my college freshman year i got to

644
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,960
 play roland maul in present laughter and i that character is just

645
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,560
 annoying and crazy and so i just got to go

646
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:46,000
 ballistic as a young ham and it was fucking glorious and i killed it it was

647
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,680
 it was really really really fun but then also i was like well

648
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:55,120
 fuck i that i was in a main production with all the graduate

649
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:59,840
 students i think i'm done here oh boy i was like i don't know

650
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,960
 seriously i got like third from the top billing like what the fuck

651
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,720
 what else what else is going on it's six more years to do this again

652
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,720
 no thanks i'm fucking out of here i really that was really one of those

653
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,680
 things i took away from that experience was like oh okay

654
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,600
 i can go do other stuff now

655
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:26,080
 and he did i sure did indeed go do other stuff and still is doing

656
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,760
 other stuff and unless he's died between the recording

657
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,920
 of publishing of this episode you never know

658
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:38,480
 and i'm still doing uh the uh more enthusiasm than experience

659
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:45,440
 when i got to do the the warm-up gig for p&t yeah exactly

660
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,720
 that was ridiculously crazy but it worked out worked out real good

661
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:56,080
 but that i was just very lucky right place right time

662
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:00,400
 and boy oh boy was that guy previous to me just tanking it

663
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,240
 i mean yeah you initially had like a different job right or whatever

664
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,080
 were you there when he got fired or yeah i was there as pen stand in

665
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,440
 yeah i was doing i was doing right yeah you were doing standing work yeah i was

666
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,400
 doing standing work and then i kept doing standing work and the warm-up

667
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,440
 right for that season that was wild that was a lot of work yeah it's fun

668
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,960
 though i think every job i've ever taken was

669
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,360
 definitely taken with enthusiasm over experience

670
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:29,440
 yeah yeah i mean at least up until i was

671
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:36,160
 35 right uh including including when matt called me and said you want to do a

672
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,440
 podcast i mean i would say that would definitely

673
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,680
 be enthusiasm over experience for all three of us

674
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,440
 except for me paul that well yeah i mean well but not not really

675
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,800
 i don't i don't have any experience i i had experience talking into a

676
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,480
 microphone that's about it oh i don't i still don't know diddly

677
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,960
 squad about putting together a podcast properly

678
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,560
 not true i mean i know a little bit but not not a ton

679
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:04,400
 i don't get on the feeds i don't when other podcasters ask us for advice they

680
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,200
 are disappointed often exactly

681
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,920
 like i don't know record it and throw it in the ether

682
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,040
 yeah release the episodes on time i don't know yeah right

683
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:21,920
 yeah i can't i can't don't show up a half hour late

684
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,640
 i can't start off my ted talk with be friends with pen

685
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:31,600
 why not it'd be a hard one to do

686
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:36,240
 it's not easy to execute advice but it is that it is advice that can be executed

687
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,080
 can be can be done we got an email here from

688
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:44,800
 anonymous uh here's a what would you do story

689
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,080
 so we had a little what would you do action it starts when i visited

690
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:52,240
 a dance scene that i hadn't gone to in about 15 years

691
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,680
 i hit it off with a guy i used to know and like a scene from a film

692
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,640
 we danced together for most of the late night

693
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,640
 blues party it was romantic and incredibly hot

694
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,160
 when we left he carefully asked i might be reading this wrong

695
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,240
 but would you like to have coffee sometime uh to reassure him on several

696
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,600
 levels i answered yes that is the perfect thing to say

697
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,200
 that is much better than my suggestion which was to go to my hotel room

698
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:23,840
 and fuck whoa it's a good answer it's a solid answer

699
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:28,000
 when we met for a date i was glad to find uh we were both vaccinated atheists

700
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,360
 he's 15 years older than me though which put me on edge because of a bad

701
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,320
 experience i had with an older guy i started worrying we wouldn't be

702
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:39,200
 compatible and saw a red flag when he mentioned a right of center newspaper

703
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:43,040
 still he was kind and empathetic and the chemistry was hard to ignore

704
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,400
 at this point what would you do at this point

705
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,240
 i could continue on the day you keep on getting to know each other right

706
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,400
 do we know the gender of our writer we don't okay

707
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:59,360
 i feel like gay or straight if an older man came to meet you if you

708
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:03,280
 wanted to say let's let's cut through the bullshit and go fuck i feel like they

709
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,600
 would do it well i think the writer was was saying

710
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,480
 that to be funny more than more than like an actual

711
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,000
 suggestion right the other person the other person they had been dancing with

712
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,640
 said like hey you know we've been dancing we're having a good time tonight

713
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,800
 would you be interested in going to get a coffee

714
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,000
 and they're like i we i am interested in getting coffee

715
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,760
 i was gonna say we should go fuck but yes let's go get coffee right

716
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,080
 so then the question is how we feel about if they started mentioning right

717
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,600
 wing newspapers all right yeah like kind of just where

718
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,840
 we're at at this point with it i guess so there's a little bit of a little bit

719
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,640
 of uh stuff that they're worried about a little bit of stuff that writers

720
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:43,840
 worried about age that made the newspaper i guess um

721
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:48,400
 but still kind empathetic and had good chemistry

722
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:53,840
 so yeah uh we did our best to be respectful and with full consent

723
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:57,760
 uh that it might be a one time only thing we spent the night

724
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:04,480
 okay uh turned out he's good in bed oh and and we have a kink in common

725
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,840
 so i got very excited at the potential to explore this

726
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:11,360
 which would be a first for me okay shipping right that's what i'm guessing

727
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:19,120
 toesucking shrimp let's go

728
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:25,600
 over the next weeks we spoke on the phone a few times

729
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,800
 in an impressive backfire of complimenting me

730
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,040
 he said he only wants to date women at least 10 years younger

731
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:39,840
 because women his own age look old what i called him out on this casual

732
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:44,000
 sexism and he apologized guys where's the empathy

733
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,440
 here so next know that i'll be breaking up with you in nine years

734
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,280
 yeah right i said good day

735
00:53:53,280 --> 00:54:00,880
 don't get comfortable universal all women age the same

736
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:09,360
 all men don't don't worry about it uh wow no problem

737
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,160
 i called him out of this casual sexism and he apologized

738
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,520
 next it came out that he voted for a political party that i don't like

739
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,480
 but i don't want to be an i hate people who vote

740
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,880
 x person finally uh like he was quoting a sound bite

741
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,720
 he said it's hypocritical to believe in global warming

742
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:32,960
 and still fly yep he doesn't believe in global warming come on

743
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,640
 i got the feeling he didn't always think before speaking

744
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,240
 most people wouldn't call their promising sex partner a hypocrite

745
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:44,400
 with a cell by date uh oh with a cell by date right

746
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,520
 and this is all just making this sex hotter yeah

747
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:54,400
 you know like oh yes for sure that's the kink the kink

748
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,080
 it's just oh tell me more horrible opinions

749
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:02,480
 oh yeah shut up and keep fucking me you big dummy

750
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:10,240
 go having my first peri-menopausal mood swings i crashed hard

751
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,600
 and ended things spell dei with your tongue on my toes

752
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,760
 go

753
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:21,440
 hey that sounds like a good night

754
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:31,040
 uh having my first peri-menopausal mood swings i crashed hard and ended things

755
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,360
 damn it i get very uncomfortable with debates and didn't attack his beliefs

756
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:39,120
 i spoke my piece he listened and it and it didn't become an argument

757
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:43,120
 he apologized properly and was shaken by how much he had upset me

758
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,320
 it was the most respectful breakup call i ever had

759
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:50,880
 shortly after that time three people i knew got terminal diagnoses

760
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,040
 and depressing political stuff was happening at a low point i asked myself

761
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,240
 what would i do if i only had six months left

762
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:04,640
 my reaction was i would call that guy and tell him don't say anything about

763
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:08,960
 anything let's just have some fun

764
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:13,120
 this is really hard right it is this is really hard

765
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,560
 because it's hard to meet anyone that you're simpatico with

766
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:20,480
 in general yeah oh that kind of hard yes that's also hard

767
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,240
 and then to try and navigate especially currently

768
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:30,080
 just how polarizing opinions can be sure but what how important like we've made

769
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:34,720
 everything so important when i was uh

770
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:40,720
 single i remember being an atheist like factored faster than i thought it

771
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,640
 would like i was certainly willing to not give a

772
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:50,560
 shit about that person being christian uh and the early dating parts yeah and it

773
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,600
 just it kind of it would come to a head faster than i

774
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:57,040
 than i thought it would yeah time you know yeah well that's just a

775
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,400
 younger generation thing i mean they don't they don't view blowjobs

776
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,680
 as a thing that you need to wait on as much anymore

777
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:10,400
 but it's it's true in relationships if you you know if you find out that your

778
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,800
 partner is prone to magical thinking then

779
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,560
 it opens up other doors and if you find your partner is prone to saying

780
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:23,760
 off-color possibly bigoted shit there's probably other shit behind there

781
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:30,240
 too right like that's well also i mean maybe if you

782
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:34,240
 you know i think it's i think it's hard to examine like

783
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,840
 male loneliness uh white male loneliness has like its own

784
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:41,040
 thing but like the truth is like this is an example like

785
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:45,280
 wherever this guy is getting his echo chamber yeah there's no such as global

786
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,920
 warming right you're breaking up with him sends him

787
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:53,440
 back to that space right yeah but but yeah but i don't know

788
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,520
 yeah but it's not and it's not your job responsibility to save yeah it's not

789
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:02,320
 woman's responsibility to save all of stupid white male america

790
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:05,920
 like i mean you know i've been i've been uh i've been out of the game guys

791
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:09,280
 uh no but uh you know whatever we're all married

792
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,120
 but the thing we want we want i found a woman who would save me

793
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,720
 the thing that i do for my single friends is you know like write down

794
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,040
 everything you want in a man right so in this case if you

795
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:23,200
 wanted to say awesome in bed believes in science like

796
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:27,200
 you know like like what happens is like when you write that list down it is not

797
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,000
 crazy to look at that list that list is not like there's no one on earth who

798
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,840
 could fit this bill no not at all and like and i did i did

799
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:38,880
 that before i ended up uh dating and i made my specific list of

800
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:44,080
 things i wanted in a partner and it not only does it reinforce

801
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:47,360
 what's important to you but it narrows your field of vision

802
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:51,520
 and you don't just go wild off the handle looking at people who

803
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:55,440
 it just quickly nullifies possible bad choices

804
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,760
 right it sharpens your head man it's it's it's what i talk about in improv all

805
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:04,400
 the time too you know the the real key to improvisation is focus

806
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:10,880
 that's it where's your focus okay and so that that's it that's it it's

807
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,800
 really just focus like i can teach a lot of different stuff but focus is what it

808
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,200
 really a lot of what it really comes down to

809
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:21,120
 and with anything decide what's important

810
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:24,000
 decide what you're truly looking for get clear about

811
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,160
 goals and uh things that are important to you and

812
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:32,400
 the [ __ ] falls away yeah but it's hard to keep focus

813
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:37,520
 it's that and that's especially true now and that's why we see a lot of what's

814
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:44,240
 going on within our political spectrum it is designed to destroy focus

815
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:50,400
 sure yeah yeah for sure uh i don't want to i'm gonna go back to

816
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,680
 other point but what you're i don't want to yeah no no no please do yeah that

817
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,360
 point is valid but i think so many times like our ability

818
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:01,040
 to be flexible to be giving to want to

819
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,800
 put things on the line to like our willingness to possibly change to help

820
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:09,600
 to bend for other folks yes uh i think you can get lost in that ship

821
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:14,320
 yes and and then and then you combine that with the sunk cost

822
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:18,400
 fallacy uh yes good example my membership massage envy

823
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,360
 and you suddenly and you turn and you're like wait i've been i've been in this

824
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:24,240
 shitty relationship you're like i can't get three thousand dollars with the

825
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:27,840
 massages in a month i can't do it

826
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:32,640
 and and you you think you're gonna get out of relationship you're gonna be

827
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,520
 embarrassed you think your friends are gonna think oh my god you put so much

828
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:41,040
 time in your friends won't care at all uh uh you know uh it's it they don't care

829
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:45,040
 about you but they won't care that that that you put more time or less time in

830
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:49,040
 they don't you you anytime you take a step towards being

831
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,760
 healthier your friends are going to be grateful that you're in a better space

832
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,320
 no matter how long it took you to do it um that's worth saying on its own also

833
01:00:56,320 --> 01:01:01,760
 uh if they're your real friends right and not your frenemies and that's it

834
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:05,520
 and that goes another saying saying that goes from what we're talking about also

835
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,720
 you can be you should be also be more selfish about your friends

836
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,280
 you should be you know if you if you have a dysfunctional relationship with

837
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,960
 your friendship group or you feel like you're

838
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:17,840
 you know not truly like uh jive on a mute it's not truly mutual

839
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:21,920
 with your friends group you should get new friends you should try to find it uh

840
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,680
 any kind of hobby any kind of club any kind of meeting yeah you're right

841
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,120
 any kind of bar oh there he goes here we go

842
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:32,800
 you know what he can do better than us paul jacob can do better than us and

843
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:38,240
 i'm glad he's gone i i wait a minute i i looked around

844
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:41,840
 i turned out i couldn't do better that's a double edge right there

845
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:45,120
 he could do better than that's what i'm glad he's gone i actually know that i'm

846
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:49,120
 saying i know that i'm saying as a guy who

847
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,520
 lives in like you know an urban and suburban

848
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:55,440
 environment uh you know we have numerous scoops right us you know

849
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,560
 where they have basically stayed in their religion longer simply because

850
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:01,200
 they would know they'd be completely alone in their community

851
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,800
 sure right become atheists like i understand that this is an uphill battle

852
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:09,200
 and bigger things uh i'm only saying in your heart

853
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:14,640
 don't think that like compromise compromising all of your wants is the

854
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:18,640
 only way you know right right i think you made the

855
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:24,160
 right choice in uh put the kibosh on it because fool me once shame on me shame

856
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:28,480
 on you fool me twice shame on on me and oh wait what do you what kibosh

857
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:33,040
 is has happened here well she she broke it off

858
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:36,480
 and the writer you mean they broke it off what

859
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,320
 uh i haven't finished reading this email yet oh i thought i

860
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:44,800
 i thought they broke it oh shit oh no oh oh no we've just got we've gotten

861
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:49,280
 sidetracked my friends there's more email ah fuck me in the bottom

862
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,800
 what would i do if i only had six months left my reaction was

863
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:56,240
 i would call that guy and tell him don't say anything about anything

864
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:00,160
 let's just have some fun oh no that thought stopped me crying

865
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:03,360
 i asked myself seriously am i that shallow

866
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:07,840
 and my brain said yes oh wow you asked what i want

867
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:11,440
 and i told you if you can broker that deal i'm in

868
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:15,360
 after a cooling off period i arranged to call him we agreed that being friends

869
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:19,520
 was a disaster and i said i had heard of the concept of

870
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:23,120
 sex clubs where apparently you don't discuss politics

871
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:26,960
 how would he feel about meeting as if we were at a sex club

872
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:31,440
 he said i can be there in an hour and a half

873
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,200
 he added if i turn up and you decide no i'll drive home

874
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:38,240
 and i'll not sulk about it which was a helpful reassurance

875
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:41,680
 oh so this this guy definitely had uh had has

876
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:45,760
 some reassuring uh qualities to him sure this is smart

877
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:49,680
 this is yes we had a better night than the first

878
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:53,680
 at the time of writing we meet every couple of months always checking we're

879
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,080
 still okay with it and enjoying it while it lasts

880
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:59,600
 we've had some amazing times and he's said and done some very kind and

881
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:03,920
 thoughtful things the kink exploring is going very well

882
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,120
 can't believe it took me this long to buy some sex toys

883
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:10,720
 i found he's a fan of uh tim mentions poem

884
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:15,440
 uh storm and of pennanteller's bullshit so he has critical thinking awareness

885
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,960
 it's just well behind the times and certainly not helped by the media and

886
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,160
 politics that he follows maybe some of my attitudes will rub off

887
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,800
 on him maybe some other things will rub off on him too

888
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,920
 as i try to avoid generalizing or being negative

889
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,200
 and i really try to understand rather than judge so

890
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:35,760
 am i naive liberated morally challenged making the world a slightly happier

891
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,960

907
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:47,440
 slightly happier place both for you and your uh companion

908
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,280
 yeah the like look you said you have kinks and fetishes right like that's

909
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,720
 that's often a very difficult conversation to to broach on in a

910
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:58,000
 regular dating environment you found someone who fits the bill

911
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,840
 uh you want me to put this light bulb where and they agree to

912
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:05,920
 everything right you put out everything you wanted again you just did we just

913
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,840
 talked about without whether we got to it

914
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:11,920
 you were like if it could be this and not that and always this and never that

915
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:15,760
 and he said yes you both intelligently made an agreement

916
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,320
 will that get sloppy at some points or we end up in the conversation at some

917
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:21,440
 points sure sure but that happens in every relationship

918
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:26,480
 no matter what you're doing anyway so like what you did do was actually you

919
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,840
 literally came up with your most selfish list for this person to still be in your

920
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:32,320
 life and this person said they'd happily

921
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:38,560
 fit those parameters that's awesome you laid it out this person accepted

922
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:42,640
 and it seems like it's going okay because now you might meet another guy

923
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:46,480
 who's also dynamo in the boudoir and uh and and then decide i don't need

924
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,320
 to meet this uh this this right winger for for private

925
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:53,600
 sex anymore that might happen but you you've actually

926
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,320
 allowed yourself to leave that door properly open

927
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:59,280
 right right if you were dysfunctionally dating this person and you were going to

928
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,840
 meet someone and be like oh but i'm dating someone oh but it might get messy

929
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:06,160
 now you now you're fucked up right but you you have the exact sexual

930
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:09,840
 relationship you want with this person you want to use this person he

931
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:13,760
 says use me uh you're in that spot you've

932
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:17,920
 appropriately set expectations yes and now you if you would now encounter

933
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:19,840
 someone you could have a more fulfilling relationship with

934
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:23,040
 you'd be able to move on to that thing no problem

935
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:28,720
 right now i think this is a nice thing i think this is a nice thing anonymous

936
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:32,080
 very much so uh speaking of nice things it's gonna be nice how about i beat
