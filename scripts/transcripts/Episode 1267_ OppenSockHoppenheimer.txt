 Happy birthday, Paul. Thank you
 50 fun years old
 I feel it
 Social
 Barely sitting because of me issues. It's
 Fun yeah, wait you you have knee issues. I have a bum knee right now. Yeah, I think there's something going on
 It's my right knee is just acting a fool
 I don't know why
 It's just been last five days the left face. So we have a different disease entirely. Absolutely. Absolutely different. It's tough
 Be careful fellas. It's spreading completely different shit. I don't know. It's just you know
 I think it's possibly the change in the weather combined with the fact that I
 Worked my ass off for three days straight. I don't know
 Who knows whatever it's you know, what's fucked up but good it gets better the more I'm up and on it
 So I guess that's our weird. It's when I sit down that it starts to get really bad. Oh, it's like tightening up
 Yeah, I don't know. So I'm having to stretch a lot more and all that kind of thing, which eventually is good
 I do need to do more stretching and and all that kind of thing
 what's happening with your knee Matt I
 Just heard it
 Playing in a soccer game with adults versus kids soccer games. Oh, yeah smart play. Okay
 Oh, hold on one second guys. I gotta hit this button
 Because my knee hurts too
 And what I'm finding is that I am a restless sleeper
 I toss and turn so what happens is I
 start to feel better and then I wake up in my knee it hurts the next day because I because you've been jerking around my
 Leg around all when I like okay, so I worked yesterday early in the morning
 And I had a full day and stayed up past my normal bedtime
 Which I was I had three days in a row so I was getting to bed at like five o'clock
 so I wouldn't play I wasn't playing any games and sick as a dog so I was trying to take care of her a little bit and
 Not get sick myself and so far so good. Yeah, I got a little stuffy head today, but not too bad, but
 When I stay up late like I did last night past my normal bedtime my
 Legs start to get real
 antsy and they start to hurt they start to hurt and they get jittery and I have to like
 Shake my leg and twist my leg all evening. It's like go to bed. Go to bed. Go to bed. Okay, fine
 But yeah, I was up pretty late. I mean I wasn't up that late. I was like 930, but
 Well, I
 Forgot that I'm here. I'm a see I'm in the ocean. Yes. I'm actually actually off-shore some rando
 Thomas Island that princess owns
 Whoo, but
 I've seen it and
 I
 Forgot to pack a knee brace because I found it was helping my knees
 I was going to sleep with a knee brace which doesn't help me sleep better
 It just helps my knee feel better the next day. I sleep worse. I sleep more restlessly wearing a knee brace
 Okay, right
 Sounds grabbing my knee. Oh shit. I'm watching Alien Earth. So I assume some alien has gripped my knee. It's like my knee cap
 By the way, I I hate the modern
 TV show where like you you kind of like slow burn
 Middle episodes to like to like peak almost peak boredom and then they and then they really stick the landing on the final
 Two and a half episodes and you're like, yeah. All right
 You did pick it up and I it's like I'd rather watch the show that I just watched at the end the whole time
 Are they I hate it too. And what makes me crazy is in our day. We had 24 25
 Now they can't even get fucking eight. Yeah
 Well, yeah, I think we look back at the quality of those 24 episodes we're not gonna be like nail of them
 I think yeah, I think we'd be surprised. I'd be surprised
 Well, here's the thing here's the right not nailed them take up with take a pause recording
 Let's all go watch Hill Street Blues and let's come back
 Go watch in the heat of the night. I mean my my base thought is
 We're gonna sit down everybody and all watch a different world, let's do it
 I just think they're trying to get rid of even more episodes. We're trying to prove that they can't do where I want to agree with you
 It's just money. We just were spending movie money on television now and so you can't afford to make more than eight episodes, right?
 but
 Compelling drama that can resolve in an hour. That's where you're talking about. That's what you're talking about. Paul is
 These episodes are these these modern TV shows are secretly just super long movies. Yeah, which is gross, you know
 Yeah, they're like they have some they have some kind of arc. Yeah
 But they
 An episode of Star Trek their slow burn in the shit. Well, that's the thing like Trek is sort of
 Responsible for all this too because it was season three where they did
 You know best of both worlds. That was the first
 true
 Season-to-season cliffhanger that had ever been attempted in syndication
 Oh, I see it was it was the end of a season and then the season break. Yes
 Gotcha. So half of the season half of the cliffhanger was at the end of the season
 then you had to wait four months five months before the next one started up again and
 You know
 tantalizing but it
 Patrick Stewart became the other thing that the when he became locutus. Yes
 That is are the what's the Borg that's the Borg that became locutus of Borg
 Yeah
 And that is that was the model that they then went forward with from then on out with all the Trek series
 all the Trek series had
 season cliffhangers I
 still remember as a kid not knowing how like I didn't necessarily like we didn't get like TV guide to the house or anything, right and
 Different strokes. Yeah, they snuck on the set of Knight Rider. I remember that and they were hiding behind
 He was with that kid from Terminator not the main kid from Terminator the other redhead kid from Terminator
 Who I think was also on salute your shorts. Yeah. Yeah, the little punk that was him and and
 Arnold hid what happened they hid and they almost got killed
 They hid they hid in the set and the set was gonna be exploded, right? Yeah. Yeah, and everybody goes. Yes
 The audience goes and I was like all summer being like I have to remember to watch the first see if they die
 What happened?
 Young me was wondering whether
 Gonna get dead in the explosion like they start the series be like so sorry every character is dead
 They all do well. Well, it wasn't every character was just Arnold dead space
 The cast broke on to the set of a James Cameron movie and James Cameron murdered them
 Was gonna happen in terms of that like Arnold's death. Yeah
 I don't well the little kid died in a set explosion in the Simpsons in the first season
 Child was killed. There's that classic episode in the first season of Simpsons
 They're all classics, but that one where Homer finally goes to try sushi
 Any fucking loves it and then he decides he wants to go for the forbidden sushi the fugu
 Which is the blowfish which if not prepared properly can be poisonous and deadly
 And yes, so the whole premise was will Homer die
 Eating this poison sushi and the commercials that you didn't get TV guide
 I got TV guide and the TV guide commercial was a little blurb a little picture with Bart
 Coming up to going. Yeah, right. Like they're gonna kill the main character of a
 In the first season and you know
 So it really was you know, it was before Game of Thrones. They were do that back there
 They were always on their ear. They were always putting stuff
 Anything within I also saw?
 Damn, I just saw a tick tock to me. So say I'm not gonna talk about it. Anyway, uh, I
 Wanted to say before we go any further. I
 wanted to say thank you to Matt and Jacob because
 Guys, I don't know if you know but they always come through when it's my birthday and sure enough here
 We are recording on my birthday
 And they did it. They gave me permission to use my soundbox throughout this episode
 Birthday buddy, there we go. So that's what you have to look forward to
 Is zoom cutting off the fart box? Let's see if I want to go through the recording here, but we won't
 Zoom as a thing where it cuts out like weird weird weird noise stuff
 It's part of it's part of its noise cancel like things that you only hear the what a bunch of shit
 Correct that it is going into the episode
 Okay, that's great. So it'll be really funny
 That it will uh, you know
 It'll come up only in the episode
 So that'll be a whole surprise for later. Yeah, that's right
 So yeah, but a couple of people said it. I already had it pulled up to I'm sorry Paul
 Star Trek didn't do it first. Who did it first?
 Dallas who shot JR. Oh, I guess you're right. Yeah 10 years 10 years earlier Dallas was 1980 Star Trek
 Did it 1990?
 Yeah, yes, they did the the season break who shot JR
 I'm sorry Paul. Your precious Star Trek didn't do it first. Hey, look look I'm I am I
 Have no problem giving Brandon Braga less credit. Fuck that guy
 It's all good he can eat
 Brandon Braga's a piece of shit
 Man now my my computer's asking me if I'm playing music. No, I'm not playing music you dumb thing. I
 Mean I played a tiny little piece of music. Well now I can't really do it. It's not fun
 If I know I can hear it. It'll be fun later though. Anyway, oh, I got a message for so
 Well, not only did I injure my knee playing soccer
 But we decided this year man. We did a whole
 Is if Nick Newman
 Totally influenced my whole family about Thanksgiving. It's basically this is the unit because seated our kids hate
 Thanksgiving food. Oh
 Would you do it? That's right. Your kids do not care for Thanksgiving food. They never have they do not they do not and
 Sarah's you know, basically a vegan. Mm-hmm. And so I rest that there's only one person the household that was looking forward to Thanksgiving
 It was me and I was like, well, I'm not gonna I'm not gonna you know, be a fatty dictator
 Oh, you know that
 And so we blew it off I've never done it before in my life we blew off Thanksgiving
 I'm so proud of you. It feels so weird. I feel icky about no. No. No, what'd you have?
 Just normal. So here's what we did. We rallied a
 Kind of like friends friends with kids kickball game. Okay. Mm-hmm
 and
 We brought turkey and roast beef deli slices and croissants and right and some fixings
 Some hummus and penis pita. I said Pia penis penis, okay
 So we did we did our we did our new tradition of dipping our penis and in hummus
 Mine the pine nuts and
 We have like a basic like half-ass picnic that's not a new tradition, you know, what's weird Matt
 You know what what's strange about that tradition is I personally have never had anyone I've never paid anyone to penis on me before
 Nobody's buying that
 There ain't a carbon zone of bean on me
 The bill could never go bond so done Trump's been that's right
 But shit
 So then so we're playing kickball and both Sarah and I pop the hamstring playing kickball
 And she was like this is terrible this is the worst thing Sarah really Sarah really pop
 But she was going to run for a ball and you know, like like it's like you like music professional injuries
 But they're running and they just stop and you go
 Yeah, like Sarah's Sarah's running and also it was like nope
 I could have ran to the next base and I stopped like no God and then the very next play I
 Pop my hamstring running from second to third
 So, uh, I just it's my brain
 Subconsciously cannot let Sarah have any more attention that she already gets good
 We have to do it. Well, we had inadvertently a similar situation at my home because
 The day before Thanksgiving and got terribly sick like
 Knocked down drag out sick still had to go to work still worked and almost dying
 And so I was like, okay. I better make at least some kind of backup plan. So on the way home, I bought
 Warm up mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. So at least we'd have something that resembled a Thanksgiving. Okay, right and
 Got home and sure enough. She was just out of it. We were done. We didn't get to go down to the the in-laws
 But we absolutely had
 chicken nuggets mashed potatoes cottage cheese
 That was that was Thanksgiving dinner
 That was it
 Wait, where's the cottage cheese? Is it countries of its own dishes to go on top?
 I put mash I put cottage cheese on the mashed potatoes. I can't I love that. That's my favorite
 This has come up before and I I still don't understand I talked about it all time. It's one of those things
 I just have to I love it. Just did a triple take up on his view
 I love mashed potatoes
 I always have it's so good. Are you pregnant? Are you expecting? I mean
 by the looks of me you'd think when when's that fucking thing coming, but
 No, I
 See Nick see Nick Newman top baked potatoes with cottage cheese, I think it's a southern thing. I think there's some kind of weird
 You and Nick will not represent the entire
 Okay, but I'm saying Kentucky fine
 I'll say Kentucky because I my mom my mom used to make lasagna using cottage cheese instead of ricotta
 So I that's I prefer cottage cheese and lasagna to ricotta
 Any day of the week? Yeah
 But I just really love a little cottage cheese on my mashed potatoes according to the Google
 It's not a it's not a southern thing or it doesn't have a particular area of origin
 it is touted though as a a nice higher protein version and a little healthier version of mashed potatoes if you're not doing like all the
 Yeah, if you're not doing like the loading mash up in their sour creams and bacons and all that
 No, I just do a little just a little cottage cheese. Just a dab of potatoes and some cottage cheese in there a little salt and pepper
 Yeah, sure. Yes little salt pepper. I'm sure every doctor be proud proud of you switching the cutters
 Oh, I mean, it's the healthy lifestyle choice of a generation as you can tell
 It's done wonders for me
 It's really move the needle. I
 Mean it got you to this birthday. It did. I mean, hey, I made it to 51 better than a lot of people do I
 Bet it's better than half the population does so there you go
 Rfk approved don't be saying that lemur creamer lemur creamer in in in chat
 What's this if I'm going to get all those horrible dyes of the cottage cheese?
 With the mashed potato
 Paul you are okay, we can't hear you, but I know it'll be on the broadcast
 Right horrible fuck poetry, man, he's so nasty he's so nasty. Oh
 I would pay
 $14.99 for a book of rfk's poetry. Oh god
 Don't say that he'll publish it. He'll do it. He'll he don't give a fuck
 He does a little like
 Yes in a kickball. We all ate sandwiches and hummus and
 Then went home and I had we had leftover pizzas from the day before because we had all a bunch of kids over if we
 all saw wicked okay, and
 So it was it was leftover pizza was the other Thanksgiving course that we had and then
 There's off the Mac Kings for dessert. That's pretty great
 That sounds like a nice day
 It was super fun it was it was it was really nice not to take Thanksgiving that seriously yeah, and it was like gosh
 Really good idea to not stress out of all Thanksgiving
 I performed it in the max Thanksgiving variety show nice good
 He asked Brad Sherwood and I since Paul couldn't make it Paul was invited
 to do a some kind of improv song bit how fun and
 Then I called Spadoni and Spadoni was available so we had Spadoni there beautiful and
 then after arranging all that I got a text from Brad saying you got a minute and I was like
 Oh, no, he's gonna fail. Uh-huh, and then I I call him and it is not him bailing. He's like hey, it's not a wild idea
 It's like what if all right? What if what if we do?
 do it all in Shakespeare and
 You do magic tricks, but I play like your hype man like your producer
 And I'm just blown away by all the magic you do and I just narrate everyone's thoughts
 I
 Like this and I said
 The one thing that Mac King's show has is bad, yeah
 Arguably lousy with it and
 You know we were specifically asked to do music yeah, it goes alright, why don't we do it as a musical?
 Yes, and motherfucker
 Mm-hmm. So we did
 We did what we called the the Shakespeare repertory presents much to do about magic the musical great
 Funny that's cool
 It was so well that some people thought it was written which is always the best
 exactly and
 Brad and I want to do it again
 Find a way to like we were not satisfied with just the 10-minute hunk that we want to do it again
 This is the trick right like we're finding these new ways to expand on improv like
 Colin Mockery is doing the hypnoprov
 Yes, Brad works with Colin a lot
 So yeah, I imagine he's seeing the bold new adventures that can be like what else can we use improv to mine?
 Well, yes, so Brad and Colin perform
 I've been formed together for 15 something years or more than that. Maybe okay
 So so anytime you see hip improv performing. That's Colin not performing with with Brad. Ah
 It's just I think that's the the most delicate way I can say it got it. Yeah
 So, yes, Colin has discovered that trying to sell the hip improv thing they tried it in Vegas it was too soon
 It was a mistake and there's also bad timing. Yeah
 and and and did not
 Did not get a lot of positive show reports from that. Hey man of experience. Where did they do that?
 Muppet improv didn't hardly fucking work in Vegas. No, it's it's fucking tough
 Muppets didn't work in Vegas for a different set of reasons. Oh fine, but it's still it's still
 Improv with awesome shit not working. So yeah, there's the crazy cocaine habit of all those puppets that really did it in. That's it
 They really do good lord those felt-lined straw. They are just
 hoovering it hoovering it
 They are bald they are
 I'll tell you who else is sucking up a lot of cocaine into their felt-lined noses and that is the following sponsor
 Which I have in my hand right here. Oh
 This is Paul's emergency toilet paper socks Paul's emergency toilet paper socks
 Monte Cristo
 This year that was this year
 We've all had the horrible embarrassment of
 Having to shit in a place without a bathroom
 Oh
 When it happens not if but when
 Will you be ready for the challenge of?
 the necessary ass wipery
 Because that's the real challenge of going to the bathroom without a bathroom the cleanup
 Introducing Paul's emergency ass wipe socks
 Paul's emergency ass wipe socks are equipped with a double layer
 one for absorbency and
 one
 to be discarded and
 then used again for absorbency I
 Was to number one there are two number ones
 Yeah, but one of them is for number two when you have the Paul's emergency shit socks on you technically are wearing four socks
 The first outer layer is the more absorbent layer
 And that is the one to be used upon first blush if you will
 getting the most
 liquid out
 of the system
 The second is less absorbent but no less important
 But we advise you go ahead and employ both socks
 use the second socks first layer of
 Absorbency to make sure that the rectal area is clear of all juices
 then
 With the third sock which is the first sock second layer
 Go ahead and do what we call the check it tab
 Tab it up there take it back out and check it. Where are we standing folks? Did we get everything if?
 we didn't
 invert the third sock which is the second sock of the first sock
 After the check
 You go ahead and you use the fourth sock, which is the second sock of the second sock
 that one of course is
 rounded up and
 tucked as a muffler
 to prevent any further seepage and
 Hey scoops to check out
 It just makes too much sense
 Jacob take me we got to figure out the zoom thing because everyone's turned off their cameras and so we can't see if anyone's laughing
 I
 Saw a few or maybe everyone turned off the camera just a vomit. I saw
 I saw a few laughs
 Just in time for Christmas
 Merry Christmas shit, so you cannot hang them by your but you can hang them by the fireplace, you know
 Well, I mean you had a drive out somehow. Yeah
 Have you been yes, if you guys been watching the show physical Asia on Netflix is that the one with the really strange
 Japanese Olivia Newton John impersonator
 Yes, yes, okay, that's that's the show that I'm alluding to right now
 Japanese Olivia Newton John impersonator physical Asia. Yeah, that was very odd, but I mean, you know
 Oh
 That's so much better than the Japanese person singing physical that I thought you were about to do I didn't do that
 So it's a it's a crazy reality competition show
 Where they do these insane like physical tasks and everything it's different Asian countries
 Participating competing against each other. Also for some reason Australia
 So it's like all these Asian yeah cuz Olivia and John and Australia because of Olivia Newton John, of course
 So I'm watching it last night
 And they they do it's all overdubbed all of the language is overdubbed
 Which is kind of neat just as a side note all of the teams competing against each other
 In the overdubbing watching watching the show. It just sounds like they're all speaking English to each other, which of course they are not
 They're all speaking their native languages to each other
 Which means nobody else can understand them in the competition so they can just
 Work together and talk to each other in their native language and the other team can't understand their planning and it's it's really kind of a neat
 Twist but the thing I want to talk about was the overdubbing
 Because they do all of these crazy physical things where they're like grunting and yelling and everything while they're while they're doing it
 And they overdub all the grunting and yelling
 Consistent it's so goddamn funny that makes no sense. Oh
 Really strange it is the best thing to watch once you realize that that's what they're doing and like oh right
 That's not the that that's the same overdubbed voice that is now yelling which is not what that person actually sounds like
 Yeah
 It's so good. It's so good. What are some of the physical challenges they have to do they do shit like I mean
 It's it's really insane stuff
 the the first one they do is like a king of the mountain type thing where they have these these each team is six members and
 They're all like MMA fighters and
 wrestlers
 Track stars, it's it's quite a few former Olympians
 All this stuff. I mean it sounds like Battle of the Network stars
 Kind of but in like a hardcore way. I mean it's it's hey battle network stars was hardcore
 I'm telling you Paul
 Meatloaf could not have gotten through the first leg of the first competition on this show
 He would have died into the board. I
 Was worried we're gonna present a vigorous defense for Battle of the Network stars. I will I will
 It's Paul's birthday, man, of course, we're gonna present a vigorous defense of Battle of the Network stars
 You know, I also saw Jacob. I don't know if you're aware of this new show that they're doing
 they've gone in and they're doing this whole retelling of
 The guys who came up with the atom bomb
 But it's set back in the in the 50s
 So it's like it's like a future backwards. So it's like it's okay
 It's the the the scientists that made the atom bomb, but they're all
 High-schoolers in the 50s, right? Okay, so it's up up and hop up and stop up and sock
 Oppenheimer is what it's called
 Oppen sock Oppenheimer and can't say the title of the show of the first three tries
 Oppen sock Oppenheimer, I said it there. I'll stop sock Oppenheimer and it's also starring
 Olivia neutron John
 That's how it works, yeah
 The show was a bomb I'm assuming it's that's Pluto TV and it's Pluto TV. It's a Pluto original
 Good call man. Good call Pluto original
 Oppenheimer I said it again
 Say Oppensock Oppenheimer five times fast. Good luck. No, I'm not trying to watch Pluto TV
 No, they do these insane challenges like they they do stuff that if the three of us tried to do a
 Single one of these games we would die. Oh, I can't play kickball
 Oh the first thing I heard about on Thursday night was how injured you and Sarah were
 and
 Sarah and Sarah's like, oh Matt and I are so hurt and keeps watching these
 These tic-tacs with these physical challenges. Have you seen some of these where the couples do these extreme physical moves?
 With each other they do like these very gymnastic. They'll see a gymnastic move and then they like okay
 We can we can do that, you know, and they're in there like little home gym and they're trying to do it
 and sometimes they fuck it up some of them well
 Over Thanksgiving. She found this one where these guys are doing a new tradition right after the Thanksgiving meal the men
 grab the their wives and hoist them on their shoulders and run a race and
 And it's laughs of strength. Yeah, and was laughing her ass off
 And I was like I could do it. Let's do it. And she's like, no, no, you couldn't
 Pick you up. Let's go
 Pick her up and she wouldn't she wouldn't work with me at all, which is probably trying to convince and let him pick her up
 Is the video that we all need to see wouldn't do it. She would not do it. She's like, no, no
 No, I can't do it by myself. You got to give me a little jump so I can you know get it going here
 But she would not she would not commit to the bit
 But to be fair, she was also coughing up a fit because she was still very very sick
 But I don't get picked up like that. That's right
 She doesn't get picked up like that and she didn't get picked up like that because I did do it
 but she was she was ridiculous, I could have done it but
 Yeah, I see all these things Jacob. Did you ever see the the Japanese one with the wall and the shapes?
 The wall and the shape yeah
 Did I see a television show made in Japan that had a wall and some shapes?
 Yeah, is your question? Yeah. So what happens is
 You're standing you're standing. I saw Shogun Paul. You're standing in this you're standing in this
 Hallway. No, wait. Oh before you go on I'm trying to think of a show that doesn't have a wall
 What happens is the outdoor set shows like the Bear Grylls site things where he's surviving in the wilderness
 I guess I don't have walls. There's plenty of shapes though. They have shapes but no walls
 this the wall has a shape cut out of it of a
 silhouette
 Uh-huh, right a per a person's physical silhouette. Okay in some sort of stance. Oh
 And the wall I have seen this wall moves towards you. Yep
 And you must assume the stance to Wile E. Coyote style
 Fit through the silhouette as it you have to pass through the wall or yes backs you
 Yes, you have it's called hole in the wall. There you go buddies on it
 It's called hole in the wall. And so I thought it's called any portentous storm
 any portentous storm
 It depends on what region you're watching it in some of them is called any portentous storm. So I'm gonna call it hole in a wall
 I've watched every episode of any portentous storm
 So that's what happens and the wall keeps going up and then either you get through it or you get smushed
 They're gonna do a two-person version of that Paul. Have you seen that? No, what is called death in the doorway?
 Oh, it's a gentleman's game
 Any portentous storm also has a lot of smushing as well a lot of smushing a lot of smushing
 There was the cocaine addicted muppets was they had a solo show with miss piggy
 Called any snort in a perm and she was just out there hoovering hoovering cocaine
 So much money
 Piggy Oh
 Kermie Kermie, I got some of this fresh Colombian white. It's not even been stepped on. This is the real skag. Oh

 Kermit always does on a straight and biggie's tail dart frog a dart frog. I dart the hell away from this crazy bitch
 Colombian sober is really funny. I like Colombian sober a lot. I'm truly stealing
 Even all out on Thanksgiving. Oh, we did we did we tore it up from the floor on up. We had
 I don't know 15 20 people over at the house had a big old turkey on the smoker had we had we had house
 Guests in town that week. So they were they were around
 We had a ton of people it was great though several people even commented on it
 We had no stress the whole cooking of the of the meal and everything
 We were just walking around having a nice time. That's how you do it baby. No stress at all. Yeah, great. Everything just worked out
 We had a nice big spread set up outside in the in the yard
 Yeah, just so so so nice
 That's beautiful. This is the only adjustment. I should have made just I should have come by your house after kickball
 It's the only adjustment I should have made. Yep
 You're gonna you're gonna limped over to the house after kickball and had some turkey
 Nice pack from you. Yep. Yep. I would help you out with an ice pack
 The best thing happened that I doubt I'll ever be able to repeat
 That is what we had the big spread set up. We had all the people a
 Couple hours later. I had to go to work. I'd do shows that night
 That's where I saw the the injured Sarah that night and we talked about the kickball game of doom and uh, I
 Got home a couple hours later
 There was still about five people at the house and the first thing that SJ said to me when we when I got home was
 Hey, there's no leftovers. Everybody ate all of it. Wow. Oh
 Oh Mike we did it. We did it. We got the exact right amount of food
 It got grazed on after the after the meal was over and it's just all gone. That's great. This is magical. I
 thought like I I you know grew up with with four brothers and a sister and
 We you know, I I am I am the shortest of my not by a lot, but I'm the shortest of my brothers. Uh-huh
 so
 never
 Never had leftovers. Yeah
 Never no, no meal. No meal leftovers. Yeah, that checks out
 Yeah, my mother-in-law does this thing where she insists on trying to make like a turkey soup with the turkey carcass of the
 turkey thing
 And like it's just a whole it's a thing that takes up the whole next day, right?
 All that all that started was to make sure that Sarah and I stopped cooking turkey. That's all that happened
 Is that we just don't we do?
 like
 We don't want to spend the whole other day making soup and we don't want to spend the next four days eating that soup
 Yeah, it's just not just not the world we live in
 But
 Yeah, but look I saw on Instagram. It looks like you had a fine spread at your house there Jacob
 Oh, yeah. No, it was it was so nice. Yeah. Yeah, we had a we had a ton of people over and everything
 It was great. I love Thanksgiving. I don't know what y'all are talking about. I love doing the the whole meal
 I love doing all of it. It's it's great time. I
 Did too I think I really I
 Promise I'm making a very good turkey. Yeah, I just was simply alone in my house
 As as Nipman famously said all Thanksgiving food tastes like napkins and that's what my kids think too. So there you go
 And it was it really was this show that changed my perception
 So first I was like I have to as their dad
 Keep making it until they like it
 It works and there's only on this show. I found out so many listeners hate Thanksgiving food. Also as adults. Oh
 You should show your boys do you ever watch a Garen the guy out of Ireland, he's very funny. He's a
 Thanks for watching. I'm delicious
 You ever seen him? He's really funny
 He's he's really really funny. You should look up some of Garen stuff, but he did
 from Ireland
 Just a couple days ago. He cooked his own version of a traditional American Thanksgiving dinner and
 I was very surprised by what he liked and what he didn't like
 So he was okay with the turkey. Okay
 He hated Kraft macaroni and cheese box dinner
 The box fine at which I mean, I guess yeah, that's not really Thanksgiving food in anyway. Well mac and cheese
 Yes, it does mac and cheese is a Thanksgiving food. That's what people I suppose so sure people get
 You're bringing a very fiery debate. Yeah, there are people that that insist Mac Jesus not a Thanksgiving food people system of this
 I don't have it as a Thanksgiving food, but I'm not upset if I see it show up. I love it. I love it
 Mashed potatoes. He made his own mashed potatoes. He has a special recipe for the mashed potatoes
 Great, so he wasn't expecting the mashed potatoes be anything but delicious. They were he made kind of a cheese
 Does he put in his mashed potatoes? What kind of cheese? What kind of white cheese does he put in there?
 Oh, no, he does not do the no. No, he doesn't do the cottage cheese
 It's just curds and weights barely even cheese. It's like halfway done
 So then he had the green bean casserole
 Which he was very suspicious of but he liked
 Yeah, I like a green casserole and then he made pumpkin pie which they don't do pumpkin pie in Ireland at all apparently
 No, they do potato pie. Yeah, but I mean they don't mash potatoes. They're new pumpkin pie at all and
 He was really super suspicious about it all but he made it and he really liked it
 He was suspicious of the pie. He was suspicious of the pie
 He said he was took him some time to get over the he's he was like what's got this vegetable II?
 Mush to it. I'm not used to like a dessert and he says and then I went on I watched all your fucking videos of all
 Your fucking celebrations and I saw how all you got all you only got these these yam potatoes all these sweet potatoes with fucking
 Marshmallows on top so many fucking marshmallows get fucked. I don't want marshmallows anywhere near my dinner. That's bullshit
 I do agree with that. I don't want the marshmallows. I agree with that too. He says I know a lot of you say it's great
 I don't know more power to you. Keep those fucking things away from me. It's secretly deserting early
 That's what I don't like about it. Yeah, it's like what's it because was I have marshmallows and sugar and brown sugar and cinnamon on something
 I'm like, well now I don't want to eat savory things anymore. You've you shift my gear to dessert, right? It's unfair
 Yeah, it's like it's like a hip. It's hip broth like we do we do the the sweet potatoes
 We do the sweet potato casserole and it's got brown sugar and pecans and everything. It's not healthy
 It's not it's not a it's definitely still a dessert masquerading as as a dish
 But it doesn't do the full-on swing over with the marshmallows
 Sweet potato the masquerade
 Galactic president scooper star mix groups a lot stuffing on a waffle iron. That sounds amazing
 Stuffing on a waffle iron is legit. I saw that earlier. I've seen that before
 It's a that's a fucking idea. Do you put a little gravy on it and then kind of sear it all in is that how it goes?
 I think you gravy afterward though. You have like a little I suppose
 I suppose you're right. Yeah. Yeah, you just make it
 I think you want the hot gravy. Yeah nice hot gravy then pour it on after you waffle iron it
 Oh, man, because when you get something that has crispiness and moisture, that's the key. Yeah, right
 So that's that's that seems really good. It's fucking good
 But Paul was the hot crispify some gravy, which is also ambitious. I mean as long as it has a skin
 Me that me that skin give me that gravy skin gravy skin is not not no, it's no good
 How do you know? No, I'm just I'm just upset because
 Well, I'm not upset upset is the wrong word
 disappointed lightly
 That I can't just go get the food that I want on my birthday without driving an hour and a half out of my way
 Yeah, like it's literally an hour and a half drive for me to get even fucking Panda Express
 It's like fuck Nick newman the chances this conversation for me must be what is like when the topic is football for other scoops
 There you go horse racing, yeah
 Yeah express you're absolutely right rich
 Yes, it takes way too fucking lot. So like and that's the thing. It's by the time I get back home
 I'm like, oh, well, I drove an hour and a half for Panda Express
 Might as well just give fucking McDonald's. It's just it's turned into
 Shit at that point. I mean, that's the same thing, right?
 Kind of Panda Express and McDonald's. I didn't even say it's all owned by the same company, right? Well, we're thinking of
 Maybe going to Costco on Wednesday
 Get that good old hot dog. That'll be fine. So what did you guys what you guys think of wicked - didn't see it
 What? No, I didn't see you didn't rush up to see the sequel. I did not I've only seen it seven or eight times
 So I I don't really have a fully fleshed out opinion on it yet
 I know it's really cool when they breakdance to save the car wash. That's really amazing
 Have you seen that is that what you're talking about?
 No, there's
 There's a bit of the plot of breaking -
 Okay. Well, I'm gonna blow your fucking mind to show you shit
 You're not gonna show me anything
 Program I'm gonna tell you about it as it's happening
 First is it take a long time to pull it up though. I don't know if I have the plot right from breaking - I'm not looking
 It up. I'm just we're just moving on. No, all it is is it's the old Donnie and Marie
 Or the Osmonds that's what it are. No, no, it wasn't the Osmonds. It was a fucking what he called. It's a Brady Bunch
 the break you remember the Brady Bunch hadn't had a
 Their variety show. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah where one of the kids I forget which which kid one of the kids got replaced on
 It because they couldn't get the whole original cast back together
 That is correct. I think it was one of the young kids. It was just like a new kid. Oh Jan. Thank you
 You're like the president. Yep, they had to replace the Jan
 Well what you just and Jan sickly stick-ups issues cutting ropes to see
 I just would fall from the top of the theater and there's a cliffhanger. That's right cliffhanger ever right
 You just joked about Matt happened and it happened with none other than rip Taylor as the
 Lion and the rest fucking Brady's dressed up like the people from Oz
 Doing the theme from car wash. They're doing car wash at the car wash
 Yeah, and then fucking Greg Brady dressed up like the scarecrow and rip Taylor is the lion to be in his flamboyant as he can be
 Just out of hand and I thought this would be really funny for somebody to slip into a copy or one of the edits of
 Oz - or we could do wouldn't be really funny if this showed up all uh, you know
 Somebody's just like watching that on TV in the background or something. No, no, you know, what's the
 Fight Club like in Fight Club. Remember how he would always slip in little snippets of pornographic stuff
 In all the movies if you can put this in and just make everybody upset
 That is true
 That is quite a fever dream as none of the elements make sense at all. No, it's fucking bizarre and
 And rip Taylor of all a rip. Yeah rip Taylor of all people. He's like, hey, it's
 You you'll never get rich, but it beats digging a ditch. Ah
 I think I said you guys the funny the meme I saw which is that don't worry Glinda and Alphabot will be back in the Avengers
 That's awesome, I just keep this doll thing that there's a doll channel on tik-tok and
 The guy he's mad at there's a lot of now Madam Mova or whatever name is you know
 There's dolls of all these figures, right? There's dolls. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah sure. So he's got all the dolls stacked up and
 then Madam Mova
 Comes in and it's playing that that song from the drag race stuff
 Here comes the hurricane bitch Katrina Katrina Katrina Katrina Katrina Katrina Katrina
 Katrina Katrina Katrina Katrina and she's knocking it to all the dolls and the bounce comes down and crushes
 It's fucking funny Katrina Katrina Katrina here comes the hurricane bitch. I'm just yelling Katrina. It's funny
 It makes me laugh. So what what did you really like it? Did you not like it? Oh
 That was funny. That was good. Would you be able to watch it all in one sitting?
 Yes
 That's that's that's my only takeaways. They added three songs to it and those three songs aren't on par with the actual Oh
 Core soundtrack. Yeah to basically strength to basically make the second
 Movie fill out. Yeah. Yeah
 Is it they're not terrible. There's not there's nothing - is it closer to the book or the?
 Musical do you know I?
 Wouldn't know is my wife would know either my wife loved the book and we went to see the musical and
 She was so upset because the ending is so really yeah
 The ending is so different and just all had to carry her out of there like it was a Thanksgiving Day prank
 I threw on my back and she laughed the whole way home
 It was crazy
 It undercuts the meaning of the whole
 Story, the ending Cooper Nova girl in the chat says that it's the musical on screen nothing added from the book. Well, that's unfortunate
 For Anne. Yeah, that means go good. It's so poorly but
 No, the the ending of the musical is bupkis deus ex machina bullshit
 That's everything now though. I guess you're right. There's so much
 movies for happy endings, dude
 Worried about that. There's so much of the any TV show. I watch any movie
 I'll watch like half of them now at least have the have the
 God from the machine. Yes a sex Machina
 Just some kind of supernatural thing or somebody comes in or something
 But something off-screen happens and the plot resolves itself. Do we know do do our do our audience members?
 I think most of our audience members know deus ex machina
 But you know where that really comes from from back in the day in early theater. There was actually a hand
 Yeah, the Greeks had an actual hand of God that would come down from the top of the
 The thing and touch characters or zap characters and that was a way to resolve plots by actual divine intervention
 Yeah, they would they would just say like, you know Medea is doing all of these things
 Off off stage right now, right and then the gods interfere intervened and and now it is this and now here comes
 Everybody to bow. Yep
 Yeah, there you go. Yeah
 I was told that people kind of get off scripts and and kind of go haywire with stories and stuff and and so like that
 Was a way to like just clean everything up. Yeah. Yeah, and somebody did ten minutes of Shakespeare and magic
 I can tell you we can go haywire fast. I'll bet no haywire. I'll bet it got loosey loosey
 You know you ought to do that again
 Nope, we're gonna and Paul Paul might have to take a flight. We might do the thing. I would fuck
 I would fuck. I want us. I want to I want to see Brad schedule, but I want to submit it for
 French. Oh, yes
 That'd be really fun. Yeah
 So I you know for people to see the movie I don't want to you know, it's a good movie
 I don't want to pass the whole thing. Yeah, there's one part that really stuck out to me that I was really really like like
 Really laughing because it almost took me out of it. So this whole thing's like basic family-friendly PG ish PG 13 ish. Uh-huh
 story
 but there's a part where
 The prince has got to get it on with somebody they they they they they run off and they're they they're finally by themselves
 And they're gonna there's a hookup that's gonna happen. Oh, yeah
 And it is the weirdest shot
 Thing ever it's like this weird like it's like it looked like an old Chris Isaac music video
 Like everyone's just drifting from one room to another
 stuff and like
 What am I watching? It took me out of it completely. I literally was like almost laughing. I was like, what is the scene?
 The title of the song is
 That's what it must have been
 Video listeners do yourself a favor and Google them
 the Wicked Games video
 So take the characters from one room to another like taking off clothing, but then also putting on clothes
 Like that's great bizarre
 Someone said big ups to modern love where someone puts on a sensible shawl to have sex
 Old jet alpha
 the
 Matt I don't want to frighten you but if you back up just a little bit
 Back back your head up just a little bit. There you go. Perfect. Stay right there
 everybody in the chat
 Don't move
 Is it me or is the shadow of the Baba Duke behind him?
 Am I crazy is that the shadow of the fucking Baba Duke over there? Yeah. Yeah, it's the Baba Duke
 Why are you worried about a shadow of a big cartoon Great Dane behind you know, they talk about this
 He's gonna get you they talk about they talk about, you know within
 Spooky stuff ghosty stories that they talk about the hat man and all that kind of thing
 Baba do definitely qualifies as a hat man. Yeah, that's pretty scary. It's kind of creepy. Yeah
 All right, well
 Have a good night sleeping tonight with the Baba Duke
 In there. Yeah. No, Baba. Duke is now a gay icon. So I think you're safe
 It truly is Baba Duke has now been taken over by the gays which I think is awesome. Oh good. Yeah
 The gays do good work. They fucking do they rehab the Baba Duke of all of all critters. Well, I got him go. Yeah

 We had ourselves a bit of a slow-burning medical themed air show over the course of the next day
 First oh, no
 The planes collide at 2 30 in the morning when my stepson son wakes up to tell me that he's not feeling well
 Only to then yell i've just thrown up. Oh, no
 There I am cleaning up vomit in the middle of the night
 Casey and d were able to fall back to sleep, but i'm awake until about five in the morning
 Second the burning jet fuel lands on me at six in the morning when I am woken up by a text message
 My sister texts to tell me that she's on her way to the doctors
 Due to some distressing medical symptoms and will keep me posted as to how she's feeling. Oh, no
 Lastly for the grand finale of the flaming wreckage hitting the crowd
 I get a call from my father at eight that evening saying that my stepmother is in the emergency room
 Jesus fuck
 Long story short she ended up face planting onto cement and looked like she'd been hitting the eye with a baseball bat
 God damn my god
 This italian air show ultimately becomes an ontario business meeting though as both my stepson sister and stepmother are fine
 No long-term damage and everyone is healed up fine. The new running joke is if you party with us, you better have
 You have a better than zero chance of ending up in the hospital. Absolutely

 Uh thoughtfulness and craftsmanship. Okay, please enjoy
 The categories are 80s comedy again 80s horror again 80s action again
 And 80s sci-fi again. I can't get enough of all this
 All right, let's try i'll open it up with 80s sci-fi for 200
 Commonly known as the film where john landis killed vic morrow
 This anthology mostly just reimagines tales from the classic 1959 tv show
 It shares a name with for real though. Fuck john landis. I'm sure his son is a really cool guy though
 People don't like john landis. What's wrong with john landis?
 Because of this because he killed him. Oh, oh, yeah fine. Uh twilight zone
 Yeah, there you go
 Uh matt you're up
 Um, i'll do um 80s action 200
 About that action even with a stiff neck. Mr. Mom is surprisingly badass when he kicks jack
 Torrance's ass in this thrilling 1989 film that spawned three sequels each better than the last
 This is batman, yeah the batman
 It is of course the batman jack torrance is just in a different movie
 Oh, but he's so good. He's so good
 Amazingly all over he's great. I remember as a kid seeing him in that movie and I was like this man is delightful
 I don't know what is happening here, but i like jack nicholson. I'm going against jack nicholson
 He's gonna be the joker. I'm sure they should have cast me as the joker. That's what i'm gonna do
 Every scene that of this movie that i'm in i'm going to audition for the joker paul
 Uh 80s horror for 800, please
 Oh in this 1984 king adaptation sarah connor and her husband are the targets of a rural cult of children
 Run by cousin it and hans clopec looking to sacrifice them to their god

 Children of the corn. Yes children of the corn
 Children of the in the fields they're born in the fields. They're born have some corn on the morn
 I'll do 80s action for 400 daily double
 On the corn your cows will graze while the natives call it maize children of oh
 I get it this daily double there is a parentheses
 then a zero
 then another point to see
 And then another zero and then a closed parentheses then another zero then a closed parentheses or then another zero and then a closed parentheses
 And that is from I believe that is referencing the film total recall with arnold schwarzenegger total recall
 Yep. Wow. Uh, yeah, I know it came out in 1990, but it's an 80s film my heart and this is a half-assed scooperty
 That's cool. Yeah, great. What's that? Uh, is that something he sees when he gets a message?
 No, it's three. It's the three titties. Oh the three boobies. Oh, it's the alien with three boobies. That's right
 How could I forget?
 Yeah, one was paper mache. Oh, that's how I forgot
 That's the hottest one. Yeah

 No, the the sound that would the audience would make when this tag team would come out
 It's a little remember a legendary effect
 Huh, I I don't remember your your your hand's not up, but we saw pass, uh
 Oh, it passes to paul. I think thunderdome's the third mad max movie road warrior
 road warrior
 It is the road warrior. Yeah, so when the road warriors would come out
 It's still legendary hawk an animal then the noise that the crowd would make was like deafening and that is still slang
 Like if you if you come out to big cheers everything like you got that road warrior pop
 Yeah, matt, yeah road warrior
 Of course later they became the legion of doom
 But what yeah, you don't have to tell us about that paul. We all know all about that and it's all the fucking same
 What do you want paul, oh what do I want sci-fi for eight
 sci-fi for 800

 Who's raiden in mortal combat? It's the movie is highlander. The movie is the highlander. That's him. He was in mortal combat. He was
 Oh the the christopher lambert
 Oh
 That's oh he was in that first. That's right. That's right. I can't believe you all are here to survive
 You're going to defend earth realm against shao khan
 Your christopher lambert in mortal combat impression sounds a lot like ren and stempy. I mean, that's kind of what he sounded like
 You idiots
 johnny cage you idiot you have to fight goro in the pit. Yeah, that's it
 Oh you eat you're up
 Uh, I guess i'll do 800, uh 80s comedy. All right
 If this is 1988 classic mario must clear the name of charles flesher's voice after he's accused of murder orchestrated by professor plum
 Also, did that cartoon redhead give anyone else a boner?
 Who framed roger rabbit who framed roger rabbit, of course is it
 I love that movie. Oh, that's a great movie. So good. I will go with 80s comedy again for six
 In this 1982 celebration of how far we've come as human beings a rich
 Jackie dleeson literally purchases a black man as a plaything for his son
 Portrayed by that kid who got his tongue stuck to a flagpole in a christmas story the toy

 Keeping it from unleashing hell on everyone that he purchased in a smoky back alley from an asian stereotype
 Also, don't mention lincoln's birthday
 Gremlins
 Wait, is this okay? I thought that'd be the sequel because the lincoln's birthday thing comes up in the sequel
 Oh gotcha. Gotcha. Well, he buys the thing in the first one. I don't know whatever. Yeah
 The sequel is great. Uh, also you should watch the sequel to gremlins
 You should watch gremlins 2 and then after you get done watching gremlins 2
 You should uh on youtube pull up the key and peel sketch about the makings of gremlins 2
 That is great that is 100 percent a real suggestion watch that movie then watch that key and peel sketch
