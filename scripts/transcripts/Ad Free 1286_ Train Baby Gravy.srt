00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,600
 (laughing)

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,160
 - This is the part of the show where we thank you,

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,120
 the Ice Cream Truck Drivers.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,940
 Thank you so much, Ice Cream Truck Drivers.

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,960
 I'll tell you what, guys, I am going through these lists.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,160
 I am so close.

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,700
 I'm really close to being able to thank each and every one

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,120
 of you by name this month.

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,000
 And by the next episode, I'm gonna do it.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,640
 I'm gonna thank each and every Ice Cream Truck Driver

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,880
 by name this month at this part of the episode.

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,360
 Don't you worry.

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,600
 All you Ice Cream Truck Drivers out there,

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,160
 who are the Ice Cream Truck Drivers, you may be asking?

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,000
 - Wouldn't you like to know?

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,040
 - These are the folks that deliver that fucking ice cream

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,520
 straight to your fucking ear holes.

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,560

24
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,200
 - Ooh, a show.

25
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,000
 - Hey, Johnny, do you wanna go to an ice cream social?

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,440
 - Yeah, I'd love to.

27
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,960
 - Great, let's go.

28
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,920
 (upbeat music)

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,560
 - Are we on Twitch, Jacob?

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,880
 - We are on Twitch.

31
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,720
 - Oh, hello.

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,800
 - Hello, Twitch.

33
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,080
 (laughs)

34
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,760
 - Ann advised me to raise my computers.

35
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,760
 (upbeat music)

36
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,800
 - All the problems are solved.

37
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,400
 It's time for Matt and Mattingly's ice cream social.

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,960
 Sitting over there in Las Vegas, it's Matt Donnelly.

39
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,200
 Sitting over there with a nice raised computer,

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,320
 it's Paul Mattingly.

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,240
 I'm Jacob the Audio Guy, we're preachingfun.

42
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,960
 - You know why to go chin gut first to the audience, Paul?

43
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,440
 - I mean, I can do whatever is gonna sell the tickets.

44
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,240
 Whatever's gonna put butts in seats.

45
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,720
 I know some people are here for the chin gut.

46
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,120
 I'll tell ya, now I just have to find

47
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,600
 a more permanent solution.

48
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,640
 'Cause right now, the computer is balanced

49
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,640
 on a big stack of DVD holder bags.

50
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,040
 - Oh no.

51
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,280
 - Bags?

52
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,120
 Bags.

53
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,960
 - What do you mean bags?

54
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,160
 - Bags.

55
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,520
 - So these are what I got.

56
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,120
 - What's a DVD holder bag?

57
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,840
 - This is a DVD holder bag.

58
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,680
 So it opens up--

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,000
 - Oh, like a CD wallet, a big CD wallet bag thing.

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,040
 - Sort of.

61
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,920
 But it holds DVDs.

62
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,160
 - Yeah, you know, I see what you mean.

63
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,800
 I'm trying to describe it for the audience

64
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,520
 who can't see your crazy thing

65
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,840
 that you have your computer balanced on.

66
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,920
 - It holds whole DVD.

67
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,240
 I've got a stack of five of these in another bag.

68
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,560
 And then on top of that, I have precariously rested

69
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,440
 a box of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

70
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,440
 little figure people from Fisher Price on top of that.

71
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,840
 - You don't have books? - In another box.

72
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,680
 I do have books, but I feel like,

73
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,000
 you know what's funny, Matt?

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,320
 You know what's funny?

75
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,680
 That was my first thought.

76
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,880
 First of all, right next to me is where I keep my stack of--

77
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,120
 - So incredulous.

78
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,600
 - I keep my stack of improv books right here next to me.

79
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,800
 - Yes. - Okay?

80
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,640
 - Right.

81
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,000
 - I just happen to take all my improv books--

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,400
 - Should I use these books?

83
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,240
 No.

84
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,000
 - No, I took them all, they're in my backpack.

85
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,560
 I took them all to class for my first class on Monday

86
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,760
 to show everybody what books to check out

87
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,720
 if they're interested in looking up more improv stuff.

88
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,440
 So I don't have, but here's the other thing.

89
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,560
 Here's the other thing.

90
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,000
 Nice, stack of wires.

91
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,560
 I do have a box of wires.

92
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,400
 - It's a box.

93
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,000
 Just don't worry about what's in the box.

94
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,120
 - It's a box of wires.

95
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,680
 - It's the box that matters.

96
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,600
 - Well, I've got a box of wires right down here

97
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,440
 that'll work.

98
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,840
 - Matt just shifted his camera so that we could see

99
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,880
 a clear box filled with some electronic doohickeys

100
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,360
 that he has just sitting in his office.

101
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,560
 - It's all my audio equipment for any kind of podcasting.

102
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,400
 - Yeah, I've got--

103
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,560
 - It's an excellent box to set a laptop on.

104
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,760
 If Matt needed a box to set a laptop on,

105
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,200
 I'd be like, "Matt, use that box right there."

106
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,440
 I didn't notice what was in it.

107
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,520
 - I'll have to do that.

108
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,760
 Unfortunately, the space here is limited.

109
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,960
 I'll figure it out, but I do need a box.

110
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,040
 - Call me crazy, I'm a box-not-bags guy

111
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,960
 when it comes to putting valuable equipment on a--

112
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,160
 - But I'm also a bags-not-books guy

113
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,880
 because for whatever reason, my brain goes to,

114
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,800
 oh, but what if I need that book?

115
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,480
 - I'll send you some of my magic books

116
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,320
 that I've never cracked.

117
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,600
 (laughing)

118
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,080
 - Oh, shit.

119
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,240
 No, no, no, no, no.

120
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,600
 I have, do you have sentimental books

121
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,680
 that you keep in your home?

122
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,240
 - Yes. - Oh, yeah.

123
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,760
 - I have several sentimental books that I keep in my home

124
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,280
 that I can't imagine ever reading,

125
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,080
 but they were given to me by like family members--

126
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,520
 - Oh, that you never read? - Or something like that.

127
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,920
 - Oh, yeah, I have something I never read.

128
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,200
 - Oh, no, I don't have any--

129
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,520
 - My uncle was an automotive expert.

130
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,720
 - Oh. - He would go to court

131
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,400
 and testify for, I'm really not exactly sure,

132
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,800
 so I'm telling you kind of what I understand.

133
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,880
 - Was he the one behind unsafe at any speed?

134
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,440
 - Wasn't that Ralph Nader?

135
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,880
 - Yeah, it was Ralph Nader.

136
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,720
 - Okay, no, that was Ralph Nader's fault.

137
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,160
 - You're related to Ralph Nader?

138
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,400
 Holy shit, Jacob Nader?

139
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,240
 - I did have an aunt, or I guess I do,

140
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,760
 who worked for Ralph Nader.

141
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,560
 - She used to be like his chief of staff or something.

142
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,280
 - It's all coming together, what a tangled web we weave.

143
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,600
 - We have technical scoop port in the chat here,

144
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,920
 and there's technical scoop port for a living.

145
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,040
 I'm wondering, do you ever have to address

146
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,840
 what people are putting their computers on top of

147
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,440
 as a technical scoop port person?

148
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,200
 - Yeah, it's getting a nod. - He says yes.

149
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,360
 - He's nodding, he's just nodding with,

150
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,800
 all the time, he says in the chat, all the time.

151
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,520
 - So like, I put it on-- - So people's computers

152
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,400
 just fall off of things all the time.

153
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,120
 I've put on a series of delightful pillows,

154
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,680
 and now I'm having difficulty operating my computer.

155
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,240
 - I had my computer-- - Oh, have you ever had

156
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,040
 the thing where they-- - Perfectly balanced.

157
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,200
 - Stacked the laptop up on pillows and everything,

158
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,160
 and then the pillows clog up the fans,

159
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,360
 and the laptop overheats?

160
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,800
 - Right, yeah. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

161
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,920
 That's happened to me.

162
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,880
 - I had 'em-- - Just blocking up the fans.

163
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,400
 - I had it stacked up on a bunch of bananas,

164
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,800
 and the bananas went south of cheese,

165
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,560
 and then my laptop got infested with fruit flies, so.

166
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,040
 (laughing)

167
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,080
 - So you have a record.

168
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,320
 (laughing)

169
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:25,400
 - Paul, say that sentence again.

170
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,440
 - Well, I-- - For the--

171
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,720
 - I stacked my, no, I didn't really.

172
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,320
 I was playing, I was playing.

173
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,600
 I would not stack my computer on well-stacked bananas,

174
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,440
 let them go to rot, and then let the computer--

175
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,800
 - Bullshit, bullshit, you would not do that.

176
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,920
 - I wouldn't do that.

177
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,880
 No, no, no, if you came into this basement,

178
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,040
 I will tell you what you would not find.

179
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,040
 Any food or decayable items outside of laundry detergent

180
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:57,200
 and a bottle or two of diet soda, that's it.

181
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,080
 There is nothing-- - What about small rodents?

182
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,160
 What about squirrels?

183
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,440
 - No, everything else in this basement is plastique, baby.

184
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,080
 Plastique.

185
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,160
 Plastic or pressed wood, that's all that lives in this basement.

186
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,320
 - I'll give you some pressed wood.

187
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,360
 (laughing)

188
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,200
 - All my shelves are fucking pressed wood.

189
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,640
 - When all the kids left my birthday party,

190
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,440
 I took all the leftover balloon animals,

191
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,640
 put them in one pile, and I put my computer right on top

192
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,600
 with the old balloon animal.

193
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,440
 (laughing)

194
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,080
 - Let it heat up. - Really propped it up well.

195
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,240
 (spitting)

196
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,600
 - Paul.

197
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,880
 - No, I have books about auto accidents and stuff.

198
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,240
 My uncle used to go testify about auto accidents

199
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,840
 and tire marks on highways and that kind of thing.

200
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,920
 He was one of those types of expert witnesses.

201
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,760
 - It'd be like, well, Your Honor--

202
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,600
 - Books about that kind of stuff.

203
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,440
 I'm like, I'm not gonna read these books,

204
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,280
 but they're cool.

205
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,280
 They're never gonna come around.

206
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,280
 - Clearly the victim in this crime

207
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,280
 was a worthless piece of shit

208
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,720
 because there were no tire marks

209
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,400
 in front of where he was struck by the vehicle.

210
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,680
 (laughing)

211
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,960
 - He was clearly not even in an automobile, Your Honor.

212
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,840
 Clearly denoting him as one of the poors.

213
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,920
 - One of the poors.

214
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,480
 One of the worthless piece of shit poors.

215
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,600
 - One of the poors who the law does not apply to.

216
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,040
 One of the poors.

217
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,920
 - All right, Matt, what did you wanna know?

218
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,760
 - Well, I'm just saying,

219
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,800
 Jacob's uncle was trying to get him paid.

220
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,600
 You know, you get paid to testify in court

221
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,440
 when you're an expert.

222
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,920
 - Oh, yeah, no, he was a paid expert witness.

223
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,600
 - Making that money, making that dollar.

224
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,760
 - He worked for LSU and he was a paid expert

225
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,880
 in those types of cases.

226
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,720
 - Now, he wasn't working for the big, big auto people, was he?

227
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,560
 - No, no, no, no.

228
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,320
 He was a university professor at LSU.

229
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,160
 - Oh, so he was standing up for the middleman.

230
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,560
 - He was an independent expert.

231
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,920
 He would come in and testify for like,

232
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,280
 yeah, just testify to the facts of an auto accident.

233
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,960
 - Leon piping up in the chat

234
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,640
 that he has to pay quite a bit for his expert witnesses,

235
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,760
 so he would know.

236
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,600
 - Yeah.

237
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,120
 - Yeah, yeah.

238
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,920
 So, Paul, I'm gonna tell you a story

239
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,600
 that's gonna make you too messent, buddy.

240
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,640
 - I've got a feeling about what it is.

241
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,600
 Go ahead, tell me.

242
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,360
 - I was going to mail some things out yesterday

243
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,920
 to the UPS store nearby my house.

244
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:09,320
 I was, it's actually totally random.

245
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,680
 Someone reached out and said,

246
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,760
 "Hey, this is a crazy question,

247
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,840
 "but I guess this is what Facebook is for.

248
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,920
 "I think I went to one of your comedy shows in the '90s

249
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,440
 "and I bought one of your shirts

250
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,560
 "that said possible side effects but said free sex."

251
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,400
 - Yeah.

252
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,240
 - And I--

253
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,520
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, the one that says two different things

254
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,360
 depending on where you are.

255
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,240
 - Yeah, if you look at our store,

256
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,640
 the one with the salt pork shirt is based on.

257
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,480
 - Yeah, we modeled it after that.

258
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,520
 - And, apologies to Mike Nilsen for using UPS.

259
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,520
 They're closer, buddy.

260
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,120
 FedEx is all the way up on Stephanie.

261
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,960
 And--

262
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,040
 (laughs)

263
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,360
 Anyways--

264
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,200
 - That's Brooke's company.

265
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
 - This is a side note, but yeah, yeah.

266
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,960
 So they reached out and I was like,

267
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,400
 I go, "Oh my gosh," and I was like,

268
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,720
 "I don't know where those shirts are."

269
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,560
 And I go, "You know what?

270
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,680
 "I have a box of old shit in my garage.

271
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,520
 "I bet I have one in there."

272
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,240
 And I looked into my box and I found my last

273
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,600
 free sex possible side effects shirt and I thought,

274
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,000
 "Well, it's sitting in a box for me.

275
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,560
 "This person wants it."

276
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,400
 - Right.

277
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,600
 - So like wear or hang up.

278
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,000
 So I went to the UPS store to mail this person the shirt.

279
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,480
 - That's very kind of you.

280
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,640
 - So a part of you decided that you didn't need

281
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,280
 to hold onto that for the future Matt Donnelly Museum.

282
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,120
 - Yes.

283
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,120
 - Go ahead and just give that away.

284
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,960
 - Yeah, yeah.

285
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,000
 Matt at 47 looking back at the T-shirt he made

286
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,080
 when he was in his 20s is a fine length of time

287
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,600
 to remember that time.

288
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,440
 - Yeah, I agree.

289
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
 - Ever since I showed Paul my rig,

290
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,200
 slowly my laptop's been sliding into my lap.

291
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,200
 - Oh, and yet my DVD bags remain solidly steadfast.

292
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:46,240
 How strange.

293
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,760
 - All right, time in scoops.

294
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,880
 Team bag, team box, team books.

295
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,800
 Let's go.

296
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,640
 Let's go.

297
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,480
 - Paul was right.

298
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,320
 Paul was right.

299
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,160
 - Paul was right.

300
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,040
 (laughing)

301
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,720
 - Get more bananas, Leafy Screamer.

302
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,480
 - But I wouldn't have done it unless I showed you my thing

303
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,720
 and I put everything out of my arrangement.

304
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,320
 - It's a poor craftsman blames his tools, Matt.

305
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,920
 - I'm so happy right now.

306
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,080
 I was so close.

307
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,480
 I ran out of time.

308
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,040
 I was so close to adjusting my monitor set up

309
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,720
 in my office here before we started today.

310
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,840
 And I'm so glad I didn't be falling over right now.

311
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,920
 (laughing)

312
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,040
 So I, right next door to the UPS store

313
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,520
 is the comic book store.

314
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,360
 - Oh yeah.

315
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,520
 - And I was like, man, Paul got me

316
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,400
 that absolute Batman trade.

317
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,720
 - You hit it exactly the right day, serendipity.

318
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,880
 - Totally, I didn't realize it.

319
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,320
 I walked into the complex with the day it came out.

320
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,240
 - The day of volume two.

321
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,960
 Oh really?

322
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,920
 Yeah, the day of absolute volume two, absolute Batman.

323
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,520
 Yeah, oh crazy.

324
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,520
 I walked in and then he was like, hey, what are you here for?

325
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,800
 I was like, oh, I was curious if you had absolute Batman.

326
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,120
 He goes, oh, that's right, that came out today.

327
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,160
 And I go, I didn't realize it.

328
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,800
 I literally just happened to be mailing something next door.

329
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,120
 And he's like, oh yeah, no, it's a great book.

330
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,240
 Are you enjoying it?

331
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,800
 And I wanted to be like, look, we can do small talk,

332
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,600
 but I am not one of you, is what I really wanted to say.

333
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,440
 - Right, right.

334
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,260
 - But I can't say it.

335
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,100
 - Jump in.

336
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,520
 - You wanna like stop him and explain to him?

337
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,920
 Be like, no, no, I really didn't know it was coming out today.

338
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,080
 - Jump in both feet.

339
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,320
 - This is great.

340
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,520
 - I was like, oh man, I don't, I was like,

341
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,120
 my kids come here 'cause they're in the system.

342
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,960
 I was like, maybe 'cause my kids come here

343
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,600
 'cause children buy comic books.

344
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,440
 And--

345
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:34,360
 - And so do well-educated men and women

346
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,880
 and people of indeterminate gender

347
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,880
 or whatever they want to be.

348
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,040
 - He plowed right ahead.

349
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,680
 He was like, you closeted nerd.

350
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,480
 And he just dove right in.

351
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,760
 - Yeah, good for him.

352
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,600
 He knew what to do.

353
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,440
 - He saw you, he knew you.

354
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,280
 - Yeah.

355
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,120
 - One of us.

356
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,080
 - Okay.

357
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,400
 - And I said, it's really my podcast partner

358
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,360
 who turned me on to this, the bond.

359
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,120
 He goes, oh, what's your podcast?

360
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,760
 - I gave him a chip that last time.

361
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,200
 - Well, Paul, so did I.

362
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
 - And?

363
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,760
 - I'm just saying, I went in.

364
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,840
 - You chipped him again.

365
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,360
 - I chipped him again.

366
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,200
 - Awesome.

367
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,080
 - Get to message, Paul.

368
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,920
 - I am.

369
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,680
 - I was like, so I bought an absolute Batman.

370
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,640
 He said there are two other books in the series

371
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,640
 that aren't included in the trades.

372
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,080
 Art Gam and some other adventure.

373
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,520
 And I bought those.

374
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,840
 - Wow, look at you.

375
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,440
 You're even deeper than me right now.

376
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,600
 - Oh, he even upsold you.

377
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,400
 - He upsold me.

378
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,440
 'Cause here's what happened.

379
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,240
 I flew on Frontier and that's a hellscape

380
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,520
 that humans don't deserve.

381
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:43,840
 Among it being the Maury Pulvich show airlines,

382
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,720
 Jerry Springer Airlines.

383
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,400
 - It's also no Wi-Fi.

384
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,440
 While you sit on those uncomfortable lawn chairs,

385
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,360
 it's no Wi-Fi.

386
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,320
 And my absolute Batman got me through a flight

387
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,280
 and I was like, oh, I need to just have this handy

388
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,040
 for my next travel.

389
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,720
 And so I bought the thing.

390
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,880
 So I bought, I put my name in the system

391
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,400
 and I chipped the guy

392
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,400
 and he said he wanted to check out our podcast.

393
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,480
 - Fantastic, dude. - All right.

394
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,320
 I am so proud of you on so many levels.

395
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,840
 - I'm glad you brought this up though.

396
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,600
 'Cause you always do Wi-Fi on the planes.

397
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,680
 - I do.

398
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,120
 - Paul, do you do Wi-Fi when you fly or no?

399
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,520
 - Not usually, no.

400
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,800
 - I don't either.

401
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,720
 I kind of enjoy the few hours where I'm disconnected.

402
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,840
 I read a book or watch a movie or something.

403
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,240
 - Yeah, I go into airplane mode

404
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,880
 and I turn on something I've downloaded.

405
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,120
 I usually just listen to podcasts when I'm flying.

406
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,400
 - Like I'm aware that you can get Wi-Fi on planes.

407
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,560
 I just don't really think to do it.

408
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,800
 - I'll turn on my podcast and fall asleep is what I do.

409
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,640
 That's-- - Fair.

410
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,480
 - That's kind of the whole thing.

411
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,640
 - And then you have to rewind your podcast

412
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,000
 and find where you left off?

413
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,480
 - No, it's usually just podcasts.

414
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,560
 I've decided these are just my sleep podcasts

415
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,600
 for this round, yeah. - Okay.

416
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,920
 - 'Cause I travel with just my phone.

417
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,240
 So I'm an ogre and don't know how to download

418
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,040
 an episode of television to my phone.

419
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,040
 So I usually just try to see if the Wi-Fi is strong enough.

420
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,600
 - Oh, right, right, right.

421
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,040
 - So I know like different airlines

422
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,800
 have different strengths of Wi-Fi.

423
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,600
 Netflix is generally pretty agreeable

424
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,480
 with even the weakest Wi-Fi.

425
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,200
 - Well, Netflix is also the app that works best

426
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,880
 for downloading stuff too.

427
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,080
 - Okay, well now I know.

428
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,720
 - Netflix has the best download technology on their app.

429
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,800
 So they are the best in airplane mode.

430
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,040
 - That's what I have to start doing.

431
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,640
 So I'm jealous-- - But now like HBO

432
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,120
 and some of those others have caught up a little bit

433
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,960
 with the app technology.

434
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,760
 - When I see them download, I'm so jealous

435
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,320
 of people who have downloaded full shows

436
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,600
 or movies to watch on the plane.

437
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,440
 - Oh yeah.

438
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,240
 - You're ahead of the curve,

439
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,680
 busting out the graphic novel, dude.

440
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,840
 You're ahead of the curve having to trade paperback

441
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,840
 'cause people can be, but plus I'm telling you like,

442
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,360
 you're on the right track.

443
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,280
 You cannot go wrong with that absolute Batman book

444
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,720
 because Scott Snyder, who did the whole "Court of Owls" series

445
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,360
 and a bunch of other Batman stuff that I love,

446
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,360
 a lot of his work, he's done some of the best Batman

447
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,360
 of the last 15 years.

448
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,360
 But this series, it is selling so well.

449
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,040
 Like numbers keep going up per issue.

450
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,120
 I believe they're on issue 18

451
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,400
 and the orders are higher than when they started,

452
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,440
 which is crazy for any book.

453
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,280
 - Oh, right, right, right.

454
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,480
 So it's increasing in popularity and stuff.

455
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,760
 - Yes, people are buying it, more people.

456
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,160
 So comic books or comic shops are ordering more copies.

457
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,580
 So it is just, it is growing, growing, growing

458
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,760
 in a way that is not normal 'cause it's that popular.

459
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:37,200
 So you're looking, what you're reading right now in 10 years

460
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,400
 will probably be the DCU film adaptation.

461
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,480
 - That's what seems like it's headed for sure.

462
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,940
 - Oh, gotcha.

463
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,780
 Let me ask you something, Paul.

464
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,600
 - Simply because it's so popular, yes.

465
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,440
 - These different kind of Batman properties,

466
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,800
 like back in the day, there'd be like the detective Batman

467
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,840
 and now there's this, all the different things.

468
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,140
 Is that, that's just different writers

469
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,560
 or different creators all under the same corporate umbrella

470
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,920
 or is it different people that are going to them

471
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,160
 to do this or are these part,

472
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,240
 I guess what I'm asking is like,

473
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,320
 is the author of this current Batman series

474
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,640
 that y'all are talking about here,

475
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,420
 is that somebody who's been working

476
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:20,200
 with the Batman comic group, whatever they are,

477
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,120
 for some time, there you go.

478
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,520
 Has he been working with DC

479
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,880
 or have they been working with DC for some time

480
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,360
 or is this like a new person that has come in

481
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,920
 to push things in a different direction?

482
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,840
 - No, Scott Snyder's done Batman forever as far as--

483
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,280
 - Oh, this is Sny, oh, okay.

484
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,520
 I didn't realize this was Scott Snyder.

485
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,700
 - Comic book time. - I know that name.

486
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,540
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

487
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,000
 And so he's been at it for a while

488
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 and this is a new re-imagining reboot of the character.

489
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,720
 A very interesting take, which I love.

490
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,600
 So it lets everything become kind of fresh and new.

491
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,640
 And everything's under this absolute umbrella.

492
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,960
 So I don't know if you recall,

493
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,900
 it's crazy to me that it was 20 years ago

494
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:04,220
 when the Marvel Ultimates started, but it did.

495
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:09,220
 So Ultimates is what basically inspired the MCU.

496
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,520
 So-- - The movies.

497
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,200
 - The films that you see are essentially based off

498
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,660
 the Ultimates in a lot of ways.

499
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:22,280
 So "Ultimate Spider-Man" was probably the strongest,

500
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,000
 followed very closely by "The Ultimates,"

501
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,320
 which was "The Avengers."

502
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,160
 - Got it.

503
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,980
 - So those were the two books

504
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,820
 that I followed really closely.

505
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,000
 But every little while, you've gotta do a reset.

506
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And currently, DC is eating Marvel's lunch

507
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,080
 as far as the success they're having with "The Absolute Line,"

508
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,560
 which allows for these characters to be set

509
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,120
 in a new timeline, new era, new stuff,

510
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,520
 and not say, we're not throwing out the baby

511
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,360
 with the bathwater.

512
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,000
 You still have all the other classics up.

513
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,080
 And there are still ongoing series based more closely

514
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,960
 on classic interpretations of the characters.

515
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,040
 This is not the only "Batman" book right now.

516
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,720
 This is not even the main "Batman" book.

517
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,700
 The main "Batman" book, I believe, I wanna say,

518
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,080
 is it Zdarsky who's got it right now?

519
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,500
 No, Zdarsky doesn't have it right now.

520
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,560
 - Okay, let me ask you this.

521
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,580
 So whoever's writing the main "Batman" book

522
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,240
 and then Snyder writing this one,

523
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,800
 are those people working together in any way?

524
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,000
 They are not having to-- - Are they having discussions?

525
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,520
 Are they like coordinating, storyboarding,

526
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,920
 anything like that? - Not currently, no.

527
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,580
 - They're completely separate, and they're--

528
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,880
 - The only way that those-- - I'm more curious

529
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,760
 about the business aspect of how these things work.

530
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,800
 Is it like the, you mentioned the MCU in film.

531
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,000
 Is it like that where you have kind of the whole thing

532
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,960
 storyboarded out? - Now this is the thing.

533
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,280
 - And then you're trying to, hold on, hold on,

534
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,360
 you're trying to work within that storyboard.

535
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:57,360
 Or is it several different artists working independently

536
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,520
 but kind of keeping an eye on each other?

537
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,700
 - Within the Absolute Universe,

538
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,960
 they are just now starting to do crossovers

539
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,580
 within the Absolute Universe.

540
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,420
 So Absolute Wonder Woman has met Absolute Batman.

541
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:14,360
 So that's starting, those characters are starting

542
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,920
 to interact within the Absolute Universe.

543
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,400
 - How did it go?

544
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,800
 - I don't know, I didn't read it yet.

545
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,060
 - Oh, straight to anal, straight to anal.

546
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,080
 - I'm still waiting for my Absolute Wonder Woman volume two

547
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,420
 also, but yes, Jacob, that's kind of been a weird thing.

548
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,080
 - They both discovered they were tops

549
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,420
 and then it got awkward.

550
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:35,060
 - It's been a weird thing with all the,

551
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:40,520
 you know, the crossovers that these comic book companies

552
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,100
 have become addicted to.

553
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:46,460
 So when you do something like Civil War or Secret Wars

554
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,000
 or KO is the big crossover event that's happening

555
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,040
 right now in DC, so a lot of the mainline books

556
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,380
 do have to communicate with each other

557
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,160
 'cause their main characters are interacting with each other,

558
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,520
 but a lot of times that will throw a monkey wrench

559
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,720
 into what other creators are working on

560
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,360
 in their individual books and it'll either completely

561
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,000
 fuck up the story in some way

562
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 and maybe they'll have to rejigger everything

563
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,860
 or they'll just be like, well, here's two issues

564
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,700
 that don't have anything to do with the continuity

565
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,640
 we're trying to project, but this fits in

566
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,200
 with the ongoing overarching storyline

567
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,920
 that's happening in the universe.

568
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,440
 - Like, Paul, you brought up that like the,

569
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,880
 Marvel just launched a thing called Secret Wars

570
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,040
 'cause they thought war and secret

571
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,760
 were exciting words for kids.

572
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,960
 - Yes, that was the thing that they did back in the '80s,

573
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,800
 yeah.

574
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,900
 - And that's why I think DC just launched a new series

575
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,440
 called La Boo Boo Mr. Beast, so.

576
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,840
 - Wow, that's gonna fly off the fucking shelves.

577
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,040
 - Yeah, it sold out.

578
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,440
 - That's the way to do it.

579
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,680
 I just saw there was a George Lucas La Boo Boo

580
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,040
 limited edition.

581
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,640
 - How big's the goiter on it?

582
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,540
 - Look at it, it doesn't not look like him.

583
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,000
 But he's wearing like--

584
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,240
 - I'll tell you who else doesn't not look like George Lucas

585
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,040
 and that is the following sponsor.

586
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,160
 - Today's show, Madden Manley's Ice Cream Social

587
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,960
 is brought to you by these fine makers

588
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,820
 and providers of products.

589
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:14,040
 A single photograph of US President Martin Van Buren.

590
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,360
 That's right, today being sold to you

591
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,320
 could be a single photograph of US President

592
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,160
 Martin Van Buren and that's from Belgian Tripple Scoop

593
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,680
 in 2025.

594
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:31,160
 - Hello, I'm a single photograph of Martin Van Buren.

595
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:37,360
 I'm speaking to you through the magic of picture magic.

596
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:43,140
 This photograph talks, that's why it's so expensive.

597
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,120
 That's the only way we can keep the company afloat.

598
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,800
 I cost 18 million dollars and after I'm sold, that's it.

599
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,680
 We're shutting the doors on the storefront.

600
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,800
 We're closed for business but we'll stay open

601
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,680
 until someone buys me the talking picture

602
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,920
 of Martin Van Buren.

603
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,140
 That's all, that's it.

604
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:05,980
 However--

605
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,560
 - I'm sorry, was that a prerecorded message

606
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,800
 or can you have conversations with people?

607
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,340
 - Oh, I can talk to people.

608
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,180
 - Bah!

609
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,200
 - Yeah, welcome to the shop.

610
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,840
 That's why I'm so expensive, I'm 18 million dollars.

611
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,280
 Here's the thing--

612
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,400
 - Are you conscious?

613
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,280
 - Yeah, very much so and to the point

614
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,680
 where I've been giving advice to my business partners,

615
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,060
 I've been telling them this is a stupid business plan

616
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:31,040
 just to sell one picture of Martin Van Buren,

617
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,480
 talking or not, conscious or not.

618
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,680
 18 million dollars, that's great but what are you doing?

619
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,480
 Your overhead's gotta be out of control

620
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,720
 for the rental of this space so I've decided

621
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,720
 that we're going into furniture as well as my picture.

622
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,120
 So you can buy the Martin Van Buren while you're here,

623
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,640
 you can shop and buy one of my beautiful Martin Van Buren's

624
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,760
 suitable to put me on top of someday.

625
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,020
 - Does the bureau also speak?

626
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,720
 - I'm afraid not, unless you put me in it,

627
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,880
 you can do that, you can stick my picture inside

628
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,320
 and I'll be like (mumbles) haunted or something,

629
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,040
 I don't know who, it's not really haunted though,

630
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,300
 I'm just a talking picture, it's different from a haunting.

631
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,160
 - That's a good question, are you a talking picture

632
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,580
 or do you have the consciousness of Martin Van Buren?

633
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,920
 - Not at all, I'm just a picture that has consciousness.

634
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,880
 - Oh, you just look like Martin Van Buren.

635
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,800
 - Well, I'm just a picture of Martin Van Buren,

636
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,120
 I look like a two dimensional image of you.

637
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,560
 - Do you know which president Martin Van Buren was?

638
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,080
 - No, I don't even know who I am, I don't know what I am.

639
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,800
 I'm a picture thing.

640
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,560
 - Are you also selling a red and white wine blend

641
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,520
 from France?

642
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,860
 - Yes, you are, okay good, I was worried someone else

643
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,060
 was trying to profit from your name

644
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,160
 and selling Martin Van Bordeaux.

645
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,980
 - No, Martin Van Bordeaux's are being,

646
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,000
 you can buy the Martin Van Bureau's

647
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 that's so angry. - I actually stacked my laptop

648
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,080
 on top of some Martin Van Bureaux.

649
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,900
 (laughing)

650
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,000
 - Just bottles?

651
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,400
 - Just bottles, it's very sturdy.

652
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,400
 - Well, I also told the guys, hey, what do the kids love?

653
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,060
 They love the vape, huh?

654
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:31,060
 Yeah, so we got you hooked up G, we got that sticky icky,

655
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,680
 if you know what I'm saying.

656
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,600
 So come on in and try some of Martin Van Blazen's.

657
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,280
 420, what up G?

658
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,760
 - Now, you're not selling containers

659
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,160
 of just your piss, are you?

660
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,720
 - Martin Van Juren, of course.

661
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,960
 - Okay, all right, let me make sure

662
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,320
 this line is very diverse.

663
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,980
 - But it's not just containers of my piss,

664
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,400
 it's in custom shoes made for skateboarders.

665
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,080
 They're Martin's Vans Juren.

666
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,600
 (laughing)

667
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,140
 - All right, let's go for the check out.

668
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,480
 - The soggy step.

669
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,460
 - The soggy step.

670
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,320
 (laughing)

671
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,040
 - Martin Van's Juren.

672
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,240
 (laughing)

673
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,960
 - Dead last low, a bird sanctuary, Martin Van Buren.

674
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,160
 Yeah, I like that, that's good.

675
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,240
 Oh, I had a kitty cat named Martin Van Puren.

676
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,760
 That was like Katy Perry, that's Kitty Perry.

677
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,720
 Good one, Leon.

678
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,640
 We, if my brain had been in a more punny place,

679
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,320
 we could have rocked that a little bit longer.

680
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,920
 I was, I was, I'm still pulling on the old--

681
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,680
 - Oh boy, that's a shame.

682
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,040
 - I'm pulling on the old motor.

683
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,600
 Ah boy, you son of a bitch, you son of a bitch.

684
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,120
 - Too bad, too bad for the rest of us.

685
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,440
 (laughing)

686
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,440
 - This is that he had his laptop on a book of puns

687
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,120
 so he couldn't access it.

688
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,400
 - That's right, he needed that book.

689
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,560
 He needed that book. - Never stack,

690
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,000
 never stack on books.

691
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,080
 You might need that book.

692
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,560
 (laughing)

693
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,000
 - I had to listen to my own fucking advice, I'm stupid.

694
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,800
 - Matt, are your boys trying to buy up

695
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,040
 all the Mr. Beast jerky and whatnots?

696
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,480
 - You know, they're surprisingly not

697
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,920
 as like uber-focused like that.

698
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,560
 So like for a second, my youngest was into Prime drinks,

699
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,400
 and then-- - Okay.

700
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,220
 - But then he's like, after a while he's like,

701
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,840
 these don't taste good, I'm gonna stop buying them.

702
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,720
 - Oh, for God's sake, they're the worst shit ever.

703
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,540
 - Those Paul boys are the devil.

704
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:36,840
 - Now, Mr. Beast does pride himself

705
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,320
 on doing ethical chocolate,

706
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,600
 which actually is like a huge thing

707
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,680
 that we don't like to talk about

708
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,480
 'cause who wants to start taking pride in their chocolate?

709
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,000
 - Oh yeah, I thought that was only in Vegas.

710
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,320
 - Well, I'm in Vegas, I don't know if it is anywhere else.

711
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,920
 - Ethel M. Chocolate?

712
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,680
 (laughing)

713
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,960
 Isn't that a Vegas company?

714
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,360
 - It is a Vegas company, yes.

715
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,480
 - Okay.

716
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,920
 Oh, ethical chocolate.

717
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,560
 - Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

718
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,240
 - Ethel cool chocolate.

719
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,080
 - So he does--

720
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,400
 - She should call ethical chocolate.

721
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,680
 - So the kids will buy some Feastable bars,

722
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,320
 but I'm okay with that since he is trying

723
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,560
 to actually set a precedent of you pay a little more

724
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,360
 for your chocolate, but it's ethical.

725
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,360
 - Does he pay the cacao harvesters $2 instead of one a day?

726
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,040
 - That's right, that's right.

727
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,880
 - What a saint.

728
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,120
 - Yeah.

729
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,800
 - Hey, my question, the only thing that I care about

730
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,860
 as far as your kids are concerned,

731
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,400
 did you show them the He-Man trailer?

732
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,080
 - I brought up at dinner and we have not had a chance.

733
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,080
 So last time I had a corporate gig,

734
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,920
 I wasn't home.

735
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,320
 Tonight I'm home with the boys

736
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,240
 and I'm gonna try to show them the He-Man trailer.

737
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,320
 I did bring it up.

738
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,320
 They showed very little interest in watching it,

739
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,160
 just so you know.

740
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,320
 - Oh, of course, 'cause they don't know from He-Man.

741
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,640
 - That's right, but we are gonna watch it tonight.

742
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,320
 And I'll report to you either privately or publicly

743
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,160
 about it.

744
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,000
 (laughing)

745
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,680
 - Well, it's gotta be public, that's what it's all about.

746
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,440
 We're gonna hear it on the pod.

747
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,560
 - Fair enough, fair enough.

748
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,280
 - Speaking of public things that people are gonna hear

749
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,460
 on the pod, this is technically Scoop Mail,

750
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,280
 but I wanna do it now.

751
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,440
 Lauren Shreve sent us an email

752
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,440
 and Lauren is setting up an LLC for HR Consulting.

753
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,260
 - Okay.

754
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,600
 - Needs a name for the business.

755
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,100
 Lauren is asking us to help name the business.

756
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,520
 - All right.

757
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,280
 - HR Consulting business. - HR Consulting,

758
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,320
 what's it about?

759
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,920
 - Oh, HR Consulting.

760
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,000
 - HR Consulting. - Not like HR stands for,

761
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,680
 it stands for human resources.

762
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,880
 - HR does stand for something, Paul.

763
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,760
 - I know.

764
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,680
 - I thought it, well, it stands for a puff and stuff.

765
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,760
 - It's Lauren is setting up an HR puff and stuff, LLC.

766
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,600
 - Okay.

767
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:40,000
 - Don't discuss Israel, LLC.

768
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,840
 - That would be.

769
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,680
 (laughing)

770
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,840
 - This is not about Israel, LLC.

771
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,180
 - HR is the enemy, LLC.

772
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:49,880
 - Fight the real enemy, LLC.

773
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,960
 - Yeah.

774
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,260
 - There's still. - Oh, okay.

775
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,960
 - There's still such thing as the C word, LLC.

776
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,080
 (laughing)

777
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,220
 - Why didn't you just tell me to my face,

778
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,140
 I would have reacted better, LLC.

779
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,840
 (laughing)

780
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,840
 - We're watching you, LLC.

781
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,840
 - Let's see, 'cause you don't wanna do something corny

782
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,400
 like Olive Branch or like Peacemaking or Peacemaker,

783
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,240
 that'd be good, Peacemaker.

784
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,080
 - Peacemaker.

785
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,620
 - How about like, humane recognition?

786
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,800
 - No.

787
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,680
 - For HR.

788
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:33,220
 - How about workforce alchemy?

789
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,660
 - Synergy, the show.

790
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,500
 - Yeah.

791
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,320
 Two plus two equals five?

792
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,360
 - Resourcing humanely.

793
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,800
 - Well, we're getting some suggestions here in the chat.

794
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,360
 - Coca-Cola, LLC, try that one, that's good.

795
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,560
 - Lemur Kramer is the Martin Vroomen resources, that's good.

796
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,760
 Leon Kasab's got hitting some dingers, LLC.

797
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,840
 That's a good one, scooper nova girl,

798
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,680
 this could have been an email, LLC, I like that.

799
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,400
 - This could have been an email, LLC, it's really funny.

800
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,800
 - That's pretty good.

801
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,880
 Chris Angel has a Chimera.

802
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,120
 Why is your union rep here, LLC?

803
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,160
 I like that.

804
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,720
 HR Us, from Lemur Kramer, I like that one.

805
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:21,080
 HR Mart, Lemur Kramer is just cranking them out.

806
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:26,080
 - How about Ipatch HR, you like the VR, Ipatch HR.

807
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,160
 - Ipatch HR?

808
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,460
 - Yeah, 'cause Ipatch, like I patch it up,

809
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,000
 I'm making it better, right?

810
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,520
 There's Ipatch Pirate, and then HR with the Pirate R.

811
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,480
 I'll just go ahead and declare me the winner on this, I won.

812
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,760
 (group clapping)

813
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,920
 - Oh, my dogs are in here and they are so mad

814
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,040
 that they're not getting fed right now.

815
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,080
 - Here's the question, so like sometimes you want,

816
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,440
 like you have a regular business name,

817
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,480
 but like what you put on the checks is funny, right?

818
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,320
 - Sure.

819
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,040
 - So like, my wife has like 11 jobs

820
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,880
 with the same company,

821
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,640
 but they all have the different LLCs.

822
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,480
 And every time I get the stuff for the taxes,

823
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,160
 I'm like, what is the company called?

824
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,960
 And so like, no one calls it these companies,

825
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,800
 but it's just a funny thing.

826
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,560
 - Some of the names are wild, yeah.

827
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,920
 - Yeah, like for this, I get paid from Penn Sunday School

828
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,400
 from preaching to the choir, LLC.

829
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,920
 So it depends, do you just want a funny name for the LLC

830
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,640
 for someone to cut the check to?

831
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,600
 Or is this like, I'm gonna get a website

832
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,440
 and market my services, I need a real name.

833
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,640
 - This is gonna be that.

834
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,000
 - It's gonna be the funny check thing.

835
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,400
 - When do you think it's gonna be?

836
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,520
 - No, I think it's gonna be the second.

837
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,360
 I think it's gonna be the name that she wants people

838
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,080
 to be able to see and do business with her.

839
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:45,080
 - How about Bat Shit Crossom?

840
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:52,600
 - What do you think, like free beer?

841
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,560
 - Free beer and chicken.

842
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,560
 - Just name it after old improv teams.

843
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,720
 - Free beer and chicken.

844
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,600
 - How about you call it a bear in the woods, LLC?

845
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,640
 - Oh, I like uncomfortable conversations.

846
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,120
 - Slang for shit.

847
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,360
 (laughing)

848
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:15,560
 - We need to talk, LLC is good too.

849
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:22,920
 Yeah, something like hard conversations

850
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,840
 might really be on the right path.

851
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,000
 'Cause that's all anybody wants

852
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,640
 an HR consulting firm for, right?

853
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,840
 - Exit strategy.

854
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,160
 - Golden parachute.

855
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,440
 (laughing)

856
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,680
 - Final interview.

857
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:41,000
 Exit interview, exit interview, LLC.

858
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,320
 - Exit interview.

859
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,560
 (laughing)

860
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:52,320
 - You could do which exit interview?

861
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,600
 - It could be a New Jersey based HR firm.

862
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,360
 - Which exit interview?

863
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,480
 Exit only interview.

864
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,440
 - Trim the fat LLC.

865
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,680
 (laughing)

866
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:08,720
 - One of us doesn't have a job LLC from elsewhere.

867
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,560
 - There you go.

868
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,200
 - That's exactly the conversations that HR--

869
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,520
 - Oh, Fudging the Whale, Higher Expectations, H-I-R-E.

870
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,360
 Higher Expectations.

871
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,560
 - Oh, I like that.

872
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,400
 - That's pretty good.

873
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,360
 - I don't like that.

874
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,400
 - Higher Expectations is pretty great.

875
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,520
 - Yeah.

876
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,480
 - What I think you have to do is take your,

877
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,400
 the name of your first pet and the street you grew up on,

878
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,520
 and that's how you name a company.

879
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,360
 As far as I know, that's a--

880
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,840
 - That's right, that's right.

881
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,560

 I'm a friendly gator, don't you see?

00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,400
 - From the Pearl Vision?

1061
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,720
 - Pearl Vision.

1062
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,000
 - Yeah.

1063
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,600
 They take-- - What you stripped?

1064
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,560
 - They take, oh, I'm actually not as bad as,

1065
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,400
 oh, did I talk about that?

1066
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,720
 I talked about that I was gonna go to the eye doctor.

1067
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,920
 Did I talk about going to the eye doctor?

1068
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,320
 - I think we were gonna talk about going there

1069
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,080
 and we talked about having reading glasses around the house.

1070
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,120
 - Yeah, yeah, so I have reading glasses around the house

1071
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:30,840
 and I went there and I was like so afraid

1072
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,600
 that they were gonna be like, did you drive here?

1073
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,440
 - Here's these Coke bottles, you blindy.

1074
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,120
 - But they gave me five vision tests.

1075
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,640
 I did like a round of different tests,

1076
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,720
 the test for different things on the eye.

1077
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,560
 - Uh-huh.

1078
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,080
 - And they said I have a very basic prescription,

1079
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,080
 nothing too crazy.

1080
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,440
 - That fits, clock that.

1081
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,640
 - Basic bitch.

1082
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,960
 (laughing)

1083
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,320
 - Here's your basic bitch glasses, you basic bitch.

1084
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,560
 (laughing)

1085
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:07,280
 Once you go have your chicken salad for lunch,

1086
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,360
 you fucking basic bitch, get out of here.

1087
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,680
 Here's your glasses.

1088
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:18,200
 - Are you nearsighted, farsighted, or both?

1089
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,040
 - Both.

1090
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,360
 I need tough, I got progressives, right,

1091
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,520
 so I can do the far from the top and tiny at the bottom.

1092
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,200
 - Let's just pour some milk in your fucking eyes,

1093
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,280
 get you some lactic acid, you basic bitch.

1094
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,120
 (laughing)

1095
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,720
 - You fucking cereal eating basic bitch.

1096
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,880
 So--

1097
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,800
 - Milk is a basic acid, right?

1098
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,800
 Or is that Beale Street?

1099
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,640
 - Beale Street.

1100
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,480
 - That's Beale Street.

1101
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,560
 - I'm trying not to give you, oh shit, oh fuck, real quick.

1102
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,360
 To derail everything.

1103
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,760
 - That's fine.

1104
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,600
 - Corrections time.

1105
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,680
 - I'm not passionate about talking about my glasses,

1106
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,520
 but that's--

1107
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,840
 - Corrections time.

1108
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,040
 And made me put in a correction.

1109
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,840
 Last episode I claimed that the interstate

1110
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,520
 was designed specifically for truckers.

1111
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,360
 - Uh-huh.

1112
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,920
 - It was in fact specifically designed

1113
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,800
 for the military industrial complex

1114
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,120
 to be able to transport military vehicles more efficiently.

1115
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,360
 First and foremost.

1116
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,200
 The trucking thing was a secondary benefit.

1117
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,520
 - Oh, a side effect was helping the trucking industry.

1118
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,720
 - Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1119
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,840
 - And destroying the train.

1120
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,240
 - And destroying the train bearing monopolies.

1121
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,000
 And yeah, well I mean we have far less children

1122
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,480
 with one leg in this country thanks to that.

1123
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,520
 That's true.

1124
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,000
 More dead ones, but far less maimed kids.

1125
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,840
 - Oh man.

1126
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,440
 - But dead whole kids.

1127
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,840
 - Oh yeah, dead and intact for the most part.

1128
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,800
 Dead in the car, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1129
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,520
 I mean well, I guess how do you judge intact?

1130
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,480
 It's still belted in, does that count?

1131
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,000
 - Yes. - I guess, yeah.

1132
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,960
 - It depends. - Blood on the freeway.

1133
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,240
 - If it's a really tender chicken,

1134
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,560
 you can like pull the leg out.

1135
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,480
 I don't know, it depends, it depends.

1136
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,760
 - It's done.

1137
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,760
 - Oh, you just jarred another thing from me, Matt.

1138
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,760
 - Let's do it, let's keep going.

1139
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,600
 We're on fire.

1140
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,720
 - Guess what I did this week?

1141
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,000
 - Yes.

1142
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,840
 - What?

1143
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,240
 - I made chicken and dumplings.

1144
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:13,120
 - Yeah.

1145
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:13,960
 - Out of a can?

1146
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,080
 You made chicken and dumplings?

1147
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,240
 - Nope, nope.

1148
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,000
 I'm learning, I'm learning.

1149
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,120
 - Okay.

1150
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:20,960
 - This was--

1151
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,960
 - Did you use a cooking pot?

1152
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,800
 - Yes.

1153
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,120
 This was a six or a seven, I would say.

1154
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,400
 Six, seven.

1155
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,600
 - Six, seven.

1156
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,120
 - I did not hit it out of the park like I'd hoped,

1157
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,920
 but I'm going to change up my recipe.

1158
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,080
 - Your first attempt.

1159
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,600
 - First attempt, yes, yeah.

1160
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,440
 I'm pretty happy.

1161
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,440
 - Myra wants to know, did you use a Dutch oven?

1162
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,440
 - No, just a big pot.

1163
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,880
 No vegetables are added in my--

1164
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,440
 - I just farted directly in Anne's face.

1165
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,720
 I didn't hold her under the covers.

1166
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,560
 - No vegetables are added in my--

1167
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,000
 - But Paul says chicken and dumplings.

1168
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,440
 He means chicken and dumplings.

1169
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,280
 - Yeah, that's it.

1170
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,200
 No vegetables, no, no, no.

1171
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,240
 There are plenty of people who do celery and carrots

1172
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,560
 and onions and shit. - Peas.

1173
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,280
 - Peas, peas is a common one, yeah.

1174
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,000
 - Peas, get the fuck out of here.

1175
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,080
 - Yeah, throw some peas in there.

1176
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:03,920
 You don't even taste them.

1177
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,760
 - Disgusting.

1178
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,600
 No, no, no.

1179
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,440
 So we bought a bunch of--

1180
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,000
 - It's like a football ball in your soup.

1181
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,360
 - Yeah, it's delightful.

1182
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:14,040
 We had a bunch of chicken from Costco, which was--

1183
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,160
 - You're making a gesture with your hands

1184
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,280
 like you're holding a shotgun.

1185
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,960
 What did you buy a chicken in?

1186
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,800
 What form of chicken-- - It was in a sack.

1187
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,640
 It was in a sack.

1188
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:25,640
 It was de-boned rotisserie chicken in a sack.

1189
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,200
 - Paul would show you the sack,

1190
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,760
 but it's currently holding up his laptop.

1191
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,760
 - Wait, that sounds, wait, who sells de-boned,

1192
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:31,960
 how does one get de-boned chicken in a sack?

1193
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,800
 - At Costco. - Really?

1194
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,640
 I didn't even eat the chicken.

1195
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,360
 - Yeah, it's like shredded chicken in a bag.

1196
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,200
 - I didn't really get it de-boned.

1197
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,800
 - Jacob knows exactly what I'm talking about.

1198
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,640
 - I do.

1199
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,560
 - Just because I don't doesn't mean I'm accusatory.

1200
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,400
 I can learn too.

1201
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,360
 You're learning, I'm learning.

1202
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,080
 - You son of a bitch.

1203
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,480
 - I bought sack chicken from the Costco.

1204
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,720
 - You come on down to Beale Street,

1205
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,240
 we all settle this man to man.

1206
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,840
 - We're gonna settle this up right here.

1207
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,760
 Who's eating who's chicken?

1208
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:55,720
 Dr. John?

1209
00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:00,600
 - That person speaking, Aaron Burr.

1210
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,440
 - Aaron Burr.

1211
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,920
 We had this chicken and it was gonna go,

1212
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,000
 it was gonna go south in about a week.

1213
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,240
 So I needed to put some pedal to the metal.

1214
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,520
 - It's gonna go south of mustard.

1215
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,520
 - I went online and I watched several how-to videos

1216
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:23,160
 on YouTube until I watched, until I saw stuff

1217
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,360
 that the end result was consistent with visually

1218
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:30,080
 what I recalled from my grandmother eating.

1219
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,960
 So I was like, okay, that's the one I'm going with.

1220
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,600
 So it was very simple.

1221
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:38,600
 I put in an egg, flour, egg, little bit of chicken broth,

1222
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,320
 that's it, mushed it up into a dough.

1223
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,160
 - For the dumplings.

1224
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,200
 - For the dumplings.

1225
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,600
 Mushed it up into a dough, added flour as needed,

1226
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,720
 rolled it out half the end.

1227
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,200
 - Oh, I was gonna ask you if you rolled it out

1228
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,240
 or if you did like the dumpling ball.

1229
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,080
 - No, I rolled it out, we do the flats.

1230
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,360
 - I'm very impressed.

1231
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,680
 - I went to a comic book shop and Paul is rolling

1232
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,520
 out his own dough.

1233
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,840
 It is a new day, it's a shiny new day here.

1234
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,360
 - We're getting old, we're getting old,

1235
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,280
 we're running out of things to do on the planet.

1236
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,440
 - I've been sober for a day and a half.

1237
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,280
 - Holy shit.

1238
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,120
 - It's a weird world, it's a weird crazy world.

1239
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,280
 - It's a weird world.

1240
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,400
 - This is a very weird time.

1241
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,280
 - I haven't been sober for a day and a half.

1242
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,600
 (laughing)

1243
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,440
 - Getting carried away.

1244
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,760
 - Cut up the dumplings, had a whole lot of dumplings,

1245
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,760
 it was really great.

1246
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,360
 The two things that probably came up short

1247
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,920
 were the chicken and the stock.

1248
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,520
 So I got just box stock, right?

1249
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,360
 - Gotcha.

1250
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,040
 - In the future.

1251
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,040
 - Oh yeah, you gotta season up.

1252
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,360
 You can do the box stock, but you gotta season up

1253
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,200
 the box stock a little bit.

1254
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,720
 - I seasoned it up, but I didn't season it up enough.

1255
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,040
 But I think in the future, the trick is just straight up,

1256
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:47,480
 make your own stock, boil bone-in chicken

1257
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:51,000
 until it falls off the bone of a couple of pieces,

1258
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,120
 clear out the bones, chunk up the chicken,

1259
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:56,200
 take out the chicken, and you've got the stock.

1260
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,040
 Maybe add a bouillon, I saw another recipe.

1261
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,880
 - No, no, keep the bones going.

1262
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,040
 Take the chicken off the bones and then keep the bones

1263
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:07,320
 there, let 'em really-- - And keep 'em really going.

1264
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,400
 You can even break 'em, break the bones up.

1265
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,160
 - Get the marrow out for a little while.

1266
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,880
 Yeah, or add a little bouillon.

1267
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,920
 I saw another recipe, added cream of chicken soup.

1268
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,080
 - Eisenhower used the bones of children

1269
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,760
 that died making trains.

1270
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,600
 - Yeah, yeah.

1271
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,160
 - That's how my grandma used to make chicken and dumplings,

1272
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,200
 and it's honestly the best way.

1273
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,440
 - Train baby gravy is the primary way--

1274
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,800
 - Train baby gravy!

1275
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,880
 - Is the primary way to eat chicken and dumplings,

1276
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:38,680
 but I didn't have the things available to me at hand.

1277
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,920
 - I still say that's James Taylor's best song.

1278
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,160

1296
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,120
 that I'm afraid the elites have stolen from us.

1297
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,720
 Besides our future and our hope,

1298
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,560
 they've also stole the ability.

1299
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,320
 They've stole the ability to really make fun jokes

1300
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:47,080
 about eating babies, because now it's just a stark reality.

1301
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,520
 (laughing)

1302
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,680
 There was a time when dead baby jokes

1303
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,640
 ruled the playground for kids.

1304
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,800
 Nowadays, it's just like, whoa, who are you trying to be?

1305
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:58,960
 Elon Musk?

1306
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,680
 Yeah, oh boy.

1307
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,520
 Anyway.

1308
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,880
 - How do you fit 10,000 dead babies into a phone booth?

1309
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,360
 You give 'em to the elites, they'll figure it out.

1310
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,560
 - That's how you do it.

1311
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,640
 You figure it out real fuckin' quick.

1312
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,880
 - Oh, I also have a piece of side note business

1313
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,040
 popped into my head.

1314
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:15,880
 - Okay, okay.

1315
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,160
 - We had one of our scoops right on Patreon.

1316
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:22,160
 I don't get the Angry Goose joke.

1317
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,400
 Someone explain it to me.

1318
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,640
 And I just thought I should maybe also explain it on air.

1319
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,400
 'Cause we're making it in reference to Fisto

1320
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,000
 from Masters of the Universe.

1321
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,640
 And I didn't know this until, I guess,

1322
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,760
 you can hear early episodes of us learning this, basically.

1323
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,760
 But in the actual sex act of fisting,

1324
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,800
 you don't actually make a fist.

1325
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,960
 You don't just punch someone's butthole.

1326
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:50,960
 (laughing)

1327
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,320
 - I mean, unless they've asked for that.

1328
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,800
 - I'm just saying, there might be people out there

1329
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,560
 making mistakes.

1330
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:02,800
 - Making mistakes or just granting wishes.

1331
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:03,640
 - Yeah.

1332
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:04,480
 - Sure, sure.

1333
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,160
 Featured on a bug, maybe.

1334
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,040
 - Put the Paul Mattingly biography.

1335
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,520
 (laughing)

1336
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,120
 - Making mistakes and granting wishes.

1337
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,840
 - Yeah, making mistakes and granting wishes.

1338
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,280
 The Paul Mattingly story.

1339
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,320
 - A lid for every pot, a fist for every cornhole.

1340
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,640
 - Now, Paul, your camera went out.

1341
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,080
 Is it 'cause your computer fell off the bags?

1342
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,880
 - It's because I'm wiping my nose

1343
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,440
 because it's two degrees in my goddamn basement.

1344
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,640
 My nose is running from the fucking cold.

1345
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,600
 I thought I'd spare our listening audience

1346
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,080
 and viewing audience, me digging for nose goblins.

1347
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,840
 - Now, Bossy and Cham is a good point.

1348
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,280
 He's saying, "Fisting 101" by Matt Donnelly.

1349
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,720
 Yeah, don't let me be the only source on this, okay?

1350
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,560
 Please.

1351
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,400
 I'm not doing--

1352
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,800
 - Do your own research.

1353
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,280
 - I'm not doing a sarcastic Joe Rogan

1354
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,920
 where I give some lunatic a platform for four hours

1355
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,440
 and then say, "Do your own research" at the end.

1356
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,480
 I mean, I really want you to not let me be the only source

1357
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,320
 that you get this from.

1358
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:59,000
 Is that some kind of high women joke?

1359
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,160
 - I don't want you to punch people in the assholes

1360
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,840
 and I don't want you to use me as your only fisting source.

1361
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:04,960
 - That's right.

1362
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,320
 But you actually form your fisters into a point

1363
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,160
 as if you're like pinching up--

1364
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,440
 - Well, if you see many of the sex toys

1365
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:15,440
 that are sold as fisty, they are that same thing.

1366
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,080
 They are like somebody's getting ready to--

1367
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,880
 - You make a cone, a cone of fingers.

1368
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,720
 - It's basically prekermit.

1369
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,800
 - Prekermit, yeah, yeah.

1370
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,360
 - So if someone says prekermit, my butthole,

1371
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,800
 we're talking about the same thing.

1372
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,720
 (laughing)

1373
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,880
 - You know, you can still get pregnant from prekermit.

1374
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,240
 (laughing)

1375
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,440
 I heard that was a myth.

1376
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,400
 - No, it's not a myth, buddy.

1377
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,800
 - Oh, I heard it's a myth.

1378
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,960
 (laughing)

1379
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,160
 - That's how, look, Paul's only nine months apart

1380
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,080
 from his brother, believe me, you can get pregnant

1381
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,160
 from prekermit. - You can get pregnant

1382
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,400
 from prekermit, for fucking sure.

1383
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,240
 10 and a half months, that's right.

1384
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,200
 - I thought it was eight and a half.

1385
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,720
 - 10 and a half, razor close.

1386
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,960
 (laughing)

1387
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,280
 - So yeah, angry goose is referring to the actual shape

1388
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,000
 you make when one fists another person.

1389
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,120
 - Right.

1390
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,280
 - I just wanna make sure that we're all caught up.

1391
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,120
 And-- - It's pump at hand.

1392
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,520
 - And-- - Inside joke explained.

1393
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,360
 - And it's been a while since you've explained--

1394
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,520
 - That's a literal inside joke.

1395
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,720
 - That the best way that we express gratitude on the show

1396
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,080
 is by saying, fuck you in the face,

1397
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,800
 you dick and tit farmers, of which I am the farmer.

1398
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,320
 And so that's when you get a thank you email

1399
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,720
 from me for signing up for Patreon.

1400
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,800
 That's what that means on the bottom.

1401
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,720
 - We have a wonderful comment here in the chat

1402
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,640
 from Chris Angel has a chimera.

1403
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,040
 As an old queer man, we used to tell a joke

1404
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,720
 back in the '90s, how can you tell if a guy is gay?

1405
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,120
 Ask him to make a fist.

1406
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:39,080
 - Oh, that's great. (laughing)

1407
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,880
 - I like that a lot.

1408
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,000
 - That's great, that's a guy, I had a friend

1409
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,040
 who was a lesbian who was like,

1410
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,920
 listen, girls like to say they're bisexual.

1411
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,640
 And she goes, I just look at their fingernails

1412
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,160
 and be like, no you're not.

1413
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,400
 (laughing)

1414
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,000
 - All good talk.

1415
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:54,960
 - That's a big tell.

1416
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,800
 That's a big tell for sure.

1417
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,640
 - Right there.

1418
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,320
 So yeah, yeah.

1419
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,120
 All right, what do we have?

1420
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,960
 We got some Scoop Mail, Jacob?

1421
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,000
 - Now let's do a little jock versus nerd.

1422
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,120
 - Oh that's it, we already did Scoop Mail.

1423
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:08,960
 We snuck it in.

1424
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,240
 - That's right, yeah, we snuck in.

1425
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,240
 - Ladies and gentlemen, it is time.

1426
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:17,420
 - That angry goose don't speak anywhere.

1427

 ♪ Time for jock versus nerd ♪

1430
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:37,720
 Hello, fabulous face fuckers.

1431
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:41,040
 I wrote this scooperty on Black Friday,

1432
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,640
 which made me think about a gift

1433
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,680
 everyone must have received at least once in their lives,

1434
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,220
 a quote of the day desk calendar.

1435
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:51,520
 You know the kind where there are about 365 pages

1436
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,820
 and you rip them out and each page you have a new quote

1437
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,780
 and you keep on tearing a sheet off every day,

1438
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:00,040
 starting on January 1st until about mid February

1439
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,360
 when you throw it away when nobody is looking.

1440
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:05,440
 Here is a scooperty with some famous quotes of people

1441
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,120
 in the areas you three enjoy.

1442
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,600
 And this is from Psych Scoop.

1443
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,280
 The categories are comedians, magicians,

1444
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,840
 comic books, and sports figures.

1445
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,360
 I'm up first, I'll try magicians 200.

1446
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,700
 - Filthy magicians.

1447
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,680
 - On the subject of pattern,

1448
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,280
 this magician said generally magicians

1449
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,760
 don't know what to say so they say stupid

1450
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,200
 and redundant crap like here, I am holding a red ball.

1451
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:36,240
 I mean, it sounds a lot like Penn.

1452
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,680
 I'm gonna say Penn Jillette.

1453
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,780
 Tell her.

1454
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:42,480
 - Well, you were halfway there.

1455
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,320
 - I was kind of close.

1456
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,160
 - You were very close.

1457
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,360
 - Well, actually, that is the thing.

1458
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,680
 I end up talking to magicians about the whole,

1459
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,480
 once you're not doing the sarcastic teller talks thing.

1460
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:55,920
 But he is one of our greatest living magic minds

1461
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,440
 and I always say that one of the things

1462
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,720
 that makes him such a great magic mind,

1463
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,100
 both Penn and Teller are,

1464
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,320
 we've talked about this, not sentimental.

1465
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:08,080
 If they don't wax poetic or get into things being too,

1466
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:12,280
 whatever, and emotions in any kind of way.

1467
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,000
 So Teller is remarkably practical at magic advice.

1468
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,360
 And that's an example of right there.

1469
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,960
 He's very much about just do this, this sucks,

1470
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,280
 this makes people go, wow, this is deceptive, this isn't.

1471
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:25,520
 He's very clear and bare bones about his magic advice,

1472
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,360
 which is really awesome.

1473
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,560
 - Yeah, nice.

1474
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:29,680
 Matt, you're up.

1475
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,160
 - Magicians, 400 please.

1476
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:34,640
 - This magician said there is nothing worse

1477
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,760
 than good magic at the wrong time.

1478
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,360
 (laughing)

1479
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,480
 - That's a really funny quote.

1480
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,120
 - I don't know who said this.

1481
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,520
 - Copperfield. - But I like that a lot.

1482
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:48,040
 And I really want to know the context of it.

1483
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,760
 - Dude, he's on his way out, huh?

1484
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,400
 - I don't think so.

1485
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,560
 - You don't think so?

1486
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,320
 You don't think they're gonna push him?

1487
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,800
 - Who knows?

1488
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,020
 - I guess there are no consequences for anything anymore.

1489
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:00,860
 I don't fucking know.

1490
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:01,800
 - Well, also, if he's the only one

1491
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,040
 who suffers consequences for this,

1492
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,600
 that'd be really weird too.

1493
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:08,160
 Because basically they were like--

1494
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,400
 - It'd just be him and Bill Gates,

1495
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,880
 so the only two that have gotten anything,

1496
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,640
 any kind of blowback.

1497
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,480
 - Yeah, yeah.

1498
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,160
 - Oh no, I think several of them got blowback.

1499
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,200
 Oh, blowback.

1500
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,840
 - No, but (laughing)

1501
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:18,960
 yikes.

1502
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,920
 - This magician said there is nothing worse

1503
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,760
 than good magic at the wrong time.

1504
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,160
 - I'll just say this on this,

1505
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,840
 just to put the finer point of what I'm getting at,

1506
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,480
 which is that I think he's too much

1507
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,480
 of a non-current celebrity

1508
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,080
 to get too much shit for what's happening.

1509
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,400
 I don't think-- - Outside of Vegas,

1510
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,440
 he's not really-- - Outside of Vegas,

1511
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,760
 I don't think-- - Oh, yes.

1512
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,280
 - People think of as a nostalgic name

1513
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,000
 that recalls to their childhood.

1514
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,600
 It is not like bringing up someone

1515
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,200
 who's operating right now and thriving right now.

1516
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,320
 - Did he ever bring back the Statue of Liberty though?

1517
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,160
 I mean, we never-- - Oh, it's all he does.

1518
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,840
 It's like, we're like, stop, put it away, David.

1519
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,040
 It's the Statue of Liberty here, Statue of Liberty there.

1520
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,400
 Can you just please order?

1521
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,840

 to getting in his private jet

1527
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,240
 and going to his island right now,

1528
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,040
 so it seems like there's really no ramifications happening.

1529
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,880
 - Wait, who's Private Island?

1530
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,080
 - David has his own private island.

1531
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,120
 - Copperfields.

1532
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,720
 - Of course he does.

1533
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,080
 - But that's the whole point.

1534
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,480
 That's why they're, like, that's actually why

1535
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,640
 they were mostly connected,

1536
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:24,600
 and not mostly connected through his--

1537
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,440
 - Oh, they were island friends.

1538
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:27,600
 - Yes.

1539
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,840
 - I suppose, ugh.

1540
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:30,800
 - Like two people with Jeeps

1541
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,360
 doing the weird finger wave at each other?

1542
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,680
 - Two people with Jeeps.

1543
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,240
 Yeah, they'd go over to each other's island,

1544
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,440
 give each other a rubber duck every month.

1545
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,160
 - No, no, no, it was just a weird finger wave.

1546
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,440
 They did a weird finger wave with each other.

1547
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:47,440
 - Anyhow, pass.

1548
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,280
 - Paul.

1549
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:53,320
 Mattingly.

1550
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,560
 Paul Mattingly.

1551
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:55,400
 - Pen.

1552
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,880
 - All right.

1553
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,480
 David Roth.

1554
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,200
 - David Lee Roth?

1555
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,360
 - David Lee Roth.

1556
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,760
 - Amazing.

1557
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,320
 - Yeah.

1558
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,680
 - Hey, you know what, there's nothing worse

1559
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:11,520
 than good magic in the wrong time, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1560
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,840
 - Panama!

1561
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,160
 - Diamond Dave.

1562
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,000
 (laughing)

1563
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,440
 - Bozey, bozey, bozey, bozey, bozey, bozey.

1564
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,760
 - Don't bring out magic in the good times.

1565
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,480
 - Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

1566
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,360
 - Toe time to jump!

1567
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,200
 Paul, you're up.

1568
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,040
 - Get me a coffee and a glazed donut to go.

1569
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,240
 - I'll go with comic books for 200.

1570
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:37,480
 - This comic book figure is known for saying Excelsior.

1571
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:40,640
 - That is none other than Stan "The Man" Lee.

1572
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:45,320
 I am wearing an Excelsior badge on my shirt right now.

1573
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,120
 I have it on my coat.

1574
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:47,960
 I have a little--

1575
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,120
 - That's something that people care about.

1576
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:49,960
 - They do.

1577
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,880
 - I'm doing sports figures for 200.

1578
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:55,520
 Winn questioned about his work at the news conference.

1579
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,880
 This sports figure responded, we talk about practice?

1580
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,480
 - Oh, you're gonna know that.

1581
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:02,320
 - Practice?

1582
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,320
 - That's true.

1583
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,140
 - Yeah.

1584
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:04,980
 - We talk about practice?

1585
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,040
 - You know that.

1586
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,320
 - Coach Mora, baby, Coach Jim Mora.

1587
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:12,000
 Alan Iverson.

1588
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,960
 - Oh, that's the wrong thing.

1589
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:16,440
 Playoffs, I'm thinking playoffs, god damn it.

1590
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,280
 - Oh no.

1591
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,280
 - Playoffs, not practice.

1592
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,160
 - Oh, you went the wrong way.

1593
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,080
 - I went to the wrong press conference.

1594
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,720
 - In your defense, Jacob,

1595
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,120
 people mix up Jim Mora and Alan Iverson all the time.

1596
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,920
 (laughing)

1597
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,120
 - Constantly, all the time.

1598
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,680
 That won't even be the last time on this show

1599
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:34,520
 where it happens.

1600
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:39,520
 - Oh boy, oh boy, give me Comedians for 600.

1601
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,880
 - Let's try it.

1602
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:44,720
 This gone too soon comedian said this

1603
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,840
 after encountering Jacob's favorite waterfowl.

1604
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:51,520
 I find a duck's opinion of me is very much influenced

1605
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,560
 by whether or not I have bread.

1606
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:57,140
 - Oh, shit, I know who this is, I'm picturing it in my mind.

1607
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:00,400
 It is not Steven Wright.

1608
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,560
 - No, you got to go outside and trim--

1609
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,600
 - Mitch Hensburg.

1610
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,440
 - There you go.

1611
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:07,280
 - There you go.

1612
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:10,280
 - Yeah.

1613
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,120
 - Paul.

1614
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:15,120
 - I'll do comic books for 800, I'm gonna shoot the moon.

1615
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,240
 - This superhero said there's always a way

1616
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:20,360
 when the odds are impossible, do the impossible.

1617
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,200
 - Oh.

1618
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:25,200
 - Captain Planet.

1619
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,920
 - No, this is tricky.

1620
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,320
 - The power is yours.

1621
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,960
 - The odds are impossible, do the impossible.

1622
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:35,960
 It sounds like Superman, but it could be a lot,

1623
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,480
 it could be Captain America 2, that's a pass.

1624
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,800
 - Oh, that passes to me.

1625
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:44,240
 That is Howard the Duck.

1626
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,560
 - It definitely sounds like cast or soups.

1627
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:49,040
 - Sure, pass. - It's one of those pass,

1628
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,440
 ultra goody goodies. - Matt.

1629
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:55,240
 - That would be Fisto.

1630
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:57,720
 Pass.

1631
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,080
 Superman.

1632
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:07,080
 - It's me, I'll try comic books for 400.

1633
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:10,200
 - I fell asleep.

1634
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,280
 - This shield bearing comic book hero said

1635
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:16,360
 I'm loyal to nothing, General, except the dream.

1636
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,200
 - There you go.

1637
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,160
 - That is Spider-Man.

1638
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,320
 - Spider-Man, Spider-Man has a web shield.

1639
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,920
 - I'm loyal to nothing except the dream.

1640
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,200
 - He does have a web shield.

1641
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,400
 - That is the crow from the Sandman.

1642
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:33,120
 - That is Brandon Lee's The Crow.

1643
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,760
 - James O'Barr's The Crow.

1644
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:37,600
 - Eric Draven. - Captain America.

1645
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:38,600
 - Eric Draven.

1646
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,440
 - Matt.

1647
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,000
 - I'll do comedians for 800.

1648
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,560
 - This late comedian said cocaine is God's way

1649
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,880
 of saying you make too much money.

1650
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:54,400
 - Oh God, shoot.

1651
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,800
 I know that quote, it's a very good quote.

1652
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,640
 - It is.

1653
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,920
 - Somebody just leapt into my head.

1654
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,160
 I have a guess, but I'm not sure if I'm right or not.

1655
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,080
 - Well. - I'm gonna pass.

1656
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,440
 - Oh shit. - Paul.

1657
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:12,200
 - See, now I'm second guessing myself.

1658
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,040
 - Who are you thinking?

1659
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,600
 - Well, talk us through it, baby, talk us through it.

1660
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,440
 - My first thought was Carlin.

1661
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,600
 - Yeah. - Okay.

1662
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:18,440
 - And then-- - That's my first thought

1663
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:19,760
 as well. - And my second thought

1664
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,280
 was Bill Hicks.

1665
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,880
 - Okay.

1666
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,040
 - And then my third thought was Mark Maron.

1667
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:27,360
 - Oh, wow.

1668
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,560
 I think, yeah, Mark Maron and Carlin.

1669
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:31,400
 - Any one of those.

1670
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,000
 - I think you're both forgetting about Pryor.

1671
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:34,840
 - Oh. - Oh.

1672
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:37,040
 - Yep. - I'll pass

1673
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:39,040
 to let you take that shot, bruh.

1674
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,040
 - No, no, no, I'm passing as well

1675
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,640
 'cause I'm right there with you.

1676
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:46,200
 - Oh my God, it was Robin Williams.

1677
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,800
 Of all the cocaine addles.

1678
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:51,640
 - I was gonna say, so it was Richard Pryor's.

1679
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:52,840
 (laughing)

1680
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:57,240
 - Oh, oh, shots fucking fired.

1681
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,240
 - Stay down, Robin Williams.

1682
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:00,800
 Too good, too long.

1683
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,600
 Paid everybody for every joke you ever told.

1684
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,680
 Oop, oop, oop.

1685
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:06,960
 - On blast.

1686
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,520
 Robin Williams on blast.

1687
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,320
 - Paul, you're up.

1688
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:13,880
 - I will do comic books for 600, please.

1689
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:19,280
 - This superhero said when there seems to be no chance,

1690
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,840
 that's when it counts.

1691
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,640
 - Oh, piss.

1692
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,240
 - Piss man. - Piss man.

1693
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:26,840
 - Piss man.

1694
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:30,320
 - Martin Van Buren is piss man.

1695
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:33,680
 - Seems to be no chance.

1696
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,000
 - When there seems to be no chance, that's when it counts.

1697
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,800
 - See, this is also a very goody two-shoezy.

1698
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:45,120
 This could be like Green Lantern

1699
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:50,200
 or there's another big--

1700
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:55,200
 - No, no, Paul, this was a motivational speech

1701
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:00,600
 given by Lex Luthor in the big Doom house

1702
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,680
 that would fly around and the super friends

1703
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,320
 would have to chase them around.

1704
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:09,680
 - It could be Batman.

1705
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,360
 I'll have to pass.

1706
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:12,320
 - That passes to me.

1707
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,840
 I happen to know this one.

1708
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,800
 It is the Left Wonder Twin.

1709
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:19,480
 The Left Wonder Twin.

1710
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:20,680
 I don't know, pass.

1711
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:21,520
 Matt.

1712
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,600
 - I have no idea.

1713
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:26,840
 - Spider-Man.

1714
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:28,160
 - Spider-Man.

1715
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:32,280
 - His is, there's great--

1716
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,040
 - I just walked through a comic book.

1717
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,000
 I walk into one comic book shop

1718
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,480
 and suddenly the pressure's on to answer these questions.

1719
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,600
 - Tested.

1720
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:43,080
 - Oh yeah, no, that one did come out today.

1721
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,520
 You're absolutely right, sir,

1722
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,400
 to be here on the day that that one came out

1723
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,200
 that you just came in and asked about.

1724
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,680
 - I swear it's a coincidence.

1725
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,880
 - It's not, you're a nerd, you're one of us.

1726
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:57,000
 - Well and the thing is they also probably had 40 copies.

1727
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,280
 - They did have a lot of copies.

1728
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,640
 - It sounded like fucking hotcakes.

1729
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,560
 - I don't think they had 40, but they had a lot of copies.

1730
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,720
 - It's my turn and I just accidentally clicked on a question.

1731
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,360
 I don't know which one I clicked on.

1732
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:10,800
 This hot-headed coach said when my time on Earth is gone

1733
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,640
 and my activities here are past,

1734
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,920
 I want them to bury me upside down

1735
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:17,160
 and my critics can kiss my ass.

1736
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:21,360
 - That's your boy from UNLV, or not UNLV.

1737
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:22,760
 - May, is that Bobby Knight?

1738
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:25,560
 - Is it Bobby Knight or Tarkanian?

1739
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:27,280
 - It's Beale Street.

1740
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,560
 - Beale Street.

1741
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:31,280
 - Is it Bobby Knight or is it Tarkanian?

1742
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,120
 - No, I don't think it's Tark.

1743
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,520
 - I don't think Tark's a kiss my ass guy.

1744
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:36,560
 - It's Bobby Knight.

1745
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,960
 - Tark is the, my friend here

1746
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,680
 is gonna break your legs later.

1747
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,160
 - Yikes.

1748
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,400
 - Yeah, I'll say Bobby Knight.

1749
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,800
 Fuck yeah, it's Bobby Knight.

1750
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,760
 - It's Bobby Knight.

1751
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:49,600
 - Which one was that?

1752
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:53,080
 That was sports figures for 600 maybe?

1753
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,520
 - Yep, score check, Jacob.

1754
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:58,960
 - Let's see, Matt and I are both tied at 600.

1755
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,080
 Paul has negative 200.

1756
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,040
 And I think there's still two daily doubles left

1757
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,400
 out of the six questions that are left.

1758
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,600
 So anyone's game.

1759
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:07,440
 Matt, you're up.

1760
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,560
 You got comedians, magicians, and sports figures.

1761
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:11,040
 We've burned all the comic books.

1762
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:14,160
 - I'll do sports figures for 400, please.

1763
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,840
 - Let's try it.

1764
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:19,760
 This baseballer said they don't think it be like it is,

1765
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:20,920
 but it do.

1766
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:23,920
 Although many falsely attribute this quote to other players.

1767
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:26,600
 - Oh man.

1768
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,800
 - They don't think it'd be like it is, but it do.

1769
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,120
 - Is this Reggie Jackson?

1770
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:33,280
 Or is this-- - Yogi Berra.

1771
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,120
 - That says this is like Yogi Berra.

1772
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,000
 - It's not, there's no irony in it.

1773
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,720
 So it's not, people falsely quote Yogi for a lot of things,

1774
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,240
 but there's usually an ironic twist.

1775
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:43,520
 - Okay, yeah.

1776
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,000
 This either Daryl Strawberry.

1777
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:51,280
 - I'm gonna be Pancho.

1778
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:53,000
 - Joe Pesci, Bill Cosby.

1779
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,760
 I'll pass.

1780
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,600
 - Paul.

1781
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:01,920
 - Was it Pancho Ponce de Leon?

1782
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:02,760
 - No.

1783
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,960
 - Satchel Paige.

1784
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,760
 - Is that your guess?

1785
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,160
 - Yeah, I'll go with Satchel Paige.

1786
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,140
 - Your guess is Satchel Paige.

1787
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:12,920
 Great.

1788
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,800
 It's Oscar Gamble.

1789
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,840
 - Everyone knows Oscar Gamble.

1790
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,680
 We were just talking about Oscar Gamble,

1791
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:21,160
 the very well-known baseball player.

1792
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:24,440
 - Well, I just Oscar Gamble several points and lost.

1793
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,280
 - You did, you did.

1794
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:30,200
 Satchel Paige, that is a deep baseball poll, sir.

1795
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,160
 Paul, you're up.

1796
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:33,880
 - Not deep enough.

1797
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:38,440
 I'll go with magicians for 800 to get back on the board.

1798
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,760
 - This magician born in the 1800s said

1799
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:44,040
 the personality must be bigger than the prop.

1800
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,840
 - Gotta be Houdini.

1801
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:47,000
 - Who?

1802
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,280
 - Houdini.

1803
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:49,200
 - Who?

1804
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,280
 - Houdini.

1805
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:52,320
 - Harry Blackstone, sir.

1806
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,400
 (laughing)

1807
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:58,640
 - Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

1808
01:09:58,640 --> 01:09:59,840
 - My turn.

1809
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,800
 I'll just try magicians for 600

1810
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,280
 just because Houdini hasn't been an answer yet.

1811
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,120
 - Shit.

1812
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:06,960
 - Daily double.

1813
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,300
 - Oh, boo, boo you.

1814
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:12,960
 There is no official record.

1815
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,840
 - This person whose name is Houdini

1816
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:16,160
 says Houdini things. - Anyone who believes

1817
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:18,120
 in magic is a fool. - My name is Houdini.

1818
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,600
 - But people attribute the quote to him anyway.

1819
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,440
 - I'm Houdini.

1820
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,880
 My name is Mr. Houdini.

1821
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,120
 Said this Houdini.

1822
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:27,320
 - Harry Houdini.

1823
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,520
 Houdini.

1824
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:32,120
 - Boo on you.

1825
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:33,440
 Fuck you.

1826
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:34,280
 (laughing)

1827
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:37,080
 Fuck you, fuck you Houdini.

1828
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,880
 - That worked out so well.

1829
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,400
 Matt, you're up.

1830
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,880
 - Comedians 400.

1831
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,960
 - Daily double.

1832
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:46,960
 - The hits keep coming.

1833
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,720
 - This humorist first said in 1923,

1834
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,240
 I don't drink water.

1835
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,480
 Fish, fucking it.

1836
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:56,200
 - Oh man.

1837
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:59,280
 I am up to date on my 1923 humorists.

1838
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,840
 That's for sure.

1839
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,520
 - Oh, you don't know this one?

1840
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:06,640
 - That's gotta be the cowboy.

1841
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:07,760
 It's the cowboy guy.

1842
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:10,600
 - Will Rogers.

1843
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,680
 - Will Rogers?

1844
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,920
 - It's gotta be Will Rogers.

1845
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:19,080
 (coughing)

1846
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:22,080
 - Yeah, Matt, it's gotta be Will Rogers.

1847
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:26,200
 - I think this would be Harry Blackstone Jr.

1848
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,040
 - That's it.

1849
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:30,000
 - Is it W.C. Fields?

1850
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,680
 - Ooh.

1851
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,320
 Ooh, that's a good guess.

1852
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,720
 - Oh, I'll go with Fields.

1853
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:36,560
 - All right.

1854
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:42,440
 W.C. Motherfucking Fields is correct.

1855
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:45,400
 - Water closet Fields himself.

1856
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:49,000
 - My favorite quote is, again, maybe mis-tributed.

1857
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,320
 I mean, you can find it attributed to different people,

1858
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,080
 but it's, if you wanna make people laugh,

1859
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,200
 dress a guy up like an old lady

1860
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,960
 and push him down the stairs.

1861
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,360
 If you wanna make a comedian laugh,

1862
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:58,000
 push an old lady down the stairs.

1863
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,800
 (laughing)

1864
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,800
 My favorite Fields quote.

1865
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,640
 - Paul, you have negative 1,400.

1866
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:05,840
 Matt and I are both tied at 1,200.

1867
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:09,920
 - Let's get on the board with sports figures for 800, please.

1868
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:10,760
 - All righty.

1869
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:15,360
 This prominent pugilist, poetically proclaimed,

1870
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:16,520
 it's just a job.

1871
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:19,960
 Grass grows, birds fly, waves pound the sand,

1872
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:21,320
 I beat people up.

1873
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,240
 - Okay.

1874
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:27,160
 - I think Matt will agree with me,

1875
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:29,920
 there is only one person that this could possibly be.

1876
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:33,960
 - I mean, Foreman?

1877
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:36,760
 - That's what I would've guessed.

1878
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:39,000
 - Foreman?

1879
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,640
 Like, it's not poetic enough to be Ali.

1880
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,760
 - Okay.

1881
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:49,120
 - And it's too cogent to be Tyson.

1882
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,200
 - Yeah.

1883
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,200
 - Oh yeah, I don't think it's Tyson.

1884
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,640
 I think it's Ali.

1885
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,560
 - Well, I'm going with Foreman.

1886
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:55,400
 - Okay.

1887
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,320
 Muhammad Ali.

1888
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,400
 - Ah, hell!

1889
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,440
 (laughing)

1890
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,240
 Hell and damnation!

1891
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:03,760
 (laughing)

1892
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:07,240
 - I gave you the best hint I could think of giving you, Paul.

1893
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:09,480
 (laughing)

1894
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,800
 - Well, it wasn't good enough.

1895
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,120
 - For the win, I am closing out the category

1896
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:17,360
 and the game, Comedians for 200.

1897
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,360
 This sassy French guard said,

1898
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:22,280
 "I fart in your general direction."

1899
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:24,400
 - No, it has to be the character's name.

1900
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,600
 - Or the person who put in the character's name.

1901
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,840
 French guard, French castle, the number two, yeah.

1902
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,160
 - It's French guard number one

1903
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:38,480
 from Monty Python's Quest for the Holy Grail.

1904
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:39,320
 - That's right.

1905
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:43,080
 - Oh, you wanted the, oh, you did want the actor.

1906
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:44,680
 John, please. - Yes.

1907
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,720
 - Oh, sorry.

1908
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:50,040
 - With that psychological destruction of Jacob, I win.

1909
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:50,880
 (laughing)

1910
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,520
 - Ah, man, got it, 1,200 points.

1911
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:53,360
 I've got 1,000.

1912
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:56,800
 Paul's got negative 2,200, and that's from Psych Scoop.

1913
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,280
 Thank you, Psych Scoop.

1914
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:59,120
 - That was a good one.

1915
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,920
 - Oh yeah, all the others were the comedian names, wasn't it?

1916
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:01,960
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - That's right.

1917
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:06,960
 - I was half joking when I said it, and I feel bad, so.

1918
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,000
 - Don't feel bad.

1919
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,720
 What do you feel bad about?

1920
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:12,680
 - I felt like I accidentally coached you

1921
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:14,680
 into giving the wrong answer on that one,

1922
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:17,480
 and I didn't mean to, I was being a joke, joking to Kev.

1923
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:21,040
 - Oh, no, no, no, I gave the answer I wanted to give.

1924
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,800
 I do enjoy, though, that you feel bad

1925
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,200
 about a jock versus nerd result, though.

1926
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,920
 - Especially, it was 1,200 versus 1,000 points,

1927
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:28,960
 real squeaker.

1928
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:29,800
 - Yeah, yeah.

1929
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,520
 - Yes. (laughing)

1930
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,200
 - A nail-biter to the end.

1931
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,040
 - Yeah, yeah.

1932
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:35,880
 - Thank you, Bossy.

1933
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,360
 Bossy thinks I should get the points.

1934
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:41,280
 Yeah, yeah, I agree, Bossy.

1935
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:42,600
 - He's his own judge, Bossy.

1936
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:43,720
 He gave himself the negative.

1937
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:46,080
 We can't, we can do it all we want.

1938
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:47,520
 He's in control of the points.

1939
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,520
 - No, no, no, I would like to continue under protest.

1940
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,040
 (laughing)

1941
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:54,200
 - I would like to continue with protest over my right hand,

1942
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:57,840
 as my left hand, and I would like to get the points.

1943
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:58,680
 - Fuck you.

1944
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:00,120
 - Ouch!

1945
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:03,560
 - Oh, I want to thank Penn Jillette for being in this podcast.

1946
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:04,400
 - Thanks, Penn.

1947
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,240
 How is Penn?

1948
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:07,280
 We got a health check on Penn?

1949
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,320
 - He's doing good, he's doing good.

1950
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,000
 He is really staying strict to doctor's orders,

1951
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,200
 which surprises no one.

1952
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:14,360
 So he's moving around very little.

1953
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,240
 He just announced this week on Penn Sunday School

1954
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:19,240
 that they will attempt to do, basically,

1955
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:23,800
 some kind of theatrical presentation of Penn

1956
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:27,440
 to resume shows starting February 12th.

1957
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,640
 Penn will be, he doesn't want to go on a wheelchair

1958
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:31,360
 'cause it's too, like, weird.

1959
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,920
 - Oh, no, no, he's gotta do the Axl Rose.

1960
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,160
 - That's it, they're gonna do the--

1961
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,280
 - He's gotta do The Throne.

1962
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,720
 - The Throne, they're gonna do a--

1963
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:41,760
 - Yeah, Axl Rose, Ozzy, yeah, you gotta do The Throne.

1964
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,320
 - And so, that'll be happening there.

1965
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,960
 And so, yeah, that's that.

1966
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:50,400
 - Those will either be the best Penn and Teller shows ever

1967
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,520
 or the worst Penn and Teller shows ever.

1968
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:53,920
 - Right, right.

1969
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,960
 - Those will not be mediocre Penn and Teller shows.

1970
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:58,960
 Those are gonna be ones that you're gonna wanna go see.

1971
01:15:58,960 --> 01:15:59,800
 - Yeah.

1972
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,040
 - If you are a Penn and Teller fan,

1973
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,880
 those are the shows that you wanna go check out

1974
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:03,960
 because that's gonna be limited edition.

1975
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:06,240
 - I just wanna hear, like, three jokes that happen

1976
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:08,920
 from, like, a lack of being able to figure out something,

1977
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:12,200
 you know, like, seeing how many dominoes it pushes.

1978
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:13,320
 - Yeah. - Oh, right.

1979
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:17,840
 - That's what I wanna see, so, yeah, it's gonna be fun.

1980
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,080
 - Oh, yeah, no, it's gonna have some things.

1981
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:20,920
 - Speaking of Penn,

1982
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:23,000
 I wanna thank him for creating this podcast.

1983
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:23,840
