 Visit MyFICO.com/free or download the MyFICO app and take the mystery out of your FICO score.

30
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,880
 I'll get on here and apologize right away.

31
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,440
 Patreon's switch is default, so when I put up a Zoom link to our Patreon members,

32
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,840
 it only went to free members and not to anyone else, and that's my bad.

33
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,520
 You'd think the paid members would be the default.

34
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,840
 It's time for Matt and Maddly's Ice Cream Social.

35
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,920
 Sitting in Port, it's Matt Donnelly.

36
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,320
 Sitting in Pittsburgh, it's Paul Maddly.

37
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,320
 Sitting in Vegas, it's me, Jake and the Audio Guy.

38
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,120
 We're preaching fun.

39
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,600
 Oh yeah, ScooperNovaGirl was just mentioning YouTube doesn't care about swearing anymore,

40
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,960
 and that does seem to be the case.

41
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,560
 They have arbitrarily just changed up the whole thing, and you say,

42
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,320
 "Fuckity, fuck, fuck, fuck, as much as you want."

43
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,000
 Right at the top, doesn't hurt a damn thing.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,320
 Well, then they deliver that fucking ice cream straight to your fucking ear holes.

45
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,280
 Yeah, baby, that's what I'm talking about.

46
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,200
 I'll go back in and edit that.

47
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,240
 Thank you, thank you, thank you.

48
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,680
 Yeah, no problem, no problem.

49
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,320
 Yeah, yeah.

50
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,840
 Paul, how's your eyeball doing?

51
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,400
 Okay, so eyeball update.

52
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,920
 Hold on, I'll play the theme.

53
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,640
 Eyeball update, eyeball update.

54
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,960
 It's a ball in Paul's head that he sees through.

55
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,460
 Hey.

56
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,840
 So, left eye.

57
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,520
 I'm left eye Lisa Lopez, and I went into the...

58
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,680
 So, optometrist is the one to get you your glasses.

59
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,240
 Ophthalmologist is the one that actually looks at your eyes, right?

60
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,000
 Uh, sure.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,040
 Yeah, yeah, let's say yeah.

62
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,520
 Anyway.

63
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,760
 I mean, optometrist also looks at your eyes, I don't know.

64
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,640
 No, no, no, no, no.

65
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,840
 For the sake of this, yeah, let's go.

66
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,320
 Do we really know the answer to this question like in our hearts?

67
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,200
 Optomologist is the one that knows how to really get in there and do the thing.

68
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,760
 Yeah.

69
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,000
 Larry in the chat is saying, "Optomology is surgery."

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,520
 Yeah, so I went to the ophthalmologist.

71
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,560
 According to R.F.K. Jr., you're supposed to see a shaman.

72
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,640
 I don't think your eyes can ever heal until you start having more.

73
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,240
 You need to have a worm in your eye.

74
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,600
 R.F.K. Jr., I wasn't going to bring you in until later.

75
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,320
 In the guest segment of the show, but it's good to have you.

76
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,040
 Yeah, well, I've been watching you guys.

77
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,960
 You got a real, you got really a show here.

78
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,280
 Oh boy, oh boy, what a show.

79
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,760
 I have to say some of your information seems to be

80
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,960
 outdated from what I understand.

81
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,760
 Medical accuracy.

82
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,760
 How many bloodlettings did you do today?

83
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,760
 I personally have 18 leeches on my scrotum right now.

84
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,880
 Yeah, but not for health reasons.

85
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,160
 Well, no, of course not, personal pleasure.

86
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,840
 The Kennedy curse is bald leeches.

87
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:16,400
 I have misunderstood what the Kennedy curse was for years.

88
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,880
 Ever since Chappaquiddick, that's what actually, it's a curse.

89
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,800
 The Chappaquiddick leech, the cat Chappaquiddick ball leech has just come.

90
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,120
 So how's your eye?

91
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:40,000
 Okay, so it hadn't gotten any worse, which is good.

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,040
 Good, good, good.

93
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,360
 Over two days or whatever, the guy looked at it very intently.

94
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,280
 Right eye is fine still.

95
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,240
 The fact that it's only in the one eye,

96
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,280
 it is possible that I have some back and forth blood flow issues.

97
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,000
 So just to be on the safe side, we're going to get that.

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 My whole neck looked at for the veins going back and forth there.

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,560
 Just see if there's any kind of...

100
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,320
 Well, you've always had a great neck.

101
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,440
 It's any kind of occlusion.

102
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,760
 Anyway, we'll see.

103
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,280
 But he doesn't think that's it either.

104
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,760
 He seemed to be very, very positive about it's just probably,

105
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,640
 it's probably just the stress of scoop fest, the extra work, the extra travel,

106
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,560
 all the extra lack of sleep, all that shit, and dehydration, et cetera.

107
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,400
 Then, yeah, and then that's it.

108
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,800
 So it's probably just on its way to Wellsville.

109
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,320
 It's healing up, hopefully.

110
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,080
 But I had all the blood work in the world done.

111
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,840
 I don't have AIDS.

112
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,720
 I don't have syphilis.

113
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,280
 That you know of.

114
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,000
 And I'm not...

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,880
 Not yet.

116
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,840
 You don't have them yet.

117
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,640
 I'm not diabetic.

118
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,760
 Well, that's the case with all those things.

119
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,720
 I'm not diabetic yet.

120
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,240
 I'm not syphilis yet.

121
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,840
 I'm not AIDS yet.

122
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,600
 Yeah.

123
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,880
 We should start to go fund me for Paul to get syphilis.

124
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,680
 Oh, yeah.

125
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,840
 I mean, that doesn't cost that much.

126
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,960
 Couple hundred bucks, right?

127
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,040
 Oh, you're paying a couple of hundred bucks.

128
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,320
 Who's your syphilis guy?

129
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,160
 I can get it for you for half the price.

130
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,720
 You know, it depends on where, what kind of syphilis you want.

131
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,880
 Several different versions.

132
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:21,440
 I got bear syphilis when I was...

133
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,360
 Bear syphilis, simple bear syphilis.

134
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,440
 The disease that comes from a bear.

135
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,680
 I have misunderstood what the candy first was for years.

136
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,280
 I need the bear syphilis.

137
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,040
 Get it from a grizzles.

138
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,760
 Who fucks you and me as you'll get it there.

139
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,640
 All right.

140
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,200
 I'm going to write a musical about RFK Jr. getting bear syphilis.

141
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,920
 That's good.

142
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,800
 Good. Another one.

143
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,600
 You can write another song about getting bear syphilis.

144
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:55,040
 I got the bear syphilis from carrying a bear carcass.

145
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,000
 I thought it would be funny as a joke.

146
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,880
 What an asshole.

147
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,380
 All right.

148
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:05,440
 So, yeah, I go to get my thing looked at in a couple of weeks

149
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,920
 and then I go back to him in like five weeks.

150
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,200
 Oh, but the one thing that was kind of rough during the whole exam,

151
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,280
 the second exam, the follow up.

152
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,480
 Anne was there with me the whole time again.

153
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,120
 She's great as far as follow up.

154
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,680
 Even she got a little squeamish because at the very end,

155
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,080
 he's like, okay, I'm going to press on your eye now.

156
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,560
 It might be a little discomfort.

157
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,800
 Because you don't you've never worn contacts or anything.

158
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,840
 No, no, no.

159
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,600
 So, yeah, so I was like, you know, just jamming on there

160
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,560
 and looking with the thing.

161
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,280
 So that didn't feel wonderful.

162
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,200
 An optometrist told me something when I was a young kid

163
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,960
 first getting contact lenses.

164
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,680
 And it is something that has stuck with me

165
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,720
 and weirdly made me feel better for decades of my life.

166
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,120
 Yeah.

167
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,240
 Which is your eyeball doesn't really feel pain.

168
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,400
 So whatever you're doing, like everything around it,

169
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,640
 there are nerves around it that feel pain and everything.

170
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,120
 Right.

171
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,640
 They're like, yeah, yeah, your eyeball is fine.

172
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,800
 So mess with your eyeball, like touch it, do all the stuff.

173
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,680
 It's just weird and icky, but it is fun.

174
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,560
 It doesn't hurt.

175
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,360
 Yeah.

176
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:07,680
 So.

177
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,320
 Matt's out.

178
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,520
 But my eyes.

179
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:09,920
 Thank you.

180
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,240
 My eyes definitely.

181
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,840
 Not having stick your finger right in there.

182
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,240
 I'm good.

183
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,640
 I'm good.

184
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,760
 So I had him dilated.

185
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,240
 What's the patron level for Matt to poke himself in the eye?

186
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,720
 I had him dilated on Friday twice.

187
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,520
 Scoop pink guy.

188
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:31,840
 And then I had him dilated again yesterday early in the morning.

189
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,920
 So dilating motherfucker.

190
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,360
 I'm definitely like, I'm feeling like, oh, geez.

191
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,040
 So I think the, I don't know.

192
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,040
 Can you, my eyes just feel tired.

193
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,560
 Yeah.

194
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,040
 Yeah.

195
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,080
 My eyes just feel tired.

196
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,000
 I slept as much as I could today.

197
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,960
 And yeah, let me look to do some more sleep as soon as I can.

198
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:59,200
 But, uh, otherwise rock and roll, uh, Viatola, everything seems to be okay.

199
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,040
 So that's good.

200
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,440
 I appreciate everyone's, uh, concern and, uh, I'll keep you updated.

201
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,880
 But, uh, so far, so good.

202
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,640
 Hopefully it's just a, a symptom of a lot of travel and whatnot.

203
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,720
 And I've got a little wheeze going on now.

204
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,000
 I'm, I'm laying down, reading my comic books last night before I go to sleep.

205
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 And I, and I hear this little squeak and I'm like, what is that squeak?

206
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,640
 And it's me.

207
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,400
 That is, and it's coming from your eye.

208
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,840
 That's my life, man.

209
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,600
 That is my tiny little, a tiny little squeak coming out of me.

210
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,600
 Every, at the end of the night, I'm like, what the hell is going on?

211
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,000
 So just a little squeak at the end of my, my breathing.

212
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,840
 There's a small dog trapped inside of you.

213
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,080
 No, at home, I like sleep with my head facing away so that I don't let my like weird,

214
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,120
 weird throat organ, uh, keep my, keep my wife awake.

215
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,840
 It happens all the time.

216
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,080
 I've never thought your throat organ was weird.

217
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,560
 Oh man.

218
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,480
 I mean, and I, my throat organs, but you know,

219
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,120
 best throat organ in the business.

220
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,640
 Yeah.

221
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,840
 So, but, uh, yeah.

222
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,200
 So there's, there's the update.

223
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,800
 How's the boats treating you, Matt?

224
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,280
 Oh man.

225
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,320
 Well, the streak had to come to an end sometime.

226
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,440
 I got on board and was immediately demanded to hand over my knife to security.

227
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
 It did happen.

228
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,320
 Holy shit.

229
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,520
 This is one for the books.

230
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:25,360
 Virgin nicer cabins, stricter about not talking about your creeping fascism.

231
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,640
 And then, uh, that's what I said.

232
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,640
 I thought this boat was about freedom.

233
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,920
 I yelled, no, it's not, it's, it's buffets.

234
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,280
 This boat is about buffets.

235
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,480
 I mean, anything for those passion fruit meringue tarts.

236
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,360
 Here, take my knife.

237
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:39,840
 There he is.

238
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,880
 Uh, yeah.

239
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,480
 So what happened?

240
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,240
 That's a, that's a key part of your act.

241
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,920
 No, no, they give it, they gave it to me for my show.

242
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,960
 So they keep it checked somewhere before, when you're not performing.

243
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,600
 They keep it in the, the, uh, the, the arms, the arms safe, but whatever.

244
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,720
 Do they really lock it up?

245
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,520
 They lock it up.

246
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,000
 Yeah.

247
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,240
 Yeah.

248
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,320
 And then some from security brings it to my show and as soon as my show was over,

249
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,200
 I was like, Hey, I'm here to collect your knife.

250
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,720
 I said, Oh, there you go.

251
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,200
 Is it possible that they are worried about, uh, pirates and boarding parties?

252
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,640
 And they're like, we have to do this.

253
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,640
 It's just the captain's general order.

254
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,800
 Like get, get all of the weapons in case we have to repel boarders.

255
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,760
 They actually said, they said, it's not a policy across the board.

256
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,960
 I said, we ran a background check on you specifically, and we're taking the knife

257
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,560
 away from you is what they said.

258
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,120
 Stop it.

259
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,760
 They did not.

260
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,920
 They did not.

261
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,680
 I don't know what to believe anymore.

262
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,600
 We're through the looking glass here, people.

263
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,320
 I don't know.

264
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,880
 I agree.

265
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,000
 Everything's fucking crazy.

266
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,800
 Have you seen all these fucking AI things that are coming faster?

267
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,440
 Furious now?

268
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,200
 It was coming out of my mouth.

269
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,320
 I was like, wait, this is, this isn't as extreme as this is too real.

270
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,600
 It's too real.

271
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,720
 It's too real, Roy.

272
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,600
 It's too real.

273
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:53,840
 Yeah.

274
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,340
 Yeah.

275
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,600
 Very good.

276
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,160
 That's right.

277
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
 Born in Jersey, hand the knife over pal.

278
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,120
 Yeah.

279
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,440
 Yeah.

280
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,320
 Oh, that makes sense.

281
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,840
 That's a, yeah.

282
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,440
 A cursory background check.

283
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,160
 Born in Jersey.

284
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,240
 Get the first red flag right away.

285
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,720
 First item, first item on the, on the background check.

286
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,560
 They didn't even have to read down the list.

287
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:10,800
 No.

288
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:17,920
 And I had a, uh, we have other magicians here on board, uh, uh, early foolish,

289
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,680
 Kyle and Misty night, a little magic duo.

290
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,120
 Uh, this guy, Tom, follow them on the Insta.

291
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,320
 This guy, Tom Crosby, who fooled Penn and Teller with his Rubik's cube routine.

292
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,480
 Nice.

293
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,680
 Uh, he has a, he, it's one of those things where like, if you knew anything about him

294
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,080
 before he went up, he has a Rubik's cube Twitch channel that's very popular.

295
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,400
 So in terms of guessing whether it was a gimmicked cube or skill,

296
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,440
 had you known about his Twitch channel, you would have guessed skill.

297
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,880
 But he fooled them.

298
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,360
 I remember that.

299
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,600
 He was, he was one of the, he, he went on and fooled them, uh, by just doing it.

300
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,320
 Ultraviolet.

301
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,560
 Yeah.

302
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,920
 He had someone else next to the cube.

303
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,720
 It was ultraviolet.

304
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,800
 He took a flash ultraviolet flashlight to it and then saw the behind his back.

305
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,400
 Yeah.

306
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,480
 And so with the, with the cube, they thought they guessed that basically the cube can light

307
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,600
 up whichever way it wants.

308
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,640
 It can light since, since, since it's the UV thing, you can light it up.

309
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,240
 Therefore it's a right thing.

310
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,760
 So, uh, yeah, technically puzzle cube.

311
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,160
 Good job.

312
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,520
 Scoot shooter.

313
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,280
 Uh, Rubik's cube is a brand name.

314
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:23,600
 Puzzle cube is the, is the term, although most cube people still say Rubik's cube,

315
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,320
 even though almost none of them use an actual Rubik's cube.

316
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,640
 Right.

317
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,680
 Yeah. Actual Rubik's cubes are junky clunky cube.

318
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,120
 Uh, there are so many, uh, more well-made cubes by different companies that people use.

319
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,600
 Yeah.

320
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,760
 Anytime you see somebody like holding it with one hand and like spinning

321
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,520
 just a single plate of it or something like that with their, with their finger real fast,

322
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,680
 that is not a Rubik's brand cube.

323
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,000
 Yeah.

324
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,520
 I remember way back in the day, we got one from rice checks, uh, proofs of purchases.

325
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,440
 Did you ever have a rice checks cube?

326
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,360
 Rice checks cube.

327
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,000
 Yeah.

328
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,800
 No.

329
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,520
 Yeah.

330
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:01,760
 What?

331
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,880
 Rice checks.

332
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,440
 Like the cereal?

333
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,560
 Rice checks did a rice check.

334
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:04,800
 Yeah.

335
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,320
 The cereal that, uh, that we did a mail away rice checks cube and it had like

336
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,200
 rice checks on the stickers and stuff.

337
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,520
 Yeah.

338
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,720
 It was interesting.

339
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,680
 Um, huh.

340
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,920
 Rice checks really got into it, man.

341
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,520
 They even had a doom clone towards the end of their, uh, well, I guess they're still out there,

342
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,960
 but they did a doom clone.

343
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,160
 Uh, for cereal clone.

344
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,200
 Yeah.

345
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,200
 You know, you remember doom, the hot, the hot, hotness, the game.

346
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,440
 Yes.

347
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,320
 Oh, the video game.

348
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:34,560
 Okay.

349
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:34,880
 Yeah.

350
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,840
 The PC game.

351
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,160
 Yes.

352
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,320
 Yeah.

353
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,960
 I remember doom.

354
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,200
 Okay.

355
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,760
 They included a disc on there.

356
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,440
 Uh, there it is.

357
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,480
 Oh, yep.

358
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,360
 It's in the chat now.

359
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,960
 There's the, that's the checks, the checks.

360
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,880
 Uh, oh, you beat me to it.

361
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,360
 Yep.

362
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,320
 And, um, there was a doom clone that they came out with checks quest.

363
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,080
 Checks quest.

364
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,320
 And, uh, that came as like a CD on the packaging.

365
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,440
 There it is.

366
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,240
 There's checks quest.

367
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,560
 Wait, someone in chat is saying my uncle made that game.

368
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,240
 Get out of here.

369
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,600
 What is happening?

370
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:05,920
 James T.

371
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,320
 Scoop.

372
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,080
 James T.

373
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,960
 Scoop is saying that, uh, get out of that for real that your uncle worked on checks quest.

374
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,880
 That's captain James T.

375
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,120
 Scoop.

376
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,240
 Could you unmute yourself?

377
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,880
 Hey, sorry.

378
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,520
 One second.

379
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,680
 We got to get out of my office.

380
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,160
 Oh.

381
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,760
 If she talks about her uncle in her office, she gets, she had to call the cops.

382
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,200
 Yeah.

383
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,720
 I just, they put her right down.

384
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,760
 Um, but yeah, yeah.

385
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,400
 He's uh, well, he's not my uncle anymore.

386
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,840
 He divorced my aunt.

387
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,800
 Um, don't bring up his name at a family reunion.

388
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,520
 I'll just say that.

389
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,680
 I will not.

390
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,400
 Okay.

391
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,040
 Okay.

392
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,960
 But yeah, thank you for the heads up.

393
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:50,160
 Once he invented the checks game, you know, all the power and fame went to his head.

394
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,160
 Even though that's right, that's right.

395
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:59,840
 He's a little nutty, um, according to my dad, but yeah, no, he's my, um, my cousins,

396
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,080
 he's their dad and his son is a big game developer now.

397
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,360
 And yeah, pretty cool.

398
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,040
 That always got me a lot of points with the boys in elementary school.

399
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,560
 So, you know, sure.

400
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,800
 Well, yeah, cause all those, all those boys in elementary school, they were all just hard

401
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,400
 for rice checks all the time.

402
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,600
 They were like, God damn it.

403
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,960
 Give me that rice checks.

404
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:24,080
 Freeware was over to have my dad coming back to me up and be like, yeah, she's down the truth.

405
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,680
 Wow.

406
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,920
 Did you ever get like a special copy or anything?

407
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,120
 Um, no, I don't think so.

408
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,480
 I'll have to ask.

409
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,640
 I'll have to ask my dad, but I don't think so.

410
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,320
 Listen, uh, James D Scoop, don't give away where you keep your private checks,

411
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,080
 memorabilia collection on air.

412
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,160
 No, no, do not.

413
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,920
 It might get robbed by those NFL players.

414
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,280
 Yeah.

415
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,360
 Yeah, fair point.

416
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,880
 I'll have to add my security, you know?

417
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,320
 Well, that's really cool.

418
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,920
 What a small world, huh?

419
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,400
 Yeah.

420
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:56,800
 Yeah.

421
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,520
 It's pretty neat.

422
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,000
 Yeah.

423
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,760
 How, how, how often have you ever bring that up in conversation with people?

424
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,360
 You know, I wish I could say not often, but I have so little that I can brag about.

425
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:17,600
 Also, I wish I could say I brought it up last, Jack's quest was monumental.

426
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,960
 Monumental, I say.

427
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,460
 Yeah.

428
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,640
 I mean, yeah.

429
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,520
 Tall enough people do, um, to have people on related to the guy that made doom.

430
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,720
 I mean, like I said, a lot of people think that's pretty cool.

431
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,680
 So yeah, I'm fairly certain.

432
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:41,440
 I'm 90% sure that might've been the very first free video game

433
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,800
 ever given with a product.

434
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,360
 Oh, interesting.

435
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,160
 Certainly the first free video game given with a cereal.

436
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,080
 I got to believe.

437
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,720
 Well, apparently he wrote a, he wrote a book.

438
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,320
 His name's John Romero.

439
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,760
 And, um, my aunt is.

440
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,160
 Stop it.

441
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,800
 Wait a minute.

442
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,200
 Stop it.

443
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,600
 Stop it.

444
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,480
 Stop it.

445
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,080
 I didn't know who you were talking about.

446
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,040
 John Romero is your uncle?

447
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,600
 Yeah.

448
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,320
 Yeah, man.

449
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,200
 Former uncle.

450
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,360
 Oh fucking look, hold on.

451
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,600
 Oh my God.

452
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,960
 Paul is leaving.

453
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,600
 It'd be great.

454
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,520
 Like if like Paul's chair just backed up like into a wall and like through a wall,

455
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,280
 like Kool-Aid man and then just kept going.

456
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,080
 Paul keeps his ball.

457
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,480
 It's coming.

458
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,400
 Paul keeps his another room.

459
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,640
 He also has a hidden Romero vault.

460
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,520
 Holy crap.

461
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,720
 Don't tell anyone where it is.

462
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,000
 Do you guys have any idea?

463
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,320
 John Romero is the number two guy.

464
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,240
 It's John Carmack and John Romero.

465
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,760
 Wait, John Romero, John Romero is the guy that did the rice checks.

466
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,360
 He did the Rice Checks Tube.

467
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,800
 The Rice Checks thing isn't even.

468
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,960
 He, that's not even, that's not even.

469
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,640
 No, this is, okay.

470
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,080
 This is, this is the book.

471
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,920
 Masters of Doom.

472
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,720
 Oh yeah, that's his book.

473
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,000
 Yeah, my aunt's in there.

474
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:06,880
 So Masters of Doom is all about the incredible success of Romero and Carmack.

475
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,840
 Motherfuckers.

476
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,880
 You guys, fuck you guys.

477
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,960
 Fuck you guys.

478
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:21,520
 John Romero is a seminal, he is a seminal character in video game history at large.

479
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,720
 Oh yeah.

480
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,800
 How do you feel about my first date with my husband?

481
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,360
 Yeah, that's right.

482
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:25,920
 He is.

483
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,360
 He's incredibly important.

484
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,800
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

485
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,280
 He's still.

486
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:29,920
 Oh yeah, you know.

487
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,960
 No, he's one of the more important video game guys that I talk about ever.

488
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,760
 So he finally left Id.

489
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,120
 He left Id kind of early.

490
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,040
 And, um.

491
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,560
 Seems like he has a leaving.

492
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,760
 Am I right, James T. Scoop?

493
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,440
 It does seem to be.

494
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,200
 Well, he started his own thing and he fucked up because his big game,

495
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,320
 Daikatana, was a massive failure.

496
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,920
 They put tons of money into the advertising and everything.

497
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,800
 Even the song.

498
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,320
 Hey, Daikatana, I.

499
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:07,120
 So the, but the big advertising push in many of the print ads was in, you know, in September

500
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,760
 or whenever the game was coming out, John Romero is about to make you his bitch.

501
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,680
 That was, that was, that was the tagline.

502
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,640
 Because he had such cache among first person shooter fans.

503
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,960
 But then the game, the game tanked.

504
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,040
 So were you around when Daikatana came out?

505
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,480
 Was that part of why he left?

506
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,920
 Because the failure of Daikatana, everything went to shit in a relationship

507
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,600
 after he lost all that money.

508
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,480
 Yeah, yeah.

509
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,480
 Well, he, oh gosh, I don't want to speak out of school here.

510
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,520
 I don't want to get like quoted on like BuzzFeed or something.

511
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,240
 Yeah, a lot of national press checking out social.

512
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:50,800
 I think, yeah, the first time he lost all his money is about the time they split.

513
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,080
 So pretty early on.

514
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,640
 Yeah.

515
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,680
 My dad always was, he's just one of those guys who'll lose his money,

516
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,840
 but then he always finds a way to make it back.

517
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,440
 He's out living in Ireland right now with his new wife and kid.

518
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,400
 Yeah, yeah.

519
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,760
 Yeah, he's still, he's still very wealthy guy.

520
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,120
 Oh yeah, oh yeah.

521
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,920
 He's doing all right.

522
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,680
 Yeah, but you're right, he's gained and lost fortunes over the years.

523
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,160
 Oh yes.

524
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,280
 We got a, I almost said email, but we got a mail mail,

525
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,400
 an invitation to a wedding in Ireland from Sarah Buren,

526
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,080
 who has been a longtime listener and apparently is getting married in Ireland.

527
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,520
 So we should go get married and see Sarah in Ireland

528
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,320
 and go visit with your previous uncle.

529
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,320
 Yeah, that sounds great.

530
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,360
 Yeah, why not?

531
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,560
 Oh, the wedding is in, oh, it's coming up.

532
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,520
 It's at the end of November.

533
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,020
 Okay.

534
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,680
 Probably too late to rally it out.

535
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,240
 We could have stayed at John Romero's house.

536
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,760
 Ridiculous.

537
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,320
 Well, that is absolutely fascinating.

538
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,600
 I had no idea, I had no idea.

539
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,120
 Yeah, no, it's really fascinating.

540
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,160
 Yeah, and so, and my husband, he's a software engineer and he,

541
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,640
 you know, works on the side, makes the games.

542
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,080
 He's developing an app right now.

543
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,640
 And so he and my cousin, Michael, John's son,

544
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,120
 you know, they, yeah, they talk about stuff and, you know, anyway.

545
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,960
 So they're pals.

546
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,480
 So, yeah, yeah.

547
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,320
 Yeah. Oh, that's wonderful.

548
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,840
 Did the same guy make the game Quake?

549
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,380
 Yeah.

550
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:22,400
 I don't know if, I don't know if Romero, I guess, I think he was,

551
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,440
 yeah, he was on with Quake.

552
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

553
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,800
 I just, I mean, I just looked him up and it says, it says Quake.

554
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,920
 Yeah, yeah, he was on with Quake.

555
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,120
 Yeah. Great.

556
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,640
 I mean, yeah, full disclosure, like, I mean, I don't know John,

557
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,000
 very like really at all, but mostly his sons, you know, but yeah, yeah, it's fun.

558
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,200
 But that's so funny though that you're related to the guy who made the Chex Cube.

559
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,700
 Yeah.

560
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:51,520
 So even though he's not actually part of the family anymore,

561
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,080
 I assume that you're going to get that sweet Chex Cube money

562
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,720
 passed down to you when he dies.

563
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,840
 I guess it's time to come clean.

564
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,600
 I'm not here as a cruise ship entertainer.

565
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,720
 This is my cruise ship.

566
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,680
 I'm on my own ship.

567
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:08,400
 Which makes the knife thing even weirder.

568
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,720
 Excuse me.

569
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,240
 Yeah, I took it.

570
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,240
 Oh, Matt and I sound exactly the same.

571
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,400
 No, I just coughed all the time.

572
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,280
 It's miserable here.

573
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,680
 I'm in St. John, New Brunswick and it is just.

574
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,040
 Overcast, dreary.

575
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,760
 It's dreary.

576
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,560
 Oh yeah.

577
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,360
 This is the storm because we're sitting right on top of everything.

578
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,000
 And so it just makes my whole face blow up.

579
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,960
 Captain James D. Scoop, thank you for telling us about your previous family.

580
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,600
 Thank you, Captain.

581
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,560
 That was awesome.

582
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,440
 Yeah, thanks guys.

583
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,160
 Next time I see you in person, I can tell you some stories

584
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,920
 I don't want to say while being recorded.

585
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,800
 Fantastic.

586
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,120
 That's awesome.

587
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,680
 Thank you.

588
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,280
 I'll tell you who else Captain James D. Scoop is going to tell stories about

589
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,120
 next time she sees us in person.

590
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,800
 And that is the following sponsor.

591
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,800
 Today's show, Matt and Madeline's Ice Cream Social is brought to you by...

592
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,840
 Come on, internet machine.

593
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,960
 Go, go, buddy.

594
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,460
 Oh no.

595
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:14,320
 Brought to you by Dirty Diana's New Jersey Diner.

596
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:14,720
 That's right.

597
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,960
 That's Dirty Diana's New Jersey Diner from Ranch Ham in 2022.

598
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,040
 Do, do, do.

599
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,560
 She wants some french fries with cheese but she ain't willing to pay.

600
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,320
 She's pretty hungry, you know.

601
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,080
 She ain't ain't nothing today.

602
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,600
 She's gonna step right on in and get herself a plate.

603
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,360
 She's really hungry, you know.

604
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,040
 This girl, she will not wait.

605
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,040
 She says, "What pies do you have?"

606
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,800
 They say, "Apple and peach."

607
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,480
 She says, "That will do."

608
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,240
 "Give me one slice of each."

609
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,440
 "Can I also get an order of fries and cheese?"

610
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,120
 They say, "We don't serve that."

611
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,040
 "And she got on her knees."

612
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,360
 "Dirty Diner Diana."

613
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,320
 "Yuck."

614
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,320
 "This floor is gross."

615
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,200
 "Ick."

616
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
 "This floor's disgusting."

617
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,920
 "Gross."

618
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,440
 "Why did I kneel down?"

619
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,960
 "Get it clean."

620
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,720
 And her hay scoop's a check out.

621
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,720
 Yeah, I'm not gonna be able to rhyme that better again.

622
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,920
 The worst part of that song is the end of that song when she realizes that even after

623
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,120
 she did all that, they don't have any other flavors of pie.

624
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,680
 No, that was it.

625
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,960
 She got her two flavors though.

626
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,240
 She got one slice of each.

627
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,120
 She got those two, yeah.

628
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,800
 Yeah, that was good.

629
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,680
 That turned out good.

630
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,560
 "Dirty Diner Diana."

631
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,280
 That was good.

632
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,160
 I made those rhymes.

633
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,800
 It ended well.

634
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,440
 I'm very happy.

635
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,720
 Very happy, yeah.

636
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:30,880
 Good.

637
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:38,320
 And you killed it before I could ruin it, which is good.

638
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,400
 Yeah, 'cause if I went further, it would have gotten weird.

639
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,120
 But it's still good.

640
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:48,080
 Speaking of throat organs, I went and saw Paul McCartney this week.

641
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,200
 Oh my God.

642
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,240
 I went and saw Beetle perform this week.

643
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,760
 It is a whole fucking thing.

644
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,560
 How did he do?

645
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,720
 He is really good at that.

646
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,240
 He's still really good at doing the whole thing.

647
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:02,640
 Yeah, yeah.

648
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,560
 Yeah, the whole putting on a show and singing and talking and doing the whole thing.

649
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,200
 He's had a minute or two.

650
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,720
 It's like he has practiced, and he's very, very good.

651
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,480
 Did you get graced with the double Beetle shot?

652
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,160
 Did Ringo pop in "Secret" on this one?

653
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,840
 No, Ringo wasn't in town.

654
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,520
 He was in town the week before, and I was hoping that he would stick around and make

655
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,200
 an appearance, but it didn't look like he did.

656
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:31,200
 So yeah, no special guest, but holy fuck was the show good.

657
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,840
 They had audience cameras and everything.

658
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,440
 At one point, the camera stopped on somebody in the audience, and Paul was talking to them,

659
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,040
 and they had a sign that said that they had seen the Beatles at Shea Stadium in 1965.

660
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,800
 Okay, that's pretty cool.

661
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,160
 He's like, "Wait, you really saw us in 1965 at Shea Stadium?"

662
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,160
 And she's like, "Yeah, I fucking well did."

663
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:59,760
 It was so crazy, the number of people that were there, what it meant to everyone.

664
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,640
 I took my mom.

665
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,240
 My mom came in town, and so she came in town to see the Beatles.

666
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,920
 Yeah, I mean, it meant a lot to her.

667
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,720
 It meant a lot to me.

668
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,800
 It meant a lot to everybody around us.

669
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,280
 Yeah, it was so fucking cool.

670
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,360
 It'd be like John Romero showing up to my house.

671
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,520
 It would be exactly like that.

672
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,040
 Hey, Dicatana, hi.

673
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,200
 Hey, Paul McCartney Singh, hey, Dicatana.

674
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,240
 I mean, you talk about...

675
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,720
 I kept yelling it out.

676
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,080
 I kept yelling it out as a request.

677
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,160
 McCartney's version of Dicatana.

678
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,520
 No, but you talk about a seminal creator.

679
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:39,920
 There you go.

680
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:45,360
 Dicam, how big was your "I have cancer" sign, will you please say, "Oh, blah dee, oh, blah da."

681
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,800
 It was roughly the size of a Sherry's Berry.

682
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,680
 It was enormous.

683
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,200
 A Sherry's Berry.

684
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,800
 Holy shit.

685
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,720
 Paul McCartney did...

686
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,280
 Because there were signs in the audience, and he, I thought, did something very smart,

687
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,360
 which was he addressed the signs and then people would put them down.

688
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,240
 That's nice.

689
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:06,720
 Yeah, that's smart.

690
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,040
 Yeah, so he did like five minutes between two songs early on.

691
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,640
 He was like, "Oh, we got some signs out here.

692
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,360
 Let's see what they say."

693
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,280
 And he'd go through a couple of them.

694
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,440
 And then when he was done with them, they'd put them down.

695
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,600
 There was one person towards the front holding up a large piece of cardboard.

696
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,200
 And all it said was, "Paul McCartney saved my life.

697
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,480
 Can I have a hug?"

698
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:28,960
 Oh, my God.

699
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,280
 And that was one that he did not acknowledge.

700
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,800
 Of course, because no, because no, buddy, sorry.

701
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,760
 Because the answer, I'm sorry, is just probably not.

702
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,280
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

703
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,640
 Was there one song that he performed that really put you over the moon

704
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,120
 or one that you were surprised that he was belting out?

705
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,160
 Oh, you know, he's 83, I think.

706
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,080
 Before we move on, I'm skeptical, by the way.

707
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,480
 I don't think that Paul McCartney saved that guy's life at all.

708
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,000
 I don't think he did anything.

709
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,960
 What do you mean?

710
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,040
 I mean, I think he just was, by coincidence, this song maybe meant something to the guy

711
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,520
 before he maybe was going to jump off a bridge or something.

712
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,520
 But I don't think Paul McCartney specifically...

713
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,320
 You don't think that renowned neurosurgeon Paul McCartney might have saved that guy's life?

714
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,040
 You're close.

715
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,160
 You're close, Paul.

716
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,320
 Actually, the guy in the audience I did, I got to speak to him, he was confused.

717
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,200
 It turned out John Lennon jumped in front of a bullet mitt for that guy.

718
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,520
 And then he thought it was Paul McCartney this whole time.

719
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,000
 And I was like, "No, that actually killed John Lennon."

720
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,960
 The bullet mitt for you did kill John Lennon.

721
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,880
 It'd be really funny if he really did have a doctor named Paul McCartney who helped his brain,

722
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,600
 but then he mistakenly thought it was the other guy.

723
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,080
 Like halfway through the concert, he maybe puts a sign down.

724
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,400
 I was like, "Wait, it can't be the same Paul McCartney."

725
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,720
 This guy doesn't look anything like the guy that saved my life.

726
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,000
 This is a different guy.

727
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,080
 I paid so much money for these tickets.

728
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,600
 I don't think this is the same guy at all.

729
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,720
 I feel foolish, this piece of cardboard.

730
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,520
 I feel foolish.

731
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,160
 I mean, this is a nice song and everything, but this is not what I'm here for.

732
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,520
 I was here to give thanks to the person that saved my life.

733
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,200
 Who cut a brain tumor out of my skull.

734
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,240
 And I wanted to give that person a hug.

735
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,480
 This person doesn't want to hug me at all.

736
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,880
 If anybody has a chance to go see this McCartney tour now, you would highly recommend them?

737
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,640
 Oh, yes.

738
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,080
 Oh yeah, it's the Got Back Tour.

739
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,160
 There was so much going on.

740
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,680
 Is Sir Mix-A-Lot opening for him?

741
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,560
 Sir Mix-A-Lot is not opening for him.

742
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,000
 That's a missed opportunity.

743
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,120
 That is, I agree.

744
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,920
 Baby got back.

745
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,280
 Yes!

746
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,040
 You can do side bends or sit-ups.

747
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,840
 Please do actually.

748
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,080
 Keep your body active as he gets older if you want to keep that blood flow going.

749
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,480
 You are an octogenarian.

750
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,160
 You should do side bends and sit-ups.

751
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,160
 I engage in a lot of Tai Chi.

752
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,600
 I got an afternoon over at the park.

753
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,800
 I got pool aerobics.

754
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:02,960
 It's pretty great.

755
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,560
 Keeps my ass in shape.

756
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,360
 I walk every day.

757
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,600
 4,000 steps a day.

758
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,920
 I know that isn't 10,000, but it's still pretty good.

759
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,800
 Baby does bends.

760
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,600
 Baby's got steps.

761
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,160
 I'm in the barbers club.

762
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:25,840
 So I think I mentioned to you guys that on my greatest day ever last week,

763
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:31,200
 I ended up buying that Rock Band 360 controller that I've been looking for.

764
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:37,360
 So I finally got a chance to test it and, Jacob, you'll be happy to know,

765
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,160
 my first game I wanted to test it with was Rock Band Beatles.

766
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,000
 Yeah, you talked about that last week.

767
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,600
 Because I love that game and I love the art style of it and everything.

768
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,880
 So I get my old 360 going.

769
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,560
 Hadn't turned it on in probably a year.

770
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,040
 Turned on my 360.

771
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,320
 Opened it up.

772
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,440
 Put a disc in the tray.

773
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,080
 Closed it up.

774
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,920
 It goes, man, man, man.

775
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,640
 And then it just says open tray.

776
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,080
 And I'm like, oh, no, that seems like a bad sign.

777
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,800
 It was a bad sign.

778
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,360
 So I pressed it and opened it up and I tried it again.

779
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,440
 And man, man, man, nothing.

780
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,880
 So my 360 isn't reading discs.

781
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,120
 And I'm like, fuck, I got like 200 discs sitting here for my 360.

782
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,880
 That's the one system I've kept.

783
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,200
 I would like my games to still be able to run.

784
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,320
 So I'm like, oh, shit.

785
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:29,840
 So I started getting really sad because not only was I like, well, you know, all my 360

786
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,360
 games aren't working, but now I'm going to have to go through all the hassle of returning

787
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,160
 this guitar.

788
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:39,840
 I don't really know if it doesn't work or what, but I don't know how people existed

789
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,960
 before the advent of YouTube, honestly.

790
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:49,760
 So I go on YouTube and I look up this very specific malady going on with my 360.

791
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,200
 And a short pops up and a guy does exactly what I did, gets that same error message,

792
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,840
 open tray.

793
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,400
 He puts it back in as the disc is going back in.

794
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:05,120
 He just reaches up on the top of the system, goes back, back, back.

795
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:11,200
 Oh, and then sure enough, sure enough, he just hit the top of the thing on the top

796
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,000
 of the system.

797
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,800
 And then sure enough, it reads the disc and he plays the game.

798
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,520
 And I'm like, well, I don't know.

799
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,000
 I don't want to be beaten on my system necessarily.

800
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,440
 But I, but I do know like PS ones, old PS one models, you had to flip them over and

801
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,000
 run them upside down to actually get them to read after a while.

802
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,080
 And when they got old, huh, that was a fix.

803
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,720
 So I was like, all right.

804
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:37,200
 Well, so I looked again, the next one that came up, same error message, same thing.

805
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,200
 Guy goes back, back, back and starts to read it.

806
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,120
 I'm like, all right, fuck it.

807
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,400
 What have I got to lose?

808
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,240
 I do the thing.

809
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,920
 I put it in back, back, back.

810
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,400
 Fires it right up.

811
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,160
 My fucking controller works with it.

812
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,240
 I played a perfect round.

813
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:59,520
 So the controller is very responsive for a, you know, 15 year old piece of plastic

814
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,920
 hardware that could easily get fucked up.

815
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,440
 I'm like, yeah, this fucking works.

816
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:03,920
 This is great.

817
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,040
 I was really happy.

818
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,600
 Got to watch my, uh, you know, the Beatles animation and all that, which is really,

819
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,400
 really cool.

820
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:16,080
 So I played a couple of Beatles songs with my new Fender Stratocaster and, uh, I was

821
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,680
 just, uh, I was just over the moon.

822
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,880
 But, uh, yeah, I had to fucking Fonz my 360.

823
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,760
 Just bam, bam, bam.

824
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,840
 Yeah, got it.

825
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:29,440
 Yeah, uh, time to mod it up and get those discs.

826
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:29,920
 Oh, yeah.

827
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,560
 Yeah.

828
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,920
 No, if your dog starts feeling bad and, uh, you're going to take it to the vet to

829
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,960
 have it put down, try to hit it on top of the head a few times.

830
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,320
 I tried that with pirate.

831
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,760
 Maybe that was what, uh, brought up.

832
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,800
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

833
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,280
 Uh, no, dog dogs are doing really good.

834
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,080
 Thankfully.

835
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:54,640
 Although I don't know what the fuck happened last night and gets up.

836
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,600
 She has to go in early every, every fucking day.

837
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,120
 It's something new with this place with her.

838
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,320
 She's getting called in early.

839
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,480
 So she goes to let the dogs out at like four in the morning.

840
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,600
 It was Ann.

841
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,720
 Well, no one had yet.

842
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,160
 That was why she had to do it.

843
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,200
 I don't know what the fuck was in the yard, but it ran over the fence.

844
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,840
 She heard crazy commotion.

845
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:22,000
 It had knocked over and bent the bird feeder.

846
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,280
 I think it was a big fat raccoon, but Ann thinks it might've been a bear.

847
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,280
 Who the fuck knows?

848
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,160
 Bear?

849
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,640
 A raccoon did not bend the bird feeder.

850
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,400
 Then it could have been.

851
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,680
 You have like a metal pole on the.

852
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,440
 It has a big metal pole, right?

853
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:35,920
 Big metal pole.

854
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,200
 A raccoon didn't bend that.

855
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,160
 So yeah, it might've been.

856
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,520
 Bear is what I was thinking.

857
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,400
 It might've been a bear, but the dogs went and chased the bear.

858
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,160
 Oh, hello.

859
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,440
 I love this yard.

860
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,660
 Yeah.

861
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:57,760
 You know, if you invited him over, he'd have been probably nice enough to give you the syphilis.

862
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:04,160
 If you ask him, you know, just say, please, can I have your bear syphilis?

863
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,960
 He'll do it.

864
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,640
 I would've given it to.

865
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,440
 I want that bear syphilis.

866
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,280
 Give me your bear syphilis.

867
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,280
 So anyway, yeah, who the fuck knows?

868
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,320
 Or it could have been a deer.

869
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:18,720
 Maybe.

870
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,000
 I don't think a deer though, because deer would have really had to jump over our big fences.

871
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,880
 It's possible.

872
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,000
 Who knows?

873
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,760
 But it was probably.

874
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,760
 It could have been a bear.

875
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,720
 But yeah, so a little, little crazy.

876
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,320
 We had some wildlife activity in the, in the yard.

877
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,320
 Unhoused drug addicts who wanted to eat bird feed.

878
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,920
 Not completely out of the realm, but I don't think he would have bent it over like he did.

879
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,080
 To get at the bird food.

880
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,880
 But I fixed it.

881
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,320
 I fixed the pole today.

882
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,760
 So it wasn't that it wasn't that strong.

883
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,680
 I was able to straighten it out with my hands.

884
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,440
 Just kind of, you know, so maybe then maybe I think it could have just been a big fat possum.

885
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,720
 Big old fat raccoon.

886
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,160
 Yeah, I think it could have been.

887
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,200
 Or tiny raccoons in a raccoon costume.

888
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,040
 I might've been, it might've been stranger things.

889
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,840
 My God.

890
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,240
 Or a lot of tiny raccoons in a bear costume.

891
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,400
 You guys experiencing these full moons right now?

892
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,560
 There was a big one last night.

893
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:16,720
 Yeah.

894
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,320
 These big harvest moons.

895
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:24,000
 So as the moon got fuller and fuller when I'd go into work in the morning, good gravy.

896
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,840
 Are there deer out at four in the morning?

897
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,640
 They're everywhere.

898
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,360
 I must've passed 16 years last time I was driving to work.

899
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,160
 No three mile radius.

900
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,560
 Crazy.

901
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,240
 Do you think maybe they're choosing you as a leader?

902
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,840
 I hope so.

903
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,280
 I usually drive with my window down and I, and I call out to them.

904
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,240
 I say, Hey, gorgeous.

905
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,360
 Hey, beautiful.

906
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,320
 Just to make sure they don't run into the road.

907
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,520
 Looking good out there.

908
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,640
 I do.

909
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,520
 I compliment you.

910
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,320
 Look, you look incredible.

911
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,600
 I don't know what you're doing, but don't stop.

912
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,160
 You're amazing.

913
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,160
 I mean, his whole life complimenting women has kept them away.

914
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,520
 He figures it'll work for deer too.

915
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,360
 I don't do it to women, just deer.

916
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,800
 That's how I get my, that's how I get my cat call fix.

917
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,560
 I just can't call the tears.

918
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,520
 I'm driving off.

919
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,360
 Hey, that's at least a 10 point rack you're sporting.

920
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,560
 You're amazing.

921
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:23,120
 That is fabulous.

922
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,760
 Oh yes, girl.

923
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,800
 You've had, well, it looks like you've got two little does with you.

924
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,320
 Beautiful.

925
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,760
 Go mama.

926
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,400
 Do it.

927
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,920
 Work mama.

928
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,360
 I'll tell you who else gets horny watching Paul's deer.

929
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,600
 That's the following sponsor.

930
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:51,520
 Today's show is brought to you by dog made doggy dentures for cats.

931
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,480
 That's dog made doggy dentures for cats.

932
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,960
 That's from the New Hampshire caveman in 2023.

933
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,480
 Oh, roof for roof, roof, a roof for roof, roof.

934
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,760
 We're tired of the kitties with their fangs so itty bitties.

935
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,800
 So we made some dentures to stop their shit.

936
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:18,080
 Hey, it's me, the dog dentist, dentist D dog dentist.

937
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:22,640
 I know it's, I'm working on the name.

938
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,680
 Dentist, dentist D dog dentist.

939
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,640
 My last name is D D E E.

940
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,240
 My first name is Dennis.

941
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,720
 I happen to be a dentist, a DDS.

942
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,760
 Dentist D dog dentist DDS.

943
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,600
 Don't let it get it to it.

944
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,880
 Don't get it twisted.

945
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:45,040
 Dentist D dog dentist DDS has come up with a really great solution for kitties fangs.

946
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,520
 Fuck these cats trying to claw our eyes and bite our balls.

947
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:55,840
 I got these special made crowns that are very dull and thick.

948
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:00,160
 And not only does it prevent biting, but it also impedes eating.

949
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,320
 So the cats get thin and weak around us.

950
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,600
 Roof, roof, roof.

951
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,640
 So come see me.

952
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:10,800
 Dennis D dog dentist DDS at your local earliest convenience.

953
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,720
 And I will fix your cat's mouth.

954
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,960
 So it won't bite your dog anymore.

955
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,600
 A roof, roof, roof, roof, roof, roof, roof, roof, roof, roof, roof.

956
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,800
 That's my dentist D dog dentist DDS guarantee.

957
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,400
 It's the hey scoops of check out the list.

958
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,120
 That's simple.

959
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,480
 Oh, hello.

960
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:42,480
 Uh, at the McCartney show, they had a lot of, you know, there was video of old Beatles

961
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,080
 performances and things like that.

962
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:49,680
 And one of the things that was in there, uh, Matt made me think of, uh, you and your kids.

963
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,320
 Okay.

964
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:55,040
 And like specifically kids, like more specifically just kids in general today.

965
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,320
 But, uh, but especially your kids.

966
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,680
 You felt called child predictive services during the concert?

967
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,000
 I think that often.

968
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,440
 I, you know, I probably, it probably popped into my head at some point during the concert.

969
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,680
 Yeah.

970
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:15,120
 Uh, how would you feel okay about things if your children, uh, while, while attending

971
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,400
 a concert or, you know, a big, a big event for, for somebody that they liked,

972
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,600
 if they were screaming in a way that seemed like they were in pain,

973
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,720
 just because the person was on stage, you know what I mean?

974
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,520
 Yes.

975
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:27,760
 Yeah.

976
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,360
 I mean, it, it kind of struck me.

977
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,160
 I don't have kids.

978
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,440
 I don't think about things from the point of view of having kids very often.

979
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,320
 And for some reason it just struck me at that concert.

980
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,000
 That is a weird thing for, you know, fairly young children

981
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,160
 to just be screaming at someone because they are so overwhelmed with emotion.

982
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,920
 That was the children at the Paul McCartney concert screaming.

983
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,240
 No, no, no.

984
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,160
 This was, this was videos of old Beatles footage when this was happening.

985
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,120
 It is really hard.

986
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,960
 Like, uh, there were children at the Paul McCartney concert, uh,

987
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,160
 several of the, uh, we saw several of them with their parents and their parents were

988
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,120
 trying to keep them awake because boy, the 13 year olds that have been brought by their

989
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,480
 parents to the Paul McCartney concert, not give a shit.

990
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,720
 This is a thing of kids and their parents going to concerts.

991
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,560
 I never thought to go to a concert with my dad.

992
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,800
 I don't think my dad ever thought to go to a concert with me.

993
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,280
 I guess we would go to like a show or musical or something.

994
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,360
 So maybe, I don't know how different that is, but it is, it is a thing that I'm hearing

995
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:34,720
 a lot more of, which is like, but he didn't take you to something that he liked and just

996
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,400
 to be like, you should like this too.

997
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,760
 Willie Nelson buckle up.

998
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,040
 Yeah.

999
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,720
 Well, I mean, they called it Beatle mania for a reason.

1000
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,680
 It was straight up.

1001
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:43,840
 Right.

1002
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,960
 That's what I mean.

1003
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,560
 Yeah.

1004
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,920
 It was insanity.

1005
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,560
 It was.

1006
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:54,640
 And I think, you know, it just goes to the repression of the society at that time.

1007
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,880
 You know, it was one of the few times people were

1008
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,960
 allowed to really let their emotions fly.

1009
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,960
 And I mean, if you haven't been able to be free, you know, that's a chance to really

1010
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,760
 get it out.

1011
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:13,040
 It's not dissimilar from, you know, going to like a church revival, speaking in tongues

1012
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:13,760
 and shit, you know?

1013
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,880
 Yeah.

1014
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,520
 You're probably right.

1015
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:20,080
 I also think like, you know, like it's really hard to relate in a non-internet era where

1016
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,760
 like there is no fix, right?

1017
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,520
 Like you like Paul McCartney and he's not in this country that read this year.

1018
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,040
 Right.

1019
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:29,360
 Right.

1020
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,920
 And you can't go on any internet outlet to do it.

1021
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,680
 You have to try to find a magazine or something, do an article and just to kind of

1022
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,120
 keep scratching that itch.

1023
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,800
 And then finally, you have to, you know, have her, you're probably only going to see

1024
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,160
 him once in your life and you're there and you're going to scream your guts out.

1025
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,840
 I definitely think that's a crazy thing.

1026
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:56,320
 I remember when Penn was filming Apprentice, One Direction was staying at Trump Tower for

1027
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,000
 their Madison Square Garden concert.

1028
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:06,800
 And the amount of fans that were just sitting there all day, just packed around that building.

1029
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,280
 Oh, yeah.

1030
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,080
 One member of One Direction to walk out of the apartment was crazy.

1031
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,880
 They were all waiting for Harry Styles.

1032
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,920
 Taylor Swift is about as famous as it gets right now.

1033
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,160
 Yeah.

1034
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,400
 I think people go wild seeing her and screaming for her.

1035
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,120
 Definitely.

1036
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:23,360
 Yeah.

1037
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,360
 But I think it's more rare.

1038
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,760
 I don't think it's completely gone, but it is.

1039
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,640
 Yeah, it is rare.

1040
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,760
 Yeah, I don't know.

1041
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:36,000
 I was sitting there, I was standing there during the concert trying to like appreciate

1042
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,720
 the gravity of what this was in the 60s and 70s.

1043
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,760
 And yeah, I don't think I can do it.

1044
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,160
 I couldn't really wrap my head around what that must have been.

1045
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,680
 I mean, at ScoopFest, I don't think people even move to applaud at all, right?

1046
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,520
 That's at least half on us if you do something to warrant the applause.

1047
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,400
 I don't know.

1048
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,760
 Is it kind of like a bell curve where the raw sexual chemistry just gets too profound

1049
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,680
 and then the applause dies down?

1050
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,960
 It's like they're just shocked into silence when they see us on the stage.

1051
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,960
 They're like, "Dear God, my libido is in a state of frenzy that I can't even articulate.

1052
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:23,280
 I just have to sit here calmly or I may explode from just observation."

1053
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,600
 That's what several Scoops came up to me during ScoopFest and told me.

1054
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,480
 Said their libido is in a state of frenzy from observing me?

1055
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:30,880
 That's right.

1056
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,680
 Is it, "Sorry, we're not applauding.

1057
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,680
 My libido is in a state of frenzy."

1058
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:44,880
 Frenzy!

1059
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,840
 Never gonna clap, never gonna give it up.

1060
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:52,480
 Because of my libido.

1061
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,880
 It's in a state of frenzy.

1062
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,000
 Lindsay said, "Paralyzed by horniness."

1063
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,960
 That's exactly it.

1064
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,040
 No, that's crazy.

1065
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,600
 Hard to applaud with two hands full of cotton.

1066
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,040
 Tell them, Scoop Shooter.

1067
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,320
 How old is McCarty?

1068
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,120
 83, I believe.

1069
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,080
 It's crazy that he's still out there and delivering.

1070
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:14,800
 He's kicking ass.

1071
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,080
 Oh, yeah.

1072
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,920
 And putting on a good show, putting on such a good show.

1073
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,840
 How much stuff was new?

1074
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,800
 How much stuff was Beatles?

1075
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,600
 How much was Wings?

1076
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,760
 Oh, that was, there was some Wings.

1077
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,680
 There was a fair amount.

1078
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,120
 He made a joke at one point.

1079
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,360
 He was like, "Oh, we're gonna play some of the new stuff right now."

1080
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:39,440
 Well, I guess it's 20 years old, but it's still newish.

1081
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,560
 And then they went into it.

1082
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,060
 That's funny.

1083
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:46,320
 There wasn't much that they played that I didn't know.

1084
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,800
 There were a couple of Wings songs that he played.

1085
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,160
 But he played for a long time, too.

1086
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,240
 He played for, it was well over three hours.

1087
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:54,960
 That's crazy.

1088
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:00,800
 Oh, Laurie Elsroth in the chat saying, "Not Wings."

1089
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,760
 One of the best moments of the night was a Wings song

1090
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,120
 when they played "Live and Let Die."

1091
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:09,440
 And the whole place just exploded.

1092
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,400
 This was crazy.

1093
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,480
 It was so crazy how prolific he is, right?

1094
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,960
 Because we can bring up like four Wings songs

1095
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,960
 that are just gigantic smash hits.

1096
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,960
 Post-Beatles, really, it's crazy.

1097
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,760
 Have you, Jacob, delved into the

1098
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:32,240
 simply having a wonderful Christmas time conspiracies?

1099
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,520
 I've heard a little bit about these.

1100
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,480
 Of course I haven't delved into these.

1101
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,200
 So why not?

1102
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,320
 I am vaguely familiar with what you're talking about.

1103
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,360
 So apparently, simply having a wonderful Christmas time

1104
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,880
 is actually about someone interrupting a Wiccan ceremony.

1105
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,600
 Okay. We're in there having like pagan rites.

1106
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:57,920
 And somebody is interrupting them.

1107
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,680
 I'm skeptical about this one.

1108
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,440
 Well, as you should be, as you should be.

1109
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,360
 I think it's really funny to have that song be a song

1110
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,880
 of interrupting is very funny.

1111
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,840
 Like people are just like, "The moon is up."

1112
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:15,440
 See, that's where it starts.

1113
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,560
 The moon is up.

1114
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,600
 So it's like, it's the beginning of a pagan setup.

1115
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,360
 That's right. You say that like it's A to B, and that's A to Z.

1116
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,800
 Because I've just done a search for it.

1117
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,600
 It's simply having a wonderful Christmas time about witchcraft

1118
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,680
 is the auto-film that came in when I searched for it.

1119
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:32,640
 That's right. Of course.

1120
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,360
 And it says, "No, it's not."

1121
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:38,720
 You know what? Interestingly enough, no.

1122
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,120
 Oh, oh, did you ask Siri about that?

1123
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,880
 She's notoriously truthful, that Siri.

1124
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,920
 The moon is up.

1125
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,520
 Wiccan, Wiccan ceremony.

1126
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,480
 No other human would look up at the sky, see the moon,

1127
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,480
 and think that'd be a good first line of the song.

1128
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:54,960
 Nope.

1129
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,720
 See the moon, I get Wiccan.

1130
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:01,840
 Oh, apparently this is all based on just a misunderstood lyric.

1131
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,600
 Oh, right. Okay, sure.

1132
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:09,760
 So the lyric that people hear and thought was Wiccan.

1133
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,680
 Paul's such a staunch defender of this Wiccan ceremony conspiracy.

1134
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,000
 Fine, let's hear the lyric, Mr. Smarty Pants.

1135
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,440
 Yeah, so the lyric that Paul is referring to is, "The moon is right."

1136
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:27,440
 That is the lyric that people glommed onto, is that this is Wiccan.

1137
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,920
 According to Paul McCartney, when interviewed about this, I said,

1138
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:37,600
 "No, the lyric is about the mood, M-O-O-D, not M-O-O-N.

1139
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:42,080
 The mood is right, not the moon is right, the mood."

1140
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:46,720
 Paul, I want you and R.F.K. Jr. say one side of the conspiracy theory

1141
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,880
 and then say which one the other side of the conspiracy theory is

1142
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,760
 and see which one seems more natural in R.F.K. Jr.'s throat.

1143
00:50:51,760 --> 00:51:01,680
 Well, when you watch and listen to Simply Having a Wonderful Christmas Time,

1144
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:09,280
 what you'll find is there are moments when they're talking about sharing drinks,

1145
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:15,760
 and those could be tainted with adrenochrome that they have obtained from babies.

1146
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,200
 That's how they do it, drink babies.

1147
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:25,440
 Simply Having a Wonderful Christmas Time, that translates to,

1148
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,880
 "I'm drinking adrenochrome from babies." You play it backwards.

1149
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,920
 We're drinking adrenochrome.

1150
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,520
 And now what's the other side, that it's just a Christmas song?

1151
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,960
 Yeah, yeah, that's just a Christmas song.

1152
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:48,960
 I know that for me and my family, it's not Christmas until someone brings a dead bear in there.

1153
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,080
 [laughter]

1154
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,440
 I'm not dead yet.

1155
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,600
 You will be.

1156
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,720
 No!

1157
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:57,200
 You will be.

1158
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:57,840
 We're gonna roast you up like you're...

1159
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,840
 Who bent this pole? Who bent my Christmas pole?

1160
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,760
 Oh, God.

1161
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,240
 Sorry.

1162
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,040
 What do you call that pole at Christmas? Not the Yule log.

1163
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,200
 What is it called?

1164
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,160
 The Yule log, yes.

1165
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,440
 Oh, and someone bent the Yule log, it was a bear.

1166
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:19,760
 [laughter]

1167
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,800
 You're right. The regular Christmas sounds more believable.

1168
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,800
 [laughter]

1169
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:31,040
 The only way to win is to force you to agree with RFK Jr., and then I figured you would maybe not.

1170
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,480
 [laughter]

1171
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,640
 Yeah, you're right, you're right.

1172
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,320
 Maybe that'll bring you back.

1173
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,160
 The moon is right.

1174
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:42,480
 If he is a fucking AI character, the moon is right, the moon is left.

1175
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,960
 Ah, man, there were so many good moments in that concert.

1176
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:52,720
 Completely full, it was Allegiant Stadium, Raider Stadium in Vegas, totally full.

1177
00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:04,240
 But I'm looking at the set list now, they did Band on the Run from Wings, they did Get Back,

1178
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:10,320
 and then they had a little moment, and he would talk a couple of times between some

1179
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:16,960
 of these little moments, and then they went into Let It Be, and they started Let It Be

1180
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,880
 in a very interesting way, and then they filled out the song, and then they did the whole thing.

1181
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,640
 By the end of it, there were a couple of times in the concert, by the end of it,

1182
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:33,600
 you had about 50,000 people really nicely singing along, not singing at the top of their voices,

1183
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:37,440
 not screaming, but just pleasantly singing along.

1184
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,120
 Well, they didn't want to wake up their children.

1185
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,040
 That's right, that's right.

1186
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,120
 [laughter]

1187
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,440
 Now, this was at Allegiant, was that where this was?

1188
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,880
 Yeah, this is Allegiant Stadium.

1189
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:47,920
 That makes sense.

1190
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,120
 And at the end of Let It Be-

1191
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:52,080
 Anything three years old, still filling up Allegiant Stadium is crazy.

1192
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,920
 That's insane, that is insane.

1193
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:59,600
 Yeah, and seemingly just effortlessly, and also moving around, playing a lot of different

1194
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:03,920
 instruments. He played his bass, his famous-

1195
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,800
 He still had his bass.

1196
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,200
 Yeah, his famous violin-style bass. He played a couple of different guitars,

1197
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:16,800
 he played two different pianos, he played a mandolin, and he played a ukulele that had

1198
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,920
 been given to him by George Harrison, and he told a little story about how George had given him this

1199
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,920
 ukulele. So he plays a lot of different instruments, like he's all over it.

1200
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,440
 But the end of Let It Be, you asked if there was anything that kind of hit me.

1201
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:36,960
 And the end of Let It Be definitely was one of the two times in the night that I tiered

1202
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,640
 up a little bit, just standing there.

1203
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,360
 Sure.

1204
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:45,120
 And Let It Be, yeah, there will be an answer, let it be.

1205
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:51,120
 And the whole audience was singing that, and at the end of it, he did something that I thought

1206
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:58,320
 was fucking brilliant and perfect. He just let that last note hit, and as the audience applauded,

1207
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,840
 they just stood there. They just didn't say anything.

1208
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:08,000
 And you could tell that everybody was definitely a little moved, like the energy in the room was a

1209
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:14,080
 little moved. And he just said, "There will be tomorrow, just let it be."

1210
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:26,560
 I said, "Man, this guy fucking knows how to do this." Like he knows how to tap into the energy,

1211
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:35,920
 he knows how to tap into the room. Everybody in this room was seemingly listening to this song

1212
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:42,880
 and thinking about the way the world is right now, and thinking about our brothers and sisters all

1213
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:48,800
 over the place that are having a hard time because of a great many things, because of

1214
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:54,400
 war in different places of the world, because of the insane political climate that is in

1215
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:59,200
 the United States right now and in different places around the world as well. I know, I know.

1216
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:04,560
 It's an old guy thing. You have to be 83 to really see the whole pattern in all of it.

1217
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,200
 The average age of MSNBC watcher?

1218
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:15,120
 Yeah, that's it. And I mean, man, he hits the end of that. And he knows what the whole room is

1219
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:19,840
 thinking. He knows what the whole room is doing. And he just lets everybody sit in it. And he

1220
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:25,280
 doesn't have to say it. He doesn't even have to come out and point an arrow at it. He just says,

1221
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:32,240
 like, "Yeah, this is a thing. And it's shitty right now. And it's going to be okay."

1222
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:37,520
 And then the concert ended, or the main part of the concert ended before the encore. And the

1223
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:43,280
 last song of the main concert was Hey Jude, which was another big, of course, sing-along moment. I

1224
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:51,440
 got a good 360 video of the whole crowd. Exactly. Yeah. And I finished that. And then they came out

1225
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:58,480
 for the encore a couple of minutes later. And here comes Paul carrying an American flag.

1226
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:04,720
 And then some members of the band are coming out behind him. One of them has the Union Jack. They

1227
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:10,240
 have the English flag there. And one of them comes out with the Nevada flag, because that's

1228
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:15,840
 where they were. And then the fourth band member comes out with the, oh, I just forgot the name of

1229
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:22,720
 it, the Pride flag with the newer extra stuff on the one end of it. I don't remember the name

1230
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:31,600
 of that flag. But it's the inclusion flag, the Pride Progress flag. There you go.

1231
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:38,080
 Make you a Latter Day Scoop. And they just stood there and waved these flags around for a few

1232
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:44,560
 seconds and let everyone just kind of think about that. And then they went into I've Got a Feeling,

1233
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:49,520
 The Beatles' I've Got a Feeling. They played some of that. They played some Sgt. Pepper's.

1234
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:54,560
 Did Fergie come out? Will.i.am? What's that? Did Fergie and Will.i.am come out for that one?

1235
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:59,280
 They did not. They did not, weirdly. That's weird, yeah. They also did Helter Skelter live,

1236
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,440
 which was pretty great. See them do Helter Skelter was pretty awesome. That's pretty cool.

1237
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:10,960
 Yeah. Man, it was just, it was good. It was touching. It was entertaining. Fuck me,

1238
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:16,720
 Paul McCartney is good at what he does. Where were you in the stadium? Oh, we were on the floor.

1239
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:22,000
 My mom, my mom had never seen any of the Beatles before. And so I wanted to do some good tickets.

1240
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,880
 So we were in the 16th row on the floor of our house, right? Yeah. Did they pull out the Raider?

1241
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:31,440
 We could see him. Did they pull out the Raider grass for you or did they just pull the tray away?

1242
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:38,400
 Did you get to ride? They put the tray away for some reason. I was so mad that the grass wasn't

1243
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:48,320
 there. Yeah. Oh, okay. Pandora is absolutely listening to me just right now. It came up with

1244
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:54,880
 a thing that says, "A notification just hit my phone." It says, "All of the Beatles, every Beatles

1245
00:58:54,880 --> 00:59:01,760
 song." Yeah. I've been getting a lot of Beatles recommendations the last few days. Oh no, that's

1246
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:07,120
 terrifying. It's really exciting, Jacob. And it's good to know that something successful can happen

1247
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:13,600
 inside that stadium. So that's very nice. That's right. It can actually happen, right? Something

1248
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:18,880
 that ends with everyone just feeling good and like they spent an evening out doing something

1249
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:27,760
 worthwhile. It can happen in that stadium. That's good to know. Amazing. Yeah. Oh, it was so fucking

1250
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:34,560
 good. Let's move into some little Scoop Mail here. Yes. Physical Scoop Mail. Physical Scoop Mail.

1251
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:41,120
 Zip-a-dee-doo. We got mail in a box. I love it. Oh, it's Physical Scoop Mail. Great for Jacob.

1252
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:48,640
 Bad for Paul and Matt because they're not here. Oh, we got one from the Coffee Bean Scoop. Matt,

1253
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:54,160
 we got some coffee from our friend the Coffee Bean Scoop. Gentlemen, the Stars did not align

1254
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,680
 this year for me to make Scoop Fest, but I hope I'll make it next year. I hope everything is lining

1255
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:02,720
 up well or that it went well, depending on when you get this. That's Paul, the Coffee Bean Scoop.

1256
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:07,120
 He also sent the second letter here. The summer seems to be flying. I hope it's treating you all

1257
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:10,960
 well. I forgot to send you a package last month, so I upped your shipment this time. That's right,

1258
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:16,400
 we got extra coffee this time. Nice. I've also included a little extra something for Jacob.

1259
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,240
 I like bourbon and Jacob likes bourbon. A big part of bourbon for me is sharing what you're

1260
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:24,080
 enjoying with friends. I can't be there to share a bottle with Jacob, so I'm sending you

1261
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:31,680
 some of what I'm enjoying this month. This month is Penelope Estate 10-year single barrel

1262
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:40,320
 at 105 proof. Paul also sent me a little tiny bottle of bourbon here for me to enjoy on my own,

1263
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:48,320
 so that'll be very nice. Lovely. Thank you very much. I already mentioned Sarah and Mayer, M-A-Y-O-U,

1264
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:53,840
 getting married in Ireland. Congratulations. They're coming up here in November. Yes, absolutely.

1265
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:59,680
 That's fantastic. Then we got something here from the OG Scoop. We got Andy, the OG Scoop,

1266
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:04,800
 who is in the chat with us right now. Hey gang, I have some small gifts sent by Amazon to the

1267
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:09,680
 Vegas address and also to Paul's place. I just wanted to send you this note. They are small

1268
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:14,080
 tokens of my appreciation to you for all the laughs that you have given me in the past and

1269
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:18,640
 continue to do so. Thanks to all of our wonderful community for all of the love that you have shown

1270
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:24,880
 to each other over the years. I love you all mentally and sexually. Fucking you in the face,

1271
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:31,280
 that's Andy, the OG Scoop. Oh, thank you, Andy. Andy sent two books along with us here. Oh,

1272
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:36,000
 what you got there, Paul? This is what Andy sent me. He sent me a cool bird of prey,

1273
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:43,040
 wood printout 3D model that I can put together. Oh, cool. Moving forward, we're going to be,

1274
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:51,040
 specifically me, I'm going to be hosting some extra Zoom chats as a Patreon reward. This is

1275
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,240
 going to be one of the projects I'm going to be working on during one of those Zoom chats for

1276
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:59,440
 sure. Thank you, Andy. Very nice. Yeah, this will give me some more fun stuff. This and LEGO type

1277
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:03,440
 stuff will be some of the things I'll be engaged in while I'm chatting to you guys during some of

1278
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:08,640
 those meetups. Very cool. Well, I might be drinking some of the whiskey that I learned about in this

1279
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:14,560
 book, A Field Guide to Whiskey, which is what Andy sent to me, which looks like a very informative

1280
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:20,480
 whiskey book here. And Matt, don't worry, he sent you something as well. And it is fantastic. He

1281
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:25,280
 sent you a little golden book. You remember the little golden books from our childhood? Yes. He

1282
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:32,560
 sent you a little golden book all about Bruce Springsteen. It is a Bruce Springsteen biography

1283
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:37,200
 as a little golden book. That's really cool. I just got this. Are you excited about the movie,

1284
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:41,280
 Matt? I just got this note slipped under my door and it's telling me I should check out some Beatles

1285
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:47,200
 on my music player. So there we go. Oh, the boat is listening. The boat is listening. Oh my God.

1286
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:56,080
 No, no, I'm not excited about the movie coming. What do you heard? What's the scuttlebutt? I don't

1287
01:02:56,080 --> 01:03:01,760
 know. Is it a Jared Leto and Skeletor kind of situation? Because that's got me in a fucking

1288
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:07,600
 tizzy. Jared Leto is playing Skeletor in the new Bruce Springsteen movie. Oh, well, I would be out

1289
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:15,280
 of it too. Yeah. It's got the dude from succession taking very big swings. The bear playing Bruce is

1290
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:23,920
 like a really weird melancholy thing. And I love Bruce so much. I've read multiple biographies on

1291
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:31,520
 him. His autobiography as well as other biographies. I will see that man in concert as long as he's

1292
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:37,920
 playing. I'll see when he's 83 playing playing. Oh, yeah. He can't fill up a legion, by the way.

1293
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,960
 That's the thing. It's like that's why I'm so impressed by Paul McCartney. I don't think Bruce

1294
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:46,720
 could fill up a legion. Yeah, I think Paul, I think Paul plays less than Bruce, though. Yeah.

1295
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:51,920
 I think Paul gives audience less opportunity to say. Yeah. Also, he just does the big ones.

1296
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:57,840
 Arguably one of the most popular people in the last in the 20th century.

1297
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:05,840
 Yeah. I think he's got a little more fame than Bruce. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyhow, I just don't. I

1298
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:10,960
 just don't know what the I don't know what the story is. You're just worried. You're just worried.

1299
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:19,440
 I don't know. Matt has concerns about the film. I get it. When Ray came out. I do like Ray. Oh,

1300
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:25,360
 yeah. Sure. Really great biopic. And then they kept making other ones that weren't as good

1301
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:33,040
 afterwards. Right. Still about Ray Charles. No, no, just like then they just started a bevy of.

1302
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:37,200
 Yeah, right, right, right. A bunch of others that came after it. Well, we did get Walk Hard from all

1303
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:41,840
 that. So that I was going to say you have the John C. Reilly Walk Hard that came out of that whole

1304
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:46,160
 love walk hard. Yeah, we say like we I don't I think one is very hard to make a really good

1305
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:54,000
 biopic. And then two, I don't think we have it like in our in our in our in our, you know,

1306
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,560
 artistic hearts take in a lot of biopics, you know, like, I think one comes around that we

1307
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:04,720
 really just kind of like it for what it is. Right. And so I this is coming right on the heels of that

1308
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:11,520
 really well done Dylan movie. And yeah, I just don't know if you get to do that twice. That was

1309
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:19,040
 good. That was a good movie. And I agree. Let's cancel Bruce Springsteen. Jeremy Allen White's

1310
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:24,560
 not singing. Right. He's lip syncing or doing whatever. Oh, that's that's rough, too. Yeah.

1311
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:30,800
 Because that was actually our boy doing the songs. Right. Yeah. Timothy Chalamet just straight up

1312
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:36,640
 became like a channel. That was ding dong. Don't play, man. Same with Jamie. What's his last name?

1313
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:42,320
 We played Fox. Jamie Foxx. Jamie Foxx. Oh, yeah, you're right. Jamie Foxx went straight up,

1314
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:48,640
 went to like Ray Charles School, just straight up. Oh, yeah. Charles. I mean, doing Ray almost

1315
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:54,000
 turned Jamie Foxx into a full time musician. Yeah. Was Ray Charles still alive at that time?

1316
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:01,280
 Yes, I think so. I think so. He had some he had some actual direct firsthand, too. Yeah,

1317
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:05,040
 it was definitely. Yes, there was definitely footage of Jamie Foxx learning from Ray Charles.

1318
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:11,360
 That's cool. And in the behind the scenes. Oh, yeah. Ray Charles died in 2004.

1319
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:17,600
 So I hope I'm close. I hope I'm wrong. But everything about everything I'm seeing makes

1320
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:27,520
 me go like you. Sure. Sure. Well, I mean, Tron Aries is getting in the 50s for scores right now. Oh,

1321
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:32,000
 no. Yeah, it's it's also not a good Bruce Springsteen movie at all. And not great.

1322
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:38,640
 But again, it's hardly there's hardly any Bruce Springsteen in it. You could barely call it a

1323
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:43,520
 Bruce Springsteen movie. I don't get the Jared Leto thing. The only thing I think is honestly,

1324
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:48,240
 Jared Leto must have dirt on a lot of Hollywood. The place like, you know, to place like an

1325
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:53,200
 interplanetary, you know, neon motorcycle race based solely on the Ghost of Tom Joed album is

1326
01:06:53,200 --> 01:07:00,480
 a mistake. It's just a mistake. You know, when I heard about that, I was really excited. I'll be

1327
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,760
 very honest with you. I thought that was going to be it. But yeah, just it didn't work out.

1328
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:12,800
 Or it's because they had so many of them there. First, there were two, then there were three,

1329
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:18,320
 there were four. No, it's all about soon. I think I have to try to see it right away because I think

1330
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:25,360
 for the sake of this podcast, I just have to. I think as a podcast, I have to. But yeah,

1331
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:33,120
 we'll see how it goes. Same thing with me and Tron Aries. I really want to see those visuals

1332
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:39,920
 with that Nine Inch Nails music. I want to go see it in IMAX because the soundtrack is exquisite.

1333
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:45,360
 Right. It's it's some of the best Nine Inch Nails music in the last 10 years.

1334
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:51,680
 Yeah. So I don't know. I watched. It's really, really good. I watched F1 last night.

1335
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:57,360
 OK. The new Brad Pitt movie. This is the Brad Pitt. Right. Yeah. You did a great job with the

1336
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:03,440
 soundtrack on that. It's really like felt like old school. Like it was really a lot of scorpion

1337
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:09,040
 songs. Yeah. Very old school sports movie that like the soundtrack was really pumping you up.

1338
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:17,520
 Nice. I liked it. It was it was it was, you know, I think we figured out so much with

1339
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:22,320
 movies now. It was it was a it's a sports movie. It's a it's a sports movie traditionally done

1340
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:30,400
 well executed. It was really fun to watch. And yeah, I just I'm looking forward to it.

1341
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:34,400
 It looks like it's a good watch for me. So last night did my first shows on the ship. So it was

1342
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:40,000
 like I was staying. I was a little wired. So I just watched it to the end. So then I went to sleep.

1343
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,400
 It was fun. How did the first shows on the ship go? Good. Good, good, good.

1344
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:57,280
 It was it's a big enough room where I basically couldn't get like I did. I did the show as written

1345
01:08:57,280 --> 01:09:02,480
 and so it went over well. A lot of people laughed. You know me. I like to get like

1346
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:06,720
 something spontaneous happening in the show. I want like another character to emerge

1347
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:13,040
 that kind of stuff. And I didn't get any characters out of the show. And so everyone else

1348
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:16,400
 like, you know, good show. Really funny. I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I was fine. It was a fine

1349
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:23,680
 show. It was a solid B B minus is good. I mean, they have an awesome crew here is also neat. They

1350
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:30,320
 have seven movable giant LED screens that you can arrange in whatever order you want.

1351
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:38,240
 Well, that's a that's a nice plus. It is. Yeah. And so I created like a V with six LED screens

1352
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:43,600
 and put one all the way back. Nice. And it was really nice to create intimacy with the audience

1353
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,760
 to kind of focus that V right there. And so I got to perform kind of center stage and not feel too

1354
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:53,680
 small in the giant theater. Okay. And it was and so that part super fun. Their crew is just

1355
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:58,000
 unbelievable. They just follow every direction to a hill. You tell everybody everything once

1356
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:03,840
 everybody's remarkably calm. Nobody's there. There's no crew. That's what you want. That's

1357
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:07,600
 the juice right there. The ship is next level. It has no cruise director. They have different

1358
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,920
 people in different positions that handle things, but no one's job is to talk to or host to the

1359
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:17,760
 audience. So you just come out and do your show and your show ends. There's no extra, hey, this

1360
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:21,360
 is what's happening tomorrow. Here's what's going on later on tonight on deck seven, blah, blah, blah.

1361
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:26,720
 That's that's cool. This whole ship is so different. It's so it's like it's like it's

1362
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:32,880
 honestly with the cosmopolitan at sea. It's it's a there's no fake opulence. Like there's no like

1363
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:41,120
 grand ballroom type feel to stuff. Like it's all very hip hotel. Nice little niche. Nice things.

1364
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:45,840
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's really, it's a different design from what I can see in there. It looks

1365
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:51,200
 pretty cool. Oh, it's the nicest room I've been put in as a guest entertainer by far. Well, that

1366
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:54,400
 was the thing. As soon as I, as soon as I asked you how the boat life's going, I thought, wait a

1367
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:59,840
 minute, is he just in a regular hotel room? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then it has like different light

1368
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,640
 settings as an IP the whole thing. So the whole room is controlled by an iPad.

1369
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:08,720
 I got as different moods, including get it on. Every room has its own iPad. Yeah. Every room has

1370
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:12,640
 its own iPad where I can turn on the TV, open the curtains, turn the lights on and off everything,

1371
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:20,080
 temperature, order room service. It's all right here. Is there a Patreon level where we could give

1372
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:25,520
 a scoop control of the lights in your room on the ship? We're just going to keep hitting, get it on,

1373
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:30,400
 get it on. Exactly. You hit get it on and all the lights turn purple and then music comes on.

1374
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:35,520
 Is it, is there a setting for real? Yeah. That's amazing. Show us. Can you show us?

1375
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:42,160
 Yeah. Let's see, Matt, this is going to hit. This is why we broadcast with this. Why you went,

1376
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:47,440
 oh my God. Oh, there was just a large button on the iPad that says, get it on. There he goes.

1377
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:55,680
 Matt has hit the button. Oh my God. Yes. Oh my God. It's just close. Just a love machine.

1378
01:11:55,680 --> 01:12:03,200
 And I won't wait for nobody but you. Wow. Look at this. It's like that moment straight out of an

1379
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:10,080
 eighties movie where somebody bumps into the record player. Yes. Instant sweat house. I'll hit photo

1380
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:21,120
 shoot. And then that's going to turn the lights super bright. Yeah. Look at that. Wow. It doesn't

1381
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:28,480
 have a refractory period button. Just go to like a nice dark blue and some soft music starts playing.

1382
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:31,520
 You can't read it because it's too bright. It says zen. Is that close enough?

1383
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:37,120
 That's pretty close. It's pretty good. It goes to blue and the curtains do close again. Yeah.

1384
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:45,440
 Look at that shit. Holy smokes. All right. Go back to the get it on look real quick.

1385
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:48,240
 Oh, there it is. I need to. Oh, wait. There you go. This is pumped up.

1386
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:53,200
 I don't know what that means. Lights go up in this kind of purple and blue. Okay. You want to

1387
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:59,760
 get it on? Okay. Yeah. Give me that get it on look again. I just need to get a quick shot of

1388
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:10,160
 something here. I don't do it. There we go. Maybe. Oh, dammit. My screen capture isn't working.

1389
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:21,440
 Wow. That is something else right there. Yeah. That's amazing. I think I got it. Well, technology

1390
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:29,360
 is better every day. Clearly. Yeah. Oh, yeah. This place just like it's really like about. Yeah.

1391
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:37,680
 There's not like Excuse me. There's not like a pageant to the cruise ship. Do you know what

1392
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:43,440
 I mean? Like there's not like this kind of someone marching you along through the cruise. It's very

1393
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:50,400
 you do your own thing kind of thing. And even the showrooms are all hold like 300 400 they don't

1394
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:55,200
 there's not like a giant theater. So like it's just you're not going to do the same thing as

1395
01:13:55,200 --> 01:14:00,000
 everyone do their own thing. And it's just totally it's the restaurants that crazy amazing

1396
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:07,040
 restaurants. Oh, yeah, I went to the test kitchen where they bring out all this experimental food

1397
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:14,720
 to you and courses. They just bring it out. And that was Yeah, it was just nuts. This has

1398
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:21,520
 been a crazy crazy trip. Every. Oh, cool. I put a picture of me working Virgin and like every,

1399
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:27,120
 every entertainer who hasn't worked is like seeding. Like, I'm trying to get there. And

1400
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:31,040
 everyone who has played Virgin is like, Oh, so you're here now. Like, it's very like,

1401
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:35,920
 everybody, everybody just wants to play here. Everybody wants to get the call all the time to

1402
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:42,480
 play here. Like, it's definitely like the number one. It is the spot. Yeah, I get it. I totally get

1403
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:48,160
 it. Like I before I leave want to be like, I will do anything to be here again. Thank you.

1404
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:56,400
 I will leave my family for any period of time. I will come sit on your ship and your purple neon

1405
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:10,000
 light in my room. Let's do a little jock versus nerd action. Oh, am I? Yeah, I'm on the hunt for

1406
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:26,320
 balls on the hunt for balls. Oh, we got a scooper to come in as today from ML Kennedy. The categories

1407
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:34,560
 are that was remade this time in English, good remakes and confusion remakes. Oh, it's me first.

1408
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:43,680
 I'll try. I'll try that was remade for 200. This 1984 Ivan Reitman film was remade by Paul Fieg,

1409
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:50,000
 I think in 2016. But nevermind that one. We're trying again with a soft reboot next March.

1410
01:15:50,000 --> 01:16:02,160
 This is a this is an older scooper. Oh, yes, I guess it is. But thank you. This is great to have

1411
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:06,080
 is this not next March? Is this is this like a previous March that happened? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1412
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:12,800
 This is 2017 or 2018. Yeah. Oh, well, that's that explains why I don't know this. I pass Matt. Yes.

1413
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:27,120
 Paul Ghostbusters. Oh, oh, yeah. That that that. Oh, okay. Matt. This time in English, please.

1414
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:36,160
 For 200. Based on a play 1978, Lacanje à Follets was titled this when it was remade with Robin

1415
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:47,200
 Williams in 1996. The Birdcage. The Birdcage is correct. Let's see. I'll try. Oh, no, it's Paul.

1416
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:52,800
 Paul, you're up. I will try. That was remade for 400.

1417
01:16:54,640 --> 01:17:02,800
 This 1987 Paul Verhoeven classic was remade in 2014. The remake made 243 million dollars

1418
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:09,120
 despite no one remembering it. I guess crime's new enemy didn't make an impression. RoboCop.

1419
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:20,240
 RoboCop is correct. Ah, boy, I'm not doing well on this one at all. I'll try good remakes for 200.

1420
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:27,200
 Be afraid to be very afraid. This 1986 Cronenberg remake starring Jeff Goldblum and Gina Davis

1421
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:35,920
 is much better than the original 1958 version. Help me. That would be Jurassic Park. Jurassic

1422
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:42,560
 Park starring Gina Davis. She was the T-Rex. She was the T-Rex. Big old lady. That'd be the fly.

1423
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:52,080
 The fly. Yes. Good. She was the pilot. No, it's Gina Davis. Matt. Good remakes, 400.

1424
01:17:52,080 --> 01:18:03,200
 That'd be category number three. There we go. Yes. This film was awesome in 1956, arguably better

1425
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:10,560
 when remade in 1978. Still pretty good when remade in 1993 and pretty terrible when remade in 2007.

1426
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:16,160
 As the film is about duplicate replacement copies, it makes sense that another remake is in the works.

1427
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:28,880
 Oh. I don't know. Pass. That's Paul. Paul, do you know what that is? Invasion of the Body Snatchers.

1428
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:37,120
 Invasion of the Body Snatchers is correct. Paul is fucking rolling with ML Kennedy's game today.

1429
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:45,920
 Paul, you're up. That was remade for 600, please. This 1990 Paul Verhoeven film starring Arnold

1430
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:52,080
 Schwarzenegger was not based on a Stephen King work. It was remade with Colin Farrell in 2012.

1431
01:18:52,080 --> 01:19:00,160
 You'd probably need a perfect memory to recollect that. That would be Get Your Ass to Mouth.

1432
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:08,640
 Total Recall. Total Recall is correct. There we go. I forgot that Colin Farrell had made a

1433
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:12,640
 total recall. Was that any good? It couldn't have been, right? I don't know. I didn't see it.

1434
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:18,400
 Let's see. I'll try a good remake, 600. Daily Double.

1435
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:28,640
 This 1960 killer plant film was made for about $28,000 and all its interior shots were done in

1436
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:35,520
 two days. Naturally, the more popular 1986 version is a $25 million musical, I believe.

1437
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:45,680
 Oh, wait. Oh, it's a Daily Double. I can say it all out loud. I think it is A Little Shop of Horrors,

1438
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:53,760
 but it could be Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. In 1960? Yeah, I don't think it's that. Yeah,

1439
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:59,600
 yeah. Yeah, it's A Little Shop of Horrors. Yeah. Yeah, there it is. You got it. Matt?

1440
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:09,040
 I will take good remakes for 800. Jeff Bridges replaced John Wayne when the Coen Brothers remade

1441
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:22,800
 this 1969 film in 2010. True Grit. True Grit is correct. Paul? I'll close out. That was remade for

1442
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:28,240
 eight. Schwarzenegger was replaced by Jason Momoa when they tried to revive this film franchise in

1443
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:35,520
 2011. The 2011 remake made less money than the 1982 film, even before adjusting for inflation.

1444
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:43,360
 Tell me what is good in the box office. That hurts. Not this. That hurts. Conan. Conan? The

1445
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:52,400
 Barbarian. I had no idea Jason Momoa did a Conan remake. Oh, yeah, it's terrible. And I love Conan.

1446
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:58,800
 I'm sitting here with the whole classic run of Conan. I got this. I got these brand new ones.

1447
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:03,200
 This is the brand new. Show of hands. Anybody surprised that Paul has Conan toys at his

1448
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:08,800
 fingertips? No hands. No hands. Look, they definitely didn't inspire each other. That's

1449
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:13,360
 all I want you to know. OK, Master's Universe is not a rip off of Conan. That's for sure.

1450
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:21,200
 Good. This Momoa should just be a comedian. Who? Momoa? Yeah, he should.

1451
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:27,520
 He's so much better in comedic roles than he is in action roles. Yep. Yep. Well, he's getting there.

1452
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:33,120
 Well, it's if they do pull off that third Dune movie, which I guess they are moving forward with

1453
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:39,440
 some production stuff, he might that might be really interesting to see him turn that because

1454
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:45,680
 that's a crazy character arc for that character that he's playing. Oh, really? Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1455
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:51,040
 Yeah, because he is good in the he's one of the parts of the Dune movies that I like so far.

1456
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:55,120
 So do you know what happens to his character? No, no, I don't know anything about it. So it's

1457
01:21:55,120 --> 01:22:02,400
 Duncan, Idaho is his character he plays and Paul Atreides love Duncan, Idaho. You saw how, you know,

1458
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:07,520
 they captured that relationship of how he idolized him and everything is a who was that second name

1459
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:13,840
 you said? Paul Atreides, the main character. Oh, OK. That's oh, that's Timmy. Timmy. Yeah.

1460
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:20,720
 OK, so they were, you know, best buds. Well, he ends up cloning him over and over and over again.

1461
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:27,360
 And he gets Duncan, Idaho gets real weird and philosophical about shit being a clone. It's

1462
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:33,920
 interesting. So, yeah, just like Michael Keaton in multiplicity. Just like that. Exactly. It's me.

1463
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:40,080
 I'll try this time in English for 400. Spike Lee directed the 2013 version of this 2003 Korean

1464
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:45,200
 film, the second installment of the Vengeance trilogy, preceded by sympathy for Mr. Vengeance

1465
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:55,680
 and followed by Lady Vengeance. What? You heard it? I have I have no idea.

1466
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:59,840
 I don't think I do. I think I'm going to pass to Matt.

1467
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:14,880
 Matt, do you have a guess? Me? No. Yes. Paul. I believe this is old boy. All right, let's try it.

1468
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:20,800
 It's it's old boy. Yes, that's just what it is. Yeah, I didn't know we did a score check.

1469
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:28,240
 Yes, the original version of Old Boy is legendary. Yeah, yeah, the Korean version.

1470
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:32,640
 Yeah, it's fucking crazy. Yeah, I never saw that. That another one was the what's his name? Yeah,

1471
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:40,400
 I didn't see that one. Matt, you're up. I'll do with Confusion Remakes 200.

1472
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:49,120
 Rob Zombie remade this 1978 movie in 2007. Then he made a sequel. Then we ignored both those movies

1473
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:54,640
 and all the other films in the franchise to make a sequel to the original 1978 version in 2018,

1474
01:23:54,640 --> 01:24:02,080
 which shares the same name as the 1978 and 2007 movies. I don't know this, but that's very funny.

1475
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:10,880
 Pass. Paul. Halloween. Halloween is correct. Oh, I wasn't against Halloween, but yeah,

1476
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:15,440
 you would have got it. Yeah. If you had, you would have gotten more points. Paul. Shit.

1477
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:25,280
 Confusion Remakes for four. The Thing from Another World was remade by John Carpenter in 1982 and

1478
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:31,200
 called this. Then in 2011, they made a prequel to the 1982 movie and gave it the same name as the

1479
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:39,440
 1982 film. The Thing. The Thing is correct. This category specifically just bread and butter to

1480
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:46,160
 Paul here. It really is. Score check with four questions left. I have 800 points. Matt has a

1481
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:50,640
 thousand points. Paul has 3,400 points and none of those are off a daily double for Paul. There's

1482
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:58,000
 still a daily double out there. Could bring me to my knees real quick. I'll try Confusion Remakes

1483
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:07,840
 for 600. In 1998, Gus Van Santen made a shot for shot remake of this 1960 Hitchcock film for reasons.

1484
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:15,920
 It had, oh, what's that guy's name that's in a bunch of stuff? Vince Vaughn. I can't think of

1485
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:19,920
 his name. Vince Vaughn. Vince Vaughn. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. This was the remake of Psycho. Yeah. There

1486
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:33,280
 you go. Yep. Matt. This time in English, 600. The Austrian film Funny Games was made in 1997 by

1487
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:41,760
 Michael Hankney. Hankney. Hanky, I think. The 2007 American version was also directed by Michael

1488
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:52,880
 Hanky and was called this. Funny Games. I don't know. Is it the game? I think it's the same title,

1489
01:25:52,880 --> 01:26:04,400
 Matt. Do you think it's the same title? I think so. I'll pass. Paul. How much does he think it's

1490
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:11,360
 the same title? I'll go for it. Funny Games. What is Funny Games? It was also called Funny Games.

1491
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:18,560
 Okay. Yep. Boy, this really is just made for Paul. Have you seen that one? I've seen the English one.

1492
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:23,040
 Yeah. No, I saw it and then didn't get the question right, Paul. Yeah. Oh, no. Yeah, I saw the whole

1493
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:27,440
 thing. Funny Games is awful. I mean, it's great. Matt just watched it this morning. Funny Games is

1494
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:32,640
 really good, but it's horrific. I never did. Yes, this time in English or Confusion remakes,

1495
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:37,040
 one of them is a daily double. God, here we go. Here we go into zero town.

1496
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:44,400
 I'll go Confusion remakes. Oh, if Paul loses now, it's going to be amazing. Yep. Here it comes.

1497
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:53,280
 Either I'm the king of all or crushed to nothing. This 1988 film series about murderer Charles Lee

1498
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:58,720
 Ray comprised seven films, the most recent of which came out in 2017. Then in 2019, it was

1499
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:04,160
 remade without Charles Lee Ray. But now in 2020, the original version of the franchise is getting

1500
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:11,760
 a 10 episode TV series. That is Chucky. Is that your answer? Let's see if Chucky is correct.

1501
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:21,280
 Oh, wait. Give me a minute. You did not give me a minute. You did not give me a minute to ask what

1502
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:30,240
 the thing was. Come on. Come on. You got it. Relax. And I'm closing out the game and the

1503
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:36,480
 category this time in English for 800. The American version of this film came out in 2010,

1504
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:42,080
 despite the original also being in English and coming out in 2007. Peter Dinklage plays the main

1505
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:50,160
 antagonist in both films. Huh? American version of this film came out in 2010.

1506
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:57,760
 Was this the station agent? Gotta be right. I'll say the station agent.

1507
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:02,960
 Oh, it's death at a funeral. No, I think the station is just older than that.

1508
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:11,120
 Yeah, I didn't remember when I saw the station agent. Oh, well. Oh, I got that wrong. Yes.

1509
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:18,240
 And that is the game. Paul eked out a victory with 8,000 points. Matt is in second with 1,000

1510
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:24,480
 points. And again, thanks to Peter Dinklage. I am in third with 600 points. And that's from M.L.

1511
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:29,520
 Kennedy. Thank you, M.L. Kennedy. If you want to send us a scooper to your appraisal, Scryte,

1512
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:35,680
 Jack vs. Nerd or Annapolis, Jack vs. Nerd, head on over to HayScoops.com. HayScoops.com right there

1513
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:41,520
 on the home page. You can send us any of those things. Go do it. It's awesome. All I was doing

1514
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:46,160
 is trying to find the category of Blade Runner and I thought Blade Runner was going to be an answer

1515
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:55,120
 and I couldn't find it. Nope. I just answered true grit and then sat back and rested on my laurels.

1516
01:28:57,120 --> 01:29:00,240
 Thank you, M.L. Kennedy. I also want to thank Pengeleff for creating this podcast.

1517
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:04,080
 Thanks, Ben. I also want to thank. Did you send the list, Jacob?

1518
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:08,880
 I did. We don't have a new list yet, but we will get one before the month is over.

1519
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:14,720
 It's early October. Yeah. So we'll thank all the people who get to join us on Patreon all the time.

1520
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:21,200
 I can also get discounts. No, that's not true. I was going to say discounts at the shop. So I think

1521
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:24,400
 we explained it before, but I'll explain it again. We had to stop giving out discounts at the shop

1522
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:29,520
 because they wouldn't give us codes that lasted long. There are too many bots out there that comb

1523
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:34,320
 the internet for codes and offer it to people. I'm sure you all have an app on one of your computers

1524
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:38,480
 that offers you to run a bunch of discount codes through and that's why we can't offer discount

1525
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:46,160
 codes at our shop anymore. I thought about that today. I ordered something last night and I got

1526
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:50,400
 the thing today and as I was ordering it, they had a little like, "Oh, here's where you enter

1527
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:55,040
 the discount code." I was like, "Oh, this never works. I might as well try it." And I looked up

1528
01:29:55,040 --> 01:30:02,080
 one and got a 40% off discount code. Whoa. I was like, "Oh, this is why our shop can't do this."

1529
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:06,720
 You're better off with those bots. Yeah. Anyway, but we still have a shop available

1530
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:10,720
 with all kinds of really cool stuff for sale. Check that out over at storejingle.com.

1531
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:20,800
 Oh, I wasn't ready. Store jingle, a big store song. We got a store.

1532
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:29,680
 It just makes people so happy, that song. It does. Yeah. But basically, this podcast is awesome.

1533
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:35,600
 Your podcast is helping pay for very expensive internet here as I'm out in the ocean,

1534
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:41,600
 just so I could do Zoom calls. Literally, this podcast would not be possible.

1535
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:47,520
 The support that we get over at preachingfun.com. Head over there now and support us.

1536
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,760
 That is absolutely correct.

1537
01:30:49,760 --> 01:31:10,320
 Or if you also didn't know they had remade Conan, head on over to fartsinabag.biz.

1538
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:19,600
 Farts, farts, farts, farts, farts in a bag dot biz.

1539
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:24,000
 That's fartsinabag.biz, that along with preachingfun.com. It takes you over to our Patreon page,

1540
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:29,040
 where for as little as $3 a month, you can help keep this show on the air. It's like Matt said,

1541
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:34,000
 we can't do it without you. It pays for everything that we are able to do here. So if you like the

1542
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:40,080
 show, if you think it's worth more than $0, preachingfun.com, fartsinabag.biz. Those are

1543
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:45,440

1544
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:48,400
 hopefully you like it, because we like it. I hope you do too.

1545
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:51,760
 Stay tuned, because we didn't even get into our very passionate and well-thought opinions

1546
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:54,960
 about Bad Bunny being the halftime show. So we didn't get into that.

1547
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:59,920
 Very passionate. A lot of opinions.

1548
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:04,880
 Anything you should get tricked into a debate on online is whether or not you have very strong

1549
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:09,760
 opinions about who's going to play for 20 minutes in between the Super Bowl.

1550
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:15,120
 A football game. A football game being played by teams that are as of yet unknown.

1551
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:22,640
 I've started asking people who do say bad things about Bad Bunny if they know where the Super Bowl

1552
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:27,360
 is actually being played this year. And so far, the answer to that question has been no, they don't.

1553
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:27,920
 There you go.

1554
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:34,160
 It's as if they already know who's going to watch the Super Bowl and want other people to watch too,

1555
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:37,680
 so they get people who bring in a different audience than someone who's already going to

1556
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:39,840
 watch the Super Bowl. Yeah.

1557
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:43,840
 It is almost like that. What do you know?

1558
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:49,680
 Oh, winner scoop in the chat says, I guess JD Vance said the NFL should drop Bad Bunny

1559
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:56,880
 and hire Lee Greenwood. As someone who has seen Lee Greenwood play live a couple of times,

1560
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:03,920
 I'm just going to tell you, nobody wants that. Nobody wants that to happen, including Lee Greenwood.

1561
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:09,360
 No, no. He doesn't want to have to play live in front of those people. Oh man.

1562
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:12,400
 That ain't Paul McCartney. He's like, fuck this, I'm retired.

1563
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:16,720
 Yeah, it costs money to do. Like you lose so much money in the Super Bowl halftime show.

1564
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:22,080
 And I don't think Lee Greenwood has that money. I don't think he's got that kind of jingle.

1565
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:24,480
 He ain't liquid like that.

1566
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:28,400
 All right. Well, anyhow, thanks for listening. Stay safe out there. We love you all and we'll

1567
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:36,400
 see you soon.

1568
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:14,400
 Oh, apologies to JD Vance, JD Vance. I am so sorry. See ya!
