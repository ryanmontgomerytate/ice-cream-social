 Johnny do you want to go to an ice cream social? Yeah, I'd love to great. Let's go
 We had a party at the house last night I stayed up too late
 I said, were you drinking?
 It's time for Matt Mattingly's ice cream social sitting in Las Vegas
 It's Matt Donnelly sitting in Pittsburgh PA. That's Paul Mattingly also sitting in Las Vegas. It's me Jacob the audio guy
 We're preaching fun. We sure are yee-haw
 Well, I did it guys. I taught my first improv class in a long time
 In a well, I've been teaching other improv classes
 But this is my first structured improv class in a long time where I'm having the same students over and over again
 I got 12. The second woo was for the structure not for the improv class. 12 wonderful students
 You got a good structure and I gotta say I'm I'm a little apprehensive because of course at the end of class
 What do you think I did?
 Fart. I obelisked all of them. I gave everybody I gave everybody a chip
 So, you know everybody a chip. I'm either gonna have some people coming back being like, oh wow Paul
 Okay, or be like who am I learning from good?
 So anyway, yeah
 Exactly, I took the gamble and we'll see but a big thanks again to Justin for getting things cooking again with skit and forgive me
 Yeah, you know, it's it's it's gonna be really good it's a more good stuff happening you haven't figured it out
 Justin Zell's not in it for the money. I don't know. I don't know if you have to figure that out yet
 But or if he is he's bad at it. Well, no, and you know what? Well, the other thing is - neither am I I mean
 You're not teaching improv to make you know, but it is helping me do less target work, which is great
 That's exactly it. That's exactly it
 Yeah, one less day of
 Working at a target that is precisely it. I have cut back to basically three days a week now and
 It's gonna save my ass cuz oh man. Oh
 Cash grab Mattingly. That's right. That's good
 I don't want you walking around target too much because I don't want that sweet sweet dairy air to fade away
 I mean, it's true the word you got to keep them cakes
 Maybe the words of sir mix a lot ringing my ears every day, especially days like today
 But I'm slurping on a little chocolate milkshake. I know when you're sad bands or sit-ups, but please don't lose that
 But no trust trust this this shelf is only intact. This is here, baby. Yeah
 Matt Donnelly, you're back on dry land. Yeah, man. Yes. Yeah
 Attend your party, but literally I haven't been home in a month. So it was like oh
 SJ was like I sent Matt and Sarah
 Text about the party. I didn't I didn't hear back from them
 I didn't say anything to her, but I was like that they are not coming
 Back on land they're not coming to our house
 Two nights in a row got to be have all four of us home with our children
 Yeah, and then of course, yeah, I was on full soccer dad duties last night
 Which yeah, that's lovely around town or whatever. But yeah, how are the boys?
 Did you notice any changes since you were gone?
 Yes, yeah, they got an employment. Yeah, that's a six seven
 Yeah, so I was in the car with my oldest and and
 Somebody goes to school with driving them home and I told it was like, you know
 My son now my oldest son now goes to performing arts middle school. So that means I'm probably impromptu games. That's awesome
 Totally and so we were comparing because I just went home for what the last thing I did was I did it my improv jam room
 Which I want to talk a lot about on the show. Yeah
 But we were going over improv games and I said, yeah, these are games
 I started playing when I was like 16 17 years old and they started laughing
 And I said wait 16 17 counts as six seven. Ah
 Did they did they get called out doesn't really like oh, yeah. Yeah, they're laughing. Yeah. Yeah good
 No, no, they're not subtle about it. Like we're driving the car. My kid is like perfect time
 I look at it says six or seven on the on the dad
 Like it's not so it's everywhere. It's everywhere. Yeah. Yeah easiness
 The new South Park is is all it's all of it. Also, they all know that it means nothing. Yeah, right, right
 Yeah, it's just gibberish. This is just you know
 They know that like it just happened to be in a song and then some guy did a little tick-tock and it's all out there
 Yeah, it's just a vaguely annoyed some of their parents. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
 so yeah, but I
 went
 Theotic clumsy they were just laughing at the idea of you being young. Yes, that part is definitely
 Well, I don't think even we were putting together the improv lineup we're like, you know
 I know it's been 27 years. We do this has been 27 years
 We did that I go can we we should stop saying 27 years. It's definitely been 31 years
 That's what's blowing my mind when I'm teaching again like 21 years
 One of my students asked me straight up
 I'm like 20 years and I'm like wait, I've been teaching like 22 years and if I've been teaching 22 years, I've been improvising
 Oh my god, no, let's not go down this rabbit hole
 This is no press rabbit hole for any of us to go down
 But this is like what I'm just talking about like as my buddy Pat my buddy Pat
 He's gonna be doing the Tierney's thing with us this Thursday
 I found out that I've been spelling his name wrong for our entire friendship, which was embarrassing
 He was like, I'm pretty sure we talked about this multiple times. I was like I have a
 False memory of you telling me how to spell your name properly where I it's Pat Shepard
 I've been spelling it with the second. I've been fun at Sheppard and
 Okay, I thought for a fact. That's actually what he instructed me to do one time
 He's like like it's like Shep and Hart and I was like great and I literally had a conversation with him
 Like just like three days ago or he was like, nope
 Never said that never starts to do that definitely been all ease on my last name the entire time. You've known me
 Was like how do I make up for the fact that I've been spelling you like I can't
 That's like there's no mea culpa. Like we're lifelong friends. Like we are
 Retire improv lives and I I think the only thing that you can do here is tell him how to spell your last name
 Incorrectly, yeah, let him spell it correctly the rest of your life
 My braves really racking like possible like big-time solutions because it's so embarrassing
 How do you undo 30 years of mistakes like like it's also like it's the number one bitch behind my back, right?
 If you're like guys need to spell my fucking name, right? We're supposed to be brothers
 You know, right like I have no defense for being like if there's any sense of like I am a fucking ogre selfish ogre
 It's like I never learned how to spell. I was better than what I thought you meant though
 I thought you meant you were misspelling Pat. No
 PIT Pat
 And it's not like we're casual friends
 No, like possible side effects many press releases many articles many listings of who's playing in the shows
 I've put out his name numerous times and shout it to the rafters with incorrect spelling just 30 years. I
 I don't think I don't think that you can change it. I think the only way forward is to continue on
 When he was like no, we've definitely conversations about I think well clearly I don't remember I go
 I would I just want to say clearly one. I'm sorry and two
 This wasn't some elaborate trolling that I've been doing up for 30 years. Like I don't
 I know I'm capable of these bits
 Oh man side note on the word bit
 Fucking so jealous Amy Poehler great podcast and she's in two people about two elaborate bits
 One is the guy Cole Escala who wrote the Oh Mary Mary. Oh, yeah. Yeah
 So they are so fucking funny there. He has a bit where he calls someone and on their voicemail
 He leaves a message as if he's talking to someone else's voicemail about the person so he's talking about having to kill the person
 He's leaving a message for to another person
 Yeah, so like if I called Paul, I'd be like, what's up, Jacob? Look, it's got to go down Paul's out of hand
 Yes, yeah we have to murder Paul so that's a bit he does with all of his friends that he has to murder these
 Colluding with their other friends to murder that person great
 That's pretty I'm so jealous of that bit and then fucking Aziz and Zari
 His bet on Amy Poehler was fantastic
 so he found out Amy Poehler's kids the names of their best friends and
 So when the kids would visit set Aziz and Zari would walk by on the phone
 Pretending to talk to their best friends and ignoring them
 Ha Amy Poehler's children's best friends. So he would not speak to her children
 He would pretend to speak to their friends and it was it's like, you know
 Dalton or something. Yeah. Yeah, but it was yeah, they're like, oh, yeah. Hey Dalton. No, I haven't seen Amy Poehler's kids around lately
 Yeah, I don't know where they are. I'm sure they're fine, but I don't know where they are. Let's get together
 Let's say this let's do that. Like he's just like
 And I'm like, oh, that's a really good bit that is a really really good thing
 But yeah, yeah, so
 But yeah, so we got together
 Hilariously at Kevin Smith's smod castle. We did the reunion, right? Yes
 And so I just walk in and I'm just surrounded by Kevin Smith
 Everything right they've decorated everything just a ton of memorabilia. I just saw there's a
 He just got the the mall rats poster original art. Yeah, very very recently framed up
 That's the Drew Struzan piece who just just passed away passed away a legendary artist Drew Struzan
 Yeah, so he did I mean really it's worth looking up that guy
 He did every movie Oh everything that we grew up with for sure. Yeah, he did. Oh, yeah
 Yeah, that is that's something that I've been wanting to get into kind of quietly for a long time as old movie posters
 And start collecting those but that is the bar to entry getting into that kind of collection is intense
 Well, if you're getting like because I mean what he bought was the original
 Painted work, right? Yeah
 Right, which is even crazy. Yes, it's like 30 30. I'm not even looking at that kind of stuff
 But yeah, it's even just the original prints though. Oh sure
 in movie house
 Because a lot of those are double printed right so they can be illuminated from the back and that kind of thing a lot
 Of more double printed or a lot of them have like multiple things with the with the silver bay. It's all yeah. Yeah
 Yeah, all right. Sorry to completely derail, but yes
 And you're full of all this memorabilia
 Even one part there's a the poster with like that's one of those stereoscopic vision posters for you. Oh, yeah
 Yeah, sailboat the schooner. Yeah. Yeah, and so that James had a bob underneath and then Jay talking
 I have a button that was misprinted and has Simon Bob talking with the comic book bubble
 Oh funny. It's one of my like what's one of my like little piece of memorabilia
 I'm keeping for it should be valuable in there. It's a misprint
 So it turns out Kevin Smith decided to do a mall rats full cast reunion video
 I mean the movie watching and Q&A with the entire cast on the same exact night as my
 Did you get him a chip that's all I want to know that's all I know I
 Know I know if I know if Matt got him a chip or not
 No, this is this is I've already shared on this pot
 I believe some of my friend wrote me like hey, maybe we can get a picture of Kevin Smith, and I said maybe you can
 I'm all for you know forgiveness and sleeping dogs lies like that, but I'm not like about to initiate like hey
 It's me not on that night not on that night, right?
 Hey while you're back together the entire cast of all rights. Do you remember kicking me out of a film?
 I just want you to know that I'm
 By the way, I don't know if you've heard this thing called a podcast, but I have one here, please
 You've heard of this thing called a podcast mr. 18 podcasts
 So yeah, there's no in on me
 That you remember kicking me off of a movie 20-something years ago
 The only thing that was funny is that I basically ran right in
 I was crossing the street, and he was rounding the corner
 And then there he was and I literally just stopped dead in the sidewalk and the crosswalk
 Walked backwards and just let I just like I don't even want to be able to
 See me it happens to recognize me. I don't want this to happen right here. Yeah, I was like no
 I thought I was gonna be okay if we just happen to run each other it literally happened. I was like nope
 I'd rather just let it
 My heart was like just you do your thing tonight, I'll do mine, and we'll just be happy, okay
 Let's just get through the rest of our lives man
 Worry about this no no we got plenty in our lives. We could just move on
 Nothing is plenty of dirt on top of that hatchet right nothing buries that hatchet plenty
 So I'm not saying nothing buries it to the point where it's not embarrassing the next time you have to have a conversation
 Yeah, because the truth is it's a 90% chance. He doesn't remember at all
 You know I mean like this is just a chance. He does not remember whatsoever
 You know and I also have to remember that that film did not become like American Pie
 It's enough to go on to do like I can't it wasn't all rats
 I bring up the movie and people go what and you're like yeah
 So so it's like it's not
 I even you know the more important is that I buried the hatchet with Brian who wrote it and had to
 Suffer you know that whole political situation is look at this movie made
 Right, but even I hopped on one of his Instagram lives
 And it was like he was going over how it just came out on on DVD now
 You can just buy it. Yeah, and then I popped on his Instagram live
 And he's just going over how amazing the cast was and everything was amazing and I was like no
 Maybe I'm not totally over it. Okay. Bye, and I just kind of clicked off the live to be like that's enough
 You know so I've still you know I've still spoken with everyone
 In it we've all we've all done everything else with our lives. It's all fine, but I just was like oh god
 What a funny curveball to just have
 You know there's a lot around the block not for improv jam. You know there's a
 bit right but
 We got in there they set up a little stage for us in the movie theater and
 We sold out we sold out the show and it was a house and
 and I
 Met holding a grudge. I'm shocked and surprised. I'm doing my best to not be a jersey stereotype all right
 I'm trying to be an evolved person
 You're doing great, buddy. You're doing great
 It's only who doesn't hold a grudge the guy who ran improv jam because I left that in a very fiery political way
 You know 20 some odd years ago
 Yes 20 something years ago when I wanted to show Kevin Smith what what I took my college money and funded a TV pilot with
 My in-buff group not our in-buff group mine. I left
 my hometown in-buff group started my own in college and took the most inexperienced group and decided they were the ones I wanted to
 Work with and we did a TV pilot with them again that became a real TV show
 Maybe I wouldn't be invited back to the region, but again it went on didn't know success like the other like the movie
 Just a bunch of people holding grudges throwing money around and no one's better for it
 And in fact like there was like the original cool group of the show and then there was like the class that came right after us
 we're all reunited right because
 My buddy Pete never left the the group and so he stayed on and and and bonded with another the crew that came right after us
 So it really was like two classes of the show reuniting
 30 years later and I was laughing because someone's like where do these new guys come from and I was like
 Well, they came from the fact that Tom Pat and I quit and started our own group and went up north to Jersey
 so it created a vacuum of
 availability for the cast so
 You're like oh I can answer that question. Yeah hoisted by your own
 Exactly. So it was a 14 person cast all of us playing games. We haven't played in years
 I'm the most recent holy shit. That's a lie
 And Jacob you're gonna laugh at this, right?
 So they put together a game and Pete did a good job distributing all the games all the different people. Ah
 And he gave to Jeopardy and he went to Jeopardy and he was like blah blah blah
 He goes in Lance you'll host and Lance made a face and I literally froze. I go I go freeze. Oh Lance
 I go yeah
 Have you was hosting jeopardy your thing when you did the show that was not part of your your cast
 He's not not really I go. Do you know how to host jeopardy?
 And he goes no, I go, okay
 Switch games with me. I will host jeopardy you you do this other game. Yeah
 It's like and I said, I'm really sorry
 I was like I don't want to like step on anyone's toes
 I go but hosting jeopardy is super hard and I just made this mistake. I just made this mistake
 I made our audio guy with no improv background host jeopardy and I forgot that the jeopardy host is the hardest job in that game
 Right. It is to sell everyone's jokes. You have to repeat and sell everybody's jokes
 And you have to move the show along based on the funniest answer and you have to get a sense of whether someone else
 Might have a funnier answer. It is not you just throw somebody in to do it or whatever. And so I
 It's a showrunner more than yes. It's a showrunner more than an imp like now. I know exactly what to do
 Do it but like that day I was like, oh y'all want what now? Yes
 We got on stage. It was like, oh, it's this. Yes. I see that. Yeah, even when it's the most like it's the most like joke like
 Pimping you into making dumb jokes, right? It's it's even harder than 185 or those games. Oh, yeah, and so
 I hopped on that grenade Jacob and I was like, no, I'm hosting. I'm hosting jeopardy how to go
 Oh, it went really well. It went really well
 I mean the most thing was that honestly like the thing was that Michael Keefe was the guy who ran improv jam when I was a kid
 he was the funniest person I'd ever seen when I went and saw that show like he was so funny and
 I was steal his bits and do his bits in high school and get attention for it
 and then I finally got in the show and got to perform next to him and
 When we all got together, you know, he's he was older than us and and so
 You know, I could but I could see him like he had 14 people. He's bouncing 14 people and I could see that
 He was like not like he was kind of champing up a bit a little bit to be funny
 And he was kind of you know, all right, right?
 He was kind of making sure everyone's getting getting fed or whatever. And so when dating game came around I just was like
 He was explaining the three kids. I go. Nope. There's four contestants in this one Mike and you are contestant number four
 And so I threw him in a dating game and then and then also I was up for jeopardy and I turned to Pete
 I go I'm gonna do it again and he's like people up here. I go
 Nope, there'll be four people playing in jeopardy tonight Mike for and you're playing in that one as well
 We're doing this
 Yeah, I
 The only I was really happy for myself was
 That like I because I had departed and even reconciled and departed multiple times on
 shaky ground I actually just straight up after after his last game just said by the way everybody like all of us are here and
 All of us went on to different things with our lives over the conference that came from doing this show
 Please let's give Mike a proper round of applause for what he's done for everybody here and we got standing ovation in the theater
 I was happy because I I
 Really like I said, I I I was very driven and
 Certainly at times very egotistical and I was definitely enough through my own thing and I had my own political battles with that
 Of course when you look back, you're like boy, am I just a dumb 18 year old kid in those arguments, right? Yes
 And that show just meant so much to me and I did not
 realize the nostalgia
 Factor I was too busy trying to make sure that we were getting 14 people into a show
 I knew I was pretty experienced compared to some of the other people coming back. I was really trying to make sure
 You were the most practice, you know the most recently practiced. Yeah, and so I was trying to really just kind of make sure
 you know because our shows with Brad and
 Jonathan, I mean that's like keeping up with fucking two amazing Titans, you know
 I certainly felt like very in shape for this reunion, right? Yeah
 I
 Did not give myself like the I did not for a second
 I was like, oh wait, you're going back to the epicenter of your entire creative life
 Do you know what I mean? Like you're going back to where you were 16 17 and you started doing
 I'm so young at hip
 No, like so like my buddy Tom who had a stroke nine months ago and we were literally just told like check in with his wife
 day up
 like whether he would make it or not whether he'd want to play or not or whatever and
 So
 Tom walked in and my buddy Nick
 Those are the guys that were in this show before I get in those the guys that I looked at be like I want to
 Play on stage with those guys, right?
 He just walked in the first person saw was Nick and I just saw Tom and Nick hug and just seeing those two together
 I literally just started lose it like right there. It was like five o'clock the shows at eight. Oh, you were done
 Yeah, I was like good lord, you know
 Yeah, and I just wasn't really all this was like how the hell do we make this 14 person improv show?
 The bunch of people haven't practiced go. Well, that's all that was on my mind
 the entire time going into this this has this has to be good, you know, and
 I was not prepared emotionally to be like nobody you're going back to like day one
 You're going back to like the starter space on the game board
 and it was really crazy to just feel those other people playing games and going like that that like I was feeling 17 was like
 Oh, I love this game. I want to play this game, too
 You know like I was like I want to all the games like all and I just was like right back to being a 17 year
 old just like love on the show also like this weird thing like
 Mike came from
 sack beater in Orlando
 They start they coach the crowds and they say
 But before every scene seen in and the whole crowd goes five four three two one
 Arts that's fun. It is fun
 And none of us took it off on our separate improv endeavors
 Like Elvis went off to do other improv endeavors and we never did that so we were all just waiting to be introduced and he coached
 The crowd and doing it and hearing a full theater do the countdown again
 We all all 14 of us back 13 of us mics on stage all 13 of us went home
 like we like
 We all just got hit in the stomach with a bowling ball like right off the bat like before we even hit the stage
 It was like this crazy
 nostalgia of it and
 It was awesome
 everybody really
 Impressed me
 Everybody was really held their own and did all the right things to start all the games and the crowd was into it
 There's a lot of people who was their first improv show
 Which I was going to see their first improv show. Yes, because it was listed on the Smodcastle newsletter. Oh
 So like half the crowd was nostalgic people
 We're just like oh, I want to go see some yeah, and it being fucking 30 years a lot of people brought their kids
 Who were the same age as we were?
 Like when we were watching the show a lot of people were showing their kids what they watched when they were their age
 And that was a really big trip
 And yeah, it was just it was it was just a blast it was just a crazy night out and yeah
 we did all the old games and
 It was it was it was a crazy nutty
 Thing to do. I was really glad we did it. I can't imagine doing it again anytime soon
 And then with that in mind we're only getting older right so like right to wait 30 years to do it is
 Crazy, and then you're like, well 10 more years than I'm really weird because there was no way we can do all that shit
 You know even when Mike went up we made him do a motion roller coaster
 and
 That was always like this is the strangest thing about this show is that that was our closer
 Before we did a music we did we did we would close with a song at the very end
 But the last game we'd play is emotional roller coaster which basically was a tip of the cap to whoever we thought was
 Hot shit right that person got to do all the emotion changing so like our way of ending our show was like now one
 Person gets a show off for you like it's really weird. It's like really weird to look back, so I was like oh
 Mike is gonna change Mike. We'll make Mike change
 I'll do the last game and they'll okay and to incorporate everyone else had everyone else called the different emotions
 I just went down the line to every performer, and they and they all change their
 emotions or whatever, but I was like
 We made such a weird show that was oddly popular, and it was not like
 It was not a wholesome
 Improv everyone gets along we're all looking out for each other kind of thing
 It was a very looking back on it. We were all like young hungry comedians
 It was very competitive it was very much like I I've earned my right to do a motion roller coaster
 Like those things came back into my head
 You know like it's not like a and not a formula that you can just go and recreate
 With a with a different group either it sounds like no I mean this is like I said
 I've had the I've had the a very blessed improv life, right?
 So I've gone off to many other places and seen short form along form shows everywhere
 And when I say things like oh, we would close with the motion roller coaster people go like what like that's a starter game
 That's like a one. That's that's a first three gamer and most people's repertoire. This is just a silly throwaway game
 But like and I said and I've said this when I came back to them
 I go you know every short form show basically becomes a review like it basically becomes a kind of a rehearsed deal
 Where you do things with a certain energy you you you you perform it a certain way
 And you basically also kind of maybe steal other people's bits and jokes to create like a greatest hits version of this game
 Which this is inevitable it's inevitable it happens every theater that was everywhere and no one wants us to admit it
 But basically but that's what right why why those shows basically when you come in you go
 Oh because I love trying to sit in with every group and try to get everyone's vibe
 And it was always very interesting to see like what elements of their shows were just like oh
 This is just a piece like even though this is an improv game. This is a set piece that I can't help
 I can't walk onto this I can't help this out
 I have to hands off this piece for this particular group
 They have a thing that they do on this one
 And it's part of what made me hate short form for a long time
 It's part of what made me resent it as not improv and and maybe like a long form zealot for a good
 You know 15 years after the fact, you know, like it was like I'm doing actual improv and you're doing a review, you know
 But as I get older and we learned Paul with our various endeavors in Las Vegas is sometimes putting together review is really fucking hard
 Sometimes it can be really not funny at all. Yeah, very easy. It's very easy to fuck up games. Yes
 I mean it they're gent. They're, you know generated to help you succeed
 But if you don't know the tricks and if you don't know how to intro the fucking thing, right look out
 Mike comes from snack theater. Thanks sectors. We're Jonathan Wayne Brady Nathan Fillion. All those guys came from
 A lot of friends that Paul and I have came out of there. And yes, they'll be quicker money like oh when you intro this game
 Don't forget this bit, you know, like so we did jeopardy. I forgot that we used human buzzers, right?
 So we bring humans up and then Mike literally goes. Oh, don't forget
 We have say before we start the game you put your buzzers down
 And then I go. Oh, I forgot. I totally forgot about that bit and then I said, oh, yeah
 All right before we start the game go ahead because just put your buzzers down and they all start insulting the people who came up
 to help them
 And it gets a huge laugh and I was like fucking bits man the fucking little show little zings
 It just keep keep things flowing keep the energy high and and it's it's another one of the things
 I've you know again, I love teaching level one because it always keeps me on my toes keeps me
 Remembering that it's basics basics basics always and that's just it like just reminding people that it's a show
 Reminding people that they can relax and we know what we're doing even though we don't that's it
 It's that we know we're doing like Jonathan. You're in good hands Jonathan
 Megan does a bit if you put Jonathan charge of writing something down you have to remember that he does this bit and
 And I've only done, you know, however shows with him
 but he he you start you start saying things for Jonathan to write down and
 And then you wait and like the third one you go you get in all this Jonathan and he will go
 Oh, no, I'm just drawing a cat and they'll turn over the pad and show that he's just drawn a cat and written nothing down
 Yeah, and that and that bit if you nail it kills feels like if you do it wrong too too soon
 If you forget he was doing the bit, he'll finish it himself
 It goes okay, but you have to remember that Jonathan does the bit where if he picks up the bat, he's gonna draw a cat
 And those are the things that make it a review and not a pure show
 But it's the kind of thing that makes an art school like all these guys these guys have a back pop
 They got together. Yeah little stuff
 when we did our
 our show on
 Saturday the teacher show I just grabbed a few pieces like, you know, we're doing puppets
 I'm just you know, the old make sure no one touches the bikini zone
 that's just one little thing like that's a little throwaway line, but it just gets a laugh and gets everybody, you know going and
 at the top of
 We were doing to start and we did a little 20-minute lot or so long form, you know after an interview
 The interview was pretty heavy. And so at the end of the interview, I was like, okay
 So what we're about to do now is a little bit of a long form piece
 It's gonna be a little more theatrical more scenic things might come in might go away might come back
 You might see characters return in different times or whatever, but that's what's gonna be a little more theatrical a little more long form
 And it's all intended to be comedic which I've grabbed from you
 And then and it just ends it with them like and then they're been the audience laughs cuz they're like, you know
 But it's good to remind them that yeah, we're trying to be funny here, even though we just talked about some really deep shit
 Right is I've added to that before I go. I'll pause and go like I go like the whole time
 It's gonna be comedic like the whole time
 And I only added that bit because commies gotten dicier as it ever as we've gotten older, you know, that's it gotten different
 Well, we were interviewing this gal and just stuff just kept coming up, you know
 And and she's like, you know just some heavy stuff and and and she's like and I you know
 she's in this meeting and like stuff is getting very
 Politically charged and partisan for no good reason and it feels oh boy. And so I'm like and I'm like
 No, I really appreciate you
 Telling us that you know human rights are partisan now cuz I wasn't 100% but now I get it
 Okay, this is good. Cuz yeah, because that's what you know
 That's what she was dealing with was just these insane things that are happening because it is it's insane times. It's insane times
 Cuz like Nick right like his specialty was to bring in political stuff or do a little satire
 Uh-huh, and he was saying after the show that he felt weird that he couldn't play the way he normally played because no
 Satire is dead baby. Satire is dead. It's just it's just too much to throw in an audience
 How can you make fun of this shit? It makes fun of itself. I know it's beyond parody. Yeah
 So yeah. Yeah, I mean
 Yeah, just just just a fucking crazy I said, oh so
 One of the games we play is a game called space jump and the way space
 It's kind of a freeze tag ish game except that, you know
 One person starts off dancing you call freeze you come and you make a scene based on the way that person's frozen
 Two-person scene they keep doing something physical freeze something changes it third person comes in and you go
 What typically our show we have five or six people in the ship in the cast
 Six person would come in first and leave first
 So you do you do a six person scene and then they find a reason to leave and you go right back to that five person
 scene
 You would keep adding as they come in you tagged out you just nobody tagged out
 You just it just grew more and more it from the freeze. Okay, cool
 So pkpels like we're gonna do a 14-person space jump
 Oh, and I laugh really hard and he like he had like a moment daddy goes, right? I think oh, I'm sorry
 Yes, we're definitely absolutely
 I'm already laughing at it. It's great
 yeah, I know my hand like this might take a half hour like like this might take up the majority of our things or whatever and
 And it is intended to be comedic and instead everyone everyone may have like they're opening lines all of them
 And so the guys either call or call in response freeze
 big laugh on big laugh on the freeze and so it was like lightning fast all the way up to 14 and then it became this
 Hilarious game of trying to remember all of them on the way out. Oh, right
 I can that what we're doing. What are we doing? Yeah, everyone's gonna try to be like who's seen is it who's
 And it was just and it just paid off huge and it's easy for like 14 and 13 maybe even 12
 Yeah, you get down to like 11 10 and then you get like eight and nine. Yeah
 They're frozen there were hands up holding a casket and when I see the physicality change
 So they litters like six people staring at each other
 And then one guy finally goes up we drop the casket
 So
 Yeah, just so many moments my dad came out check it out. Oh wonderful. Nice. And I said man, it's been a while
 I've worked hard to get in this show. He goes. Oh, yeah, you were terrible when you started
 I was like not wrong not wrong
 He literally like betrayed like it was a vivid memory in his mind of me having stage fright the first time I was in the show
 Really? Yeah, and he was like you were like and he posed as me like frozen on the sidelines
 I was like, that's exactly what happened in my first show. I was absolutely
 totally
 stage-fritten
 Past tense, but yeah. Yeah, I was I was just
 Yeah, it was it was it was a really crazy crazy emotional experience to go for Wow
 You know, who else doesn't know how to say the word frightened. That's the following sponsor
 I like stage-fritten
 Is brought to you by
 Spanx for skanks. Yeah, sorry
 Magic Shell scoop in 2024. That's Spanx for skanks
 Hey, I'm crack hard
 Jessica and I love me some crack. I
 Also love to look fit and tight in my Louboutin's and my hot couture
 So after I smoke some crack I throw on some Spanx but not just any Spanx
 Spanx for skanks their number one customer is me crack or Jessica and my crack pipe
 These skank Spanx are built for skanks like me. They got a crack pipe holder
 They got a place where you could put your weed. They got a place where you can pee right in them when you're wearing them
 Nobody see that's right
 These things are made for skanks. You can skank these Spanx up like nobody's business and nobody will even know
 Meanwhile, I'm walking the red carpet high as fuck and don't nobody blink because I'm wearing skank Spanx
 Everybody thinks I got it all together. I don't the only thing that's holding me together
 He's tight-ass undergarments, but I'm pissing in them and don't nobody know
 So I say that's a win
 You take that skank home and you just open it like like like a mattress that was just delivered you slowly get those
 Spanx off
 They only last for 12 hours, that's the Spanx can't guarantee 12 hours
 But after that, it's like the fucking
 It'll pumpkin your ass real hard
 So watch it watch watch your time girls set your watches and shit cuz that stuff will explode
 Enter a scoops of checkout
 The worst part about that is her parents named her crack whore Jessica
 Determinism
 Yeah
 Yeah, so I just got back from the doctor got my neck ultrasound good times
 Oh boy. Yeah, you got the results of this neck ultrasound. The lady said things are running back
 So it'll be like a week or two and I said well heading out of town now. She's like, well, that's great
 So yeah, it'll be like probably two weeks. There's nothing with my neck. That means I can't fly because I'm gonna go fly exactly
 That's the one thing I kind of thought I was like well if I do have any kind of artery problems
 I guess the flights gonna just do a number of whatever who cares
 You're gonna figure it out. I can promise you at 50 feeling the way I do
 My blood is not flowing as perfectly as it should be I can say that definitively
 I think it's I don't think there's any major blockages or anything
 But but I could I could stick it stand to be better. I'm sure one of our friends came to the house last night
 And he had uh, what he said at first was that he nicked his lip shaving and then it was bleeding profusely
 Yeah, I thought that was odd. It turned out. It was the like the the beard clippers
 Okay, the clippers like got in there. Yeah, like took a little hunk out of his lip
 So there's like a deep deep deep dig there. Yeah
 But it was bleeding for a couple of hours. It was my gosh like
 Fusely for it because it was right on his lip. It was right on like the the not above where your mustache is
 But like down on the lip. Yeah. Yeah. So anytime he would
 Smile move his lip and move his mouth at all. You know, just open right back up. Oof
 Yeah, this is this is how we live now
 You can remind him that of course the
 The area of the mouth and eyes are the first to heal. So there you go
 Mm-hmm
 I'm laying down and she she gooed
 she put a towel under my neck and everything and then she she gooed me up with the jelly and then she did and then she
 Ultrasounded me and I got to hear my heartbeat for the first time on the monitor
 I really felt like I was my own baby. It was really interesting
 Boy
 We can hear a heartbeat we've got a heartbeat I could hear whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh, you know that that sound
 Through with the heartbeats. I was like, oh she had to do that eight different times and find it just right out and it
 Was like oh I can hear him. He's in there
 It was really interesting to hear my own blood
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm like all that sweet baby boy he's bleeding inside. He's just a gushing and a swishing
 But from my untrained ear sounded pretty much the same on both sides
 So I don't think there was anything. All right. Did they tell you like what they're looking to diagnose? Yes
 They're looking because again because it was isolated to my left eye
 right because this is all from a few weeks ago when when they went to an eye exam and they had a
 Moment of they did they saw something they didn't like in your eye and it was
 Bleeding there is retinal hemorrhaging. Yes
 So they went and they you know, I went to the eye doc the expert and they checked it out
 I don't have anything going on with the right or I didn't at least
 And so but I still have had no vision impairment. No vision changes still ongoing and you still look great
 I mean, thank you. Thank you. But the concern was there are you know, the arteries that go back and forth there
 They the concern was because it was isolated to one eye that it could be some kind of blockage or some kind of impediment as
 To the going or coming of the blood in that area. So that's what they're flushing out and then and then
 She's like, I'm gonna you know
 Check both sides you got any questions or anything and I was like, well, I mean
 I just I know that the focus is on the left because it is only isolated to the left and and and that and that was
 Kind of the weird thing. She's like, well, they check both sides in order to kind of get a baseline of what is normal
 And then I went all right. Oh, yeah, of course. This is the every
 every day
 Medical exam of the the the Joe layman, right you get up. You're like, oh shit that really hurts over here
 What the hell and you feel it and then you feel the other side and you're like, oh, that's pretty much the same
 I'll be okay. Yeah, right. That's the
 Whole thing you do the symmetrical nature of our bodies. That's what we do. We go. Ooh my knee. What's it?
 Okay, how's this one? No, that's pretty much the same. All right, we can always do like a to be comparative shopping
 That's exactly right. Exactly. So that's why as far as I know my liver is fine
 That's one of the tricky ones it's the internal stuff that gets really tricky
 External stuff is a little bit easier to diagnose from the self
 Quote-unquote, but yeah, that was what but I thought that was he checks his left penis than his right penis. Yeah
 Yeah, well as a Klingon I do have to
 Yeah, yes, it is the Echidna but well now that's exactly with you know checking everything
 In fact, I think it is Santa Claus who was the very first to practice this
 Symmetrical diagnoses. Is that right? Yeah, he makes a list. He checks it twice
 Find out if it's an ass if it's an abscess or not. Yeah, Santa Claus is rectal exam
 Yeah, that's it. I'll give a shout out to a Sparta Avenue stage who hosted me for two shows
 Friday night before my improv reunion up in Sparta, New Jersey
 I
 Sold out the first show and then no one likes to stay out late in Sparta. No
 sidewalks roll up at eight, huh? Yeah
 But no, I didn't know about that out here first crowd
 They I think they gave me a standing ovation. All right. Wow, fantastic
 And they weren't just leaving. No, they weren't just standing up to leave. It was a legitimate standing ovation
 I didn't say wait guys turn around just do it this way
 You didn't you didn't say hey everybody. Let's give it up for children with cancer. Yeah, I blew garbage at them
 Cancer babies, huh?
 Stand up for cancer babies. Thank you. Good night. Oh
 Side side note. I was on the cruise ship with this couple
 there there there there there
 Big time magicians, but they're now more social media people than magicians, but they're violent and misty night
 Yes, and they also sure they work backstage
 With blame when blame comes to town. Oh, okay on Blaine's crew. So I told them that I
 Michael Blaine, I was a so you were in the theater Chris angel was there and then we start talking about story and I surprised
 The next day I gave him Chris angel as a question stickers
 So I give those out at my shows to any Penn Sunday school listen, they love it
 They they asked for an extra one for David. So I gave them. Oh, that's great. Good. Good. Did you give them a chip?
 I they are all chipped up. I don't we can obelisk David Blaine. Our life is complete
 How funny would it be to have David Blaine come do some crazy death defying shit at scoop fest some year at my show
 I say do you listen to podcasts or whatever and I'm jokingly I'm referring to my own and then people feel like I like this
 American life
 And then yeah, nobody says that but I have my chips and stickers ready for that when I kick ass my show
 So that's awesome. They do properly chip people. Oh, yeah, baby
 Obeliskin, baby. No, no, no, but you know what that and that's that's the best way to do it
 Well, that's good because that way if they get lost and somebody else takes them to the vet
 They'll be able to know that they're yours. Well, but you're also your Matt Donnelly's audience. You're on the road
 You've only got so much
 So much capacity
 All your chips at your disposal, so no, I can't literally I'm down to three three pounds of leeway
 Got a good life for it and they are often exactly like 49 and like 47 pounds. Oh, yeah between the two of them
 something goes up to 50 on me and I get man, but
 Yeah, I've definitely multiple times been that guy at the airport
 He's opening both cases and shoving one jacket from one case into the other. Yeah. Yeah all that stuff. So yeah
 No, do you?
 Do you feel a sense of betrayal or maybe this hadn't happened to you at the airport very often?
 It's happened to me once or twice where the scale at the airport is obviously calibrated differently than the scale at my house. Yes
 I'm not saying one of them is wrong and one of them is right because I don't know but they are different and that is
 The most maddening thing that can happen on those travel days
 No, it is and like it's not that it happens like I don't have a scale at home
 I really do just lift it up with my arms and go like this feels about the time where it feels right and I'm actually
 Pretty good, right? I don't want to brag but I will lift any of you up and tell you how much you weigh
 But tell you if you're over or under 50 pounds. Carnival Parker blood. That's it. Just over under 50. That's it. That's the only task
 You're good. You can get that you can get down there. You'll be fine. Oh, you're at least 53
 So when I pack the same exact stuff and it also is like 51 pounds at the airport when I'm going out
 I'm like, no, I packed this exact same case on the way in and it was 49. You jerk. Yeah
 Yeah
 Okay, that's close enough
 Do my original foolish
 Foolish trick but for real just to get a calculator start guessing people's weights
 And then when they say this this thing is 53 pounds
 I rip open my shirt at 53 pounds on a piece of duct tape on my chest and then I rip it off and hand it to them
 Yeah, so wait, what's your question Jacob I
 Don't remember great moving on Jacob. Yeah. Yeah curiosity for you. Actually hit me a guy I came out
 I was unloading groceries
 I left my trunk open and then I got caught in the backyard talking to my family and then okay a guy knocked on the door
 And and I went I came up I was like, I bet my truck is open still and they open he goes
 Hey, why don't you know your trunk is open? I said, oh, thanks. He goes he'd help with your groceries
 No stranger. I do not
 And they goes hey
 We're walking around the neighborhood and we noticed your windows and you beautiful home and we wanted to sell you discount
 Discount windows if you're willing to put our sign in your front yard that I was you're willing to do this and I go wait I
 Turn this down all the time. It's probably the fourth time
 I've turned the guy down with this effort that my house is a model house, but you did this deal right Jacob. We did
 Yeah, did it work out?
 Was everything good? Yes. Okay. Oh, oh, yes. I was everything. Everything was great
 We saved a lot of money and they took some pictures of the house. It feels scammy
 Yeah, right and I was trying to figure it out because I was like wait
 I think Jacob did this and we never got like a bad report after the fact because I think I would have remembered if it
 Went south or something, right? No, everything went great. The the bad the bad thing that happened after it was
 Right out because it's still you know still cost us a pretty penny to do all of it
 But it saved us ended up saving us like three grand maybe maybe thirty five hundred bucks something like that, right? So not nothing, you know
 Yes, the the downturn that happened at the end of that story was right after we did that like a few weeks after we did
 That kovat shut everything down and most of our income stopped coming in immediately after spending a lot of money on windows
 I'm fine not swapping them out. That was us with fake grass
 We like Paul to be like, can you not install the fake grass?
 Like you already cut it so you'd save just the installation fee. It is done
 I was like when you just have like a mountain of sand on your side of your house
 Oh man, I guess go ahead
 But so I'm trying to think of what I think I think it might simply be the the con of it is
 Simply that Anderson windows are the standard Anderson windows are expensive and if you offer cheap windows
 That aren't Anderson and people think they're gonna get shitty windows. And so the discount element just and by complementing your house
 You feel flattered and then the idea that you have to hold an advertising thing to save money is like it's like the same
 It's like as Paul would say taking the bottle of water for the meeting, right? You don't take the water. They offer you water
 You know, it's like you're creating a currency exchange
 Yes, so like I guess like it's simply about like if you want to compete with Anderson and you can buy price
 competing by price doesn't work unless you do this bit is the best I can come up with I
 Don't yeah, cuz ours were ours weren't Anderson, but they were another big brand. I forget what what it was
 But they're they're like two or three brands in in town
 No, it's like one of the big ones
 That's it that's it they they sell windows and anvils never break
 That's it
 But yeah, so it was like another big brand and so he felt okay with it
 He offered me six to seven percent off and then we just laughed at him until he left our yard. He didn't know what
 new windows new windows
 I'll say you also go get some new windows and they're gonna pay full price. That's the following spots
 Oh my today's show is brought to you by
 a
 Greek yogurt. Yep. That's it Greek yogurt from scoop of Henley in 2022. This show is also brought to you by Greek yogurt
 There's a bowl
 And her hey scoops to check out I
 Didn't just shit it I
 Put it in a bowl
 It makes a lot of good points not only it makes a good point good point
 Jesus in the chat is pointing out that it's it's
 interesting that they did take some money off of our windows to
 Pay for advertising and now I can't tell you the brand name of the windows
 Also why we thought it was a con is that your yard gets no
 Visible there's no foot traffic. There's no traffic traffic that goes by your house. You live very you live very lonely
 The the sign thing wasn't the big deal for for ours. No the big deal for ours was the pictures
 Yeah, yeah pictures on the website. Yeah, yeah, that makes more sense because we have because we have a weird-looking house
 That was that I think that was also why they liked our house was because it's different looking for a Vegas house
 Yeah, it looks like a little cocaine compound. That's a cartel
 That's precisely what it looks like. That's what everyone everyone comes to the the barbecue thinks that someone might just break out a machine gun to
 Mow everybody down. Yeah, it's a fair concern. It's a fair concern
 you've almost got like a
 conversation den
 conversation pit designed for the
 Living room. Oh, yeah
 I'm so I am doing the second show at the Sparta Avenue stage of its part of Jersey one of the theater community
 run by awesome people
 And also this is the late-night one sparsely attended
 Yes
 The sparsely attended one and is they boost that is by reaching out to their friends
 Of course is the local magic community surrounding that so my
 Magician to regular human ratio in my second shows a little off sure
 And this is the things like magicians just don't you know as much as they want even the most respectful magician
 It's just hard to be a regular audience member when you're doing magic, right?
 So people who just don't want to do certain they give me look like you don't want to use me for this kind of
 Kind of thing when I'm trying to get people from the audience. I use a lot of volunteers on my show. Yeah
 This one guy was kind of like I busted his balls a little bit and he was a very chatty person
 and then
 So for when I have a small amount of crowds, I don't get new people, you know for for straight-ish Jack
 He's the same folks over and over I just go to the two guys that have stood out the most right?
 Okay, like yeah, it's basically like I can't I can't constantly get two other guys kind of thing
 And so I just call by name they get up quickly to get on the show faster
 and so
 I bring a guy up who I've been messing with a little bit throughout the show and he'd been messing me back a little bit
 But I go to raise the curtain and he covers my face and this is a bit that comes up
 Oftentimes with drunk dudes on cruise ships, right?
 I'm trying to do my finale and I do the joke where they raise the curtain too high to get them to lower it
 I talk over it and then some people think it's funny just to keep covering my face and I let that laugh happen
 And then I try to move on with the trick and then they keep doing it and then I point out to them
 Hey, this bit's getting diminishing returns. Does he have people laughed at it now? They're not just just letting you know
 You're not doing the bit. Let me go. It was a fine bit
 It was fine bit a second ago and this guy won't stop doing the bit won't stop trying to say funny things won't stop
 Trying to upstage me through the entire thing. It basically kicks the all of my jokes right in the dick
 Yeah, I can't
 Can't get it. So it ends fine. The show ends fine. I still short. I still get out. It's still surprising produced beers blah blah blah
 and the show's over and
 then
 he comes right up to me after the show some signing posters right there and hitting on ships possibly and
 After this motherfucker, right and he goes he goes. Hey just want to say I've really enjoyed your show
 I've been a professional magician for the last 34 years. The fuck you have no
 Fuck you have you've been a professional cocksucker. You've been a professional piece of shit
 My head just goes that just can't be true. No
 No can't be the information you're asking you're asking when his last paid gig was
 People paid you to perform magic
 The other magicians who helped me exactly
 Pack up or like that was really weird. He was that was weird of him to do what he did to you
 Yeah, I agree
 Especially if he's coming to be a magician what a fucking asshole and then on top of that because you know
 The way the guy introduced me it felt weird just go right into like whatever and so I started talking about how I became a
 Magician to the second crowd. I was trying to know what's it up front
 So I was trying to like endear them and to be like, hey sure we're hanging out
 So I just told my story learning how to pen dare me learn magic and all that other stuff
 And then I went into my show
 I'll do that if I feel like an audience is like super cagey
 I'll just tell my actual story becoming a magician to be like we're we're we're cool try to change the temperature in the room
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I guess that compelled him to like then he wanted to tell me his entire life story as well
 Oh
 This is great. And then I'm trying to get chips and stickers to two people
 I recognize from coming to my show multiple times. Oh, yeah
 And he almost seems like annoyed where like he gets through a part of his thing
 I was like, oh cool
 And I went like I just let me just get this thing real quick and he seemed like annoyed that I wasn't like hearing him
 Tell me no, you can't
 I'm fine with coming up to you and telling you a story. I'm fine with saying I'm a magician as well
 I'm fine with all this you don't get to be annoyed when the group of people that you're doing the thing with is still a group
 Of people exactly exactly nothing has changed here
 Jeff lumis and Chad says that he has to be your apprentice Jeff in a way. He was asking me to become his apprentice
 Basically was saying like and what did you say? I heard your story and just like you know, I'm way more experienced than you
 You'll probably notice how well I handled you on stage that's just a little taste of what I can do
 Yeah, I know you saw me fucking destroying on there during your fit taking your bit
 Yes, I saw that you destroy my show
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was I it was that was the that was the strangest part of it for sure
 Yeah, did you see chaotic clumsy's line? That's what is that in the future?
 Tell me it's bigger tits to be that irritating
 I am gonna steal that. Yes. Yeah, it's pretty fucking good. Pretty fucking pretty big though. Is there pretty big?
 So you say he was justified yeah
 Yeah, that was that was really really really strange, I'm sorry you had to go through that shit no no no
 I mean I overall had a fantastic night. It was so bright and it was yeah, you know, even even though the audience was a little
 Different, you know for the second show obviously if you do a show that's sold out and you're saying ovation
 The second show is not gonna check all the same boxes. Exactly. Oh, yeah
 Yeah, but you've got that one in your pocket rather than coming off a bad show trying to get the energy back up again
 And it basically like I'm recording both shows
 So it's usually it's I'm finding that the moments that I find most awkward for my shows are making the best reels on my social media
 So I was like, well, this is taped and I'm sure there's more bits to come out of it this way
 I bet I bet the clip of him upstaging me with the bid is gonna make a fine clip for the social media
 But it was uh, yeah, so I just wanted a second show just like great another show. Let's just do it
 But it's super fun super fun
 Yeah, that was just the only thing would you say that you're I don't know roughly eight months away from your family have been worth it
 It feels like it it feels like eight months anything more than two is just yeah
 Everything feels a little weird at home. When SJ said last night she was she was like, oh, yeah
 I texted Matt and Sarah about coming over I hadn't heard from him yet and that I was like, oh Matt has
 You I don't know if you know this Matt has been gone since scoop fest
 Yeah, and also choosing what the scoop us doesn't count as me really being a home either, right?
 Right, you know, like I don't really see anybody
 In the fam, so it was really in there being a really weird thing. So yeah extra week is shit. Yeah
 Yeah, yeah, kids are all grown up. They
 There was like there was like a crisis
 Like my kids soccer team while I was gone that I wasn't there for that was annoying. Oh
 Like
 My youngest kids soccer team
 They don't like they they always keep a certain core group players that always get new players every year
 Okay, and my kid soccer coach is not like, you know, basically as teams get you know
 Move on and say together or whatever some coaches basically recruit, you know
 Basically, oh sure kids hop over to the other team and yeah, my kids coach does not do that
 He just takes takes the random
 Allotment like yeah, I believe that's actually fair to the league, right?
 And probably the the healthier way to go about it as well
 Right. So but what ends up happening is that we end up getting kids who aren't quite in demand for any other team, right?
 And they're not in demand not because they may be bad
 But that sometimes they're not in demand because they don't like trilla. They just don't they don't sure they're not reliable
 don't make they're not reliable and
 so
 Basically my whole season my youngest has been playing with like either one man down or just enough to play the whole game with no subs
 Tire season that's hard
 Babies had a forfeit a game while I was gone and so it's been a bummer to not be there
 For if you had been there for that one
 Would they have let you suit up and and head out on the field to be the last player that they needed?
 I mean, I have my cleats, you know, I have my shin guards
 And I have a forged birth certificate saying that I am ten years old
 Well, they just march it on out
 I don't know if that kids tenure we need to see a birth certificate. You know what?
 Let him play. Don't worry. Do not worry about it
 Your kid can't outrun that guy
 You'll be surprised to know Matt that currently what you just talked about cleats
 Shin guards and a forged birth certificate stating your ten years old are also required to work in a bodega now in America
 Not gonna work for you
 We got an obelisk coming to us today from the upside down under scoop
 This is the one where you have the the pyramid of all the different prices the questions start at two hundred dollars
 They go all the way up to five thousand dollars. We have double downs. We have steals
 We have super steals where we also steal the other person's money and it's a 50/50 thing
 If you miss a question you lose control of the board and that's how the game works
 The $200 questions coming to me first and the question is about famous dick famous dick. I'm not gonna double down
 I'm betting nobody's gonna steal. So, let's see what the question is
 Ron Jeremy was also known as
 Be the hedgehog see the horse or D the whale
 D the whale is a great porn name
 My name is D the whale D the way
 I would say the hedgehog. He was the hedgehog. Absolutely. Yeah

 Oh
 With harvest not far away for us down under hours a day on average
 Do I sit in the tractor doing my thing? Well 24 12 10 or 15 doing my thing is definitely masturbating
 Right, and then these numbers must be minutes or second or a refractory period afterwards
 Let's see here I have no idea so let's go 50/50 on this one. All right
 That got rid of 12 and 10. So you got a 24 or D 15
 Well, he's not 24 hours
 Average 24 hours a day. It's harvest time to start messing for a few months
 Try 15 D 15 and the 50/50 answer has never worked better

 Oh, but you still have a super steel. I do still have a super steel
 You still have a dump. We all still have double downs. Yeah, and definitely not a cult. I'll try a steel

 Protects my points it does this church doesn't officially have cult status
 But it is the starting point for a few cult leaders like David Koresh and George spate
 Scientology Catholic Church Seventh-day Adventist Church or Church of Latter-day Saints
 I mean, I feel like we could just say the Catholic Church is the root of all of it
 But I believe this is seven. Yeah. Yeah. I mean the Catholic Church doesn't have cool compounds. That's true. That's true
 They have one is I mean the Vatican they have one cool compound
 It's not really cool unless you're into fucking kids
 Yeah, allegedly
 We all just stopped and thought about the different jokes we could make and we all decided to just move on that's
 Like no, no, no
 I thought of at least four and I did and I'm passed on all of them
 But here's my offer once again or many running people the Catholic Church fucks a lot of kids that I don't know
 Why that's not if not a bigger deal for again sticking on this earth
