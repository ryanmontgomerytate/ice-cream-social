1

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Thank you so much Ice Cream Truck Drivers.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Right now I'd like to thank Jake Schneider, Jason Klepper, Jeff Harris, Jonathan, Lori Ellsworth, Leon Kasab, Malia, and Mike.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an Ice Cream Social?

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Yeah I'd love to.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Great, let's go.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Hello from a secret location.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 I mean it's Jersey.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Right.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Oh shit, was that a secret?

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Damn it.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 I suck at this.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 It's time for Matt and Mattingly's Ice Cream Social.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Sitting in New Jersey together, it's Matt and Mattingly, Matt, Donnelly, and Paul Mattingly.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Sitting in Las Vegas, it's me, Jeff, I'm the audio guy.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 We're PreachingFun.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 We are not in Jersey, but we can't say where we are.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 We are sneakily outside.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Oh that's right, you are post Jersey.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 We're post Jersey, yeah.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 We're at something that we'll definitely be talking about in the next episode.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 But we are not allowed to talk about it yet.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 But we have other things to talk about, which is like, Paul's really upset, so here Paul, here's five bucks, I'm sorry.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Paul just keeps really on me about those five bucks.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 He came at me last night and he's like, "Hey, you got five bucks for the vending machine, they don't have any changes at the front."

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 I'm like, "Here's five."

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 And then this morning he's like, "Oh yeah, I owe you five bucks."

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 I told you last time I was also good for it, which I'm a man of my word.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 I know, you're good for it. I don't, I'm good.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 I just feel like it's been a subtext this entire morning, we just haven't, you know.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 If I don't have something to hold over your head.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Paul's just...

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 It's acquiring interest.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 I did scare the living shit out of Paul this morning.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Paul thought I died.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Yep.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Were you guys sharing a room?

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 No.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 No.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Okay.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 In that case, I have even more questions.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 That's a key factor, actually, is that we are not sharing a room.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 We parted ways last night and everything seemed to be fine.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 I went and got my sleeps on.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 We had said 10 o'clock meetup in the morning.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 And I get ready, do my thing, 10 o'clock rolls around.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 I look around, no Matt.

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 I go out to check the car, no Matt.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Okay, that's odd.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 I'm chilling for a little bit.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 10, 15, okay.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 I get on, I text Matt.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Let it sit.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 You know, nothing.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Don't hear anything.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Yeah.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 That's weird, you know.

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 And I let it go and Ann calls and we're chatting.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 And then it's 10.30 and I'm like, well, shit, I better call Matt.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 So I call Matt.

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Nothing.

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 It goes right to voicemail.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 I call him again.

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 It goes to voicemail.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 So I'm like, oh no.

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 And then I look at the phone and I start looking at the text.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 He sent the text last night and it was in a chain text.

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 And he hasn't responded to anybody else's stuff.

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 He hasn't liked anybody's stuff.

74
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 I'm like, he hasn't touched this in hours.

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 He's incommunicado with me completely.

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 So I'm like, okay, I gotta go check on it.

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 So I go to his door and I knock and I wait a little bit.

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Nothing.

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 I knock again.

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Nothing.

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 A little more urgently this time.

82
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 The fucking tomb of Imhotep.

83
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 I'm like, well, I'm going to the front desk to report my friend's dead.

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 We were supposed to meet at 10.

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 It's like 1040.

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Then I start walking to the fucking desk.

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 And sure enough, I'm almost to the front desk and I get a buzz on my phone and it's Matt.

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 And he's like, oh, I slept through my alarm.

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Yeah, you fucking did.

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 He thought I was the housekeeping again.

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Yeah, the knocking.

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 I thought it was the housekeeper being like, well, my alarm isn't going off yet.

93
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 So the housekeeper is too early.

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 And I'm just going to go to the housekeeper.

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And knock twice.

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Hard.

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Yep, that's true.

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 In the same bit.

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 I was expecting the door to open, you know, in housekeeping.

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Oh, right.

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Yeah, yeah.

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 So I put the door to open and just go like, no, thank you.

103
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 This is the door open, you know?

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Yeah.

105
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 And then it never opened.

106
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 So I was like, oh, all right.

107
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 The housekeeper took a hit.

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 When my alarm goes off, I'll talk to the housekeeping.

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Yeah.

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Then all of a sudden my brain is like, there's no way I slept through my alarm.

111
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 And then I got up and I sure enough slept through my alarm.

112
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 Turns out when you actually only have three hours of sleep and then you go right from the airport to Tierney's Tavern and then to, you know, two hours of comedy shows and then drive a significant distance after that to go to a secret location and check into a hotel.

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 You're more tired than you thought.

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 You're more tired.

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Where's you out?

116
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 It turns out.

117
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Where's your ride out?

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 And I could see even in Paul's retelling of it just now, I could see how stressed he was that he was never going to get that $5 back.

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Exactly.

120
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 That was the first thought on my mind.

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 I was like, I'm out.

122
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Son of a bitch.

123
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 I'm going to have to get that $5 from the estate.

124
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 This is going to be a huge pain.

125
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 I promise you in the four minutes it took me to walk down the hallway.

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Not even four minutes.

127
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Three minutes it took me to walk down the hallway.

128
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 I'm going down the hallway through different things.

129
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 I'm walking towards the front of the gate and like I get to the second like hallway gate change and I just, my face just drops.

130
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 I'm like, oh my God, this is it.

131
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 It'd be so weird.

132
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 I was like, first of all, how am I going to explain this to Sarah?

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 How am I going to explain this to his kids?

134
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 What's my responsibility from this point forward?

135
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 And then I was like, this can't be it.

136
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 This would be the end of everything.

137
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Not to mention the cars in my name.

138
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Oh my God.

139
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Forget it.

140
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Forget it.

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 All that shit.

142
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 I was just like, fucking forget it.

143
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 I wasn't even worried about it.

144
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 I was like, I was kind of going, well, I'll be stranded here for a day or two, but we'll figure it out.

145
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 But that's not what's important now.

146
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 What's important is my friend is dead and I need to attend to his affairs.

147
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 I'm going to have to adopt his children.

148
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 I mean, I might have to, you know, move back to Vegas for a little while to help out.

149
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Certainly I'm sure the first services will be held.

150
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 I don't know.

151
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Do I need to contact Tierney's?

152
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Who else needs to be notified?

153
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Is Tierney's Bats official next of kin?

154
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Sarah.

155
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Tierney's.

156
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 That's the order that you...

157
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 But no, don't act like that's some bullshit move.

158
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 He knows like 85 people that work in that fucking building.

159
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 It's not far off from next to kin.

160
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 This is the right move.

161
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 I think if I told the Tierney's second, that would have been totally fine.

162
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 It would have gotten out to the entirety of Jersey in like five minutes.

163
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 But then, of course, then selfishly it starts to overwhelm me.

164
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 I'm like, I'm just getting on my feet.

165
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 I'm just...

166
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 The house just got painted.

167
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Jesus Christ.

168
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Just getting my income straight.

169
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 This is one of the few outside gigs.

170
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 This is because of our partnership that I'm able to do these things.

171
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 It's all...

172
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 I can't fall apart like this.

173
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 I can't.

174
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 The president in chat is saying, you know, I'm laughing, but this isn't funny.

175
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 No, me being dead is not funny.

176
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 The amount of planning Paul did in four minutes is amazing.

177
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 I was all the way...

178
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 I mean, I was raised in a house of catastrophizers.

179
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 So, you know, that's where my brain goes real fucking quick.

180
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 It doesn't take me any time to be like, I'm destitute.

181
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 The podcast has had to stop.

182
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 I don't know if I can even improvise anymore.

183
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 You guys have already made it very clear that you felt that I was very replaceable on this show.

184
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 We've already done this round the clock.

185
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 I mean, I've even done this before.

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 I've been the one to call and text Matt in the mornings when we're doing all these things.

187
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 And Matt's like, now he's asleep.

188
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Matt sleeps through shit sometimes.

189
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 It just happens.

190
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Matt is a heavy sleeper.

191
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 He sleeps through shit sometimes.

192
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 That's it.

193
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 I'm a heavy sleeper, too, to the point where I have to have my door propped open and everything.

194
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 But in a hotel, when it's a different place, I don't sleep nearly as heavy.

195
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 I don't have my white noise going like crazy, so...

196
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Yeah, when Matt's in a hotel and not near his kids, he does sleep heavily.

197
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 Oh, yeah.

198
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 That's absolutely true.

199
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 That makes sense.

200
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Yeah.

201
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Also, the night before I came, my cats were dickheads, right?

202
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Sometimes I've done things where I leave our doggy door...

203
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 It's a cat door.

204
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 I have cats, but it's a doggy door that's built in our house.

205
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 I leave our doggy door, we have a little slide, and I leave it open at night.

206
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Other cats have come into our backyard and sniffed around that door in the middle of the night.

207
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 And all of a sudden, they'll be like a big cat fight.

208
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 And that's woken me up a few times.

209
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 And I...

210
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Is Sarah downstairs just yelling, "You bitch! You bitch! You bitch!"

211
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 I had to get up at 5, 515 to make the flight to Vegas.

212
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Okay.

213
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 And my cats woke me up at 415.

214
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Ah!

215
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Assholes!

216
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 And then I went down to be like, "Did I leave the fucking cat door open?"

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 And I get up in a panic because Sarah gets up every morning with the kids.

218
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 And so waking her up early is just a much larger mistake than me and my little flight.

219
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Yeah.

220
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 And so I get up right away to what I think is close the cat door.

221
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 And I came down, and my cats were just fighting each other.

222
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 That's it. The door was closed. I did everything right.

223
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 They just decided to be fucking assholes at 415 in the morning and fight each other.

224
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 They normally get along.

225
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Yeah.

226
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 They decided to fight each other at 415 in the morning, and then I was up.

227
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Right? And so that's it. I got three hours of sleep, and that was my day.

228
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 And so then I was off to the airport all day and all that stuff.

229
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 So yeah, I was more tired than I thought. My cats are dicks, basically.

230
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 And then have you discussed with Paul what you're going to have to do from now on,

231
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 now that you have pets that do hate each other, how Paul keeps all of his pets separate?

232
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 Yeah.

233
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 How you're going to have to start doing that now?

234
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 I have to build some kind of Panama Canal of fences and things in my house.

235
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 That's right. It really is. It really is. It is a fucking lock system.

236
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Now, here's the thing. So before I left, we had to go take Giz out to grandma's

237
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 so that she wouldn't be more trouble than Anne could deal with.

238
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 So Anne's just got three cords.

239
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 But that was an extra trip that we had to do on and off.

240
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Wait, when you leave town, you take one of the dogs to the dog sitter

241
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 so that Anne doesn't have to deal with all the animals that hate each other

242
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 being in the house without you there.

243
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 I didn't know that.

244
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 That is very sweet.

245
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 And Matt, I want you to know that I will not be taking one of your cats next time you leave town.

246
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 You would love the deeks. You would love schmicky deeks.

247
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 You would love schmicky deeks.

248
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 She's such an attention hound.

249
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 It's only a three hour round trip to go take the dog and drop her off and come back home.

250
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 It's really nothing.

251
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 It's really no trouble at all.

252
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Yeah, it just eats up the great majority of your off day.

253
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Especially because one of those 90 minutes is with a dog in the car.

254
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Honestly, we don't mind it.

255
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 With a classically well-behaved dog.

256
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 A dog that we talk about all the time, how well-behaved it is.

257
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 She is really well-behaved unless she's around Adora.

258
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 That's it.

259
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 The shit of it is Adora and Giz are very similar in temperament and everything.

260
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 And that's why they hate each other.

261
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 And they really get territorial around Anne.

262
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 That's all there is to it.

263
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 All I have to say is we had a really good show at Terry's Tavern.

264
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 We sure as fuck did.

265
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 We sure as fuck did.

266
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 That was the main crux of yesterday.

267
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Getting to that.

268
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 And we did it.

269
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 And I'm very, very pleased.

270
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 It was super exciting for me to perform with these players that I hadn't played with in a long time.

271
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 I played with Didgeridooche in the past, but it didn't mean it.

272
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 And he fucking brought the fucking fire.

273
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Everybody was just top of game, man.

274
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Everybody was really good.

275
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Pat Shepard drove on the shore.

276
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Steve came out from West Jersey.

277
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Probably about 30 scoops came out.

278
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 There's probably about maybe 20 other people just from town.

279
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 One guy who read about Only Me being a magic show and was disappointed that it also had Dion Flynn from The Tonight Show and Kurt Braunhuler and all this pesky improv stuff.

280
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 All this hilarious comedy that the entire room is enjoying except me.

281
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Wow.

282
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 This is a good sign, though, Matt.

283
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 This is a good sign.

284
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 That means that people are getting back into magic and they're taking it seriously.

285
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Because what the mind noodler wants are people that take magic very seriously to watch his act.

286
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 That's it.

287
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 So this guy is this douche.

288
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 I'll just call him a douche.

289
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 This douche shows up.

290
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 And he's there with his wife.

291
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 This hero.

292
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 This hero shows up.

293
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 He's a douche.

294
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 He's like, "Yeah, I'm not here because I heard you're doing magic."

295
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 I go, "Yeah, well, I've been doing some magic for sure, but this is more of like a comedy night."

296
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Now, everything that I put out said random comedy night.

297
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 Yes.

298
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 That was the name of the event.

299
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 Yeah.

300
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 And it's an improv stand-up and magic blast.

301
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Yes.

302
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Right?

303
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 And so I know for a fact that I didn't overly emphasize that this is going to be a magic show.

304
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 But I guess on Tierney's social media, one of the posts was like, "It's going to be a magic show."

305
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Ah, gotcha.

306
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Right?

307
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Well, let's be fair.

308
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 This was proudly displayed on the dumpster.

309
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Okay.

310
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 So that is a banner they made just for the event.

311
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Uh-huh.

312
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And it was located on the dumpster of Tierney's Tavern's fence around its dumpster.

313
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 It is a picture of Matt Donnelly in front of a banner there.

314
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 What's it say, Paul?

315
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 What's the banner say?

316
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 What it says on the banner is...

317
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 "Join us October 23rd for an intimate night of my noodling with Matt Donnelly."

318
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 It doesn't even say magic.

319
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 It doesn't say magic.

320
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 An intimate night.

321
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 It still doesn't say magic.

322
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Yeah.

323
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 "Intimate night's weird phrasing and my noodling."

324
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 And it's brought to you by Guinness.

325
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Yeah.

326
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Guinness sponsored it, so I'm official.

327
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Matt Donnelly will fuck you if you come by on this night.

328
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 And I laughed.

329
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 So basically we said doors at seven, but that's just because I just wanted people in there

330
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 because I knew that we had to drive a long time after the show.

331
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 So I was like, I'm going to...

332
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Yeah.

333
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 You know, I just want to get everybody in.

334
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 And I was like...

335
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 And I got up and I told everybody the whole situation, why we're there, why this night

336
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 came together, that two people were coming literally from writing for Jimmy Fallon and

337
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 literally taking a car from the city to Tierney's to make it to the show.

338
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 I said, "They're going to show up whenever they're going to show up because Jimmy Fallon

339
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 can keep them for as long as he wants."

340
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Right?

341
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 And so I was like, "We're going to do some improv.

342
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 We're going to have some standup sets.

343
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 I'm going to do some magic.

344
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 It's going to be a cool hang."

345
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Right?

346
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Get everybody on the same page.

347
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,320
 And so at like 7, 15, we did an improv set with Paul, me, Steve, and Patch, the four

348
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,480
 of us without Dion and Kurt.

349
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,200
 And we really had a great set.

350
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,200
 It was really good.

351
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,240
 The audience was just eating it up and laughing it.

352
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,000
 And we finished and the douche is sitting there going, "I thought there was going to

353
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 be a magic show."

354
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 I go, "There is going to be a magic show."

355
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,880
 Like in my head, I was like, "I just explained this actually as a matter of fact."

356
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,840
 I was just on stage talking about this.

357
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,480
 I go, "Yeah, there is going to be a magic show."

358
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,480
 He's like, "When?"

359
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,480
 I was like, "Next."

360
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,600
 But he was the one tool bag in a sea of lovelies.

361
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
 That's the other thing.

362
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
 Everybody was...

363
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
 We had a great night.

364
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
 It was amazing.

365
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
 It's a podcast.

366
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
 I'm only talking about the one dumb thing.

367
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
 Right.

368
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
 Yeah.

369
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,600
 Yeah.

370
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
 So I go, "Next."

371
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,600
 He's like, "Well, good."

372
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,600
 Or whatever.

373
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
 And I go...

374
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,920
 And I literally go, "Did you not enjoy what you just saw?"

375
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,920
 And I say that because I was so comfortable.

376
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,920
 The audience was roaring for the whole thing.

377
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,920
 It was just confusing.

378
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,720
 So I literally was like, "Can we chill out?"

379
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,160
 And I thought he was going to laugh it off.

380
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,840
 Maybe I'm interpreting him too hard.

381
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,840
 Maybe he isn't a douche.

382
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:40,120
 At this moment, at this moment of the conversation, how many feet from the stage that you were

383
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,280
 just performing on are you?

384
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,280
 15 feet.

385
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,280
 Yeah.

386
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,280
 Great.

387
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,280
 Okay.

388
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,280
 Okay.

389
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,280
 Yeah.

390
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,280
 This is not down the road.

391
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
 This is not in the next building over.

392
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,280
 This is next to the stage that you were just on.

393
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,560
 Yeah.

394
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,560
 And so I expect him to laugh.

395
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,560
 They're like, "Oh, yeah.

396
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,560
 No.

397
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,560
 That was great."

398
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,560
 Or whatever.

399
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,560
 And he goes, "Mm.

400
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,560
 Improv."

401
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,840
 And I was like...

402
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,120
 I was having a conversation with the scoop when I first got in there.

403
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,120
 This is great.

404
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,760
 When I first got in there, I was talking.

405
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:15,240
 And I'm talking with this scoop, and they're telling me some heartfelt stuff about what

406
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,720
 the podcast means to them.

407
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
 Great.

408
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
 You're having a nice conversation.

409
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,120
 And that motherfucker came in and inserted himself right in the middle of me talking

410
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,120
 to the scoop.

411
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,120
 Oh, great.

412
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,460
 I'm like, "Asshole."

413
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,880
 And so from that point on, I wrote that motherfucker off.

414
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
 Right.

415
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,880
 He was a shitbag.

416
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,320
 And I think he's come out to other events there that we've done.

417
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,320
 I don't think he was...

418
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,680
 I think I recognized him from previous things.

419
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,680
 I don't know.

420
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,680
 Anyway.

421
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,680
 Was it Brogan?

422
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,680
 No, no, no.

423
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,680
 It was Brogan.

424
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,680
 It was not Brogan.

425
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,680
 Brogan was awesome.

426
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,680
 Yeah.

427
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,680
 Okay.

428
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,680
 Great.

429
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,680
 Full side note.

430
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,480
 Brogan fucking flew in from Scotland to see the show at Tierney Tavern.

431
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
 Insane.

432
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,480
 Insane.

433
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,480
 That's insane.

434
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,480
 Yeah.

435
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,480
 Brogan's the best.

436
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,480
 Yeah.

437
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,480
 They brought me...

438
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,480
 Carolyn and Paul came out.

439
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480
 Yes.

440
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,480
 Carolyn and Paul.

441
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,480
 Oh, good.

442
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,840
 They were very upset because they definitely had traveled the furthest to be at Tierney's

443
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,840
 show of anyone.

444
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,840
 Right.

445
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,840
 And then Brogan torpedoed them.

446
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,840
 Almost.

447
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,840
 Yeah, yeah.

448
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,840
 But we found...

449
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,360
 They let us know that they met at our second Tierney's event.

450
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,460
 That's where they met each other.

451
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,360
 That's where the connection happened.

452
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
 That's right.

453
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,360
 I forgot about that.

454
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,360
 Yeah.

455
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
 So that was really sweet.

456
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,720
 And they're still together.

457
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,480
 I think so far that's the only successful couple in the world.

458
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,480
 That's not dwell on the past, Paul, so focused on the present.

459
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,640
 It's not the only successful one.

460
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,240
 We've had a few successful ones.

461
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,680
 We've had some unsuccessful ones.

462
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,680
 That's also true.

463
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,680
 Whatever.

464
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,720
 But yeah, Christine came out and...

465
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,800
 Winner scoop successful in quotes.

466
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,840
 Carl and Amy showed up.

467
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,840
 Yeah.

468
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,840
 And...

469
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,840
 Nicky.

470
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,840
 Nicky was there.

471
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,840
 Yeah.

472
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,840
 And then...

473
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,600
 This is the part of the show where Paul names people he saw.

474
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,600
 Look.

475
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,480
 And then we get in trouble for not naming the people that also came.

476
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,360
 Michael Scoop was there, of course.

477
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
 Good, good.

478
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,360
 Yeah.

479
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,360
 Yeah, tons of people were there.

480
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,360
 And it was awesome.

481
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:09,280
 And then what I really loved was at the end of the show, I came up to a couple who was

482
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,840
 sitting there at a table and they had had a blast.

483
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,840
 They loved me.

484
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,440
 They're like, "This is our first time we've ever come out to a thing.

485
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,080
 We just wanted to come out and see what's up."

486
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,720
 I thought there was going to be more magic.

487
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,720
 No.

488
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,880
 Where is the more magic?

489
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,680
 These guys were like, "This was the funniest thing.

490
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,680
 I'm hurting from laughing."

491
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,480
 I'm like, "This was very funny.

492
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,840
 It would have been so much better if there had been magic."

493
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,280
 Thank you for taking a chance on us.

494
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,800
 I got him a chip.

495
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,160
 We're obelisk people left and right.

496
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,160
 It was great.

497
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,160
 It was great.

498
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,880
 A couple came up to me and said that we love the podcast.

499
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
 We're going to head out.

500
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,880
 They said, "We love it tonight.

501
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,760
 We'll check out your podcast.

502
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,760
 We're going to head out."

503
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,960
 And I said, "Oh, do you have chips?"

504
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,400
 And they said, "No."

505
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:59,960
 I was craning my neck for Paul to look at me as I went over and got two chips out.

506
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,760
 Matt pulled his shoulder, pat himself on the back.

507
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,800
 Learning the ways of the obelisk.

508
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:14,880
 I'll tell you who else got chips from Matt Donnelly last night, and that is the following

509
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
 sponsor.

510
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:21,440
 Today's show is brought to you by Matt Donnelly's Magical Manual for Manipulating Matt's Cats.

511
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,520
 It's from 2024.

512
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,760
 It's from Big Sexy Digital Nomad.

513
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,560
 Some of you may know that Matt has two cats, Shmeeky and Shmooky.

514
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:38,840
 Both of them are certified assholes, bird killers and General No Goodniks.

515
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,760
 They cause bullshit after bullshit.

516
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:48,680
 But if you have cats that give you trouble, Matt has a way to solve it.

517
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,540
 Yes, in fact, it's Matt Donnelly's Magic Manual for Dealing with Cats.

518
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:57,940
 The wonders of this book are that it can enclose said felines.

519
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:02,600
 All you need to do is lay it open on a coffee table, hanging towards an edge, where they

520
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,000
 are tempted to knock the shit out of it.

521
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,360
 When they come up to try and do that on the book, they will fall into a great abyss of

522
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,700
 a hidden compartment inside the tome.

523
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,020
 You can quickly slam it shut and you have trapped kitty.

524
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:20,060
 The book itself is just an animal trap, and that looks like a book.

525
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,920
 No pincers, nothing sharp.

526
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,200
 The animal will not be harmed, merely contained.

527
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,360
 So if you're having trouble with your pussy, why not lock it up in Matt Donnelly's Magical

528
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,360
 Manual?

529
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,360
 Yeah.

530
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,080
 And you can use it manually.

531
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,280
 And our hay scoops at checkout.

532
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,880
 Paul, I think when we left, you were listing off people that you saw yesterday.

533
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
 Okay.

534
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:49,280
 So then I saw Kurt Prodler, and oh my god, Kurt's stand up was hilarious.

535
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,480
 He really had me losing my shit.

536
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,480
 So fucked up.

537
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,480
 Oh, he's got it.

538
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
 He figured it all out.

539
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,480
 He got it all put together.

540
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,480
 I think he's finally figuring it out.

541
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,480
 I think he's really coming.

542
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,480
 Good.

543
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,480
 Good for him.

544
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,480
 He's so fucking good.

545
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,000
 No, he was saying that he doesn't do stand up as much because he got the gig working

546
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,400
 for Fallon, and it takes up so much of the week that you don't get out.

547
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,480
 So he was very happy to be doing stand up last night, but he crushed.

548
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,960
 He was so funny.

549
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,600
 And we were able to cajole him into playing with us for the second half too, and he was

550
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,800
 very happy that he did that, and it was awesome.

551
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,720
 He was so funny in the improv, too.

552
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,520
 So just to put some buttons on the douche, so I do a magic set.

553
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,160
 I felt like it went really well.

554
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,000
 I really enjoyed the magic set.

555
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,040
 This was one of the better magic sets I've seen.

556
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,840
 I wish the whole show had been like this.

557
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,200
 No, he said nothing.

558
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
 He said absolutely nothing.

559
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,200
 No, he did not say nothing.

560
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
 He said nothing.

561
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,080
 He did not do all of that and did not say anything after the magic set.

562
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,220
 He did not say nothing.

563
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,220
 The only thing that was...

564
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,220
 Come on, dude.

565
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,040
 I mean, everyone else was having a great time, but specifically what brought me a lot of

566
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:00,960
 joy was his wife was having a fucking blast.

567
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,160
 His wife was laughing at everything while he was stone-faced.

568
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,440
 And so I'm going through a magic set, and I did a magic set.

569
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,760
 I did some cool magic.

570
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,760
 Yeah.

571
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,760
 It's impossible.

572
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,760
 Matt, I believe that you did good magic.

573
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,760
 I believe that you did really good magic.

574
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,760
 Your magic was great, Matt.

575
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,600
 At this point, I'm like, "What was he expecting?"

576
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
 If this...

577
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
 What I'm doing, right?

578
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:28,640
 I did the fucking ring bit, the arm chopper bit, and then the straightest jacket escape.

579
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,960
 And the ringed ones tends to be most magicians' favorite little magic thing is the ringed

580
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
 one, right?

581
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,960
 The ringed one is an excellent one.

582
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,960
 The arm chopper is one of your newer ones, and it's very good.

583
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,680
 The straightest jacket, a classic.

584
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,280
 It's got good comedy.

585
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,280
 It's got good magic.

586
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,600
 What do you want?

587
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,880
 And I was just like, "What...

588
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,560
 Did he want doves or a floating bar stool?

589
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,320
 What was he looking for that he needed that he was not doing?"

590
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,320
 He was looking for intimacy, man.

591
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,320
 That's right.

592
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,480
 He was looking to be intimate.

593
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:04,440
 Maybe he was just looking for just love, maybe just a human connection between two people.

594
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,440
 Here's the thing.

595
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,040
 For those who were in attendance, he ended up being a focal point for part of Matt and

596
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,760
 Dion's improvised two-man set.

597
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:21,440
 So Dion Flynn, right, Dion who plays Obama on Fallon, Dion is, I would describe, a beautifully

598
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,720
 intense person.

599
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,640
 He has no kind of aw-shucks-y bullshit mode.

600
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,640
 He's only...

601
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,640
 Oh, I love that.

602
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,640
 Yeah.

603
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,400
 He's only talking real all the time, and that's why I love hanging out with him.

604
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,960
 He just cannot...

605
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,280
 He does not small talk.

606
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:43,600
 And so for his bit, he was like, "Hey, everyone, I don't even know what I'm fully doing here."

607
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,960
 He came in in the middle of my intro, and he goes, "Yeah, I just felt like where you

608
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,580
 were in your intro, that felt like a good time for me to come in and sit down.

609
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,160
 So I'm going to start talking now."

610
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:56,220
 And he just kind of comes in, and he makes the whole audience move chairs and move closer

611
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,220
 and come up.

612
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,220
 Great.

613
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,220
 And he's like, "We're going to go to different people."

614
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,640
 He's like, "I'm just going to have you raise your hand.

615
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,640
 I might not have been calling you.

616
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,640
 You might not even talk."

617
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,400
 Then he's calling someone, then he did have him say something, he goes, "And that's all

618
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,400
 we're going to take from you.

619
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,140
 That's not to say we're not curious about Rishank, but we're moving on."

620
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:16,000
 And he just started bouncing around the room, and we kept doing scenes whenever he felt

621
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,880
 like it off of information from the audience.

622
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,480
 It was just beautifully fluid.

623
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,480
 This is great.

624
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,480
 I love this.

625
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,480
 Yeah.

626
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,480
 And so after we did a couple of scenes, he's like, "I'm going to look for the most stoic,

627
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,840
 least involved person in the room."

628
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,560
 At that moment, did you already know who it was going to be?

629
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,560
 Well, yes.

630
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,560
 I did.

631
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,760
 And then he pointed to a woman, he goes, "And that was going to be you, but then you just

632
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,240
 laughed at what I just said, so it's not you."

633
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,240
 And then he just goes, "But you've had no smile the whole time."

634
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,240
 And he points to him.

635
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,240
 You haven't looked up.

636
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,040
 Well, and then Deanser's asked him questions like, "You went to high school, tell me something

637
00:25:54,040 --> 00:26:00,040
 weird about your high school," or whatever, and the guy goes, "I went to high school where

638
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:05,680
 we had to wear school uniforms, but when we joined the swim team, the first day we just

639
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,680
 swam naked.

640
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,920
 We were all naked for our swim team."

641
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,920
 All right.

642
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,160
 They made all the boys swim naked for P.E.

643
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,160
 Yeah.

644
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,640
 Well, that's just going to increase drag.

645
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,720
 It's true.

646
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,520
 That's not even good swimming practice.

647
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:29,680
 Yeah, that high school had the worst swim times of the state.

648
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:34,400
 And so, but the thing was, as soon as it was about him, he was fucking eating it up.

649
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,680
 He was loving talking.

650
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,280
 Oh, I got you.

651
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,280
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

652
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,440
 Oh, is that what he wanted from the Magic?

653
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,360
 Did he want to be a helper for one of the tricks in the Magic show maybe?

654
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,360
 I looked out.

655
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,360
 I asked.

656
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,360
 I mean, I use a lot of audience volunteers.

657
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,360
 Yeah, yeah, sure.

658
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,600
 He did not keep a volunteer himself, but I was like, "This guy is basically like 20%

659
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,320
 of my cruise ship people is this."

660
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,200
 It's just guys a little older than me and have a couple of drinks who are like, "I'm

661
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,200
 pretty awesome.

662
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,640
 Why don't you use me more?"

663
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,640
 I am great.

664
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,840
 So we did bits with him or whatever.

665
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,760
 And so, at this point, I'm like, "Fine."

666
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,840
 I'm done with the amount of attention he has.

667
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,840
 Yeah, yeah.

668
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,840
 We're done.

669
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:25,160
 But Kurt goes up in a standup and in it, he sets up a joke about how terrible his dad

670
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:31,760
 is by putting him in the same category as Trump and Pol Pot or something like that.

671
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:37,520
 And then, we actually identified maybe one of the issues why he wasn't having the best

672
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,520
 time.

673
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,200
 Oh, because he's a big Pol Pot fan.

674
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,600
 He's a huge Pol Pot.

675
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,600
 Yeah, yeah.

676
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
 That makes sense.

677
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,600
 He was wearing a Pol Pot 2028 shirt.

678
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
 I should have noticed that.

679
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:53,000
 And Kurt had a dead Canada shirt on, so it was automatically like, "Oh, yeah."

680
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 And then he did a bit making fun of Black Rifle Coffee.

681
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,280
 And he was like, "Good, because we really need to know the politics of every product

682
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,280
 that we have.

683
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,880
 I'm glad coffee is finally letting people know that they're pro-gun."

684
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,880
 Yeah.

685
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:15,080
 He read this hilarious email that he wrote to the Black Rifle coffee company.

686
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:22,200
 He actually, Kurt, posed for the cover of one of Mike Sack's recent books called Passing

687
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,200
 on the Right.

688
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,200
 Have you seen that?

689
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,200
 No.

690
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,400
 Kurt worked with Mike Sack on this book, Passing on the Right, and I think Kurt did the audio

691
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,000
 book for it.

692
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:41,400
 And it's this very, you know, like, faux infiltration of the very right-wing media sphere.

693
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,680
 But that's kind of what the way Kurt wrote this.

694
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,680
 Yeah, yeah.

695
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,680
 This email.

696
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:52,640
 He wrote a letter as someone who is a fan of the politics of Black Rifle Coffee and

697
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,200
 saying they aren't taking it far enough.

698
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,200
 That's the premise of the thing.

699
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,200
 But he read the actual email.

700
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,200
 He sent Black Rifle Coffee.

701
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:03,680
 Black Rifle Coffee had a mocha flavor, and he was like, "A mocha flavor?"

702
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:09,840
 There's a copy that has Kurt on the cover, if you look it up.

703
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,240
 But there's a version that has Kurt on the cover.

704
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,240
 Mike Sack's.

705
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,760
 In the middle of this letter, our friend decided it was time to go, and he left.

706
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
 Oh, was that when he left?

707
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,760
 Yeah.

708
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
 Oh, hilarious.

709
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,760
 Hilarious.

710
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,760
 That's enough for me.

711
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,760
 Okay, perfect.

712
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,760
 Perfect, perfect, perfect.

713
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:29,560
 He might have been a stockholder of the coffee company, I think, or whatever.

714
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,560
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

715
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,560
 That was Ted Rifle.

716
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:37,320
 He couldn't stand being the rifle butt of the joke.

717
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:43,440
 So Kurt was awesomely unapologetic about it.

718
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,440
 He's like, "Did that guy walk?"

719
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,760
 And we're like, "If he thinks so," he's like, "Okay."

720
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,200
 If I had known, I'd have been like, "Thank you.

721
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
 Thank you, Kurt."

722
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,480
 Oh, totally, because literally, I'm writing this because the podcast, it's fun to focus

723
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,700
 on this guy, but there's a very small part of everyone else was just eating up fucking

724
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,700
 everything we were doing.

725
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,840
 I mean, here's the other part, of course.

726
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:12,560
 We had a very nice contingence of scoops, and scoops always elevate every fucking event.

727
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:18,320
 It was the thing of, I've been doing some improv now again in PA, and it was just so

728
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:24,360
 lovely to step on stage, throw out a line, and get hit with a round of laughter, just

729
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,360
 like boom.

730
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,120
 I'm like, "Oh, yeah, I'm here with friends in support.

731
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,120
 This is going to be great."

732
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,960
 Yeah, it was really, really lovely.

733
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,880
 Which made it even worse later when he thought Matt had died.

734
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,840
 It did make it worse when I thought he had died.

735
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,080
 I was like, "Oh, fuck," and all these scoops, I was like, "Oh, it's going so well."

736
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,080
 Yeah, exactly.

737
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,120
 Everything's going, everything's starting to work.

738
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
 Wait.

739
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,120
 Well, at least they got to see him one last time.

740
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:55,720
 I'm telling you, man, I went from zero to a bajillion in like eight seconds.

741
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,720
 Yes, you did.

742
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,840
 It did, but what would your assumption be?

743
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,160
 You're in a hotel.

744
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,640
 You haven't heard from him.

745
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,640
 You can't text him.

746
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,280
 You can't call him, and he doesn't respond to a knock on the door.

747
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,200
 Paul, this has happened to me.

748
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,560
 This exact thing has happened to me traveling with Matt Donnelly.

749
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,200
 I don't have to tell you what would have come into my mind.

750
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,640
 I can tell you what came into my mind.

751
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,920
 Oh, shit.

752
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,280
 My assumption was, "Matt is sleeping through this."

753
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,280
 Okay.

754
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,640
 Well, that will be my default assumption from now on.

755
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,640
 Raptured.

756
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,640
 Sweetest scoop I've ever made.

757
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,640
 Raptured.

758
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,600
 It finally took, today of all days.

759
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:50,200
 Oh, that guy was only off by a couple of weeks.

760
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,840
 If I had slept five more minutes, and I would have been woken up by a wellness check, that

761
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,960
 would have been a very bizarre start to my day.

762
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,520
 I am so mad that the hotel did not come.

763
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,520
 Yeah.

764
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,760
 He got me before I got to the front desk.

765
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,760
 That's all.

766
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,760
 Oh, I'm so mad about that.

767
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,760
 Because I've done everything in my power.

768
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,200
 I was like, "Text, call, call again.

769
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,560
 Knock on door loudly.

770
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,720
 Knock on door loudly twice.

771
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,720
 Matt's dead."

772
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,720
 That was it.

773
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,720
 That was it.

774
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,720
 No other possibilities.

775
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,720
 No other possibilities.

776
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,720
 Matt has died.

777
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,720
 My friend and business partner has passed away unexpectedly.

778
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:42,360
 I'll tell you who else was more concerned than you would have imagined about Matt's death,

779
00:32:42,360 --> 00:33:02,080
 and who else was more concerned about Matt's death, and who else was more concerned about
