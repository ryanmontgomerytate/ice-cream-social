 hazel honeysuckle in the house today boldly strip.com is the website if you
 like movies and Star Trek go check it out I like two of those things I like
 Star Trek and the left one the left one only yeah this is another great reason
 for patrons to get on the ball and put in that couple bucks a month to join us
 on these live podcasts and zooms hazel is in full Trek regalia you can see her
 in her I mean it's dangerous she's in a red shirt but yeah yeah she might not
 last the whole podcast but she is and she's sitting in front of the Sun on her
 video so I mean it's it could happen any moment yeah yeah yeah have any Star Trek
 characters ever died by just being thrown into the Sun that's got to have
 happened in Star Trek right I'm sure the actual person often they do oh that's a
 good point Paul you're telling just a star plenty of people fall into stars I
 think but I don't know about our son yeah oh I mean stars are other other
 people's sons that's right let's not disparage other people's sons people
 the Sun of Vulcan one of Vulcan Suns exploded and Osmos the whole sure sure
 that was son of Vulcan Sun exploded and the osmosis and the whatnot then we used
 the Sun our earth Sun's gravitational forces to go back in time and save the
 whales using a Klingon bird of prey so sure for now we should we should hashtag
 for now I don't think it took I don't think it took I mean what was the last
 like proper Star Trek invention you attended oh god as an actual I don't know
 I mean the last time was two years ago at Rio when I was doing a fool us and
 happened to be there at the same time I didn't really get to go to the con
 proper though I got to just see people walking around and well when was the
 last time you like went out of your way and I'm gonna go to this Star Trek
 convention got yourself a ticket did the whole nine and I have never I have never
 gotten a ticket for a Star Trek convention you never enter through the
 Stargate or wherever they walk through to go I have never gone through as a
 civilian I've always been there for work all right okay all right then what was
 last time you worked convention when they still had them at the Hilton so it's
 been a minute it been a minute it's been it's been probably a good solid 15 years
 since I've been in a very long time none of them have closed they're just on
 hiatus right how long until the Star Trek experience comes back I have no
 idea I have no idea well first turn back into the Hilton well here's the thing
 hazel is on the ground floor out there she is amongst the people's what scuttle
 butt have you heard about people trying to bring back the experience scuttle
 them butts hazel I mean there's a whole chapter new book just about scuttling
 butts the butts the butts are saying oh so much to do that oh they should bring
 about it would be great they don't they don't understand is anyone saying oh I
 should do that is anyone say oh I with the money that I currently have should
 do that oh that's a shame yeah here I am just stuffing them in my ears and
 wiping my ass with them why don't I put them towards Star Trek it'll make the
 same amount of what I tell you a bunch of people though we're like hey you know
 that you know that Empire strips back show you should do that you should do
 one of those for Star Trek oh right that's that's that's it and and how's
 that going well um I think we're gonna need another Kickstarter for that one
 right but I use the Empire Strips back seems to be going well right I think so
 yeah yeah it's a great show it is a great show I got to see that here in
 Pittsburgh oh yeah yeah it seems to punch above its weight class it seems
 to deliver more than what you're expecting mm-hmm oh I would agree with
 that yeah first scene they come out strong in that in the first scene of
 that show they come out just swinging they're real good yeah Jeff Loomis is
 saying that Empire Strips back touring show was close to a sellout for an
 entire month in Seattle oh wow so that you go on the ground reporting ticket
 sales we love it we love well and it's and it's it's doing decent business in
 Vegas it's got it's found itself a residency of sorts right oh I hope they
 did well during the Star Wars was calling me right now I'm gonna put him
 on speaker oh jeez oh boy the chaos yeah it seems like a lot of people were
 going to see that show well hi Brian you're an old yeah sure going
 no that's it you've reached the limit I mean by virtue of her age and race yes
 there he goes there he goes big tribal chief Brian brushwood everybody I gotta
 take the moral stand there Andrew heating everyone Andrew heat that was
 heating that was heating for sure mm-hmm so there is crossover than Hazel
 between the Trek and the Wars oh yeah yeah of course of course I mean I drive
 a stormtrooper car and I was a Klingon so it's all good yeah right but that that
 that hurts the idea of doing a Star Trek version of Empire Strips back you
 think yeah yeah it's already done you think it's cannibalizing its own
 audience yeah you're not gonna fly out to Vegas twice to see two different
 burlesque shows I don't know I think there is a slight possibility that you
 could man I really like your logic there you get the same person you could make
 the trek one way more tech forward I don't know I don't know you know what
 the key would be I'm gonna be shark tank here I'm out I'm out here's what was
 that if is that a foot that was coming in what in the hell was that what is
 that why I wanted to turn off my background why was that is that a
 Horta oh it's a dick rock oh it's a big old dick rock it's not a Horta all
 right but it might as well be say Horta one more time ball Horta thank you
 Horta got that you know the way to do it this here's the successful thing they
 just closed Muppets 3d we almost had it with Borg 4d at the experience but what
 they didn't do they had stuff that would move your butt in the seat they had
 water that would squirt in your face but they didn't have things that would
 attach to your junk so if you get into a theater and you get Borgified in the
 crotch uh-huh and the show literally fucks you while you're watching burlesque
 preach then you are going to go see that show a couple times probably probably
 we got to go back because you slept through the second half of the first time
 you gotta go back twice the smartest person handling the Star Trek IP is
 hazel honeysuckle that's right this person doing the smartest thing is
 combining her superpowers as a nerd and burlesque artist and it's true hazel
 what's your website it's boldly stripped calm boldly stripped calm and what will
 people find when they go to boldly stripped calm oh people will find a very
 excellent Kickstarter campaign where I'm where we are raising funds to create the
 second version of boldly stripped I've noticed only stripped to a bit of
 electric boogaloo a simplifying a bit of paring down of the options that was
 offered a boldly stripped one like lessons were learned I think so it's not
 where we can get the button put on it upside down or or to the left or to the
 right depending on which box you click for delivery purposes like with all
 kickstarters it's full of all kinds of options so that you try to keep simple
 you must have understood when it was the first one was so much more successful
 than you imagined it was going to be why did you just go right away what took
 you so long to come around the thing about doing version 2 I had to wait long
 enough until I forgot how much work it was that's a real thing yeah that's it
 that makes a lot of sense so now you just launched you've already achieved
 your your goal and your stretch goal yeah we made we've done three stretch
 goals so far and you've nailed them all and nailed them all and you're gonna add
 more stretch goals or you're done with stretch goals never done with stretch
 goals yet because one should be a Star Trek convention watching Paul sit
 through a show in his own taint tickling chairs one should be that should be one
 stretch call I want to know exactly what he wants attached to his junk during the
 show no no you would sort of device you think you want to know that but you don't
 I thought I wanted to do that one time I found out I didn't want to know let's
 just say the question implies that he's picky and he's not I'm imagining I'm
 imagining a Borg's head comes up out of the chair in front of you and you just
 take that Borg's head are you supposed to imagine the Borg says attached to a
 sexy body on your own or are you supposed to be picturing skull fucking a
 Borg that's what I'm the Borg's head yeah the Borg's head will be all on us a
 skeletal spindle like the Queen did like the you know is gesturing how the head
 would go towards him and Hazel yes it'll come out on a hanging spine and then and
 then you pick the orifice this is the thing so either you can go choose your
 own adventure you can go for an eye socket because it's a Borg yeah or you
 know if you want to get wild you can go for just a straight-up mouth or you can
 have it add on like it's got like a tongue attachment or something for the
 lady - I'm going for the ear because I wanted to hear me I want to hear me
 coming okay yeah you can go for the ear or it could be a or it could be a Borg's
 butt with the words ass simulate on it that could be kind of cute as simulate
 that's what it is Borg for board 5d plus ass simulation that's it simulation we
 got there everybody who we've arrived who's gonna work there that's what I
 want to know who to clean up after the audience and they all your remnants is
 mopper resistance is futile and your remnants are puerile that's how it's
 going space just mopper space just mopper someone's got to do it it can't
 be any worse than the shit that was going down during chicken jockey during
 the minecraft movie so upset about us disparaging you're right fuck plastic
 sci-fi things in an open theater that you're just taking random shots of the
 minecraft movie look this is just the next step in the popcorn buckets tell me
 I'm wrong I'm wrong that it's just one more month until a popcorn bucket fucks
 you they already sold a big old galactus head and he had big old ears you could
 hold on the dune worm no the dune worm was just a that was the shot across the
 bow and people did not answer the call and I'm disappointed
 was just a pocket pussy but it was also one of those like unattainable goals I
 mean that was it that was like a eight-inch mall you'd have to be the
 girthiest tuna can motherfucker to even experience standard for everyone does
 everyone not have see now that that's the popcorn bucket right there this is
 how I will always picture hazel oh where do you think the butter goes that's a
 butter reservoir for the popcorn you need a little butter refresher just give
 it a squeeze just dunk it yeah hazel how many characters did you play in volume
 one we did 14 different photo shoots okay so it was 14 is it how many hard to
 come up with 14 more or is it easy in the Star Trek universe have 14 more
 different characters um I haven't decided on all of them yet because yeah
 you know we got we got all of the most obvious ones in the first book yeah you
 can revisit them right because people do multiple you know oh yeah yeah I might
 might redo some of them you know different situations or or eras who was
 your most popular what was your most popular creature from volume one oh yeah
 what most popular species oh the green one the Orion woman okay that's the one
 that everybody likes by far when you sell I mean you sell these at the
 conventions and stuff yeah yes yes at Galaxy con and do you start right do
 they just start thumbing through it right in front of you right there at the
 table did they just start going through them all well I ask people to I say look
 at the book then they're like oh wow look at all these girls and I say that's
 me and they're like that's you yes so way the way the opposite of what I
 thought where I thought it was going that's really funny Matt thought it was
 gonna be awkward but in the other direction yes no plenty of people make
 it awkward too what's the most awkward somebody's made it um gosh I don't know
 like do they touch the picture in front of you do they put their finger on like
 a body part like some sometimes people pick up the book and look at every
 single page and then just put it down and walk away data committed to spank
 bank thank you recently I was at magic live and Mike gave me was selling these
 really awesome books one was the history of song a woman in half and the other
 was just a kind of like a history of magic but I knew they were like $200
 books so I didn't even pretend to thumb through it I just I was I dared to read
 the back of one of them and then I was like I'm gonna stop touching these books
 all together cuz I'm not spending but yeah so but that guy had no problem that
 guy just thumbed right through it left his oily residue on every page this is
 why I have you know the table book which has been thumbed through many times
 have you considered have you considered going kind of a Pat the bunny route
 where like you have a patch of some kind of real tactile stuff in the middle of
 the book that continues throughout that you know I don't know what it could be
 Star Trek wise could be like a moon rock kind of thing or something I don't know
 I don't know I thought for sure you're going Merkin like a silicone that could
 be that could be yeah I'll just keeps moving towards fuckable objects the
 ultimate goal today moon rock that's really not fuckable I mean oh come on
 anything is fuckable if you try hard enough and important to storm any
 part better attitude I'll tell you they call me lunar lander what sponsor today's
 show is brought to you by the fine makers of this following product have
 you heard of the product not yet oh a new film by Gwyneth Paltrow the gloops
 the gloops that's from the microscope in 2025 the gloops I'm Gwyneth Paltrow I
 used to be married to Coldplay now I make movies again because I got left
 behind from that guy in jail now I'm doing what I want to do with my life
 instead of making Oscar bait I'm making a movie called the gloops what's the
 gloops you might ask well it's the passion project about my website called
 goop right that's my website goop but the gloops is the poops you get when
 you're living the gloop lifestyle if your poops are gloops then you are gooped up
 you get it that's how it works me Gwyneth Paltrow teaching you what to put
 in and out of your body that's how it works don't let others fool you this is
 my real voice not manipulated anymore by the Weinstein company they know what I
 really sound like I'm basically a walking talking Grover lady but that's
 me Gwyneth Paltrow go see my new movie gloops in theaters only in theaters
 equipped with Borg 5d fuckable technology and race groups check out
 yeah okay I think I heard you all like skin care products are you all like
 some what's some gloop I got it oh lord she's an alien
 Lodi Oh Gwyneth Oh speaking of a L speaking of aliens speaking of aliens
 guys they're aliens two nights ago I wake up to go to work I'm up at almost
 3 a.m. I'm letting my dogs out and straight out my back door up in the sky
 I'm seeing UFOs now I say UFO because to me they were UFOs they were
 unidentified unidentifiable they were flying it was a straight line of about
 five just dots of light okay and then occasionally lights were blinking in to
 the left and right of the column and zipping in towards the column then
 disappearing blink in zipping toward the column disappeared and then the column
 was going up and then disappearing and then another one would start at the
 bottom and disappearing strange were you watching an elevator no okay but here's
 the fucked up thing I would say that modern life has accomplished its goal I
 didn't have time to just stay in there and keep watching this shit I had to go
 to work so like so I'm broken I can no longer three rocks off the ground
 shoved one in your butt fuck the other two went to work I can no longer stand
 there and raptured at the majesty of the mysteries of space I have to go I can
 work so I'm just I feel like we're just broken it's over like I don't even know
 what that shit was I can't I don't know but I can't even have time to watch it
 all the way I'm out of here this is just thanks whatever you are just so
 frustrating thanks that's fine I hope you're from space yeah I'm going to work
 now did you think to get your phone and film it no I did not I did not I should
 have but I didn't in the moment which is weird seems unlike you I know again
 think that he's just over it I mean do you think that he's just like yeah yeah
 they're aliens yeah that's kind of where I'm at like it's of course there's some
 weird shit going on who knows what it is but if aliens showed up tomorrow would
 you react with with surprise joy or or just kind of a board like of course
 you're here I'd be like hmm I'd be surprised yes I'd be surprised and I'd
 be like wait we didn't get ready hold on we gotta fix open up open up a flap and
 get some of this heat out of here what somebody open a flap wait we're not
 ready but open a flap if I saw clean up the aliens land in front of me I'd be
 like oh man this is gonna be the worst Paul is right email I've ever got on the
 pod oh it'd be so terrible so your first concern hazel is a tidy house when
 aliens come you know like like the like the Federation they always always wait
 till like the society is ready they have to achieve warp capability they have to
 achieve your capability yeah yeah but they can't join the Federation until
 they've like got their shit together right you know which blows my fucking
 mind that the earth was ever even let in like even if you look at the if you look
 at first contact and you're like wait a minute they came to earth they saw that
 from Cochrane go warp and then they went oh yeah this planet just recently got
 decimated by full-scale nuclear assault think they're good to go come on join us
 guys but then they got their shit together for like you know I don't know
 50 years or something oh boy oh boy I we were we we should never have been
 allowed in the UFP it's all there is to it that's it preach yeah you know me
 preach if I was on a walk and the aliens landed it would be so sad as I'd be
 concerned about my family and then I would like awkwardly not be able to run
 full speed back to my house like I'd have to like jog for a minute and like
 keep walking fast then like jog for another minute and the aliens would just
 be standing behind you with their arms crossed just looking at you in judgment
 like don't give me wrong I'm one of you making fun of Tom Cruise running in
 movies right like oh there he goes ha ha I mean well I can't do it I couldn't
 even do a Tom Cruise movie if you paid me it'd be really tough no it's to be
 fair though I would I'd love to give it a shot so if anybody would like to pay
 me Tom Cruise's going rate to make a movie I will happily attempt to make
 that movie absent of money I'm just doing the Tom Cruise fitness challenge
 and that's where I will try to become a better runner and also strap my thing
 strap myself onto various dangerous objects and see if I can pull off a
 classy stunt at my age so that's those are the two things I thought you were
 gonna say strap myself to various objects and fuck them like Canada RMS Nicole
 Kidman shout myself to those objects meanwhile the Penelope Cruz longing for
 a for a nice piece of cod the whole time you know what I could really go for right
 now some cod did this isn't that possible come out or it hasn't come out
 yet nobody cares that's right yeah yeah nobody cares anymore
 nobody gives a rat fuck that first the first one the first one that he had the
 audacity of that last one to be like oh it's a two-parter and it's also 18 hours
 long like eat my butt sir no one has time for your garbage bullshit but the
 end but the bad guys might get an AI thing Paul you're not totally wrapped up
 in that that apparently was the whole thing like the the the MacGuffin they
 were having like all these discussions about what's the MacGuffin what's the
 MacGuffin and Tom Chris finally like just nuclear bombs just make it nuclear
 bombs and that's what they did it's like bad guys have nukes good guys need to
 stop them done this is so dumb I don't think it was I thought it was like an AI
 thing like a computer that could that could control nuclear bombs oh got it
 okay oh that's what sunk that submarine that submarines full of nuclear bombs
 that's the whole beginning of the movie which is all I watched how many mission
 impossible movies has Tom Cruise made everybody no price is right rules just
 how many how many hazel's hazel's correct she just yawned while you asked
 that yeah yeah that's correct that's the right answer that's exactly it it's
 boring because it's cuz nothing's gonna happen the answer is fine the answer is
 eight and I had no idea you know just three you know what I think um fast and
 furious was benefited from the tragic passing of Paul Walker in so much as
 something could actually happen to a main character but I guess in the in the
 fictional world he's not really dead is that right are they gonna AI him back
 into the new movie is that what I'm hearing now I don't know wait Paul what's
 his name Walker Paul Walker they're gonna AI Paul Walker into a fast and
 furious movie I think so let's see here the new one seems like a mistake I think
 you're right Matt I think it's a terrible mistake and a terrible precedent to set
 to bring back dead people into movies yeah but if it goes I'm totally making
 Ben her too and I'm bringing everyone back Ben her too remember they did a
 Ben her remake today like who the fuck has a ball it was it was remarkably bad
 right but who even has the balls to even go you know what we should make again
 Ben her yeah what epic the fuck could you even add to that oh my god I love
 remaking things they do the upcoming the upcoming fast and furious movie the
 upcoming final fast and furious movie rumored to be titled fast 11 fine Jesus
 Christ set for release in April of 27 is planning to feature Paul Walker's
 character Brian O'Connor will likely use CGI and potentially AI to recreate his
 likeness Oh not his corpse they're not gonna string him up like a fucking puppet
 weekend at Bernie's them I'm glad they told us how it's all about family not
 some child he didn't know he had dressing up like him and trying to look
 like him in the movie because it's been that long it has been that long his his
 kids are alive I think he really is like supposed to be like on vacation kind of
 thing in the storyline he's on hiatus I don't know or maybe he's dead in the
 story and then they're gonna bring it back but everybody dies in that thing
 now too and they bring him back same thing with what's your head hey whatever
 Paul he's family all right and we take care of family family never dies family
 never dies here's Paul fucking Walker family never dies take a look you think
 I'm joking motherfucker look family never dies this one literally never dies
 they could do they could do a crossover could call it Paul walking dead I've
 literally never been more interested in the Fast and Furious franchise I bet
 Kirkman could get on board he's a magician he could write some great shit
 for that he could make it work can owes Atlanta tax credits they help make it
 happen no Paul walking dead and any thoughts for putting video content as
 part of your attached to your your your magazine with with animated Paul Walker
 driving you around funny you say that because no except for the Paul Walker
 part yeah we okay so one of the shoots we're gonna do is a Ferengi mm-hmm oh
 whichever you know I know everyone was clamoring yes well the thing is tell
 tell everyone the thing about the Ferengi ladies the thing about the
 Ferengi ladies and they're not they're not a very you know progressives progressive
 civilization not at all but their women their women all are just naked all the
 time and they're not allowed to do business profit which is like their
 their whole society is about earning profit right so the women are naked and
 they can't work and like the kinkiest thing is for women to wear clothes like
 them and this is this is how they they got the the main characters like the
 main Ferengi character to put it on would land them in jail is that what was
 that what happened ah it's like oh the main character like goes home and his
 mom's like wearing clothes and he's like oh gross gross mom and then she takes
 their clothes off and he puts his head in her lap oh boy it's weird no what you
 said sounds great yeah yeah so the rest of the show like this so to do a risk a
 Ferengi female boudoir shoot as it were yeah you're gonna have to put some stuff
 on she's gonna put it on yeah yeah it's gonna be the only clothes character in
 the entire book I mean that could be funny to have it go in reverse to start
 off it really would go oh it's it's definitely going in reverse completely
 starkers and then yeah full clothes by the end of it that's what that would be
 a really funny burlesque routine like a bad camp act you know where you just
 keep putting on clothes and so you're like giant like a snowman you know oh
 what was that yeah that guy wore all the t-shirts how many t-shirts did he get
 to didn't hurt himself real bad doing that one guy who's famous for wearing
 t-shirts Paul just asked three questions none of us have any idea what he's
 talking about I just remember this guy wearing so many t-shirts and it got
 really bad and I don't I think it was I think it hurt him Jacob what are you
 even searching for what did you type into the search bar I pulled up a search
 bar and have yet to type anything very curious what words you know what did a
 guy hurt himself here it is too many shirts to death calm here we go I don't
 think he died did a guy hurt himself by putting on too many shirts let's see
 here Google is shrugging at me Google has no idea I'm just picturing Hazel
 wearing like a thousand outfits to look like it looks like almost like Jabba the
 Hut with a tiny head out of a bunch of clothes and then a bunch of Ferengi dudes
 just like totally on the ground just like wasted from the eroticism they've
 experienced just yeah just lounge opium den like napping just throwing bars of
 Latin America like like like you know those those machines that throw a bunch
 of money yeah but they make it rain guns yeah yeah which is like which are like
 metal yeah go press latinum would bean somebody in the noggin it's like going
 to a strip club in Canada man they make it hail loonies right in your hand you
 got all the loonies going up there oh man I got another loony bruise above my
 eye yeah no your honor it's from a loony it's from a loony yeah yeah galactic
 president scooper star my scoops a lot talking about ear rubbing equals Ferengi
 grooming or gooning rather yes yeah it is it's umox yeah so you're sitting down
 in the writers meeting for one of the Star Trek's right and you know I had no
 no I got the world guys Ferengi right they're a little backwards all right
 everyone's naked everyone's like I'm listening like and then you know what
 everybody else is all of this project Donnelly you're handling the Ferengi's
 by yourself go on and you goon by tugging your ears I regret my decisions
 film this yesterday this was scooper Nova girls saying I'll explain the DS 9
 documentary and there is a story that Armand Shimmerman tells because he was
 one of the original Ferengi in deep space not or in the original or in next
 generation right they were originally gonna be the new big bads they were
 gonna be like the Klingons of next generation ah that was the start told us
 about this before I think I have and and there was there's a scene where they're
 on this planet and they've got you know the Frank you have these fucking laser
 whips and you know they're coming hard for the fed yeah man Marauder Moe type
 shit yeah look out their energy whips yeah but they ended up being really
 goofy that's it they they they use the sonic weapon against them and the
 directors like oh yeah grab your heads and like writhe around in pain and Armand
 was like you know if we do this we're gonna look stupid as fuck and nobody's
 gonna think nobody's gonna think that these guys are scary at all ever again
 and he was dead right and they became these very clownish aliens from that
 point on but they wanted they wanted to set them up as like the big bad alien
 species for the for the whole series and that no one bought it no no one's like
 those those goofballs grabbing their big Dumbo ears and screaming no I don't give
 a shit about them yeah laser energy whips energy whip I have myself an
 energy whip sir I do declare if you wish to get more forceful let us adjourn to
 the next parlor and we shall settle this like gentlemen with our energy whip sir
 Desmond fits me my sonic gun this this ragamuffin has a laser whip do not bring
 a sonic disruptor to a laser whip fight sir I hope you enjoy the tanky zip of my
 energy whip and that was I shall make a sandwich of your innards what that was
 of course the episode that Tennessee Williams wrote for Star Trek Hazel Leon
 Casab just asked you about what was there a something in the first boldly stripped
 what what is that and is it an axiom a talaxian that's how you say that okay and
 is there a talaxian in the second boldly stripped and what is it not so far come
 on what's it so axiom it's a neelix it'd be a whole cooking scene it's a neelix
 come on Jacob it's a neelix moving on it's a neelix and expect me to know what
 the fuck you're talking about again this is that this is what you you would lose
 your mind Jacob and Matt if you were ever in these writers rooms because
 neelix that's correct neelix was supposed to be the Voyager breakout
 character they're like oh this whole thing this is gonna be such a great
 thing this neelix character and they fucked it up six ways to Sunday they had
 him dating a twelve-year-old it's like guys no no no she was she was like yeah
 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's awful I was trying to make it sound a little
 more yeah okay so yeah so what it like this looks like she Tara's ugly step
 cousin oh the neelix wait there was a female problem is female to Lexi and
 Ethan Phillips they don't allow female to laxians on the internet I bet you
 anything Ethan Phillips is a chill guy from what I've seen of him he seems like
 a nice dude the actor who portrayed neelix that character is so fucking
 annoying and stupid I don't think it's Ethan Phillips's fault I think he's
 great exactly that's what I'm saying but he's kind of like oh he loves to like
 sell stuff to people and he's the cook yeah so he's always cooking weird alien
 things okay yeah let's make a hairy farting cheetah
 clown that makes food no one likes let's do that let's put that in the chin hair
 he's everything and then they bring this they bring this like hot girl onto the
 show but they're like oh yeah her race only lives to like 10 so she's full
 grown at like two years old and so she's dating the weird cheetah guy I think we
 know who a secret executive producer was on this
 by Diddy just a bevy a bevy of bad ideas neelix or flocks who is better asked
 scooper nova girl flocks by leaps and bounds leaps and bounds X spells flocks
 huh yeah dr. locks he can inflate his face he's all I care from a planet of

 what do they call the Twi licks you said we like the ten tentacle Twi licks only
 two figure two well doesn't help the alliteration I guess two does two tentacle
 yeah okay yeah I'm sure the zoom what Twi licks are cuz I didn't know what
 they were it was the the one that was the exotic dancer in Jabba's Palace yeah
 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah they have two big floppy horns why are their
 horns so floppy why are they such a floppy horned people they're not horns
 they're they're called lekku actually they're like zoom tight and they're
 bred that way because they've gotten more docile as they reproduce because
 no one wanted to keep the aggressive ones as pets so slowly but surely
 they've gotten dangly they just got floopy they got droopy over time the
 same thing happens that happened a basset hound ears no did I did I do the
 beholder and scoop fest yes yes I did yeah was that last year or the last one
 we did right that was what you did yeah that's what yeah that was the D&D thing
 yeah yeah yeah um thing with the eyeballs that was great I've been I've
 watched Sandman I finished up Sandman on Netflix okay you watched the second
 season I did I started to watch that that animated kind of wrap up of the
 final first season that they just put out uh-huh and I and I and I couldn't
 even get through it I was too depressed I had to stop it was it I was like our
 where where where's the population at with Neil Gaiman are we allowed to say
 we watch Sandman are like salmon are we not allowed to say we like Sandman I was
 Neil I mean he he's problematic as hell at this point yeah he's been accused of
 being a dirty bird that's right at home yeah yep and what stinks I thought
 Netflix did a really good job of creating the comic to the series I didn't
 watch the animated thing I just watched the actual episodes smart because I had
 to nope out after I watched the first five minutes I was like oh god I can't
 take this this is and I basically was like breaking my heart true to the comic
 look at it go and I think it's a fascinating world that was created that I
 really liked when I read it because I was like yeah it doesn't really advance
 it doesn't like it's not driven by like a plot plot more like you just keep
 exploring worlds and the rules that go with the world's similar what we've
 been just doing here today and so I thought like it was really neat
 compelling it's also great to watch before going to bed it's not it's not a
 compelling plot point with cliffhangers so you can just watch one weird dreamy
 scene and go right to bed no problem and then I was like I don't think I can talk
 terrified about sleeping at all I've worried about whatever happens once I
 fall asleep can be completely leveraged against me and generations of my family
 no problem and oddly enough as you're watching it though the character dream
 which obviously is influenced by Neil Gaiman himself and the whole fashion
 trend that came out of that and it's all about guy regretting his past and moving
 around see if he can go about possibly changing who he is and I was like man
 I'm trying to keep my mind off of things and this thing is just poking the bear
 of what's happening in real life and it's really strange oh I have a hard time
 with those shows he does not the character does not have a good
 relationship with any of his exes I'll tell you that much right now and so
 wouldn't it be great to see a show one time where everybody's like oh yeah that's
 my ex we get along fine but there are actors in it that are amazing I enjoyed
 the first season very much she is really fantastic yeah I watched a few episodes
 of the first season it was good I don't know why I stopped watching it I might
 have just forgotten about it maybe I went to sleep you might have seen the
 whole thing it was only like eight episodes Jacob oh maybe I saw all of it
 that yeah cuz they weren't long right no yeah now an hour okay yeah but let's see
 you guys want to do a little scoop mail here oh my gosh more than anything on
 earth let's do a little scoop mail we are one from dirty rotten cone artist
 dearest Paul your gnome repair operation from episode 1194 wouldn't make an
 excellent YouTube channel you could film your gnome repairs and put them up as
 fun videos you could then parlay that and then selling the gnomes from the
 videos people could send their gnomes in for restorations and you could film
 those and charge for it the money prints itself I look forward to the
 meteoric rise of Paul and Anne Anne's gnome dome fucking with the face that's
 the dirty rotten cone artist Paul have you thought about opening up a gnome
 hospital we thought about it we actually did talk about it a little bit and was
 like maybe we could just do this and I was like oh no I'd love to do that
 today so Paul might might be having problems here I said you know and said
 maybe we could just do this and I thought yeah that'd be great but I don't
 I don't think so oh I'm gonna work out it's over guys it turns out gnome
 repair does not provide health care so but gnome repair content does provide
 extra money that is true I'm not ruling it out in the
 future fixing up stuffed animals I'm not ruling it out in the future I'll tell
 you one problem though with some of that repair video shit I don't know if you
 guys are how much how deep do you guys go in repair videos because I watch quite a
 bit awesome all I'm doing I used to watch a lot of them like fixing old game
 systems and whatnot but it turns out like a lot of those channels just fuck
 up the product and then pretend to repair it you know what I mean like
 don't intentionally they're filthy liars yeah yeah yeah yeah Jeff Loomis do this
 on your video you could you could like carry a gnome up to the roof and then
 parachute it off and then you'd have to fix the gnome they go oh no my gnome you
 could just uh you gotta be what if you took the gnomes and you know just you
 turn them into something you can fuck I'm glitching out sure now you're
 glitching up your honor he's too busy fucking that gnome glory gnomes is a
 great name I'm back Paul has terrible internet today recording his own end but
 but he has real bad internet hey Fendi or flindy flindy flindy flindy put up a

 instinct is to keep clearing out the horse it's kind of reset that I actually
 only used one answer I got from hazel then I passed the other two so I'm gonna
 actually switch to scoop stable please for 400 Matt's gonna make a change let's
 see listeners listener letters become scoop mail but if a horse delivered them
 the segment would share its name with the 1860s all equine postal service that
 galloped across the West that would be the pink pony club the pink pony club
 that's the way you deliver letters pony express the pony express of course it's
 the pony express I've read that they did not actually gallop the very far they
 would it was apparently a what do you call like a publicity stunt they would
 gallop into and out of town to make it look like they were just galloping the
 whole time but you couldn't gallop a horse that long so they just gallop in
 and out of town and then just walk the horse that makes it was apparently like
 a publicity thing that they did on purpose yeah those man the whole world
 is bullshit man yeah Paul hoof and glory hoof and glory for 1200 and the 1973

 vomit yeah yeah show me vomit vomit there we go man I was you not I was not like
 if you gave yourself points for regurgitate because those are different
 things no they're not are they no they're not rotating vomit is not
 regurgitation I believe it just from an attention standpoint no but I mean you
 can say that birds regurgitate baby birds mouth the thing that took down our
 podcast with us vomit versus vomit like I went to counter I was like I don't
 want to have this I don't want to have this argument at all I shouldn't have
 even said what I said I suppose there I mean like it's probably the bird
 probably is regurgitating food that hasn't gone all the way past it's uh now

 difference I just don't know what the difference is yeah Matt you're up scoop
