 Everybody's like what does he have? What's the condition? It's only because of my tight frame. You can't see me applauding your impression of the guy

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:25,660
 You the ice cream truck drivers, thank you so much ice cream truck drivers

5
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,000

11
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,240
 Yeah

12
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,760
 Here's a show

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:59,480
 Hey, Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social? Yeah, I'd love to great. Let's go

14
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,600
 Guys it's Milo season

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:16,000
 Are you using proper math this time

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,800
 Oh

17
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:35,140
 Boy have you started walking already I have and I'm trying to keep up the thing where I run a little bit

18
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:42,780
 And okay, I want to start running again, and I'm embarrassingly sore from very little running again

19
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,160
 Running's not good for you, Matt

20
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:51,200
 It's definitely not good for me. I think it's good for other people. But it's not good for me. I don't know

21
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,160
 It's probably good for someone. It's hard on the joints, especially men of size

22
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:01,600
 Not that you're a man of my size, but still I'm I don't know. I'm certainly in the plus category

23
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,560
 Yeah, but I don't know but still yeah, I can't I I would die if I tried to run at this point

24
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,840
 I think well

25
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:15,640
 I was walking the other day and I saw someone running and they were like barely moving like they just simply have their elbows up

26
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,680
 And it was like this very it was almost like they were more like tiptoeing than running

27
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,800
 Do you know I mean where they just holding their elbows up? No, no, no like like this, you know

28
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,720
 You know like when you when you know, I don't know and I'm trying to describe it for the audience

29
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,840
 It doesn't help our listeners. It's like this

30
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,240
 It's like that ball

31
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:43,360
 Paul is doing me like lazy deep masseuse right now. Just the two sharp elbows. Just I'm a lazy deep masseuse

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,720
 Lazy deep masseuse. Let me elbow your caboose. I'm a lazy deep

33
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,720
 Yeah, I do like a nice elbow in my caboose

34
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,960
 My elbows slipped in your crack. Oops

35
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:09,480
 Feet you're not above right? I mean that's what it's all about. Really. That's why I go to the massage parlor for the possibility

36
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,640
 Something inadvertently slipping into my crack

37
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,200
 It just comes close to the crack use your paw whisper, please

38
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:25,140
 Please. Well, it's it's like a prehensile tail back there. It's just it grabs at whatever might come near. It's like an antlion

39
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,680
 Sir let go of my elbow. I

40
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,960
 Can't I can't control it. It has a mind of its own

41
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,440
 It's like Quado from it's prehensile, but I can't control it. That's right

42
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,320
 Basically moving their arms back and forth like almost like a dance move and then they were kind of just shuffling their feet along and

43
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,200
 I thought to myself. Well, if that counts as running I

44
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,800
 Can start running more?

45
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,600
 Yeah, yeah

46
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,280
 Yeah

47
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,620
 That counts then I should start going from walking to lazy lazy running or

48
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:11,360
 Lazy I can do that power walking is fine. I think the run it's it's the it's the coming down hard and putting the bumps on

49
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,840
 The joints kind of thing. Well, I was because I was reading an article and they were like, oh, you know like

50
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:23,080
 Specific style of power walking is in vogue right now out of Japan, which means of course, it's nothing is happening

51
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,920
 and

52
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:30,600
 But they simply referenced a mile time of like, you know power walking and like doing a 15 minute mile and I went like gulp

53
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,800
 I don't want a mile in 15 minutes the power walked it for 15

54
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,740
 15 minute mile per walking walking

55
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,720
 Huh

56
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,920
 They just toss it out in the area like it was nothing and I was like wait

57
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:54,040
 I'm at like an 18 19 minute mile when I walk. I don't walk a 15 minute mile. So the best is like three minutes, right?

58
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,760
 Running of just that just the the best like nobody's gone faster than like a three-minute mile. That's correct

59
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,760
 I don't even know if anyone's not a three-minute mile

60
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,400
 Okay. Yeah, I don't think so. Yeah

61
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:15,640
 If only there was a way I could find out no 333 13 pondering what is it three three what three

62
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,200
 343 point 13 seconds challenge accepted Jacob. Okay

63
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,040
 Three was that that guy was that notorious with the spring legs was he able was that how he got it?

64
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,240
 No, no, they don't set the records with with that. Yeah. Yeah, and then he accidentally trampled his ex-wife

65
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:43,400
 It is a man whose name I'm not going to try to say it starts with a G but he's he's from

66
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,160
 Morocco give it a shot. Jacob. Give it your best shot. Hey girl

67
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,120
 First of all first of all the barge first syllable Jacob had to take a timeout

68
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,140
 That was the whole thing that was the whole thing. What are you talking about?

69
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,240
 El garage

70
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,600
 G-u-e-r-r-o-u-j

71
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,440
 J el garage

72
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,300
 El garage, I think is it that's it pronounced Baton Rouge

73
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:24,000
 His Moroccan name means the red stick. I actually got a good laugh. I was doing a card trick

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,900
 You know the Spanish Spanish poetry card trick in San Antonio. I said at San Antonio, of course is French for the red stick

75
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:36,360
 And then I said, oh wait, that's Baton Rouge. It's Spanish for the good land

76
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:43,300
 Nope, that's Milwaukee and I need more of us. I need more of the I need. Oh the the translations. Yeah

77
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,300
 Oh, what does that mean? What does the main mean?

78
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,320
 The moin it's for the boy. No, it's it's it's it's Italian gangster for the moin

79
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:58,080
 Hey, you got the moin what's a boy, huh?

80
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,320
 You don't got the morning

81
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,640
 Friends are still fine. I'm playing ignorant. I'm playing an ignorant jerk

82
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:15,600
 All languages are up for grabs right the moin the bears. Well, I just had a

83
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,980
 Another zoom meeting with the skit crew

84
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:27,160
 I don't know if I said already but steel city improv theater still city improv theater. We are starting a

85
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,600
 new

86
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,600
 class session

87
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:38,080
 Sadly, I did not get enough registrants in my class for my class session to move forward for the first four weeks

88
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,240
 Seems to be a continuing theme in the

89
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,480
 Aegis

90
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,800
 We got to get you out there doing shows buddy, that's it's not ageist. It's not ageist. It's just a matter of

91
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:58,200
 I'm teaching level one and we got to get some level ones to get the further thing, you know

92
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,840
 So hopefully in October, we'll get things leveled out

93
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:09,680
 Rich Tellurico is coming out to do a workshop in October. So that'll hopefully help too. We'll see how that all goes

94
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,720
 Yeah, but we're just discussing getting to know the faculty and yeah, we're gonna hopefully start doing some performances

95
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,700
 For the student body and building up something of a community again, you know, I

96
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,600
 Yeah, I don't think you should ever try to start

97
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:31,640
 Anything except with the foolers tour. I don't like anything on the East Coast during the first weeks of September is a good idea

98
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,640
 I think well transitioning from

99
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:40,880
 August I need I need you and a time machine to come back and have a nice long conversation with Justin a few months ago

100
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:47,440
 I can provide I can provide one of those two things you need. Okay, one of the two things great. Okay, it's a time machine

101
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,240
 No, no, I think the first time I lose tour

102
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,360
 We were dragging ass and then by October picked up I agree and that's that's seems to be what happened with my last free

103
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:02,320
 Class too is I went down to six students from 12 the previous time. Yeah. Yeah, so it's just it is

104
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:09,520
 It's a busy time and it's just a weird time and August and September is a nasty transition from people doing the summertime things to whatever

105
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:15,760
 Fall is gonna be I guess that's true. It's just it's just whether you do or don't have kids. I think it's just a big transition time

106
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,560
 well, hopefully

107
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,940
 That'll change up. We'll see speaking of transition

108
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,640
 Yesterday and had a little bit of time I

109
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,000
 was off and so

110
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,240
 she has been desperate to

111
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,960
 convert a corner of the bedroom the big

112
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,000
 bedroom

113
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 into a reading nook

114
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,840
 Okay, is this for you? Is she is she trying to encourage you to read? She's like my husband can't read

115
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:57,520
 No, I'm going to teach him. No, she sees me in bed with a comic every night. I am I am really I'm reading

116
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,920
 I'm not reading, you know anything's too profound, but I'm reading a shitload of comic books now

117
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,240
 I read almost every night. I read some more fantastic four again last night

118
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
 No, she's uh

119
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:16,200
 What do you think would be the recipes required for a reading nook?

120
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:22,440
 What the the recipes what do you what do you put in a reading nook oh

121
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,240
 What a chair come on?

122
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,760
 Jacob gets the gold star. That's the big requirement a chair

123
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,960
 I play my zoom delay for not tying Jacob. I said good one. Did you say chair as well?

124
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:39,960
 I said come at your specific matter Matt also said comfy chair. I'll give you a star to Matt comfy chair

125
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:46,200
 We went to the one and only value City furniture

126
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,000
 down in Cranberry

127
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,360
 Nothing better for the for the spine and the tailbone like value City furniture. Well

128
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,160
 You'd be surprised this chair

129
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,080
 You found is

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:12,240
 Leg go up primarily for you or for Anne. This is for Anne, but this is the funny things nook

132
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,600
 This is Anne's nook, but this is the funny. Okay. She got this one. It's just like all this will do

133
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,540
 Can I get it in this color and they're like no

134
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:28,040
 Can you not get it in this color you can go fuck yourself no well well

135
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,760
 It was gonna be like months you specifically know we saved this color for special children. Right, right

136
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,960
 Don't you have a lot of this color though? We do we have we so much of this. You can't get this

137
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:44,760
 You can't have this color. This is only people who of the higher rankings of the Autobot Society

138
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,760
 I know that you came up

139
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,860
 Just short of the highest ranking and McPheeters

140
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,640
 underachiever

141
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,160
 So clipboard do not sell to Anne McPheeters

142
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,200
 They got a Polaroid up a van

143
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:11,240
 So she quickly set that chair on fire just to teach them a lesson good about not selling her the chair

144
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,860
 No, then the sales lady goes well

145
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:23,240
 Very almost exactly the same price we have the prime model up front

146
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,020

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,720
 It has neck support up. He down he heated. I don't need a heated seat in the house

158
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:21,040
 No, and does and always is she is forever cold. Oh, she's always caught. She's one of those always cold

159
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,040
 She's it's got a hidden

160
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,840
 drink holder in one arm

161
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,680
 the other arm

162
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,520
 Holds the master controls

163
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,920
 forget this

164
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,920
 the integrated

165
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,960
 Bluetooth sound system

166
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:46,140
 This chair is basically a high-fi stereo and

167
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,840
 She would never have have gone for this but as soon as she got in it felt how comfy it was

168
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:02,640
 Realized she could get the color she wanted and then started thinking about it. She was actually she said

169
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,760
 We were going to buy the thing she said

170
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,760
 You know, I was thinking about getting a little

171
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:20,420
 Radio or something to put in the room so that I could do like Bluetooth stuff to listen to listen to music and stuff

172
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:26,980
 And and I was like, well now you can just hook it to your your chair. Your chair is basically your

173
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,920
 Your stereo your radio. It's all you need. Yeah, and and it can just play stuff

174
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,400
 Even when you're in bed, you can just be listening to your chair

175
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,320
 And I was like that that radio was gonna cost you probably upwards of $50

176
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,560
 This is this you're getting this thing for free at this point. So yeah, it was funny

177
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:51,300
 but but she gives me guff because I don't know if any of you have experienced this but going shopping with me I

178
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:58,000
 Will just be like yeah get that I'll get the better one get the really nice one go for that. Oh, yeah, you need that

179
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 I I am similar. Yeah except when it comes to basic technology being included like I don't need my free

180
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,920
 Yeah, yeah, I don't get the things like that. I don't get the things like the speakers

181
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,800
 I don't like the idea that a program of a washer and dryer for my phone. I don't find that more convenient in any way. I

182
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,720
 I would normally agree 100% but the speaker in the chair

183
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,160
 Think about this. This is your reading nook

184
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,440
 You can just do audiobooks

185
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:33,240
 Right and that's part of it or you can have just soothing music while you're reading and

186
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,120
 with all the neck pain I have for putting on headphones and

187
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,280
 That's right as I given myself

188
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,680
 Well wearing those that for me that's true

189
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,840
 Like how much nicer would it be to just turn on your side and fall asleep without having to have headphones in or anything?

190
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,440
 Now we're getting now we're getting to what you actually want out of this chair

191
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,880
 I'm not getting anything out of this chair. Although she was like don't you think you're getting something out of this chair?

192
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,360
 Don't you think you'll ever fall asleep in this chair? I'm like, yeah, I might fall asleep in this chair someday

193
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,200
 But the other thing yeah, she was really concerned about was

194
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:12,080
 She wants it very close to the wall because she got specific measurements for the room, you know

195
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,520
 Pardon me I am fighting a terrible cold

196
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,080
 She says, you know, I

197
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:25,120
 I want it to kind of hug the wall and the sales lady's like four inches clearance

198
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,800
 And she's like what it's like

199
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,360
 Four inches away from the wall. It can fully recline

200
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,920
 That's it. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's that's amazing. Yes. That's yes

201
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:43,880
 That's that's impossible. Are you think so? But what it does is it like it moves the butt part forward as it does. Yeah

202
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,920
 It's incredible. It's an incredible chair

203
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:54,840
 So this is the part of the show that you want to be on zoom or on twitch to see because now you can see the hand

204
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:00,200
 You sit in the chair and just slides down. It just slides. It doesn't recline

205
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,520
 That's not four inches. It doesn't slide. You guys listening. You can look at Paul

206
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,680
 And does that Jacob look like bad break dancers from the 1980s with their slide motion?

207
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,440
 Slide you're really missing out bad break dancers

208
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,880
 We're as good as that

209
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,880
 Crazy bitch from Australia. Yeah, of course. I think she's known as a great break dancer

210
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,720
 Olympic consideration right

211
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,560
 Is breaking out yeah, oh

212
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,480
 I had no idea

213
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,280
 We each she was so bad. They eliminated break dancing, huh?

214
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,060
 Each host nation can eliminate games and add games

215
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,960
 Well, they did it

216
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,200
 Well, that doesn't make any sense though cuz the next one's gonna be in LA supposedly, right

217
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,960
 correct

218
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,440
 Why in the hell wouldn't you do breaking in LA?

219
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,000
 Because no one does that

220
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,240
 We don't have competitive break dancing in this country doesn't boogaloo fish still live out there

221
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,360
 How about how about who else is out there?

222
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:20,640
 The decision for the 2028 sports that would be at the Los Angeles Olympics was made before

223
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,840
 breaking debuted in Paris

224
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,560
 So it was not our friend ray gun

225
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:35,520
 Who who got rid of breaking it was already before ray gun dance my last guy access to the time machine Paul requested earlier

226
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,600
 You know

227
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,200
 it's possible that someone has now invented a time machine because a couple of people have said things to me in the last couple of

228
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,880
 Days about going back in time machines to do just silly little tasks like this

229
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,820
 So I think I think we're living in the timeline now

230
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:01,660
 Is around and we're just gonna use it for a little for tedious little tasks like this. They're like boogaloo shrimp. Mr. No bones

231
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,280
 Who are some of the other ones?

232
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,680
 turbo, oh

233
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:13,060
 There were great names. Yeah, the names were amazing the name there should have been a medal ceremony just for the just for breaking names

234
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:19,440
 Yeah, nah, I'm just I'm sad to break it isn't there. Anyway, and getting a

235
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,500
 Wonderful chair soon for her reading nook. And so that's coming to fruition

236
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:30,360
 Which I'm super happy for her is this nook. What makes it a nook your house already has a nook

237
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,360
 It's just a corner of the bedroom that we've we've cleared out

238
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:39,760
 So it used to hold the TV in the bedroom and never watch his TV in the bedroom

239
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:45,040
 okay, so we took the TV and the TV stand out to her in-laws and

240
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,880
 That's where that lives now, where do you watch TV on your phone?

241
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,640
 I have it on my phone

242
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,160
 Well, I'm usually sleeping in a separate room most of the time

243
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:02,600
 Because my crazy 2 a.m. Wake-up call is a little jarring

244
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:08,240
 so yeah, a little jarring so yeah, so we're switching stuff up with

245
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,080
 all that stuff and

246
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,960
 sleep I

247
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,100
 Sleep in the guest room right next to her in the reading nook

248
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,240
 Okay. Okay. Yeah, and you know, he's gonna be sleeping reading nook in there

249
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:27,320
 I have I the whole thing is a reading nook and you should demand a reading nook in the guest. No, no, no

250
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,580
 No, no, no, don't even say that. No and would be like one two for one

251
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:40,260
 It's two twin beds in this guest room and the one twin bread tin twin bed

252
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,540
 I sleep in it's made of bread. You told us

253
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,800
 It's all bread I do I lay in bed just whoops all bread

254
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:54,220
 Little snack little snack before bed. Oh crusty

255
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:59,480
 Just like pudding skin, I've got a I've got a

256
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,760
 little side table stacked high with trade paperbacks and comics and

257
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:10,480
 The second twin bed is equally stacked high with trade paper back

258
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:19,760
 Where do you sleep in the bed without the comic books on it, but I also I also it serves another purpose I

259
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,640
 Take giz

260
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,720
 To bed with me. Yeah, little lady Elizabeth who is the troublemaker?

261
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,440
 She's the old queen who always likes to start shit with the other dogs

262
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,760
 So I take her to bed with me so and can get some decent sleep

263
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,760
 Some of the time. Yeah

264
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:47,960
 Some of the time that dog could use a recliner. Yeah, well, that's that's the other thing. That's the other reason that that dog read

265
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,120
 She reads at the foot of the bed

266
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,640
 With her little with her little she does get a little snacky cake every time she comes to bed

267
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,840
 Well, she's got me trained forget about it

268
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,400
 I take I get a little biscuit for her if I don't drop a biscuit on the end of that bit

269
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:12,280
 Biscuits oh, man, you joke night biscuits is where it's at and in the morning

270
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,280
 Biscuits night biscuits

271
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,680
 This morning, this is my routine I get up I let giz out

272
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,080
 Ted wakes up in her bedroom and he wants out, too

273
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,320
 So I get everything squared away

274
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:33,360
 I bring giz back into Anne's room and let her snuggle with Anne because she has to keep them separate and

275
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,640
 then

276
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:41,660
 After Ted and sometimes Adora goes out Bill hardly ever goes out at two in the morning

277
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:47,780
 He's just sleeping in the bed. But when they come back I have to have I get four doggy biscuits

278
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:53,720
 Get everybody back in the room close off the little gate and that's my ritual in the morning and in the more

279
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,000
 It's it's it's two in the morning and all you hear is

 Four dogs, are the dogs making any noises? My favorite R&B band from the 70s was Otis Doughboy and the night biscuits

281
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,480
 Their first single was

00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:19,000

00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:23,560
 Boys the dark side of Otis Doughboy abandoned by the night biscuits

317
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:31,260
 When we come back Otis Doughboy hits rock bottom

318
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:37,000
 Kept singing about masturbatory membranes and

319
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,200
 The night biscuits were done

320
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,820
 Next on VH to in front of the music

321
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,320
 I got really

322
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,640
 really drunk off of

323
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,960
 hefeweizen and

324
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,760
 Put the tour bus in a tree

325
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:02,400
 And three three of the night biscuits died on impact I

326
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:10,560
 The other eight just left voluntarily that's right. There were 11 night biscuits. I

327
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,360
 told you

328
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,480
 The show I did where I handed someone my knife for the rubric and said you believe in the power of the magic wand

329
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,180
 And she said I believe in the power of the Lord Jesus Christ, right?

330
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:28,200
 Right a follow-up here. Yeah, I didn't realize I said you believe in the power and twice in my show. So oh, I

331
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:35,040
 Was doing a show in San Antonio and I had some up to the signature. I believe you believe in the power of your your own signature

332
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,200
 And I forgot that I say it the same exact way and a woman goes

333
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,120
 Well, I believe in the power of the Lord Jesus Christ first. Oh, wow

334
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,880
 a polite applause. Yeah

335
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,280
 Wow

336
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,880
 And I said, okay, and then we did the whole trick and it worked and everything went great

337
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:59,880
 And then I said really sarcastically. Well, of course every magic I pull off of course is also because of Jesus Christ

338
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,920
 and I got a

339
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,360
 rousing round of applause

340
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,640
 Amount of applause

341
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,960
 That I like froze like as if I didn't want to be seen by a reptile

342
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:19,740
 Like sure clapping and I literally was like stop you melted into the background. Don't don't make a move

343
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:26,120
 You can just like buddy. I made a small joke and you reacted like it was a large joke and now you've startled me

344
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,580
 No, it wasn't a joke at all. No, and then I was actually giving

345
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:37,040
 Credit for my entire show to the Lord or my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. They were just they were genuinely applauding

346
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:42,720
 Yes, that you had given credit to Jesus. Yeah. Yes, and that opposed was fascinating

347
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,640
 So awkward that I froze because I was like if I make a move, they'll know

348
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,560
 That I don't that I was being a smart ass to the Lord

349
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:56,700
 Yeah, and then they're gonna turn on you like wolves. I was like, and if they Google me, I'm dead. Oh, yeah

350
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:06,900
 It's good that we don't say godless in the first two words of our podcast description. Yeah, right. Oh shit we do. Oh boy

351
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,780
 We sure do false advertising

352
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:15,840
 False advertising, you know, what's funny Matt? Are you considering changing your wording now? I am

353
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:22,920
 Are you considering changing your religion now both? Yeah, I figure okay good. I mean, I just want to go wherever the money is

354
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:30,360
 Boy, it's the same thing that happens my darling. That's where the money is. It's the same thing that happens with Star Wars fans

355
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,220
 when you say may the force be with you and

356
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:40,300
 Then and also with you exactly that becomes the response. It's just turn a phrase

357
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,520
 It's just clocked into the head. Yeah, you know, yeah. Yeah. I

358
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:50,200
 Mean that's just dead. Laszlo in the chat says preaching whatever you believe in is the ICS moniker

359
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,720
 Which I think is just true

360
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,240
 Yeah

361
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:02,200
 Moniker is basically do what you want. I wasn't like angry that it happened. I wasn't like you just confused you idiots you shape

362
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:08,080
 Good job sheeple

363
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,760
 Fools you idiots

364
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:23,680
 Oh, you guys didn't think that trick was too bad. Oh, that's right. You're a bunch of sheep. Let's get him booked in next week

365
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:29,240
 But yeah, um

366
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:34,440
 But back home from here now through scoop fest, which is exciting good

367
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,480
 My dude, I was about leaving right before scoop fest

368
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,840
 After

369
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,840
 Carton of milk or a pack of smokes

370
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,120
 Yeah, that's it

371
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:51,160
 Hey, I've got a I've got a conundrum. I want to run by you guys. What is that? Oh good

372
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,380
 That is conundrums are a specialty

373
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,800
 okay, so

374
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:00,720
 I'm scheduled to do my shift tomorrow at the old Tarja and

375
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,800
 Then after that, I'm not scheduled at all next week. Oh

376
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,520
 But I am scheduled the two days before I leave for scoop fest

377
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,920
 Okay, so I think they just

378
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:22,320
 Forgot to schedule me for next week. Oh jeez. Now. Here's the thing. You're scheduled in the future past that exactly

379
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:29,860
 Now I asked Dan about this because I did want her opinion and I came back from a managerial standpoint saying

380
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:35,240
 She she schedules people all the time. She said I would probably like someone to bring that to my attention

381
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:42,680
 Just to you know, cuz people make mistakes things happen. Yeah, and it has happened before where I haven't been scheduled and

382
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:48,360
 The bosses are like why isn't Paul here and they're like he's not scheduled

383
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:53,960
 It's kind of like but they discovered on the day right it's like

384
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:59,320
 Dummies they discover it at 4 a.m. Yeah when they'd love to have things going their way, right?

385
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,640
 so

386
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,160
 but I

387
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,400
 personally

388
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,520
 Am cool with just

389
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,280
 taking this week as a

390
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,400
 zilcher

391
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,800
 counting on

392
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,120
 the little bit of funds that will probably come in through our

393
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,280
 Bucket show

394
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:24,480
 Right. I will I will almost guaranteed make as much at Bucket show as I would

395
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,680
 For whatever a couple of days. I'd be doing at the old Tarjay. Oh

396
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:34,760
 You think so, do you I guarantee? Yeah, so we already spent your thousand dollars Paul

397
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,460
 You think I make close to a thousand dollars

398
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:43,200
 How many hours usually work at Target

399
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,440
 anywhere between

400
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,500
 15 and 20 basically a week give or take

401
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:54,660
 There you go. Yeah. Good. How many how many days is this gonna be?

402
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,400
 it's usually

403
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,040
 Three or four usually usually three or four

404
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,720

406
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,660
 You know doesn't like this bit my cat, but let's keep going

407
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:17,640
 Shmoopy hates this and then multiply those hours by diddly and squat as far as my payments

408
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:23,120
 Again, you should be on zoom and twitch Matt just showed his very annoying cat. Yeah camera

409
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,640
 He showed the cat annoying annoyed annoyed her head shut up. She was napping. It was like the fuck

410
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,840
 Yeah, no, that's straight up a no fun annoying at all annoyed. That's so funny

411
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:38,540
 Okay, go ahead that that sounds like my paycheck right there

412
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:48,480
 But two bucket shows

413
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,320
 See that's like in that's what I'm counting on. I'm counting on that double dip bonus

414
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,560
 That and some other little

415
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:04,800
 Things coming in there you always give HJ's out front of it McMullin's so you always got that going for you, right?

416
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,800
 Right, we'll walk it around money

417
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,160
 Yeah. Yeah, my portable

418
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,280
 privacy tube

419
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:19,200
 But I take with me officer this is happening with the privacy of this tube

420
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:27,400
 Hey, hey buddy. Hey. Hey, come over here. Yeah, what's up? You wanna you want standing a tube and let me jack you off?

00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:41,600

423
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,040
 Not allowed for search and seizure

424
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,720
 Except from the government's that yeah, that makes it legal

425
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:56,760
 In fact, have you see my license plate? It just says I'm not traveling in a work vehicle

426
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:02,520
 Yeah, half of the tube is a modified Gaston flag and instead of a snake. It's a curled penis

427
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,360
 Good good

428
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,800
 Don't jack on me. Don't bite on me. Don't

429
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:17,960
 What what's this empty bag of economy 12 pairs of socks, what's this what's this wrapper from

430
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,360
 That is my XL

431
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:26,200
 Improvised condom that I have to use. I can't Magnum's don't even work for me

432
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:32,140
 I have to use so much worse than where Matt was going to use old. I have to use old sock bags

433
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:35,160
 You know you think I could use like?

434
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,920
 Grocery bags, I can't

435
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,860
 The grocery bags don't have the plastic doesn't have enough rigidity to maintain

436
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:49,920
 But yeah, I always complain about my condoms. It's not enough rigidity old

437
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,720
 12 to 14 pack sock bags are my condom of choice and honestly

438
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:00,400
 They only cover about half of what I got going on down there. Yeah

439
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,160
 girth and

440
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,840
 Circumference wise both

441
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:13,200
 Deal yeah deal is right. Yeah, no search and seizure

442
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:20,760
 So for Canadian scoops out there in October. Yes land in st. John twice

443
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,960
 Once with princess and once with Virgin

444
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,800
 Okay, and I'm also gonna go to

445
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,640
 Boston and

446
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,720
 Charleston, South Carolina on Virgin

447
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,520
 And so maybe we can do some kind of scoop meetup situation there

448
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:42,920
 Interesting enough. I'm going to like Eastport, Maine is a big cruise stop on the Canadian circuit

449
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:48,200
 Huh, I was like oh cool. I have a bunch of old friends. I haven't talked to in Portland, Maine in a long time, man

450
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,280
 Large state turns out pretty big. Yeah. Yeah

451
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:59,720
 That's the same thing with the Pennsylvania. It's crazy. Like you can't really it's four hours from Portland, Maine. Yeah

452
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,280
 It's not a lunch

453
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,480
 It's not a meetup for coffee kind of situation. Yeah, so

454
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,880
 I'm actually closer to most it's like that's only two hours from Boston

455
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:17,120
 But even that's like not please don't travel two hours to have a cup of coffee with me. I don't think that's worth it. Yeah

456
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,800
 Yeah, although any excuse to get out of Boston

457
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,280
 I should go there. You're right. I should get out and go there. Oh

458
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,880
 No, I meant the people who are in Boston probably want to get out for an hour or two

459
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,800
 Just give them the excuse. Let's get away from that smell of beans

460
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:42,760
 All so many beans. It's all baked beans out there. That's what crack the Liberty Bell. I went to

461
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,320
 them beans

462
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,800
 They're beans though

463
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:55,280
 My my scoop fantasy football name is I say horse you say beans and

464
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,760
 I'm not happy with any part of that

465
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:09,240
 Rock the bad start we've already lost our first game that would be an amazing chant to get going at Churchill downs

466
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:24,360
 My magic I'm in a magic magicians fantasy football league and

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,480

 Went to the the West Gate this week they had the big blues bender

509
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,920
 Oh at the West Gate resort this week, you know that used to be the Hilton where they

510
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,600
 What did you ever see that oh

511
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,720
 God, I just got a flurry of stuff in my

512
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,480
 Messages because September 8th is the anniversary of the closing

513
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,920
 So a lot I thought I felt just good that day. Oh

514
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,400
 Just woke up feeling happy

515
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,400
 No

516
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,800
 Star Trek the experience round here sort of a bitch

517
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:47,640
 So what was that the West Gate this time the big blues bender the the big blues festival that happens in Vegas every year

518
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,640
 It's happened at the West Gate for a few years

519
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,920
 But it's a it's a huge blues festival. They do I think it's either three or four days

520
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:02,720
 And it's like noon to 3 a.m. Every day. Well, is this all held in that of Elvis theater?

521
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,360
 Is that where it all is? Well, that's one of the rooms. So they've got the Elvis theater

522
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,760
 They've got another huge theater set up in the convention area

523
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:19,200
 They've got an outdoor stage. They use the the lobby stage and they have the the shimmer cabaret

524
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:24,520
 Or I don't know if it might be called something different now, but that that theater that's in there as well

525
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:30,460
 So they have five different spaces. Oh, yeah, the shimmer cabaret former home of menopause the musical

526
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:35,320
 Quite a few different things have been in the shipper. Yes, it's all

527
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:43,120
 Sacred halls sacred halls. I saw Gilbert Godfrey performed several times in the shipper cabaret. I saw Gilbert the shimmer and it was awesome

528
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:48,080
 Gilbert in that room was so good. That is that such a good room

529
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,820
 It's a nice intimate space stand-up is great. Oh, it's so good

530
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:56,320
 I saw I was in the I was in the West Gate for this this big blues festival

531
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:00,280
 We were we were outside some friends came in town in conjunction with this

532
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:06,040
 And they were getting married in Las Vegas. So we were we were hanging out with some friends that had just gotten married

533
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:10,200
 We had some family in town. They were they were hanging out the blues bender. So we were we were there

534
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,520
 We're watching music and I say I

535
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:19,960
 Need to go to the restroom. So I excused myself and go to the restroom there in the West Gate Resort and

536
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:24,000
 I'm standing there at the urinal guy comes up to me at the urinal

537
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,800
 Oh, he starts peeing old older guy old guy at the urinal. He comes up and

538
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,340
 Just lets out the biggest fart

539
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:38,480
 You have ever heard in your life

540
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:47,880
 In a pseudo public space, do you think it was prehensile back there was he trying to grab it was I don't think I don't

541
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,880
 Think there was any control happening back there at all that explains the symbol crashes

542
00:44:51,880 --> 00:45:00,560
 Out there rocking a zildjian with his hinder

543
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:09,920
 He almost fucking got it too because I was real close

544
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,400
 turning and vomiting right on

545
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:20,560
 This guy's gonna make me fucking yeah, but it smelled you got a bell. Oh, no. Oh, it smelled

546
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,760
 It was the worst thing that's happened to me in a month

547
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:32,420
 Bad bathroom luck the scoops are commenting you have this is my second

548
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:39,020
 This is my second urinal story on this podcast 12 years. Come on, but but still no no

549
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,560
 I was Jack and it was yeah

550
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,480
 Yeah, I was more than weeks ago

551
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:53,460
 That's you were you weren't counting as a bad story

552
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:58,720
 I've had one bad bathroom experience

553
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:04,920
 The other one I took as a compliment

554
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:15,240
 I was like this is I just looked at him. I was like what what are you doing?

555
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,520
 And he just oblivious of course fucking a blip of course

556
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:23,040
 I mean, I really thought I was gonna yak on him, but that is it was that is the really hard to do it

557
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:29,400
 Sure, no, no if you're gonna rip one the bathroom is the is the most appropriate place

558
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,440
 But it is tough here that close of proximity

559
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:39,120
 Also the Westgate bathroom that I was in I didn't I didn't properly explain the layout of the restroom

560
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:43,080
 What is the Westgate to you? Was this the one inside the old Space Quest?

561
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:47,760
 It's the one next to it. It's one right next to the old Space Quest

562
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:54,120
 It was not the one inside Space Quest not the one inside not the futuristic urinals. No, no, not all that do they still talk

563
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,160
 I

564
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:59,200
 Don't know you just asked Jacob when he definitely specified

565
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,920
 He did not go into the bathroom you just described just ask him facts about the bathroom

566
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:07,080
 We didn't go I sure did I sure did Matt because it's me precisely what happened

567
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,520
 I'm going I'm going into the space bathroom

568
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:13,520
 Even if I don't have to go space bathroom space bathroom

569
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,840
 I'm gonna go revisit it that guy was trying to get there. But as he was jet propelled in

570
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:26,860
 You know if he'd done that in the void of space that could have propelled him infinitely towards the outer rims. Oh, yeah

571
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:32,240
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah. No, he's basically warp speeding right through that bathroom

572
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,960
 oh, but the but the urinals you would piss in them and

573
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:41,600
 It was dumb because we were right next to the Star Trek experience and it wasn't it wasn't you know

574
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,600
 They were like, let's spacey theme it

575
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,960
 But when you pissed in it, it would go

576
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,600
 detecting luck levels

577
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:54,360
 And it's like yeah it would go detecting levels

578
00:47:54,360 --> 00:48:02,160
 Yeah, LUCK luck levels and now it's very similar now. It just says detecting hepatitis is what it says. Yes. Yeah

579
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,120
 We are so sorry

580
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,920
 You got hep C

581
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,240
 Oh bad luck

582
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:18,200
 And then then when you when you left when you were giving it the old the old shake it would go

583
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,160
 May the luck be with you

584
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:28,320
 Instead of the luck exactly may the force be with you was may the luck be with you and I was like first of all

585
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:34,960
 Wrong space thing. Yeah, it should have done. You know should have done other stuff should have been like

586
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:42,940
 Luck long and prosper. The only difference now Paul is Las Vegas offers that urinal, but it says would you like an enhanced urinal experience?

587
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:45,280
 Hey six dollars

588
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,960
 Oh, oh and then does the Borg head come out?

589
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:56,320
 Jake you weren't there does the Borg head come in it does it does as I

590
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:01,800
 After I ate one of the hot dogs. I would part there the Borg head started peeking out

591
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:06,320
 I would pay I would pay six dollars to have the 4d Borg head pop out

592
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:09,040
 Give me

593
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:23,060
 Just so our listeners are clear because some people somebody know some people watch us on zoom some people watch us on twitch

594
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:27,680
 Some people watch us on YouTube some people just listen to this as an audio experience

595
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:34,120
 So for those people I want to make it very clear that what Paul wants specifically is he wants to stand?

596
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:40,820
 urinating at a urinal and then have the head of a Borg alien come out and

597
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:43,480
 Felaciate him

598
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:00,860
 A tour they will blast you with the police a tour resistance is futile

599
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:04,700
 We're getting through the shields captain. We're almost to the balls

600
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:14,280
 Think about space baseball think about space baseball think about space baseball. Oh, no

601
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:18,680
 There is such a thing on DS 9 the Niners

602
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:24,200
 Cisco was a baseball fan, and he would play games of baseball on the holiday

603
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,760
 I thought you meant there was a toilet that would suck you off as you were peeing

604
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,840
 What?

605
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:37,080
 I thought that was really weird thing to have on this Star Trek show, but there is one in Japan

606
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:42,360
 That's true standards and practices fell asleep at the wheel does

607
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:47,440
 Does the thing in the in the space shuttle can't you know what this is on me guys?

608
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,560
 I I was the one in charge of checking this episode

609
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,240
 That we were what if we were in the in the guardrails?

610
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:59,760
 I mean I I fucked this up you'd be pretty close if you put if you if you tape some googly eyes to that

611
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,720
 Space shuttle one you'd be pretty close

612
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,000
 right

613
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,480
 Yes, sorry

614
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:15,320
 And they're just getting off just just laying out the argument go ahead keep going

615
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:20,560
 Okay, it's gonna take a lot to craft

616
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:25,800
 Hold it poor kid and then incorporate it with the sucky offy thing

617
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:31,400
 Sure, but if you've already got the space shuttle one that or the Hoover to our English listeners

618
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:38,040
 The philatator is a real thing in the space shuttle, right?

619
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:41,520
 What do you mean Destro you've lost?

620
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,280
 I

621
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:49,560
 Tried to tell you Cobra commander someone came in the middle of the night and stole the philatator

622
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,480
 Snake eyes

623
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:57,840
 It could have been I doubt it though. He's a ninja. He doesn't have a need for a philatator

624
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:04,960
 It was probably no no it was it was me actually I I definitely had that need for the philatator

625
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:11,400
 That's that's it's me. Oh snake eyes. I got it. It's mine now. You talk now. I do. Yes

626
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:18,200
 This is this is the reason I haven't talked up until now is this is what I sound you were blocked up. I see okay

627
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:24,640
 Yeah, I'm just a little stopped up. I am so glad that we could help you out. Mr. Snake eyes. Oh, thank you

628
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,200
 Thank you. Oh

629
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:29,160
 Cobra commander you are an ignorant poppin J

630
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,560
 What?

631
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,560
 heard me

632
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:42,760
 My watch still stands

633
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,720
 You ignorant poppin J

634
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:56,560
 That was popular TV writers didn't have the internet so they had a that was back when every TV writer was still 70

635
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,640
 That's what's going on and a thesaurus. Yes

636
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:03,660
 Yeah, the source from 1962

637
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:12,340
 Yeah, I believe it means like someone just obsessed with their appearance and very preening and prissy

638
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:22,500
 That's what a poppin J is. Well, thank you. I appreciate that Paul. Yep night biscuits and the philatator says scooper Nova girl

639
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:29,360
 I think you know the other thing you go philatator on the night biscuits. Oh

640
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:36,360
 Yeah, philatator on the night biscuits not too it's not too late. It's not too late to get your scoop

641
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:46,320
 Hey urinal sprung the boar head board if somebody comes to the fucking costume ball as a

642
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,000
 urinal with a boy's head on

643
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,600
 Fucking shit. I mean

644
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:58,360
 That's a contender right there. I've had a few scoops right me to be like, hey, is anyone ever dressed like this?

645
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,360
 And I'm just laughing. I'm like, nope

646
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:08,160
 We got some wild shit coming this time it's been a pretty it's been a pretty rich meaty vein of

647
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,720
 ridiculous characters

648
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:19,380
 I'm dressing up. This is the fart that Jacob described. That's what I'm dressing

649
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:28,120
 I will vomit on you. I will just vomit on you. I think I need to be the Borg head

650
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,280
 urinal equip

651
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,280
 That's crazy. I don't know

652
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:39,600
 All right, Jacob do we miss some scoop mail? Yeah, we do. Let's do some scoop mail

653
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:50,040
 We got a scoop mail from a nod knock scoop in episode 1240 Paul talked about anime and

654
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,040
 manga and

655
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,480
 Referenced go which he claimed is what we would call a fellow

656
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,080
 Go is not a fellow

657
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:07,440
 Othello and reverse II are similar, but go is completely different. Go is said to have been created at least two

658
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,920
 2,500 years ago and we have evidence of it from around 500 BC

659
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:18,080
 Reverse II was only invented in 1883 and Othello was in 1971

660
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:24,240
 I could go on but I'll just stop here and say that Paul was wrong on this one. That's what not not scoop. I

661
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,120
 Was close you didn't look it up. It's close. I

662
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:34,640
 Agree Paul that you were close. I won't take the I won't take the full. Oh, thank you

663
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:39,680
 We're in chance to work for me in the comment. You were really edging on that one. No, it's not that far off

664
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:44,600
 It's not I mean, there's a I think there's a difference in size of the board and that kind of thing

665
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:52,760
 But it's not right size of the board. Yeah. Yeah motion of the ocean and whatnot. Oh, no ranch has not sticking up for me

666
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,760
 No, it's not that's not close. Okay

667
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,680
 You walk alone I

668
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:07,960
 Walk alone into the urinal with the Borg head on it Paul just took a full journey there

669
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:13,720
 Me I don't have people supporting. I have no one no one in my corner on this one

670
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,200
 But it's better because I'm alone with my Borg head

671
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:26,040
 It finally happened Oh it has been a few years of trying to obelisk my fiance

672
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:30,400
 But it was Paul's hot dog story in

673
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,720
 1241 which did the trick I did it. Yes

674
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,520
 conversion, hey, hey

675
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:44,600
 my hubby my hubby to be looked right at me straight-faced and said if you can

676
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:48,080
 Microwave it then that's what I'll do. I

677
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:51,600
 Naively thought about listening to the podcast together

678
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:57,280
 I was the new part of our love story, but now I only see it as grounds for canceling the wedding

679
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,200
 My husband then told me that during his bachelor days

680
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:06,320
 He would microwave three hot dogs and eat them with bread as a special treat

681
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:09,840
 His favorite though was to microwave the raw

682
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:17,400
 Crumbed chicken patties and then put them in between two pieces of buttered white home brand bread

683
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,760
 the super cheap stuff and

684
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:25,240
 Would put some shredded lettuce in if he was feeling fancy

685
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:30,400
 Now now I can recreate that fart for Jacob I

686
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:36,480
 Would like to add here that at this time he was having his

687
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:43,200
 Delicacy he was making very good money. So this was a choice. Yes

688
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:47,760
 It's a choice. It's a choice before wrapping the hot dog

689
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,440
 He would dip the bread in my lord and let it absorb it like a fun. Oh

690
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:57,560
 I am

691
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,560
 150% on this guy's side. I

692
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:03,560
 Read this out to the visionary chef to make sure that he was

693
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:09,560
 Comfortable with me sharing this and he wanted me to add that if he was feeling ultra fancy

694
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:16,080
 He would add in some shredded cheese some pre shredded cheese specifically when question about the kind of cheese

695
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,200
 He said I don't know the cheapest one

696
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:25,440
 Fuck you all in the faces, but only after I've heavily disinfected it. That's the ominous scoop. Boom ominous scoop

697
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,960
 I'm so happy for you. You have found a keeper

698
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:35,180
 This man knows what's up on the culinary tip for real for real

699
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:41,840
 Oh, I like that. That's fantastic. I love me a breaded chicken patty

700
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:46,880
 To this day to this day Mike, but a microwave of course

701
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:53,520
 No, I don't want crisp I want I want it to be rubbery

702
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:59,980
 You are a monster, no, I'm not I just was raised on garbage food

703
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:07,840
 That new recliner

704
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:15,680
 I'm gonna hook up into the Bluetooth. It's gonna go get out of the chair you chicken brisket filled bitch

705
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:24,120
 You if you bring one more hot dog to this chair, I'm gonna come alive and eat you

706
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:28,520
 No, I'm not gonna use that chair very often

707
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:36,120
 Dedicated games and twitch says that they don't care if they're not married yet. It's time for a divorce

708
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:43,160
 I agree. No, I agree. You have found the one

709
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:51,600
 You have found the one that's it now. I had three microwave hot dogs for lunch today. I'll have you know, what that's what I had

710
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:59,080
 Chaotic don't sometimes the universe sends you signs before you marry a person and this scoop has smashed their face on this sign and

711
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:04,200
 Still didn't notice it. Let me tell you. Yeah. Yeah. No the signs. They're the right signs

712
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:09,560
 The signs are go move forward and enjoy. That's not

713
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:15,280
 Versus right now microwave three hot dogs today and

714
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:25,280
 The one in the center was the only one that still retained its hot dog essence the other two

715
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,280
 became very much, uh, you know

716
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:35,320
 Burn unit victims, but but there was still fine still fine. Well, how long do you microwave a hot dog for?

717
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:39,740
 Let's I usually go for about 45 seconds per dog

718
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:42,640
 Okay a minute for two and

719
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,440
 It was three. So I went 130

720
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,920
 Okay, it was a little too long

721
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:53,640
 But and you say the the side ones the two on the outside two on the outside they came a little well done

722
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:59,560
 It came in a little hot at the center one was pretty much perfect. So you microwave three hot dogs

723
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:02,600
 You had one that was better than the other two, but you still ate all three

724
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:06,000
 Do you own a toaster oven? I don't

725
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,760
 Okay

726
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,800
 patreon.com/a scoops

727
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:20,680
 Honestly, the problem is we don't have any space in our fucking kitchen. Our kitchen is so small. It's like a nats

728
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,680
 It's like a nats ass. So it is so small

729
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,440
 I'm sorry

730
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,440
 it's so small that when I'm in it and

731
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:35,200
 Can't be in it and vice versa and we often get angry at each other if we're both trying to be in the kitchen at

732
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,200
 the same time

733
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:43,400
 It's so small if you have one of the utensil drawers open you can't open the refrigerator

734
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:51,480
 That's the fucking truth one more one more it's so small that it's so small that

735
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:57,560
 If it's a cold night, you can just go ahead and turn on the oven and that's gonna heat the whole kitchen

736
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:04,820
 Not a joke just a fact, you know, what happens is the same company that makes that recliner it makes refrigerators

737
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:10,380
 So when you only need four inches from the wall and the whole fridge is dry out on the bottom for you

738
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:11,920
 You could recline on the refrigerator

739
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:18,140
 My kitchen is so small that Bilbo Baggins was like the fuck am I supposed to do to cook in here?

740
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:30,200
 My kitchen is so small that a Smurf came up in that bitch and was like this some fucking bullshit. I need room. I

741
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:38,760
 Mean I really don't know I'm back to the I'm back to the chicken patty. I'm back to the breaded chicken patty

742
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:43,400
 What what's the problem with the breaded chicken patty getting microwaved? It's just gonna be mushy

743
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:47,760
 It's gonna be it's gonna have a little mush to it. But the key the trick is you do it half and half

744
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:54,440
 You flip it half and half you do it with 30 and you flip it for 30 flip it and then it's okay

745
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:57,600
 But it's not gonna be crispy or anything

746
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:03,160
 Well, if you do that, it's still gonna be mushy if you do it one side full on it's gonna be runny

747
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:11,400
 Do one side full on okay, but if you do that will be all right. Yeah. Yeah. I

748
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:21,560
 Grew up on that shit man. That was the I have not seen a single person in either chat defend

749
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:29,900
 Microwave chicken patties. Look, I'm not looking for defenders. I'm just looking for like-minded individuals who are into freedom and taste

750
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:36,320
 You have another branching branching just points out the oven yeah

751
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:43,940
 Winter scoop winter scoop defends you quiet winter scoop. Thank you. I'll tell you the oven like I said

752
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,040
 It's a it's a damn

753
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:52,320
 Gas oven so it takes forever in a day to heat up and then once it's hot

754
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:59,040
 It's hot and our house. It just heats up the upstairs really bad on a hot day

755
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,360
 Yeah, so it's not something we want to use

756
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:05,600
 Wrap the hot dog in a paper towel. What are you talking about ranch slunk?

757
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,840
 You're gonna get all kind of fibers in it

758
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:12,440
 Yeah, that's the problem. That's

759
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:17,720
 Paper towel my concern is bits of paper towel. I

760
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:24,320
 Don't write a paper towels you buy they're just disintegrating in microwave. I'm gonna get you a brulee target brand

761
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:28,560
 That's what they get you for your birthday Paul. What are you gonna get me a brulee torch?

762
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:35,760
 So I could just like brulee my my hot dogs over the torch a hot dog over the sink

763
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,760
 you just put it on a stick and just

764
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:43,580
 You know what? I would actually really love but I I think it would just I know

765
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,860
 It would go on it would end my marriage. I

766
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:50,880
 Would love to have a 7-eleven roller

767
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:55,760
 So I just life any time I

768
01:04:55,760 --> 01:05:03,800
 Have respect for the the cooking the outside in my nature of our how but can you imagine designed for?

769
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:08,720
 But it would end my marriage the house would always smell of hot dog

770
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:16,360
 No, I don't think I would enter marriage ball or the yeah, the glass dome will do it that'll keep it the smell contained

771
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:21,480
 But but also I now see I'm sitting here thinking about nook

772
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:25,200
 I could get those finer. You can't get a hot dog. I could get those I think

773
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:30,180
 Time Paul, this is this is the time in in a married couple's life

774
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:36,120
 We're one of the one of the couple wants a thing and this is your opportunity to be like look

775
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:40,000
 I have always hated reading nooks, but I'm letting you have a reading

776
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,280
 No, you have always hated 7-eleven hot dog rollers

777
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:48,080
 But you could let me have my 7-eleven hot dog roller honestly in the middle of the living room in the house

778
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:53,560
 Honestly, I'm the one who would not like the 7-eleven hot dog roller in the house because it would be too much of a headache

779
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:56,000
 To clean up. I'm gonna get you one of those

780
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:03,140
 Trask areas all those beat skewers spears for outside. Yeah, the giant meat rack for outside

781
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:07,540
 Oh god, I won't attract any animals at all. Don't worry about it and

782
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:11,760
 Teddy Teddy is on rabbit number five this season

783
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,520
 He ate a bird the other day

784
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:20,560
 It just doesn't end with that guy and heaven forbid. I have hot dog rollers going out there

785
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:24,160
 The animal kingdom would come for me at some point

786
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:28,960
 That's not like I like the idea of you outside defending your meat skewers

787
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:36,180
 Like a night like a gladiator there is no defending those meat skewers

788
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:42,920
 Now you're not supposed to clean the hot dog rollers it ruins the flavor says Scoob Jesus

789
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:47,320
 I think you're probably right now. I don't I don't want anything to do with that device

790
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:49,880
 Honestly, yeah, cuz you just want to keep on

791
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:55,400
 Microwaving your hot dogs. The reason I microwave is for ease and convenience

792
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:02,740
 The hot dog roller is not easy or convenient listen unless I go to the convenience store where someone else the trick is getting your own

793
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:04,740
 Bacchus II

794
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:11,200
 Is I know you don't have room for toast oven, but I'm just saying in the event that maybe you you find one

795
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:17,840
 Okay, we used to have one at the old place finishing a microwaved item in the toaster

796
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:23,880
 Gets back the crisp. Yeah. Yeah, if that's if that's what you're looking for

797
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,040
 You have to be looking for that Paul

798
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:30,800
 Paul I need you to look for that

799
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:41,680
 As a friend as a friend no, thanks

800
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:47,780
 Come to scoop fest. It'll be at the end of September

801
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:50,680
 Come watch Matt and Paul

802
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:54,080
 Finally settle this grudge match style

803
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:59,800
 We're gonna have a taste test contest of chicken patties where we both have five minutes to cook it. Oh

804
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:03,800
 I got you licked man

805
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:09,320
 Done in 250. I I get things done just as I cook for children all the time

806
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:15,160
 Okay, so I can cook for you because I cook for my kids. You do the air fryer thing. Yeah, exactly

807
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:18,540
 I have an air fryer air fryer is solid and we used to have an air fryer too

808
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:24,640
 Yeah, yeah a lot of room. It's an awkward. That's true. That's the only top. That's it, man

809
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:28,520
 We got a spot for our dishes. I wash the dishes in the sink. Ah

810
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:32,400
 Do you have

811
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,480
 ambitious

812
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:41,000
 My brother my brother. Could you do a top mounted toaster oven hanging hanging right below a cabinet?

813
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:46,240
 No, we have that with the microwave. It's about it's above the oven already and there's no there's no other space

814
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:49,560
 You don't have any other can you in the kitchen because you're not turning on the oven

815
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:52,720
 Could you put the toaster oven in the case you put it inside?

816
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:59,040
 Listen think my it'd be so well insulated. I think I've told you guys before

817
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:05,680
 Just yeah, just let it melt into the oven that'd be fine

818
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:10,360
 You never turn it on that oven let's just call that a loss

819
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:13,680
 No, we use the oven

820
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:19,540
 Okay, ah and we we the Royal we uses the oven. I use the oven

821
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:23,160
 To hold things. No, I use it to cook pizza

822
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,080
 Fair enough

823
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:30,360
 We forgot about the frozen pizza. Oh, I you know what I did. You know what I did

824
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:35,160
 This is my this is on me. I take full responsibility on this one. That makes one I

825
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:38,160
 got a

826
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,160
 fresh

827
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,160
 pizza from Walmart the other day

828
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,880
 Okay, not frozen

829
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,880
 Okay, so they they they put it like like Papa Murphy's they prepare a

830
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:56,160
 a pizza doughed thing that you just buy and put in the oven put in the oven for a few less minutes and

831
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:59,680
 Good to go. Great. It was so nasty

832
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:04,360
 And I whole thing the Walmart

833
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:10,680
 Ready to bake pizza. Yep was not the best pizza you've had I I

834
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:16,440
 Didn't say it was not the best pizza. I had it might have been one of the worst pizzas I've ever had

835
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:23,960
 This podcast we have a history of very terrible pizza. Are you sure? That's right. It really reminded me of that trunk pizza vibe

836
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:31,320
 Especially especially with the herbs whatever herbs they put on that shit

837
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:35,400
 I hate herbs herbs, you know, you know aromatics, you know

838
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:42,780
 They're covering up. They're covering up bullshit is what's going on. Yeah, Paul likes the aromatics of a nice sausage

839
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:50,000
 I like the aromatics of Chuckie fucking cheese pizza. Like I don't give a damn. Just give me cheese plain

840
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,520
 Simple. Yeah

841
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:57,240
 Ricky says this podcast in quotes you Matt it was you right?

842
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:01,160
 But if Paul can say we use the oven then I can save this podcast. I

843
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:06,400
 Use the oven for french fries. I make french fries in there sometimes. Oh

844
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:15,160
 Do you have even those I don't care about the cone or pizza or like one of those special pans no

845
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,800
 Oh, I have a guess. I go right on the rack

846
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:24,380
 This is not look I'm not a Walmart defender

847
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:27,160
 But the pizza stone makes a difference

848
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:30,800
 Definitely you can get this pans. Do you put it on top of it?

849
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:35,880
 No, what happens is so that so that you can because the truth is if you're to make pizza at home

850
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:41,680
 They say the key is to just bake the dough first and then add the pizza toppings in the second phase and put it back

851
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,200
 In the oven, right?

852
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:47,240
 Interesting you get that that gives you the best pizza crust quality for an at-home pizza

853
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:53,520
 But if you're talking to make your own crust, no, no, I'm saying I'm just letting you know the logic here

854
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:59,080
 I'm asking how do I get this crust that is separate from ingredients that I then cook first

855
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:04,120
 You can buy like a pizza dough. You can buy like a like a like a Bertoli that's already cooked up

856
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:09,440
 No, no, no, no, not one of those like like a canned pizza dough a

857
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:15,360
 Canned pizza dough or like but like I could preformed but a raw pizza dough raw pizza dough

858
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:21,160
 Yeah, you need to be raw. It can't be that the pre the pre-cooked Bertoli or however you say that one. All right

859
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:24,860
 And then at home if some people want to make their own pizza dough, which you're not gonna do

860
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:25,680
 But we don't have to worry about that

861
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:30,040
 But then you you you you basically do around where you cook in the oven on its own as if it's a loaf of bread

862
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:35,880
 Like a fright of a bread you just bake up and then you go ahead and add it before it's fully right with you

863
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:38,320
 You add your okay, I'll just put it back in and that's what gives you the best

864
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:42,000
 Pizza squad now to circumvent that there's this pan

865
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:47,840
 That has like almost like a screen on top of it's like a metal on the bottom and like a metal screen on the top

866
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,840
 it's like a two layered pan and

867
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:53,400
 You can buy that and you put that pizza that you bought on

868
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:59,000
 There and that screen allows the oven to cook the bottom of the pizza crust really well

869
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:03,240
 While you I could show it to you, but it doesn't help our listeners

870
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:07,960
 Well, I mean I put it right on the rack. I don't I don't put anything in between it. We should

871
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:10,680
 Okay, you should alright cool

872
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:16,680
 Just think about it. Yeah. Yeah. No, the pizza's the pizza stone just helps like it distributes the heat and all that

873
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:22,320
 No, I'm sure I'm sure it's better. I'm sure it's better. But honestly, it was just the toppings

874
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,960
 It was a pepperoni pie and it was just not good. Ah

875
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:32,440
 Yeah, I mean I'm definitely like clocking out I'm done defending Walmart pizza right now you

876
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:39,840
 There maybe was an upset that could help you but I'm also fine with you calling it a loss for the rest

877
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:44,160
 Yeah, I'm yeah, I'm down out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm gone. I'm gone

878
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:49,940
 Yeah. All right. There's a pizza buddy. I see. Okay pizza dough. All right. Okay got it

879
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:54,260
 Sorry, I'm sending an email here. Oh, let's do a little Jack vs. Nerd

880
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:57,880
 They could send an email

881
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:23,800
 Hot dogs and microwaves. Yeah

882
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:30,520
 Hello, Jen cruise and scoop here from Delaware. I feel the need to apologize

883
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:37,120
 publicly to Matt Donnelly for wreaking havoc by passing along rumors that

884
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:43,880
 Spellbound on princess cruises was shutting down as it turns out princess is simply revamping the experience

885
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:49,560
 So is not to include dinner and will now be a cocktail speakeasy experience with a magic headliner act Matt Matt

886
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:52,240
 Do you know anything about this or do you know anything about the apology?

887
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:58,200
 I do I brought this up an abracadabra and not here, but this is a listener of both and he wrote me saying

888
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:01,340
 I don't know what the hell this is about and I panicked and wrote my agent being like hey

889
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:05,560
 Fuck and spread my availability out if this is gonna fuck up my dates that I have in princess

890
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:09,320
 Like let's look around and my agent basically wrote me back being like

891
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:12,160
 chill out chill

892
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:22,220
 Like no when they say they're revamping it's the experience in September it's because they're revamping the experience

893
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:24,240
 of

894
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:30,480
 Everything's fine, buddy

895
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:36,120
 Everything's fine. Yeah, Andy cheek. Just put a picture in the chat Paul the pan I'm talking about. Oh, okay

896
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:40,080
 Oh, I see now. Okay, cool. All right. I'll look about getting one of those

897
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:45,920
 Yeah, my wife and I will be on board the brand new star princess on February the 14th

898
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:50,160
 2025 this is I guess from the past

899
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:55,380
 And I will be checking out the spellbound venue that if any scoops would want to go with us

900
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:58,520
 There's all the stuff. Yes. Oh, they have a web. They have a website though

901
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,520
 We've talked about this before go with lisa.com

902
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:04,280
 My wife owns the travel agency and as a bonus for any scoops

903
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:09,320
 We will happily provide you with some onboard credit to defray a pretty potentially all right cover

904
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:12,960
 The cost of checking out spellbound as a consolation to the boys

905
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:18,800
 I humbly offer you a price is sprite that I created three years ago and it never made it to air

906
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:24,760
 I'm excited to hear the questions since I have no idea what they are cruise and scoop. That's aka Chris

907
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:28,240
 So just real quick while we're here. Just just to people if people want to go through that website

908
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,240
 I'll be on the brilliant lady

909
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:32,920

 November 15th 22nd and the Sun Princess the 30th through the 7th

914
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:52,480
 And then I'll be doing more dates and the following year, but those are those are the big cruises

915
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,480
 I'm doing for the end of the year

916
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:59,400
 Very cool. Let's do a little price of sprite from cruise and scoop here question one in

01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:37,920
 2020 through 2022 and is also in the India Book of Records. How long in inches is her hair?

937
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:41,440
 All right

938
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,440
 So where's my phone?

939
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:50,560
 You can't use your phone. I can use a calculator. No, you can't use a calculator. I said no calculators. Where did it say?

940
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:53,580
 We said no calculators years ago. Oh

941
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:59,400
 Right next to the right next to the air fryer. It says no calculators. That's right. Look at the air fryer Paul

942
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,400
 It's right there. Okay

943
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,480
 Let's see. So

944
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:06,320
 48 50 60

945
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:15,000
 72 let's let's go in even hundred. I'll go in even hundred inches. That's a good guess. I will go

946
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:21,400
 130 130 Matt

947
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:24,200
 one

948
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,960
 Wow. Yeah, I think you're both over

949
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:35,640
 Jacob gets a point a hundred nineteen. Wow. Nice one. Jacob a hundred nineteen inches Paul got bit by the price is right rules, buddy

950
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:41,760
 I did good. That's fair question three every time you shuffle a deck of cards

951
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:46,280
 Chances are that you have put them in an order that has never been seen in the history of the universe

952
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:50,360
 The total number of possible ways the deck could be arranged

953
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:55,360
 Ends up being eight followed by how many more digits?

954
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:59,000
 Paul you're up first

955
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,400
 Is it

956
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:05,640
 trillion

957
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:10,120
 Something like that. Yeah, I believe it is something like that. Yes

958
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:16,920
 I will go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 30 40 15 6 and 18 18

959
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,720
 18 Matt

960
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:21,640
 19

961
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:23,120
 19

962
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:25,320
 You know where I'm doing 20

963
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:29,040
 20

964
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:39,920
 Jacob gets a point 67 whole come on boogaloo. We're off by an order of magnitude and

965
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,320
 then some

966
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:48,580
 67 maybe 40 40 magnitudes. Yeah Wow

967
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:54,360
 Let's see Las Vegas is known for taking the essence of other destinations

968
01:20:54,360 --> 01:21:01,160
 Reproducing it and making it as spectacular as the original with its own unique Las Vegas spin how

969
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:05,960
 Tall in feet is the Las Vegas Eiffel Tower. I

970
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:09,160
 Don't know how many feet I got into her

971
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:13,560
 Your honor

972
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:17,080
 Matt you're up first

973
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:26,880
 1400

974
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:28,960
 1400 ah

975
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:34,600
 I mean that seems. I don't know. It seems believable. It seems like a perfectly good amount of feet

976
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:37,720
 Eiffel Tower could be we know feet

977
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:40,120
 Yeah

978
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:42,720
 That seems like a lot of feet though. I'm gonna say a thousand feet

979
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:45,680
 1400 is way too many feet Paul

980
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:48,360
 420 represent

981
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:53,920
 Paul gets a point

982
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,520
 I didn't want to go too high

983
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:59,080
 420 represent

984
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,800
 I

985
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:06,280
 Glad we've got Paul Mattingly here representing drug culture, right?

986
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:12,040
 What is what he told me in US dollars of a Taylor ham?

987
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:18,800
 Sandwich from Tierney's Tavern in Montclair, New Jersey menu accessed on July 18th, 2022

988
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:24,400
 Oh, Matt, this is way up from when you were a young lad serving out like inflation inflation

989
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:29,760
 Yeah, inflation on salted weird pork product that you slide. I have deli meat

990
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,880
 On a cooking show the other day. They were making a

991
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:39,760
 Taylor ham sandwich. They were doing a good Jersey bit making a Taylor ham sandwich. Yeah. Oh my god

992
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,800
 It looked horrible and I still wanted it

993
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:50,760
 It looked salty on as they were slicing it and putting it in the pan it looked salty somehow

994
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:56,200
 These are all designed to get people to drink right everything served in these certainly. Yeah, certainly

995
01:22:56,200 --> 01:23:03,360
 I mean, I think it was designed to survive the Great Depression as well that too. Well, yeah, well, it's coming back, baby. Let's go

996
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,760
 Let's go

997
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,760
 Let's see. So I think the price is

998
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:15,840
 This is Tierney's in 2022. I think the price is six dollars and 38 cents

999
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,600
 Paul

1000
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,760
 Jersey money doesn't go as far

1001
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,920
 That is true

1002
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:31,120
 And plus not compared to the metropolis of Pittsburgh

1003
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:34,120
 They're not gonna have a lot of change on the end this because it gets thrown at them

1004
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:37,600
 So they don't want over goes guessing 1399. What are you getting like a party sub?

1005
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:41,240
 I'm gonna go

1006
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:45,800
 Five eighty six

1007
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:52,800
 186 I was gonna say six dollars, but then you guys are right in that range

1008
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:58,280
 Well, but there's there's room. There's you can squeeze right in there at game scholarship

1009
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:01,400
 Yeah, here's the things we're really get a Taylor ham sandwich

1010
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:06,200
 He's gonna tell her him and cheese sandwich, but he's this Taylor ham sandwich, which means you ah you add whatever

1011
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:08,720
 50 cents for cheese

1012
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:12,820
 God remember those days when it was just 50 cents for added cheese

1013
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:18,960
 Here's the really hard part attorneys, we just charged whatever we never got corrected and so

1014
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:23,440
 The menu it was like once a year. I'd look at the menu back. Oh, really?

1015
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:27,400
 Possible that Matt has never known what this cost

1016
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:30,880
 the Taylor Swift ham sandwich

1017
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:34,280
 It speeds right through you

1018
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:39,240
 I'll split the difference. I'll go six bucks

1019
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:42,080
 six bucks

1020
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:43,360
 between

1021
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:49,000
 Matt was exactly right. Look at you Matt and you know what? That's how it should have been

1022
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:53,600
 That's that's how that was the man the man worked there. He should get it exactly right

1023
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,760
 That's I'm actually impressed that Paul and I were as close as we were

1024
01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:02,040
 Well, you know what though? I should have trusted my gut and I should have said six because I was right

1025
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:05,120
 They don't want to put any change in it because they don't want to get that fucking shit

1026
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:07,920
 Like you're getting

1027
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:13,280
 Yeah, they don't want change thrown at him they got to make everything even dollars

1028
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:21,200
 They're just doing it for their own safety. Yeah, I mean they could still get pelted by some Sacajaweas, but ain't nobody don't knows

1029
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:29,800
 Steven Spielberg once stated in an interview that ET was a plant-like creature and neither male nor female

1030
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:37,000
 According to the film's novelization ET is over how many million years old Paul 40?

1031
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:41,160
 40 Matt 40 million

1032
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:44,720
 Sure, no, I don't fucking know

1033
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:49,680
 Matt you were just talking about the 18

1034
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:56,480
 Novelization the other day. What did it say that? Oh, yeah. Yeah to 2 million 2 million

1035
01:25:56,480 --> 01:26:01,280
 3 million look at this

1036
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:06,360
 Jacob gets a point 10 million damn had million years old

1037
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:13,200
 Over the course of her nearly 70 year reign Queen Elizabeth has seen more thing. Oh, this is before she died

1038
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:18,280
 Queen Elizabeth has seen more than a few regime changes in American politics

1039
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:23,640
 How many US presidents has the Queen met in person during her reign?

1040
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:28,100
 Matt you're up first. Oh, I really want to get this one

1041
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:32,920
 What's from nearly 70 year reign

1042
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:36,240
 How many presidents has she met

1043
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:40,280
 I'm gonna go with

1044
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:43,720
 Five

1045
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:46,000
 Five

1046
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,760
 Let's see I

1047
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:51,800
 She met Kennedy

1048
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:55,520
 She met Trump that's two

1049
01:26:55,520 --> 01:27:02,040
 Boy Matt thinks five. I mean he must be able to count more than just Kennedy and Trump then

1050
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:07,600
 How much which five presidents are you saying she met Matt? I don't know. I'm just guessing

1051
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:10,720
 There's there's Grover Cleveland. There's Taft

1052
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:13,720
 I think she meant FDR

1053
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:19,760
 So, yeah, I would think she I would think she must have over she became years

1054
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:25,840
 I mean very early in her life. Oh sure. I would say Obama and Reagan. I think so

1055
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:33,120
 Yeah, I can see George W getting a visit. I just average it out to two presidents per decade

1056
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,840
 all right, uh

1057
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:40,780
 Yeah, I don't know. Let's say seven Paul eight

1058
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:49,120
 Paul gets a point 13. That's what's gonna be my guess but I didn't want to go too high

1059
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:57,600
 Represents too many presidents too many presidents. Yeah, it is Matt. How many presidents have you met me one unfortunately?

1060
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:04,200
 Was in the room with Clinton

1061
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:07,840
 Yeah, I didn't get to meet him. They're a parliament. I

1062
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:13,880
 Meant I'm a parliament Funkadelic. I'm at Bootsy Collins. Mm-hmm. Good. That's all that's all I'd care about

1063
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:16,600
 hospitality to very private

1064
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:18,960
 Nice of you

1065
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:24,320
 He didn't want to go in the tube when I met him, you know, that was that was when Clinton was touring with the night biscuits

1066
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:27,440
 That's right. Good good old days. Okay

1067
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:33,760
 Officially, I lost three three two. So I well officially so far. We haven't gotten to the bonus round yet

1068
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:37,840
 How many points would you like to wager out of your two points?

1069
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:44,440
 I like to wait your two of my points and I like to go at a medium pace at a medium pace. Here goes

1070
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:53,600
 Wheel of Rally's turn turn turn. Tell us the lesson that we should learn and Matt gets an extra four point Wow

1071
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,160
 Matt is crushing it

1072
01:28:56,160 --> 01:29:01,440
 Matt leaps into the lead with six points. I have to bet all three of my points now

1073
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:06,520
 I'm a low-power kind of spin guy. Just a just a casual

1074
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:09,800
 just just give it a little spin a little spin a roo and

1075
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,880
 I

1076
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,880
 Got a point. Oh

1077
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:19,160
 Currently in second place Paul, I must wager it all dick

1078
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:24,280
 Wager it all. Hi, Jacob. Ah, here we go. I

1079
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,440
 Think he was just commenting on my attitude

1080
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:32,960
 No, no, no, you don't you son of a fuck ass

1081
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:36,600
 No bonus

 At the end of this price is right my crews and scoop Matt wins with six points

 Jacob is in second place with four points Paul is a third place with three points

1084
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:52,020
 Those are the official scores and the scores before the bonus round don't matter at all

1085
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:55,320
 That's from cruise and scoop. It's a price is strike

1086

01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:47,320
 I heard the rooms going away

1095
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:55,460
 No more boats I heard boats don't float anymore. Did boats stop floating? Oh, no

1096
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:59,400
 Say it ain't submarines

1097
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:02,720
 poorly designed submarines these are

1098
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:07,800
 Norma's time we thank people who support us over on our patreon this podcast will be possible without patreon support

1099
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:15,360
 Absolutely among the numerous benefits as you get notifications and links for our live episode recordings that we're doing on twitch as we hunt for a

1100
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:17,360
 New churn. I was missing the churn

1101
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:20,340
 Yesterday, I was feeling like you know, just

1102
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:25,640
 It kind of set my week where I would I do miss the churn driving to the churn and going home

1103
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:31,720
 Kind of yeah, help me really keep like a mental calendar in my head. Yeah of like what's going on Paul?

1104
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:37,600
 You moved to Pittsburgh. You can't meh me you know, I said I said no I said yeah, I was agree

1105
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:40,080
 I was a yeah, not a man. Yeah

1106
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:44,120
 No, I was nodding my head yes

1107
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:48,460
 let the record show I agree I I

1108
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:53,600
 Mending the record to a decide that Paul was nodding his head

1109
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:58,960
 Thank you. No, I heard him down here to my little my little mini churn and it's very

1110
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:05,120
 It's very reminiscent of the churn honestly with all the chotch keys that I have around here, right? Oh, yeah everywhere

1111
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:11,040
 You look there's there's stuff scattered everywhere. So it I've recreated the churn to the best of my ability

1112
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:17,480
 Yeah, that's what I mean. I need a better physical churn space, but we don't have any so that'll be well

1113
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:21,760
 You've got two kids that makes it hard. That's it. That's it and the end

1114
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:25,620
 Move out then I could do it very easily, but then that means my life is sad

1115
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:33,440
 No life's gonna be so much fun when the kids are gone and this is all you have left in your life

1116
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:39,760
 Alright, Matt. We're gonna do a test right now. Yeah, and everybody at home with kids. You can play along with this test

1117
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:44,460
 I want you to think right now is right if you have young young children that still live with you

1118
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:45,880
 You can play along with this test Matt

1119
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:53,260
 I want you to think about these two scenarios the first scenario is the one that you just mentioned your children have left home

1120
01:32:53,260 --> 01:32:59,520
 They have they have gone they have spread their wings. They no longer live with you now, then here's a second scenario

1121
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,780
 They're both 34 years old and still live with you

1122
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:07,920
 I bet I bet it'd be one of those really like delightful like dysfunctional parents for like I don't want to talk about it like

1123
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,680
 Other parents like your kids still at home, and I beg

1124
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:20,020
 I think you're gonna be okay because I think that's gonna happen to a lot more people as time goes forward here

1125
01:33:20,020 --> 01:33:21,520
 I did a show

1126
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:24,800
 Said that's what we do for living. She goes arm retired. I said, oh

1127
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:27,600
 Millennials put your fingers in your ears. Don't listen

1128
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:41,960
 No, and so yeah anyhow we get all that because people find it find the time to head on over to preaching fun dot-com

1129
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:44,400
 It's like a tear that works for them today

1130
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:05,420
 Or if Matt's kids are gonna live with you head on over to farts in a bag dot-biz

1131
01:34:05,420 --> 01:34:19,000

1136
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:44,800
 We don't have any sign of stopping anytime soon. No, whether you'll want us to or not

1137

 The British Bulldogs gonna win whether he wants to or not. I

1138
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:55,240
 And of course, you know we converted our

1139
01:34:56,040 --> 01:35:00,960
 Our our scoop fest to robe time right our scoop fest. Yeah the robe time

1140
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:06,560
 And that's because some people buy different really cool shirts of ours to wear during the scoop events

1141
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:12,960
 And so if you want to wear a really cool shirt underneath your new robe that's coming out of the scoop fest

1142
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:20,280
 You can head on over to store jingle dot-com. Oh, that's true. I'm sorry. I didn't know where you were going

1143
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:22,280
 I didn't have store jingle

1144
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:28,800
 Door a big door it's on we got a store

1145
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:38,320
 For people watching the the the twitch here I am NOT wearing a new robe I'm wearing I'm wearing a nice old robe

1147
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:49,760
 No, no, or the sick there will be road items. Yeah, there will be robes, but it's it's a thing

1148
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:54,720
 Yeah, oh, there's other stuff. It's gonna be great. It's gonna be so good

1149
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:58,200
 It's too fast. I want to I want to say in advance. I'll say this again

1150
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:01,680
 Kudos to Matt and Jacob for all the leg work

1151
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:08,360
 Always, you know, no, seriously it really does. I really do appreciate it Jacob. Yes

1152
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:13,320
 Let's let's go. I really do appreciate all that you guys are doing out there in the location

1153
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:17,460
 I've done little bits here and there nothing like what you guys are getting done

1154
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:21,720
 So I really really appreciate it, but it's gonna be magic. I reach out to perform for the variety show

1155
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:25,480
 Yeah, but I'm some we haven't noticed it. I'm just like there's something

1156
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:29,000
 We've we've we have you and I've brought up Paul that we've forgotten to include in the past

1157
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:34,220
 I was like, I'm not gonna forget this year wrote it down wrote the person saying do you want to do a bit in our variety show?

1158
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:39,320
 Yeah, and he wrote oh, I don't I don't do my act for that kind of money, but thank you

1159
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:45,880
 And I was like, I respect it. I respect. Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'm always fine with a no I go I'm relieved

1160
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:50,520
 That I no longer feel guilt for having not included this person in the past

1161
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,200
 Yeah

1162
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:58,400
 Now also go like I respect you just saying straight up like oh, no, I promise myself. That's fine. That's totally fine

1163
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:04,880
 Yeah, that's totally fine. Now. I will I would argue to see Chris Angel perform. He won't be performing

1164
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:09,520
 He will not I I would argue. No, but you're gonna tell me that he invented scoop fest before we did

1165
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:15,620
 Hilarious clearly which is true. Whoever this is and I'm not clear on that, but whoever this is

1166
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:21,600
 Is not aware of the community and is not aware of what scoop fest really is

1167
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:26,960
 Well, that's that's I've made this mistake before with reaching out to people who I thought I was closer to than I was and then

1168
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:29,600
 I'm not understanding our podcast and going like what?

1169
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:36,200
 No, thank you. Right, right, right. Oh, I'm sorry. You don't understand the you don't know what's going on

1170
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:39,880
 I don't know what this is gonna be no one has ever no one has ever regretted doing scoop

1171
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:42,680
 No, I was gonna say to to a to a man

1172
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:47,220
 Everyone that has performed and come to our our spot has been

1173
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:52,240
 Gracious and not only have people never regretted doing scoop fest

1174
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:54,440
 performing at scoop fest

1175
01:37:54,440 --> 01:38:00,760
 they they have people have come to me after scoop fest is over with people who were set to perform and

1176
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:07,600
 Yeah, like they didn't get to perform for whatever reason and then they have been mad for years

1177
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:14,040
 Always they're like, hey, when are you doing that scoop fest again? We got it. We got to set up times. Yeah

1178
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:18,320
