4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Mike Jones is here the jazz demon I am.

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 The star for Matt Mattingly's ice cream social sitting in Pittsburgh PA that's Paul Mattingly sitting at sea it's Matt Donnelly in Las Vegas it's me Jacob the audio guy we're preaching fun.

6
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Greetings from the ocean. Yes.

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Mike do people still call you the jazz demon and when did first people start calling you that.

8
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 As a as a small child no it was on my second birthday it was a rainy evening it was after the second conviction for arson.

9
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 No I of course that was I believe that was Zeke Zabrosky from the Penn and Teller show back when he was a young child.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 He started calling me the jazz demon very early on in in my career with Penn and Teller and Penn latched on to it and still use it every night in the show.

11
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 And I have a jazz demon license plate so I can't get rid of it now oh yeah you're stuck with it now although it's more it's more horrific than that because you can only use how many whatever seven letters so I decided to use Jay ZZ DMN because I thought

12
00:02:46,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Jay ZZ DMN might be a different connotation on a B. So I went with jazz demon but then I get these people say jazz demand what does that mean and you know and so I just I just ignore people.

13
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Do people stop you and talk to you about your license plate all the time I feel like this is something that happens in Las Vegas as people discuss other people's license plates.

14
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Yeah, it's happened more than once, which is one time too many. No, it's no it's it's fine. It bothers me when I come up behind people and I can't figure out what their plate supposed to mean.

15
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 But it always means just on my penis that's that's what it means.

16
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Yeah, exactly. Um, a, but it's it's been oh yeah it's been 25 years. I don't use it myself. You know, hey, how you doing on the jazz.

17
00:03:43,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Anyway, however, I, I'm not offended when when others refer to me as that but it's yeah it's been it's been, but ZZ came up with that because you know, metal, right, I guess.

18
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 More metal is better.

19
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 He keeps wanting me to start the piano on fire and play, you know, a lot of metal music, but I won't do it great balls of fire.

20
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 He's, you know, he wants like, I don't know, Megadeth. He wants some Megadeth covers with the piano burning.

21
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 I think that'd be a fun, a fun new addition to the pre show at Penn and Teller. Don't, don't give them any ideas.

22
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Have you ever played any kind of stunt piano for any any kind of gig. I have not.

23
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Absolutely. Um, I, I mean, in my youth, I would do my Jerry Lee Lewis impersonation and you know hit the piano with my feet and stuff like that. But, no, I, you know, I try to respect the instrument.

24
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 It's when I would when I would play in in in in like lounges and some asshole would set his drink on the piano right in front of me while I'm playing a song, I would scream it's not furniture asshole.

25
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 You know, you want to set your drink on somebody's violin. Really smart. Thanks. But, and that got me a lot of tips. No, that's why I was so successful.

26
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Hey, could you play some Billy Joel? Why don't you fuck off?

27
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Our piano player here is great. He takes requests, but only the requests he wants to take. Exactly.

28
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Our musical director, Mike, at the Second City.

29
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 He, you know, they had a piano that was there on the stage all the time. And this is when we were sharing the stage with the ex burlesque dancers, so they would come in and do the show late night after we were done.

30
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 And there was one day we came in for rehearsal and there was an unmistakable coochie print right on the piano top that you just couldn't get away from.

31
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 And we all just spent the day kind of oogling it. Mike just kind of had to play around it.

32
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 You didn't clean it? No, we didn't clean it. It was, you didn't go get some fucking furniture spray.

33
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Oh man, it's like Jesus is facing a piece of toast or something. You don't fuck with that shit.

34
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 You guys just kept taking turns blindfolding each other playing pin the clip on the pussy and you just kind of just move it around and see if you could.

35
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 Yeah, so there's definitely lots of respect for the instrument out here in Las Vegas.

36
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Yeah, yeah. I had a bit of a reputation because many, many years ago, this is way before the Internet Times, there was a cartoon in the New Yorker that showed a guy playing like cocktail piano.

37
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 And the caption underneath was, "You people make me sick. Nevertheless, here's another toe tapper."

38
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 There it is. That's great.

39
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 I got like seven copies of that in the mail to me. Sure.

40
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 So I guess I had a reputation. Your friends know you, your friends know you.

41
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Now, at this point, you've been with the Penn and Teller show for quite a while.

42
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 There have been many different iterations of the stage there.

43
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Have you ever considered talking them into maybe having a Batman-like secret two key press that would then sink your piano into the stage or open up a secret window?

44
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Yeah, Teller has been talking for years about wanting to make the piano float somehow over the stage.

45
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 And I think hopefully they've gotten that out of there, that's passed them by.

46
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 I'm hoping they'll age out of that idea.

47
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 I've been with them almost half their career now, 25 years almost.

48
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 I mean, it's great. I'm bad with time now, but several years ago, they surprised me with a Mike Jones corner on the right side of the stage with the neon sign and the Mike Jones duo.

49
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 But yeah, I'm happy with the piano. And also, just from a practical standpoint, you can't...

50
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 That is very practical. That's our sound effect for telling you to get the fuck out of here, Mike. Take the directions and go.

51
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 No, no, no. I gotta go? No, no, no. Technical issues on our side.

52
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 So yeah, you had the surprise of the reveal of the corner there dedicated to you.

53
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Yeah, that was nice. But I don't think you really should move a piano often because...

54
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 I try not to. Yeah, well, they're heavy and also they go out of tune.

55
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 But I think the teller's idea may be more in line with having a car appear on stage, you know what I mean?

56
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 So I leave that up to them. But I'll play wherever they put me.

57
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 I've been doing these 50th anniversary gigs with them and it's been really fun.

58
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 And we were doing Boston a couple of weeks ago and Glenn said, what if we put you up in one of the boxes?

59
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 And I said, well, I'd sort of prefer to be on the stage.

60
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 And so they made it work. It was great. But, you know, there are shows, as you guys know, many, many shows now.

61
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 The orchestra is not in the same theater as the performance. They're in a basement somewhere.

62
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Oh, yeah. You know, and it's I sort of draw the line there.

63
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 I'm disappointed when I find out that the orchestra is in a different space, like in a room next door.

64
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Yeah, the first time I came across that was many years ago.

65
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 There was a puppet show, Avenue Q, I think it was, at the Wynn.

66
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Yeah. And I went to it and they're like, and look out about the TV. There's our guys in a suite for, you know, four floors away.

67
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 And I was like, well, that's kind of a ripoff. And it was crazy, too, because in that room we had an orchestra pit.

68
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 We just didn't use it for Avenue Q. Too good for them. That's right. That's right.

69
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 That's weird. For Spamalot right after Avenue Q, we had like 28 orchestra members down in the in the orchestra pit right there.

70
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 I don't know why it didn't get used for Avenue Q. Yeah, they they name it an orchestra pit because there's an orchestra in it.

71
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 You know, you don't want to put you in a suite and keep you away from people.

72
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 You don't want to be in illusions with pianos. What illusions do you want to be a part of, Mike?

73
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 All of them. I'll do anything.

74
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Can we get get in Georgie's Queen of Hearts dress for the for the one bit? Yeah, yeah. I you know, I it's funny.

75
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Someone just asked me last night at the show, are you part of any of the tricks?

76
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 And I don't think there's there's never been a trick that I've been a part of except for doing all the music.

77
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 And I mean, and also the girl, the gorilla where I did the narration, which was actually fun,

78
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 which I had like a whole thing alive, alive, alive, you know, and on the inside, Zomofo, the gorilla girl.

79
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 And I did a whole carnival barking thing while I played like silent movie music.

80
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 But mostly, I mean, an air sax, I mean, we were I was in center stage for that with right.

81
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 But yeah, but I mean, they're not asking me to, you know, do any tricky shuffling or hey, let's, you know, come on up for this trick.

82
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 And let's let our piano player shuffle these cards.

83
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 I think you would have made a really great ball pit troll.

84
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly. I remember that. That was a bit that was done. Oh, what? Twice?

85
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Twice, yeah. It was it was it was teed up. If you see it on the Foolish show, it's my son.

86
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Yeah, I know. I was there. I was playing the ball pit troll music.

87
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 I'm also talking to the audience listening to our podcast. Oh, oh, oh, you have listeners.

88
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 At minimum, the ones that are here now. I'm working on that.

89
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 And we found that on the Internet in front of me at the end of the day.

90
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 And they're like, do they still do that bit? I was like, they never did that bit.

91
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 This was it. I was like, you are the only ball pit troll, buddy.

92
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Yeah, I think that there's only I don't there's not many tricks,

93
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 not many bits that they've only done that limited amount of times,

94
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 except for stuff that they did, especially for for for television.

95
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 But I like specifically was done the year before covid.

96
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 So their ambition for it was to do it in the summertime where they got more families.

97
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Right. Yeah, I remember actually going to recruit a kid each show before it happened.

98
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 And then covid happened. And then three seasons of Foolish happened.

99
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 So by the time the show came back, they weren't like, let's dust off that old chestnut.

100
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Yeah, that's like, you know, and the crew loves it.

101
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 Cleaning all those balls and setting up the perimeter and getting a kid to do magic.

102
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Yeah, I walked past about it. He's like, oh, I would love to have done it again.

103
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 And he is now like two feet taller than he was when he did it.

104
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 I was like, you can't do it again. Everybody get in the thing. Yeah.

105
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 You're out. You are out. It's over. Yeah, it's over.

106
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 That part of your life is done.

107
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Well, I yeah, I walked by a couple of months ago.

108
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 I walked by Robbie Living like after after the end of Haystack and he's like, you know,

109
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 sweeping the hay up. And I said the glamour of showbiz, you know,

110
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 like he's, you know, picking up piles of hay and pulling cards out of it, you know.

111
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 But there's a lot. Tell us a story.

112
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Tell us the story of Jessica Jane and I.

113
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 He was talking about they were working on Broadway.

114
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 He had like a boil on like the inside of his thigh or whatever.

115
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 And it was his costume is irritating him, especially after they did water tank or something.

116
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 So they had this flamboyant costumer on Broadway who basically had to help tell her pop the boil.

117
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Oh, boy. Yeah.

118
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 And he said he just dressed up and wardrobe people on Broadway go above and beyond.

119
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Above and beyond. Right.

120
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 And he said he just looked up a teller from down on his knees going, ah, showbiz, the tinsel and the glamour.

121
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 That's disgusting. Oh, yeah.

122
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 The glamour made me laugh so hard.

123
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Well, Jonesy, you are a podcaster now.

124
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 I am a podcaster in conjunction with the great Jennifer Szabo.

125
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 She's actually running everything.

126
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 I but yeah, yeah, yeah. She's she she she makes it happen. But I it's you know, it's you've been on it.

127
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 It's now actually a thing. It's I just started talking to people that I knew about music and what they liked and music in their lives.

128
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 And, you know, I had these I had the idea came through working with David Silverman from The Simpsons because obviously he's not known as a musician.

129
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 He's known as a great animator and and he but he he's a serious tuba guy and he plays the tuba.

130
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 And so I said, you know, and then Bill Prady, who does The Big Bang Theory, who wrote that show and many, many others, he started playing the saxophone like when he was 60.

131
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Wow. And I said, you know, I know all these people. Yeah, I know all these people that that that music's important to them, even though they're not known for music.

132
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 And so that sort of opened the door.

133
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 And then I started talking with more musicians and also a lot of critics and people that are around music.

134
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And I just did. I'm very excited. I just did a great conversation with Eric, Eric Mingus, who's Charles Mingus' son.

135
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 And, you know, you don't get much higher up in the jazz royalty than Mingus.

136
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 And your stories of him growing up and being there when Mingus met Joni Mitchell and, you know, it's really cool.

137
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 I mean, I'm enjoying it. I mean, maybe maybe my audience is 10 people, but I'm loving it.

138
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 You know, you should have Jacob on to talk about Kiss because he loves Kiss.

139
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Yeah, yeah. No, I mean, that's I'm not, you know, I've I've had I had Scotty Meltzer on who's a juggler.

140
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 And and I just said, you've got the worst taste in music of anyone I've ever met.

141
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Tell us about it. And he did.

142
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 You know, it was great. But Scott is his worst singadoes.

143
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's impossible.

144
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 That can't be true. No, it's true.

145
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 I mean, the only difference between Scotty and Godot is and I will give Scotty the edge on this.

146
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 I believe Scotty can also appreciate good music better than Godot.

147
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 You know what I mean? I I think I think Godot has just got, you know, really pedestrian music and and, you know.

148
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 And you're right. He just doesn't care. Yeah.

149
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 But Scotty, he actively seeks out every horrific show tune you've ever heard.

150
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 And and, you know, he was he was in he was like a musical kid.

151
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 He was in like, you know, musicals as a child and stuff.

152
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 And it's just so deeply disturbing.

153
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 And I was in a lot of musicals as a child. I don't listen only to show tunes, though.

154
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 I was in other music. He can appreciate Miles Davis, too.

155
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 But I don't think Godot cares whether it's Miles Davis or Bette Midler.

156
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 You know what I mean? But so I give Scotty the advantage there.

157
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 But but but my point is that everybody's got really not everybody.

158
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 But most people have the people I want to talk to have really interesting stories about growing up with it

159
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 and what they listen to as kids and how they got into music and sort of when they realized that music

160
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 they were listening to music different than all their classmates.

161
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 You know what I mean? The music became more important to them, usually at an earlier age than than every than most people.

162
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Because I as I used to have to tell my father, who always promoted me, oh, my son's a great jazz piano player.

163
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 I say nobody cares about jazz, dad, and even less people care about solo piano in jazz.

164
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 So, you know, I'm looking for the people that care about that stuff that are also creative in other ways.

165
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Writers, you know, and everybody. I mean, just, you know, if you've got interesting stories to talk about kiss, I want to hear them.

166
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 You know, I mean, you know, Matt and I talked about some guy from Jersey, some singer, singer, songwriter.

167
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 That's South Side Johnny of the Asbury Jukes did an hour.

168
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 We did an hour on South Side, Johnny. But but that's been a lot of fun.

169
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 It's really it's the stereo image. It's called the stereo image image.

170
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 And we got a great logo done by Matt Rockman, who's doing all the stuff for Penn and Teller these days.

171
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 And he came up with this really cool like it's like 3D glasses with VU meters on it.

172
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 And it's really because it's sort of retro and it's sort of, you know, it's got a little bit of everything.

173
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 And the stereo image is on all platforms or the stereo image dot com.

174
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 And I'm going to do I'm doing Oscar Peterson's daughter next week.

175
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 And she's got great stories. Yeah. I mean, we're really getting I've got I if I were smart,

176
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 I would have the list of people we've done in front of me. But I don't.

177
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 But no one's that smart. No one's that smart. Well, I'm you know, it's but it's Piff and Jade on it.

178
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 I had Piff and Jade on and it was hysterical because we did it from the Piff.

179
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 We did our first remote podcast from Piff's Lair. Oh, nice cave. Yeah. And it was it was.

180
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Control freak like Piff making sure you did it in his studio, not yours.

181
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Well, Piff, so unlike him, Piff has horrific taste.

182
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 That's what I was curious about. Yeah, I don't know what music he likes.

183
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Suicidal coffee shop plaintiff, plaintiff, wailing singer, songwriter, 18 year old.

184
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 My boyfriend left me and I kill myself music. He lives the most depressing.

185
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 It's I mean, and he loves it and he just listens to it, I guess, according to Jade all the time.

186
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 But yeah, we we did. Yeah, well, we did.

187
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Dara Godfried, we did, you know, talked about Gilbert some.

188
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 And I mean, we did a lot. We've got about maybe like 30, 30 done so far.

189
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 But but I'm looking at Gilbert's taste in music.

190
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Gilbert, I don't I don't know if we did if we did have her very early on.

191
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 I don't know. We talked about Gilbert's podcast, of course, which was great.

192
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Yes. He didn't really we didn't really talk about his music taste.

193
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 I don't I don't know if Gilbert knew music existed.

194
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Yeah, I'm very curious about that. I'll tell you one thing. I'll tell you a Gilbert story.

195
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 I was so Gilbert was over at my house. This is 20 years ago, 15 years ago.

196
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 And we're just hanging out. And I told our friend Michael Lynn, we had a mutual friend,

197
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 Mickey Lynn, whose whose father had passed away. And he asked me, Mickey, his father loved the Marx brothers.

198
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 And he asked me if I would play a version of Hello, I Must Be Going for him to play at the funeral and recorded for him.

199
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 So I did, you know, and I was telling Gilbert that story who knew who knew Mickey as well.

200
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 And all of a sudden, Gilbert launches into a perfect rendition of of old Groucho singing Hello, I Must Be Going.

201
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 I totally spaced that Gilbert did perfect Groucho is like young Groucho.

202
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 You bet your life Groucho and old Groucho.

203
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 And he's just walking around my kitchen like, hello, I must be going, you know, and I just lost it.

204
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 I was like, oh, fuck, you know, I forgot you're a genius.

205
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 But his my favorite impersonation, one of my favorites was his impersonation of Penn.

206
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Because we're at lunch one day and he's and he's sitting there and all of a sudden Gilbert's just looking at the table.

207
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 We're waiting for the waitress to come over and he's salt shakers, salt and pepper shakers.

208
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 He goes, oh, salt, salt. Oh, let's look at the salt today, this week.

209
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 And then he goes into Penn and he goes this week on bullshit. We've got the National Salt Association.

210
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Because salt is pro salt. And then we've got the Anti-Salt Association. Salt is bullshit.

211
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 He did five minutes of Penn talking about salt and it was just genius.

212
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 But yeah, he I miss him. He was great.

213
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 But anyhow, but we got off on but yeah, the podcast is great.

214
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 And everyone should listen and subscribe and make me famous.

215
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 And then also, because, you know, how long can I play this piano?

216
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 I really belong in podcasting the nonstop world of podcasting.

217
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 That's right.

218
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Do you really see like a world where you're you're you don't play piano?

219
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Yeah, that world is when I'm dead.

220
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Yeah, I often want to be I want to be like the 93 year old guy that they wheel out in the wheelchair chair and say, you know, jazz legend Mike Jones.

221
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 And I and I eat a little pudding and I play a couple of songs.

222
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 Isn't it amazing to still play at this age?

223
00:24:49,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 This is great. OK, get him off the stage. You know, that's that's what I see my I just saw a video, a tick tock with an elderly woman who's suffering from dementia.

224
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 She's I believe 93. And yeah, maybe you saw this, Josie.

225
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 But she's a classically trained pianist, but she doesn't remember that she's a classically trained pianist anymore.

226
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 However, they consider in front of a piano and say, could you play such and such?

227
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 She's like, well, I don't know it. But then she'll do it.

228
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 You know, right. I have seen it. Yeah, it's remarkable.

229
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 And the way it is, the way music acts in the brain is something special.

230
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Oh, it is. Jonesy, would that be better or worse than current life?

231
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Would it be better or worse if you could still play anything, any piece of music that you could play now?

232
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 You can play it, but you don't remember any of the music.

233
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 So you don't ever think about any of the music in your day to day life.

234
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 This is a dream. I just want to.

235
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 I just want to sit somewhere and have them give me pudding.

236
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 That's really all I want. I don't really care about putting.

237
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 But but I'm so we're used to you were saying something, Matt.

238
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 Yeah, well, to two different ways.

239
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 One, I think you're the kind of kid that you didn't have to be like encouraged.

240
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Like your parents enough like overly encouraged you take piano.

241
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 If anything, they took piano away from you as a punishment. Right. Yeah.

242
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 I was when I was like two and a half, my brother, who's five years older, was taking lessons.

243
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 And I guess I would crawl up on the piano bench and play what he had been practicing.

244
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 And so my parents, unfortunately, thought, well, we can make money off this kid.

245
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 We'll send him to less. You know, and no, they just they just they always encouraged me.

246
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 I had two player pianos in my house, so it was always around and it's all I wanted to do.

247
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 And when I was in the third grade, my piano teacher said, you know,

248
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 I don't ever get up before 10 or 11 in the morning.

249
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 And it was a job for me. You're like, yeah, I hate it getting up in the morning.

250
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 Now, wait a minute. You said you had to play your pianos.

251
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Yeah. You know, the you know, the like with the scrolls, like the scroll of paper running through it and everything.

252
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 Now they're now they're all, you know, now they're like Yamaha Disclavier and they know it's all it's all.

253
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 But yes, in the old day, it was a paper roll and it would go over a vacuum system that would cause the keys to go up and down.

254
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 And we had an upright piano in my basement.

255
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 And then in my living room, when I was about probably six or seven, my dad bought what was called a reproducing grand,

256
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 which was 1926 when it was made, was the state of the art for rich people.

257
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 And he made these rolls. They were called expression pianos and they got louder and softer and sustained.

258
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 So it didn't sound mechanical like a player piano.

259
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 All right. Like so I grew up with George Gershwin playing Rhapsody in Blue as if he was sitting at the piano in my house playing it.

260
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 And they made a you know, there was a company called Dewart and Ampico and Welty Mignon.

261
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 And they were all these they made these for the super rich, you know, I mean, when you're watching or when you're seeing that happen on that piano machine,

262
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 are you beyond just hearing the intonations and the ups and downs and the very, you know, the very nuanced playing of these masters?

263
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 Are you also able to pick up on the mechanics of it? Does it does it come through and like the pedal step moves and all that kind of thing?

264
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 The pedal doesn't move, but the keys obviously go up and down.

265
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 But for me, that was was that it was great. Yeah.

266
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Because like if I put a Fats Waller piano roll on and I wanted to see what he was doing with his left hand.

267
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 Although it was many, many years, maybe like till I was 11 or 12 when it dawned on me.

268
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Wait a minute. Sometimes there's 11 keys going down.

269
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Maybe there's one person playing here. Then I found out it was they would double track them a while.

270
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Right. They would, you know, they would wait. And I've made piano rolls.

271
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 I got to go to QRS and make piano wasn't the same piano that Duke Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald and Rachmaninoff and everybody played.

272
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 Is there like a whole bunch connected to the to the piano key as well?

273
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 No, it was more crazy than that. It's ink things.

274
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 So the sheet of paper goes through, you press the keys down, it puts ink on the paper.

275
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 And then somebody stands, somebody sits there and cuts out a master roll by hand.

276
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 Not at all. And then they then they make the master roll and then they produce them from that.

277
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 So it's it's amazing. And I mean, at a time they had like 40 people in a room cutting out master rolls every day because it was so popular in the 20s and 30s.

278
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 You know, and it's incredible. Yeah, it was really, really, really, you know, like old timey technology.

279
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 And but the piano was so cool because it was an old I think it was a Steinway.

280
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 But it had been played so much that the ivory keys were all like scalloped in. Yeah.

281
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 So, you know, it was like soft. You know, there was there was like that much.

282
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 Wow. He can down on the keys just from the millions of people that played it out for a hundred years. Yeah.

283
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 And like the lip on the edge of the key is just completely gone.

284
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Like that little lip is worn away. Yeah, it's worn away from ivory.

285
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 And and I think it's in the Smithsonian now. But but it's it was really cool.

286
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 I in the 80s, the guy actually turns out that because they let black people play the piano, it had to be taken out.

287
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 Well, they took it to display down. Yeah. It happens. It happens. Ouch.

288
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 But anyways, so that's yeah, I've been, you know, so no, I was I I want to play, you know, I mean, as they say, I'll play till I drop dead.

289
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 You know, if I can't like arthritis or I'd rather not have that.

290
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 No, I actually I mean, certainly I have I'm always on the edge.

291
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 I I I have I I can do I have like some tendonitis and some carpal tunnel, but not not to where it's affecting me.

292
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 And I think the reason it doesn't is because I play so much.

293
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 But I relax long enough for it to set in.

294
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 Well, what happens is, yeah, I take tumor, turmeric and glucosamine and can go eat and, you know, to stave off stuff like that.

295
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 But what one of the great things about playing with the show on their 50th about in the last five years, they develop this new technology for I couldn't play a keyboard ever.

296
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 That was why it was always we can't take you on the road because we you can't play a keyboard because when you play a keyboard real quickly, pianists will know this.

297
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 There's a there's a thing I think it's called the escapement at the bottom of when you press a piano down.

298
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 If you press a piano key down very slowly, there'll be this little hitch at the very bottom and then it goes to the bottom.

299
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 And that absorbs all the shock of the piano key hitting the bottom of the keybed.

300
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 And even though they developed weighted keys for keyboards, there was never that kind of cushion.

301
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 So your arm absorbed the entire shock of the of the key hitting and it would set me off in 20 minutes.

302
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 Wow. And I never realized that.

303
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 That's crazy. And just in the last five years, Yamaha and Kawhi developed this new technology in their keyboards that has that feel.

304
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 And I can play them all day and it doesn't bother me at all.

305
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 And and it's actually better for the show because they don't have to mic the piano when I get there or anything like that.

306
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 They just I mean, it's not the same as an acoustic seven foot piano, but it's really close enough for for for them.

307
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 And and I like playing it.

308
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 So so Kawhi is you know, I'm a Kawhi artist and they just have one there for me.

309
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 It's really great. Did you hear how he said it was good enough for them?

310
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 It's good enough. Well, no, I meant it's good enough for a magic show for the people setting up this fucking keyboard that don't want to go to the trouble of setting up a piano.

311
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 That's right. That's right. It's good enough for them.

312
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 Also, it also means that the floating piano illusions back on the table.

313
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Have you got a piano?

314
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 We don't knock it out of tune. You don't want to you don't want to make that piano around.

315
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 I'm happy to be in the floating piano illusion.

316
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 I'm very happy to be in it. I just don't want to be responsible for it.

317
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 I don't want to have to tune the piano after it's done.

318
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 Yeah. Yeah. It's like I had this stupid idea for Andy cheek in the chat kiss fans won't hear the difference.

319
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 Fuck you, Andy.

320
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 Tough talk. Wow.

321
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 You know, some of the some of the 100 members of Kiss of the past two centuries actually no more than two chords.

322
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 That's true. Well, no, Ace Fraley died. Not anymore.

323
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 Yeah. Yeah. But it's anyhow. Yeah.

324
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 The piano with the piano situation has gotten really good finally.

325
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 But so my hands don't hurt. You know, I'm really lucky.

326
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 I mean, I I've been playing for I've been playing the piano for almost 60 years.

327
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 But you know, and and a lot of old piano players that I've known over the years, you know, have not had problems with arthritis.

328
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 But then again, like Oscar had it really bad Oscar Peterson and and they just play through it, you know.

329
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 But I've been lucky. I mean, I still have most of my faculties, not mental at all.

330
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 I'm but I overrated. But anyways, and so if this is going out, but I will in self promotion to jump off.

331
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 If this is if anyone's hearing this on Monday in Vegas and have nothing to do tonight,

332
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 meaning Monday, go down to Vicks at 7 p.m. because I'm recording two different live albums in one night.

333
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 Oh, nice. Or so at 9 p.m. to for the second set. Vicks downtown by the Smith Center.

334
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 Yes. Oh, I would have put this through. I thought I thought this episode was coming out too late.

335
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 It's coming out. Oh, no, it's no it's it's Monday night.

336
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 OK, tonight, tonight, ladies and gentlemen. And it's it's the first set is going to be me and Graham.

337
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 Yes. Yeah. Every time I say Graham's name, Matt coughs.

338
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 You can't help it. He's allergic to Graham Decker.

339
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 I'm doing it with Graham Decker, who's an amazing guitar player and Alex Frank, who's an amazing bass player,

340
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 who found Penn's bass for him, who is a great he runs.

341
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 He plays the bass in Jeff Goldblum's band, which is all hot L.A. studio players and Jeff Goldblum.

342
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 But it's but it's it's really it's we're doing like in the 1940s and 50s right after World War II.

343
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 The most popular jazz combo setup was piano, bass and guitar.

344
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 And so Nat King Cole's trio was piano, bass, guitar. Oscar Peterson had a trio.

345
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 Art Tatum had a trio that was like the thing.

346
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 And then sort of in the 50s, drums work their way in, you know, because they felt sorry for drummers couldn't get a gig.

347
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 So they gave them gigs and that that format sort of went away and nobody does it really anymore.

348
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 And I got together with these guys sort of as a tribute to that kind of music.

349
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 And we did a record in my living room a few years ago and the record label said you guys should do a real live album because it's really good.

350
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 And they're they're so much fun to play with that I'm really looking forward to it.

351
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 And then. Because of a lot of behind the scenes stuff that Graham at the last minute wasn't sure he could do it.

352
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 So I hired a drummer and then when Graham said he could do it, I said to the label, hey, why don't we just do two albums?

353
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 I'll do one with the trio with the drummer and one with the trio with Graham.

354
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 And the label loved the idea because Capri Records is not a mega mega corporation.

355
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 So basically he's getting two records for the price of one. Right. And and it's just twice the work for me.

356
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 So I was going to say you volunteered to do all of the extra work and they didn't have to. I'm an idiot.

357
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 Yeah, that isn't clear to everyone listening now. I am an idiot.

358
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 And so, you know, not only are there going to be killer bands that Jonesy has assembled here, but if you have not gone to Vicks, it is a great Vegas.

359
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 It's a nice room. It's really the sound, too.

360
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 Besides the fact that the staff and the food is great and the staff is amazing and everybody wants to be polite and helpful.

361
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 The room, I believe I may be talking out of my ass, which I have been since I got on the call.

362
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 But I believe that the room was designed by the guy that did the jazz at Lincoln Center Room.

363
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 They brought him in for the acoustics. And I'm telling you, you can play that place with no amplification.

364
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 It's eighty eight seats. And is that a reference to the it is it is one for every key on on the saxophone.

365
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 I would have to be the person at that venue that is in charge of making sure they're always exactly eighty eight seats.

366
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 I'm sorry. We can't let you both in. We can only let one of you in.

367
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 We can let eight more people in and we'll call it a Bozendorfer.

368
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 But no, it's it. But the room is great.

369
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 The sound is great and they record really well.

370
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 And I think it's going to be a really fun time or it's going to be something that people want to witness for other reasons.

371
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 You know, I'll be having a meltdown on stage doing the 14th of a song.

372
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 None of it's right. None of it's right.

373
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 You know, no, no, you know, because I'm going to warn everyone, you know, they know we're putting all the social media is saying live album recording.

374
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 So it is I was I was on Sunday school and I said to Penn, Penn said, oh, so you can tell them if they heckle, it'll come on to the record.

375
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 And I said, oh, that's great. You know, I and the hecklers, what we'll get are like, wait a minute, that's the mixolydian mode.

376
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 Did you just play a flat five on that chord? What's wrong with you?

377
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 Yeah, jazz, jazz, jazz, hecklers are the worst. Yeah, yeah. Wait, did was was that a Bill Evans quote you just played?

378
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 Come on. But but anyhow, it'll be no, it'll be a lot of fun.

379
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 And and I'm really I've been trying to get this done for two years.

380
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 And I think that, you know, I so I in preparation, I had my head cut open.

381
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 So yeah, yeah, because, you know, I said to Jen, I hope your Photoshop skills are good enough.

382
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 Are you not going to wear a fancy hat?

383
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 Well, here's the problem. I probably will wear a fancy hat.

384
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 But I tried to wear a fancy hat in the show last night.

385
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 We were back at the Rio and I wore one of the hat from Blue Kazoo bit, which is a fancy hat.

386
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 I mean, those hats like are expensive and I had a kazoo is outrageous.

387
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 Well, the budget was I threw the roof.

388
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 I mean, but I look horrible in hats.

389
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 I just don't have a head for hats.

390
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 And but I put it on and Penn says to me, it looks like it's going to fall off your head.

391
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 Pull it down. It's supposed to be, you know.

392
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 And so I put it down. Yeah, that's a lot better.

393
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 So I work for the whole pre show. Right. And I come back to my dressing room and from here to here is bright purple.

394
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 All of the front of your head, your whole forehead. Yeah.

395
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 And I'm like, oh, my God, I screwed up everything. It cut off the blood flow.

396
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 What's going to happen? I go to go to the emergency room because I don't worry about anything.

397
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 And it's like there was like a ridge and it had just like cut the I guess because it's just all sensitive from the surgery.

398
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 And they pull all your skin together. So it gets super tight. Oh, yeah.

399
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 So for three nights, I couldn't sleep because if I did this, it hurt up here.

400
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 And touch your chin and the top of your head would start hurting.

401
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 Yeah, really? Seriously, I was trying to shave yesterday and Mike.

402
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 But so anyways, but luckily it's gone away now and I think I'll be OK.

403
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 But that goes that idea for that hat in the chat is suggesting maybe you could use one of our fezzes.

404
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 We do have patented fez. Oh, I thought about that.

405
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 I also thought about, you know, like just like a knit cap, like I'm going on a killing spree.

406
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 I like a dainty bonnet or something like that. Have you thought that would be recommended to do rag a full bottle of water?

407
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 Kind of wild, man. Just look at the chat says a chef's a chef's hat would be great.

408
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 Well, the problem is, and I mean, I know we're all just joking, but the problem is they all have a thing that will cut off the circulation.

409
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 No, no, no, no, no, no. I figured it out. Bucket of chicken, bucket of chicken right over the head.

410
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 Yeah, yeah. Buckethead. Jazz Buckethead. I tribute the Buckethead.

411
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 Oh, you know, that'd be awesome. Won't touch the head at all.

412
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 Lampshade would also work. Yeah, lampshade.

413
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 You could do a popcorn bucket and cut a hole at the top and be like, I'm wearing this completely wrong.

414
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 Right. I am bad at this.

415
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 But I need one of those things that they, you know, they screw on your head for brain surgery.

416
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 Oh, yeah. A halo. Oh, God. A halo. And they just drape something over it.

417
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 Now you're thinking. I know this is the kind of thoughts that get you get you a real, real career.

418
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 But anyhow, no, it'll it'll all be fine. But but it's it's healing up well.

419
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 And hopefully by by the time I play the Green Mill next week, I won't have to have a bandage or hat.

420
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 I'll need a hat for Chicago. But but it's yeah.

421
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 But it's it's it's the the the Monday night thing is going to be something that I've I've been looking forward to for a few years.

422
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 But also, yeah, there's a little bit of pressure on me.

423
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 But it's I think that the jury will outweigh the pressure.

424
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 You want the pressure. You want the pressure. You need the pressure. You need it.

425
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 Yeah. Yeah. Pressure cooker. No pressure. No diamonds. I perform best when under pressure.

426
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 No, I think that the fun will weigh out. Beautiful jazz is best under pressure.

427
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 Damn right. Well, all of the stuff that I'm doing for this, like producing it.

428
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 And Jen, of course, is like making all this shit happen, too.

429
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 This is not the way I make records.

430
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 Usually the company says we got a recording date and who do you want on it?

431
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 And I go into the studio and I make it. But this record and the record before this,

432
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 I'm doing all the work because the labels in in Colorado and he can't leave to come to Vegas.

433
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 And the last record was with Penn and Jeff Hamilton.

434
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 So I have to make sure that Jeff Hamilton is happy and I have to book the studio and I have to do, you know, and all this stuff, I'm incompetent.

435
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 I don't I can barely fucking feed myself. You know, right.

436
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 So I, you know, it's it's all of that on top of trying to play good songs for people and not, you know, make a fool of myself as a musician.

437
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 You know, it's just a lot of different pressure. But but it's it but it's fine.

438
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 I mean, we get we'll get there. It'll be fun.

439
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 And and they wisely give us a meal.

440
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 So I know that I'm really just working for food at the end of the, you know, I when the recordings done, I get fed.

441
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 It doesn't matter what level of fame or fortune the musician is that if you give them food, they're going to be thrilled.

442
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 Right. Absolutely. I mean, you know, and I mean, you know, I say that by you go to you go to craft services after after the after the after the sound check.

443
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 And, you know, my bosses are down there.

444
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 They're eating, you know, because, you know, that's what you do.

445
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,000
 I mean, it's it's it's the risk. It's the reward for, you know, a lifetime spent banging on a piano.

446
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 You get a free meal once in a while. If you ever want to just like please an artist, just feed them.

447
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 If you just feed the artist, they will be they will be so happy.

448
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 I know I am. I forgot, Mike, that your that your camera follows you around with the with the AI thing.

449
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 So when you just leaned over to get a drink out of your cup, I was really wondering why you were moving the camera to follow yourself.

450
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 I see. I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

451
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 Man, he is really into this camera thing. Damn right.

452
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 But no, it's you know, it's it's funny when I was doing gigs in in in in Boston when I got out of college and I did the whole circuit.

453
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 Like there were 40 or 50 places in Boston that had live music every night from like five o'clock at night till nine.

454
00:46:50,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 There was a shift and then nine to one and I played a lot of cocktail shifts and a lot of night shifts and all of these places.

455
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 Their reputation among musicians was who had the best employee cafeteria. Yep.

456
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
 You know, that's all we cared about.

457
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 It's like, oh, man, I got a gig next Friday night at the Ritz, you know, and you would go up to the top floor on the Ritz.

458
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 And the food up there was better than most restaurants for the employees.

459
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:31,000
 You know, and if you didn't like what they were offering, they would make you a burger, which at the time, a Ritz burger was like twenty dollars.

460
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 You know, and they would just make it for you.

461
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 And you go up there and they would have like a prime rib hash that was out for the for the for the in the street bar.

462
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 That, you know, I mean, this stuff was I still think about that. You know, it's like we're talking about it.

463
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 Well, it's so funny. And I'm going off. I'm taking up your whole show.

464
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 Well, why not? You were stupid enough to have me.

465
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 I would I would see these old musicians like guys that I worshiped when I was in Boston and I got lucky enough to be friends with and play with.

466
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 And I'd be on this gig after seeing Dave McKenna, who was a great jazz pianist.

467
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:15,000
 And I would be in a room with Dave McKenna and Dick Johnson, who was a great clarinetist, who led the Artie Shaw band.

468
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:24,000
 And he's these guys are legendary musicians and Herb Palmer and Dick Johnson and Gray Sargent and all the guys from from Boston.

469
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 And they all played. I mean, Herb Palmer played with Charlie Parker.

470
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 You know, that's the level of these musicians.

471
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 And I'm sitting there as a twenty two year old guy wanting to suck up all the all the stories and all the energy.

472
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 And you know what they talked about? Oh, remember that diner on Route nine?

473
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
 The fucking mashed potatoes there were unbelievable.

474
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 You know, and Dave McKenna is like, oh, this white pizza at this place in Hartford.

475
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
 I do the gig just for that. That's what they're talking about.

476
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 You know, I played with Ella Fitzgerald for six nights and, you know, they don't care.

477
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
 They're like, that's food. Food, food is important.

478
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
 That's what I've learned in life.

479
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
 Anyhow, Jonesy, when do you think the albums are going to come out?

480
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
 What? When do you think the albums are going to drop?

481
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 Oh, the albums? Oh, not until I mean, with Locke, you know, spring or summer of twenty six.

482
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 OK, I mean, I'm going to push him a little bit more, you know, maybe maybe even as soon as March or April for one of them.

483
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
 I don't know if they'll do two of them at the same time.

484
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:39,000
 I don't know, you know, as I said, in dealing with all of the machinations to make these records,

485
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 Johnny Katz asked me what the title was going to be.

486
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
 And I said, we don't have them titled yet, which we don't.

487
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:51,000
 But as I said to Jen, the title of the first one is going to be Never Again.

488
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
 And the title of the second one is Somebody Kill Me.

489
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 This was your chance to see me do this. I'm not doing it again.

490
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
 Yes, exactly. Title. Exactly. No, no.

491
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 I mean, we'll come up with something, you know, a little bit a little bit better than vamping at Vicks.

492
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
 Not much better. Not much better.

493
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
 Go and see Jonesy tonight at Vicks. Subscribe to the stereo image.

494
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 Yeah, thank you. Yes. Thank you, Jonesy, for coming out and jamming with us.

495
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,000
 God bless you, Matt and Jacob and Paul and all of the scoops out there.

496
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
 And yes, do do whatever you want.

497
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:37,000
 Come on out and and subscribe if you want to hear me talk more about music with people that are smarter than me.

498
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
 There you go. All right. Thanks, guys. Really, really appreciate it.

499
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
 Thanks, Jonesy. Bye. Bye.

500
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
 So shy. Yeah, yeah. It's tough to get him out of his shell.

501
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
 One day, one day, though, he's going to really start talking.

502
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
 It's going to be violent that Jonesy. Yeah.

503
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
 He's a he's a fascinating guy. He is absolutely and that podcast is great.

504
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 I've listened to a couple of episodes. Yes.

505
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
 He gets he gets deep with some of his guests.

506
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:13,000
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They're talking about like a personal relationship with music, which is always it's always going to be fascinating.

507
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
 And then you add knowledge into it on top of it.

508
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
 And it's it's exactly it's a really it's a really great thing coming from a very educated place.

509
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
 Yeah. Well, I had a scooper to hear all picked out because Jonesy was with us.

510
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
 He's gone now. We're going to play it anyway.

511
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 Here comes a scooper.

512
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:40,000
 Ladies and gentlemen, it is time.

513
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:59,000
 We got a scooper to come into us today from the OG scoop.

514
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:06,000
 The categories are rock with strings, bond theme artists from Broadway to pop and old ass songs.

515
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
 That's right. It's a music scooper.

516
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
 Oh, I'm first.

517
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
 I'll start the top left corner rock with strings for 200.

518
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:21,000
 Kansas basically says we are all dirt in this 70s classic.

519
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 But it's the shit.

520
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:30,000
 The name of the song, Dust in the Wind, the horse with no name, horse with no name.

521
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:38,000
 Dust in the Wind is it. Matt, you're up. I'll do rock with strings for 400.

522
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 Let's see here.

523
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:51,000
 This moody blues song speaks of written letters that were never meant to be sent.

524
00:52:51,000 --> 00:53:00,000
 Nights and white satin. I think so. All right. Nights and white satin. Nights and white satin.

525
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:07,000
 Letters I've written never meant to be sent.

526
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
 I'll do rock with strings for 800. Let's go. Whoa.

527
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:18,000
 Skip it over. This zeppelin song name drops a region of the Indian subcontinent.

528
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
 Yeah, you're glad you skipped over the $800 question now, aren't you?

529
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
 Cashmere, I think.

530
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
 Let's try it.

531
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
 It's cashmere.

532
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
 Damn it.

533
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:36,000
 See, I always thought it was referring to Ed Wood's sweaters, but I guess I was wrong.

534
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
 You thought Led Zeppelin made it.

535
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,000
 He played all the coffee houses when I was coming up, you know, the 90s. There's a lot of coffee houses.

536
00:53:45,000 --> 00:54:01,000
 Scott Hathaway would mic his guitar all over the place and he would play cashmere by wearing a jangly bracelet, hitting certain guitar strings and playing the drums on the bottom of the guitar. It was insane.

537
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
 I've seen people do that. It's a little one-man bandy.

538
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:25,000
 Yeah. And I, my son, my youngest son brought up a clip of someone doing that who is younger and doing it. And I, this proud dad moment, bit my tongue and didn't say, I know someone who did that when I was young also. I just let him appreciate the new young guy doing it for the first time.

539
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
 And I was like, yep, that's awesome. Way to find that. Way to discover that.

540
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:34,000
 Way to discover this brand new thing. No one has done before.

541
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
 Let's see, it's me. I'll try old ass songs, 200.

542
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
 This Queen song is almost always played with their song "Bicycle Race."

543
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:53,000
 Ooh. Which one did they play with "Bicycle Race?"

544
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
 I'm going to feel really dumb here in a second. I'm going to pass. Matt.

545
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:03,000
 I think it's Fat Bottom Girls. Is it? All right, let's try it. It is Fat Bottom Girls. Look at that.

546
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
 Yes, I always play them together.

547
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
 Smart.

548
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:14,000
 I will do, let's go from Broadway to Pop.

549
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,000
 Daily Double!

550
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:26,000
 Yvonne Elliman had this hit from "Jesus Christ Superstar."

551
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:33,000
 Go get Jesus and hang him on the cross.

552
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
 What's the hit from "Jesus Christ Superstar?"

553
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:45,000
 I need this problem like I need a hole in my hand.

554
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:52,000
 Get the fuck down, someone needs the wood.

555
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:58,000
 I'm going to shroud a turban all over your face.

556
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
 Man, it's a Daily Double, so I have to guess.

557
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
 It is. Let's see, "Jesus Christ Superstar." You got all the Judas songs.

558
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
 Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers?

559
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
 Sure, yeah.

560
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
 Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those eyes?

561
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
 Rub-a-dub-dub. I was washing my feet in the tub.

562
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
 Yep.

563
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
 One, two, three o'clock, four o'clock, it's Jesus.

564
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
 Five, six, seven o'clock, eight o'clock, it's Jesus.

565
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
 I'll just say "Jesus Christ Superstar," the hit.

566
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
 There you go.

567
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:38,000
 Let's try it. I don't know how to love him.

568
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:44,000
 Also, let's play the game. I don't know how to love him. It's also the answer to this.

569
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
 Paul, you're up.

570
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
 I will also try "From Broadway to Pop."

571
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:56,000
 Let's try it. This Wiccan song was inescapable in the early 2000s.

572
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
 I believe it's "Let It Go."

573
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
 No, it's got to be "Defying Gravity."

574
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:08,000
 No, I'm sorry, Paul. It was "Letting Go," from Wiccan.

575
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
 I have green skin, look at me.

576
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
 Please don't eat the green snow.

577
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
 I'll try "Broadway to Pop," 600.

578
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
 Oh shit, I did the wrong thing. I did old-ass songs.

579
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:25,000
 According to Trace Atkins, the subject of this song has got it going on like Donkey Kong.

580
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:32,000
 Oh, for a second, I thought I wasn't going to know the answer to the question that I accidentally clicked on for myself.

581
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
 Now you do.

582
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:39,000
 Fortunately, it's the song that is my wake-up tone. It plays on my alarm every morning.

583
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
 I listen to it before I go to bed at night.

584
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
 And of course, honky-tonk, badonkadonk.

585
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
 Correct.

586
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
 Yes.

587
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
 Matt, you're up.

588
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
 By the way, that was from old-ass songs, not from "Broadway to Pop."

589
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
 Oh, good.

590
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
 I'll do "Rock With Strings," for 600, please.

591
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:09,000
 ELO added strings to this amazing cover of a Chuck Berry tune.

592
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
 I don't know, pass.

593
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,000
 Well, goodness.

594
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
 I think this is also "Let It Go."

595
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
 It could be "My Ding-a-ling."

596
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
 It's the string version of "My Ding-a-ling."

597
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
 The silver bell's hanging on a string.

598
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
 I'll pass.

599
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
 Oh, it passes to me. I don't know. I'll pass.

600
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
 "Roll Over Beethoven."

601
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
 I've never heard the ELO version of that.

602
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
 I don't think I have, either.

603
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
 Paul, you're up.

604
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
 "Broadway to Pop," please.

605
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
 For 600.

606
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:54,000
 Susan Boyle shocked judges on "Britain's Got Talent" with this song from "Les Miserables."

607
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
 Les Miserables.

608
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
 Les Miserables.

609
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:05,000
 It was--I don't know how to love it.

610
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,000
 Yeah, right, that's my favorite, but that ain't doing anything.

611
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
 This is the song that I sang.

612
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
 Oh, is it? No, it's not "Where Is Love."

613
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
 Not "Where Is Love."

614
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,000
 What's love got to do with it?

615
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
 "Where Is Love" is from Oliver.

616
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
 Shit. What is this one?

617
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
 Please, sir, can I have some more?

618
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
 I'll have to pass. I don't know.

619
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
 Pass it to me. What did she sing from--

620
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
 Yeah, I don't remember.

621
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
 That's the whole question, isn't it?

622
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,000
 "Master of the House," this is not the song that she would have sung on the talent show.

623
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
 It's not the "I'm John Valjean" song.

624
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
 It's probably not "I'm John Valjean."

625
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
 It's probably not--yeah, it's probably not--

626
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:57,000
 Who am I? I'm Susan Boyle.

627
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:03,000
 That'd be great. That'd be so great.

628
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
 It fits the meter.

629
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
 Empty chairs and empty tables, that doesn't feel right.

630
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:14,000
 Oh my god, dude, have you heard the empty chairs and empty tables Muppets mash-up?

631
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
 No.

632
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
 Dear Christ.

633
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
 The Muppets did, like, miss.

634
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:25,000
 No, it just fits perfectly with the Muppet Show intro.

635
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
 And it's just as haunting and tragic.

636
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
 That's great.

637
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
 All right, I'll have to look for it, or send it to me.

638
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
 Why am I looking for it? You send it to me.

639
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
 I gotta pass. Matt?

640
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
 It's "Dream to Dream."

641
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
 Oh, it's the only song I couldn't think of from "Les Mis."

642
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
 Yeah, I couldn't remember it myself.

643
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
 Matt just knew it.

644
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,000
 It's me. I'll close out "Pop to Broadway," "Broadway to Pop," you know what I mean.

645
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:00,000
 The other songwriters, Benny Anderson and Bjorn Ilvisis, along with Tim Rice, penned this tune from "Chess."

646
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,000
 I had no idea that anybody from ABBA worked on "Chess," so I'm gonna pass.

647
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:10,000
 Matt?

648
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
 Oh, shoot. My wife loves "Chess."

649
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
 Everyone loves the soundtrack to "Chess," and no one loves the show.

650
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
 That's exactly right.

651
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
 I mean, this is the one hit. I got it.

652
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
 Paul, go.

653
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,000
 It's "One Night in Bangkok."

654
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
 That's what you're going with?

655
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
 Yeah.

656
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
 It's "One Night in Bangkok."

657
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
 Yeah.

658
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
 That's just right.

659
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
 It's the only song there is in "Chess" that made a hit.

660
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
 I don't know. Are we supposed to "Chess?"

661
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
 I don't know. Are we supposed to "Chess?"

662
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
 Do you need us to shout you're right?

663
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
 What do you need us to credit? You got it right. I don't know why.

664
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
 I need more credit. More credit.

665
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
 Paul's right. Paul's right, everyone.

666
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,000
 One night in Bangkok and your cock gets banged on.

667
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:01,000
 Matt, you got Bond-themed artists or old-ass songs. What you want?

668
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:08,000
 Hand me that hammer, gonna bang some cock.

669
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
 But for one night--

670
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
 I'll do--

671
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:15,000
 Bangkok, Oriental City, where you have to bring your hammer 'cause hammers ain't cheap.

672
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
 Hammer's got a lot of--

673
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
 I'm gonna do old-ass songs for 800.

674
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,000
 Bring your hammer and disinfect it 'cause you're gonna be banging on your cock all night.

675
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:30,000
 Casey and the Sunshine Band got scores of us to do this in the '70s.

676
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,000
 Have unprotected sex.

677
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
 Oh, Casey and the Sunshine Band, you rascals.

678
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
 There's several possible answers here.

679
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:45,000
 I think it's get two little dance and make a little love, get down tonight.

680
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
 Or--

681
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
 Let's try it.

682
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
 Shake, shake, shake. Shake, shake, shake.

683
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:54,000
 Oh, shoot, it's gonna be that. It's gonna be that.

684
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
 What do you think, Matt?

685
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,000
 What's your final answer? You gotta pick one.

686
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
 Your answer fits better to a question than mine does.

687
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
 I think that's why I went there, is shake your booty.

688
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
 You say you're gonna shake your booty?

689
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
 Yeah, shake your booty.

690
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
 Let's try it. It is shake, shake, shake, shake your booty.

691
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
 There we go.

692
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
 Way to go, Matt. You and your booty got that right.

693
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
 Paul.

694
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
 Phew.

695
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
 Bond theme artist, what the hell?

696
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
 Let's see.

697
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:28,000
 Singer of "Nobody Does It Better" from "The Spy Who Loved Me."

698
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
 I think that's Eartha Kitt.

699
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
 Let's try it, Eartha Kitt. Carly Simon.

700
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
 Shit on me.

701
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
 The Eartha Kitt of James Bond music.

702
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,000
 Carly Simon of Eartha Kitts.

703
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
 It's me. I'll close out old ass songs for $400.

704
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:53,000
 Sir Mix-A-Lot's favorite body part of the opposite sex is obvious from this song.

705
01:03:53,000 --> 01:04:01,000
 I believe it's "My Humps, My Helumps, My Lovely Lady Lumps" by Sir Mix-A-Lot.

706
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:07,000
 That would be the butt song. Baby Got Back.

707
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
 Yeah, there it is.

708
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:16,000
 Matt, you got Bond theme artist for $400, $600, or $800.

709
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:23,000
 I had to really shuffle through all of the Sir Mix-A-Lot hits in my brain to get to that one.

710
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
 Did Mix-A-Lot do one of the Bond themes?

711
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
 He did. Under a pseudonym, though.

712
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:34,000
 Oh yeah, score check. Paul has $1,800. Matt has $1,400. I have $1,200.

713
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,000
 I think there's a daily double left as well in one of these three questions.

714
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:46,000
 I like James Bond in "I Cannot Lie." You other spies can't deny.

715
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
 When he rolls in with a car with tricks, it shoots somebody from the roof.

716
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:56,000
 It's James Bond's car.

717
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
 All right, let's do Bond theme artist for $400.

718
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
 Let's see it.

719
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:07,000
 Not Guns N' Roses, but this group recorded the soundtrack theme from "Live and Let Die" first.

720
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
 That'd be Big Buckethead.

721
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
 Big Buckethead, of course.

722
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
 What was the name of that group?

723
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
 Paul McCartney.

724
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
 But it was a group.

725
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
 Is it a group?

726
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
 Yeah, it's a band.

727
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
 Oh, Wings.

728
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,000
 Wings, there you go. Paul McCartney and Wings.

729
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,000
 Paul, you got theme artists for $600 or $800.

730
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,000
 You're currently tied with Matt at $1,800.

731
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,000
 Yeah, I'll go $800. Let's go.

732
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
 $800?

733
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
 Yeah.

734
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
 It's the daily double.

735
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
 I knew it. I knew it.

736
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
 Now it's for $1,800.

737
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
 But I had to do this.

738
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
 You had to.

739
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
 I did.

740
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:55,000
 In my opinion, this Goldfinger theme singer started the tradition of epic Bond songs.

741
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,000
 If that's your opinion, OG Scoop, you're correct.

742
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
 I think this is Earthy Kit.

743
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
 Oh, it is not.

744
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
 Oh, fuck me.

745
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
 It is Shirley Bassey.

746
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
 My ass.

747
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:12,000
 Shirley Bassey, my ass.

748
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
 Oh, I clicked the wrong thing.

749
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
 I clicked it.

750
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
 Paul got it right, which he definitely did not.

751
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
 Bond theme artists for $600.

752
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
 That's what I'm closing it out with.

753
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,000
 This R&B diva legend graced us all with the theme from License to Kill.

754
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
 This was, of course, Earthy Kit.

755
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
 It's not.

756
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
 It's Lattice Night.

757
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
 That's the game.

758
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
 Did Earthy Kit do a Bond song?

759
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
 I don't think so, no.

760
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
 That's the game.

761
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
 Matt wins with $1,800 points.

762
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
 I'm in second with $600 points.

763
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
 Paul is in third with zero points.

764
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
 Not according to the scoreboard, though.

765
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
 According to the scoreboard, Paul crushed us with $3,600 points.

766
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
 And that's from OG Scoop.

767
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
 Thank you, OG Scoop.

768
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
 Everyone knows Shirley Bassey was secretly just Earthy Kit.

769
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
 So there you go.

770
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,000
 It was three Shirley Basseys in a trench coat dressed up as Earthy Kit.

771
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:09,000
 So do we have time for me to share my winter stories for you?

772
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
 Well, tell us, Paul.

773
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
 Or let me tell people this.

774
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
 If you want to send us a Scooperty, Price is Right, Jock vs. Nerd,

775
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
 any kind of Jock vs. Nerd, or an email, heyscoops.com.

776
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
 That's where you can go.

777
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
 Send us all those things right over there at heyscoops.com.

778
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
 Paul, do you have a tale of winter?

779
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
 I have a couple.

780
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
 So it's colder in Wichita and Nebraska out here.

781
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
 It's freezing.

782
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
 And we got our first significant snow the other day.

783
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
 And it happened between my improv classes.

784
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,000
 So one improv class I went to on Monday, no problem.

785
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
 Tuesday, a little more treacherous.

786
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:47,000
 The roads are pretty fine because out here they know how to deal with snow.

787
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
 They plow and they salt and it's all good.

788
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
 So the roads are not a problem.

789
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
 They plow, they salt, they plow, they plow, they plow, they plow.

790
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
 Plow and salt, salt and plow.

791
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
 You may remember--

792
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
 It's just fine, it's fine, it's fine.

793
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
 You may remember outside of the Skit Theater area,

794
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
 there is a large section of stairs.

795
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
 Do you recall these stairs?

796
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
 Oh, yes.

797
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
 Right.

798
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
 I do.

799
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
 Well, I came upon those stairs on my second night,

800
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
 not thinking anything of it really.

801
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
 They looked trod upon,

802
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
 but they didn't look like they weren't snowy.

803
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
 So I thought, okay, we're fine.

804
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
 Well, it had gotten to about 35 degrees that day.

805
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
 Okay.

806
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
 And then by the time I got to the stairs,

807
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
 it was back down to about 30.

808
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,000
 And so the stairs were basically covered in black ice.

809
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
 I took my first step onto that stairs.

810
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
 My feet went out from under me.

811
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
 I was lucky to have hold of the handrail.

812
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,000
 I swumbled-- I didn't fall.

813
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:53,000
 I swumbled down to my ass onto these frozen stairs,

814
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
 and I could not get my feet under me for the life of me.

815
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
 Oh, no.

816
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:02,000
 So I scooted on my ass down 15 stairs

817
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
 all the way down on ice,

818
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
 and my butt was just soaking wet for the rest of class.

819
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
 It was disgusting.

820
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,000
 And in my terror of my near-death experience,

821
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
 I quickly texted Justin.

822
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
 I'm like, oh, my God, I almost died on the stairs.

823
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
 You have to tell everybody.

824
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
 Send emails out.

825
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
 Someone could really get hurt.

826
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
 I must have freaked him out.

827
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
 I was in such a tizzy.

828
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
 I was in such a tizzy.

829
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
 You do get in tizzies.

830
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
 It's bad.

831
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:39,000
 Then last night, it's getting down to 11.

832
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
 And Anne suddenly remembers, oh, shit.

833
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:47,000
 We don't have the external hose hookup covered for the winter,

834
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
 and we didn't turn the water off.

835
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
 That could lead to frozen pipes.

836
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
 That's not a good thing.

837
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:58,000
 So she remembers this last night at 9 o'clock PM

838
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
 when I've been asleep for almost an hour and a half.

839
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,000
 And so she wakes me up from a dead sleep

840
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,000
 to tell me, oh, God, we've got to get this thing fixed.

841
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
 Where is this?

842
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
 She's got like a glove for the pipes.

843
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
 Where's the glove?

844
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
 I don't know.

845
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
 I have no idea where the glove is.

846
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
 It got removed in the spring when she started doing watering stuff,

847
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
 and it hasn't been replaced.

848
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
 And I don't know where the fuck it is.

849
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:31,000
 But I managed to go get some pool noodle, because I have spare pool

850
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
 noodle around for such an emergency.

851
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,000
 Cut up some pool noodle, fashioned a crude glove,

852
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
 if you will, for the external piece.

853
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
 And we duct taped it up, and there you go.

854
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
 All fixed.

855
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
 Then I turn around, and she is back in bed.

856
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
 Meanwhile, I'm up.

857
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:55,000
 And I was beside myself that she had been able to go right back to bed

858
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,000
 after that so quickly and left me to fiddle with the dogs.

859
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
 It was really funny to me.

860
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:07,000
 But then this morning, I get the call that she got her karmic comeuppance

861
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
 for waking me in the night.

862
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
 Oh, good.

863
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
 It's about time she learns a lesson.

864
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
 No, this is tragedy.

865
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:21,000
 She's drinking her coffee this morning that she's made out of her little

866
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
 machine.

867
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
 And the coffee is off, right?

868
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
 It's off.

869
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
 Something's really off about the coffee.

870
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
 And she doesn't know what.

871
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
 But she knows it's off.

872
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
 And she goes to open up the coffee machine.

873
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,000
 And there is a stink bug in the coffee machine.

874
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,000
 And she is beside herself.

875
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
 She cannot handle this revelation.

876
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:53,000
 This is like -- this is the thing that puts her over the edge.

877
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,000
 She gets violently ill from the stink bug in the coffee machine.

878
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
 She's throwing up everywhere.

879
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
 She's -- because she's drank stink bug juice.

880
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
 So she's just like, dear God.

881
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
 So she's done.

882
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:11,000
 Not only that, not only that, she is so upset that I had to buy her a new

883
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,000
 coffee maker today.

884
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
 She will not use the stink bug.

885
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
 What?

886
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
 I said there's nothing wrong with this coffee maker.

887
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
 She's like, I can't even look at it.

888
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
 I couldn't even be in the kitchen without getting violently ill.

889
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
 Okay.

890
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:31,000
 So if there's one Achilles heel on old McFeeters, it's stink bugs and

891
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
 liquids.

892
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
 It's stink bugs.

893
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
 There you go.

894
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
 You got to get a new coffee maker and put a fake stink bug in there just to

895
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
 start it off right.

896
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,000
 Lauren Shreve says if you've smelled stink bug, you'll understand.

897
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
 And it's true.

898
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
 They are foul, foul things.

899
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
 We didn't have any.

900
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
 We don't have any in Vegas, thank God.

901
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
 They are nasty, nasty critters.

902
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
 They're really, really gross.

903
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
 So anyway, she's got a nice new coffee machine now.

904
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:01,000
 And hopefully that will be all good.

905
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
 There they are.

906
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
 We got the small brown ones.

907
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
 Oh, my God.

908
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
 No.

909
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
 Just get all these, just a bunch of plastic bugs to just fill the coffee

910
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
 maker with it.

911
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
 No, no, no.

912
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
 Oh, she'll be so sad.

913
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
 Don't send fake plastic bugs.

914
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
 Honestly, she wouldn't care.

915
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
 A fake plastic bug wouldn't affect the taste of her coffee.

916
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:24,000
 It's the fact that this bug actually put all kind of goo in her coffee and she

917
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
 drank it.

918
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
 It was nasty.

919
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,000
 Oh, that pervy bug.

920
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
 What would disinfect it is if you peed all over the old coffee maker and that

921
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
 would be, that would help.

922
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
 I told her we could do that.

923
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
 That's if a jellyfish gets into your coffee maker.

924
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
 It's just as well.

925
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
 It's an older model.

926
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
 It still works great.

927
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
 I'm going to give it to the goodwill.

928
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
 Her name is Anne.

929
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
 Don't call her an older model.

930
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:52,000
 But the other day when she was really, really sick, I guess it was Thanksgiving

931
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
 Day when she was really, really sick.

932
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:59,000
 She was making coffee for herself and she forgot to put a cup in the machine.

933
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
 And I came in.

934
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
 I'm like, Anne, what the fuck?

935
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
 She was just spilling coffee all over the machine.

936
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:09,000
 If your coffee maker does that, then you do need to get a new coffee maker.

937
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
 Your coffee maker is out of date.

938
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
 Yeah.

939
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
 So she was like, I don't even know what I'm doing.

940
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,000
 But it got coffee all in the base of the machine.

941
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
 So it can go now.

942
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
 Oh, that's really funny.

943
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
 It served its time.

944
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
 It's time.

945
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
 Poor thing was just out of it.

946
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,000
 Well, I for one, I'm certainly glad that Anne finally got her comeuppance for

947
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
 waking you up earlier than you wanted to wake up.

948
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
 Yeah, she got her comeuppance.

949
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
 Serves her right in the form of a brand new coffee maker.

950
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
 No, it's all good.

951
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
 She's dead right.

952
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:44,000
 And I would be the most upset if we had any kind of water damage happen because

953
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
 that's coming right down here to the old Batcave.

954
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
 You know, it's not going anywhere but down.

955
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:55,000
 And I've got plenty of stuff that won't be too terribly affected because most of

956
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
 it's all plastic.

957
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
 But there's plenty of paper down here to get fucked.

958
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,000
 I've got to believe, Paul, even if you weren't there, I think if the basement

959
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
 started flooding, I think the squirrel would get most of the stuff out of the

960
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
 basement.

961
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
 I think the squirrel would save most of the possessions down there.

962
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
 Do you think they're that sensible to get everything out?

963
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
 I do.

964
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,000
 I think the squirrels have taken full ownership of the basement and everything

965
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
 in it.

966
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
 They want to take care of it.

967
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
 All right.

968
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
 They don't have an insurance policy.

969
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,000
 One night at Paul's house and the world's my oyster.

970
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
 I creep and crawl in whenever I want to.

971
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
 Sarah Boyle?

972
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
 No, that's the scoop.

973
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
 Susan Boyle.

974
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
 That's the name.

975
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
 Shit.

976
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
 Susan Boyle.

977
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
 One night in Susan Boyle.

978
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
 I want to thank Mike Jones for coming on the program.

979
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
 Absolutely.

980
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
 Go to his podcast.

981
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
 Yeah.

982
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
 Go get his live album.

983
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
 Go to VEX if you're around Vegas Monday night.

984
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,000
 I also want to thank all the scoops who joined us here on Twitch.

985
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
 Yes.

986
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
 I want to thank all the scoops who joined us here on Zoom.

987
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
 That's right.

988
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
 And there's no way we thank people in the show.

989
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
 It's a new month.

990
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
 We haven't got our thank you lists coordinated yet.

991
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,000
 But I want to thank, of course, everyone who supports us over on our Patreon.

992
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:07,000
 All the people who find it in their hearts and in their wallets to go over to preachingfun.com.

993
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:29,000
 I'm really looking forward to the day that I don't have to play that whole theme manually.

994
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
 I've gotten it all inked out on a piece of paper.

995
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,000
 And I'm going to have somebody cut out all the little holes in it for a player piano.

996
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
 But in the meantime, check out fartsinabag.biz.

997
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:50,000
 That's fartsinabag.biz that along with preachingfun.com.

998
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:55,000
 It takes you over to our Patreon page where for as little as $3 a month, you can upkeep this show on the air.

999
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
 We are dependent on our Patreon subscribers.

1000
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:04,000
 So if you are not a Patreon subscriber, preachingfun.com, fartsinabag.biz, head over there.

1001
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,000
 If you think this show is worth more than $0, you can upkeep this show on the air.

1002
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
 And we sure do thank you for it.

1003
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,000
 If you can't do it, if you can't go over and do the monetary value thing, that is okay.

1004
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
 Not everybody is able to do that these days.

1005
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
 Tell somebody about us.

1006
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
 Tell one person, one person only.

1007
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,000
 Don't do the two friends and then they tell two friends things.

1008
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
 That is a pyramid scheme.

1009
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
 It is unethical.

1010
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
 We don't get into that.

1011
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
 We do an obelisk scheme.

1012
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
 You tell one person, one person only.

1013
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
 It's vertical growth.

1014
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:37,000
 But you're going to find that one person that really kind of digs this weird thing that we're doing over here.

1015
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
 So go let them know about us.

1016
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
 Let them know about the obelisk scheme.

1017
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
 One person and one person only.

1018
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
 But that person has to dig this thing.

1019
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:52,000
 And probably, preferably get on there and support the Patreon within the first, I don't know, 10 minutes or so of you telling them about us.

1020
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
 That'd be really convenient for us.

1021
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,000
 Also, don't forget about our billionaire experiment.

1022
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:06,000
 Don't forget, get each of us a billion dollars and we will see if we can be better billionaires than the current ones.

1023
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
 Oh, shout out to Radioactive Scoop for doubling their Patreon.

1024
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
 Thank you.

1025
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
 Thank you, Radioactive Scoop.

1026
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
 Yeah, we had a little a little bump in our Patreon this month.

1027
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
 Thank you guys so much.

1028
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
 Love it.

1029
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
 Line go up.

1030
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
 That's what we want.

1031
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
 That's right.

1032
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
 Thanks for listening, everybody.

1033
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
 Stay safe out there.

1034
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
 We love you and we'll see you soon.

1035
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
 We'll see you soon.

1036
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:50,000
 JonesJazz.com is by Jones website.

1037
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
 Go check that out.

01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
 Follow him on social media.

01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
 You'll get all the hints and tips.

1040
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
 We're French and punny.

1041
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
 See ya.
