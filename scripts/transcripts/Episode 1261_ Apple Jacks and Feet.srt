00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Oh hello there, I am so happy you're here because this is the part of the show where we thank you, the ice cream truck drivers.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Thank you so much ice cream truck drivers. We are actually having trouble with Patreon right now to get all of the lists out.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 But we will thank all of you Patreons out there, each and every one of you before this month is over.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 In the meantime, I want to thank each and every ice cream truck driver out there for delivering that fucking ice cream straight to your fucking ear holes.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 If you want to be an ice cream truck driver, help support this show.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Head over to PreachingFun.com. PreachingFun.com is where you can go to sign up to be an ice cream truck driver.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 And who knows, the life you save may be your own.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 It may be.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Or someone might call you on a phone.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social?

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Yeah, I'd love to.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Great, let's go.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 I feel like we've brought this up before, but what are you guys' current stance on Cologne?

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 I actually have something that happened yesterday.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Okay.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 What did you mean the city in Germany?

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 No.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 It's time for Matt Mattingly's ice cream social.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Sitting over there, it's Matt Mattingly.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Sitting over there, it's Paul Mattingly.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Sitting over here, it's Jacob the audio guy.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 We're PreachingFun.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 I had a friend's mom buy my kid Cologne for his birthday.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Oh, and your kid is 11?

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 12.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 I mean that's the age.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Cologne age.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 That is Draconwar age.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 I went through a brute phrase, not Draconwar.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Jacquard Noir was definitely the Cologne of choice when I was in high school.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 I grew up thinking that Cologne was an old fashioned notion.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 When I hear the word Cologne, I picture--

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 You don't use Cologne?

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 I've never used Cologne.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 You don't use Ascent?

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 No.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Neither of you?

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 No.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 I went to Walmart yesterday with my lovely wife.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Your anniversary trip.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Our anniversary trip.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 No, we're going and getting our stuff.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Every time I'm in Walmart, I make a point to go over to the perfume aisle and there is generic CK1.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 It's called You.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 And I always grab a bottle of You because that is the scent I've been using for damn near 30 years.

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And I use it every day.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 And it's just been my scent of choice.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 And it's cheap-ish.

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 I always like CK1 because I started with CK1 and it's just what I chose and it's been my thing.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 But I don't go without-- as soon as I step out the shower, I hit a little something,

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 spritz a little on the clothes, rub the old hands together, boom, boom, boom, freshen up.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 You said hands and you showed wrists.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 What is it?

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Wrists, wrists, wrists, wrists.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Yeah.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Yeah.

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Because putting colognes in your hands is really weird.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 That's gross.

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Yeah.

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 No.

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Right on my hand.

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 I like for everything I touch to smell like CK1.

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Put it all on my face.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Everything out of the fridge.

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Everything just like everything you grab.

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 What I like is that--

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Paul's coffee cup just reeks of Calvin Klein.

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 No, no, no.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Here's the thing.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 You two have spent an inordinate amount of time with me.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 And you've never noticed some overpowering odor coming from me.

72
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 That's correct.

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Don't you tell me what I've noticed.

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 I don't have the greatest sense of smell.

75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 But that's not to disqualify you not being a stinkeroo.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 But on the other-- I mean, not me being a stinkeroo, but not even me-- I'm not sent forward.

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Like, you don't go, oh, because there's people that wear cologne.

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And you're like, they were here five minutes ago.

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Or maybe they're on their fucking way.

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Like, you can--

81
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 Famously, we called-- you know, Wayne Newton had a crazy--

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Oh, lord.

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Had a crazy, billowing--

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Yes.

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 A pigpen-style cloud around him.

86
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 A pigpen cloud of scent.

87
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Absolutely.

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 It was like, choo-choo.

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 The Wayne train came through.

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 And that's it.

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 When I hear cologne, I think of old-fashioned parties I was dragged to in Monmouth County,

92
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 New Jersey, where all the men put on dinner jackets and had their own stinks on them while

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 they drank a lot of alcohol.

94
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 And I got bored.

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Well, that's it.

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 It's a disguise for stinks.

97
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 And I don't have to use much because I don't stink.

98
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 And I don't drink.

99
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And I don't smoke.

100
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 That's the other thing, too.

101
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 If I drank and smoked, I'd need something more powerful than CK-1 because that does not hide

102
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 shit.

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Right.

104
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 But I am curious, I just personally never thought to ever wear it.

105
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 My wife never mentioned it.

106
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 She doesn't do a lot of perfumes either.

107
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 She might do a little bit of something.

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 She does nice lotions and things like that.

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Sure.

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 And then I use--

111
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Well, your wife has a pleasing natural musk, too.

112
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 That's what you always say about your wife.

113
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 That's what she says.

114
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 That's all people talk about to her.

115
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 It's just her musk.

116
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Yeah.

117
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Her pleasing natural musk.

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Yeah.

119
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 And when I try to talk about her musk, she's like, get in line.

120
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 So many people just talking about my musk all day.

121
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 It's easier if you send me an email.

122
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Is she selling her urine for Hunter's boots?

123
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Is that what's going on now?

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 Yes.

125
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Attracting dancers in the wild that they can shoot with a bow and arrow?

126
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 No, it's Hunter Biden.

127
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 She's putting her piss on Hunter Biden's boots.

128
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Go to huntingbootspiss.vegas, and you'll see my wife's website right there.

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 [LAUGHTER]

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 .org.

131
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 No, but I'm curious.

132
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 What I'm curious about is if--

133
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 I'm in my late 40s, right?

134
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 So we do late 40s, early 40s, late 30s.

135
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Are more people wearing cologne in general?

136
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Or am I wrong in thinking that it was an old-fashioned notion?

137
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Because to see it come back with younger kids is interesting to me.

138
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 But maybe I'm just wrong.

139
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 And a lot of people wear cologne.

140
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 So I want to know in the chat.

141
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 We have enough people here.

142
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 I wear cologne.

143
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Paul's a cologne guy.

144
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Jacob, you get spritzed up when you go out, too.

145
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 You never think to go cologne.

146
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 No, I never do cologne.

147
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 I'll do maybe a little aftershave or something.

148
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 But even that, I don't want an aftershave that smells.

149
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 I don't like having a scent.

150
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 In high school, there were times that I had cologne.

151
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 I definitely put cologne on in high school and stuff.

152
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 I think by the time I was in college, though, I was done with cologne.

153
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 So it sounds like there are some-- three guys have chimed in.

154
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 They all wear a little cologne.

155
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 They're talking about Paul style, a very little amount of cologne.

156
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 All right.

157
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 A little dab will do you.

158
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Do you do the cloud?

159
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Do you walk through the cloud?

160
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 No.

161
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 I use it-- honestly, it's kind of like aftershave.

162
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Because I dry shave.

163
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 I'm not dry, but I use a little bit of water.

164
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 I use a little bit of water.

165
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 And all razors now have a little lube strip on them.

166
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 So it's not really dry shaving.

167
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Nobody likes a lube strip more than me.

168
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 So a little bit of that.

169
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 And basically, after the shower, it's almost like aftershave.

170
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Just a little something.

171
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Keeps the bumps chill and whatnot.

172
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 And I spray it right on.

173
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 I don't do the cloudy walk-through thing, really.

174
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 OK.

175
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 According to this, Gen Z is big into cologne.

176
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Yeah.

177
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Well, that's what I'm saying.

178
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 It's definitely the young people-- it's back in, for sure.

179
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 So it skips a generation, perhaps.

180
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 That's a wondering.

181
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Or it skips a generation.

182
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Or it skips Gen X.

183
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 And also, this is talking about having a fragrance wardrobe,

184
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 which is apparently a popular thing,

185
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 which is multiple fragrances in your collection.

186
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 And you select the fragrance that you feel is most appropriate

187
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 for that day.

188
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Well, that feels like something that happened to me.

189
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 I never get one of anything.

190
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Oh, you would be a collector.

191
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 I definitely feel like it.

192
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 My wife was like, maybe you could do a little laughter.

193
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 I was like, I have eight beard oils

194
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 I don't use in my house at different places.

195
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Go get the purple bottle off of daddy's smell shelf.

196
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 You haven't gotten into the beard oil habit yet, Matt?

197
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 My wife didn't like it.

198
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 I kissed her once with beard oil on, and she was pissed off.

199
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 And I was like, all right, well--

200
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Oh, is it too much?

201
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Yeah, it's easier to have beard dandruff

202
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 than it is to put accidental beard stink on my wife.

203
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 I like doing the beard oil when my beard is a little longer.

204
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 I've got my beard trimmed very short right now.

205
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 I like it when I've got it a little fluffy.

206
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 Then I like the beard oil.

207
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 That's part of my daily regimen, too.

208
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Sebastian Menescalco-- am I saying the name right?

209
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Sebastian Menescalco, I think, is a stand-up comedian.

210
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 He did a live episode on Amy Poehler's podcast.

211
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 It's really great.

212
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 I highly recommend.

213
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 And he wears two colognes, one on the front

214
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 and one on the back.

215
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Sebastian, come on.

216
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 He has a different--

217
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Oh, so this is what I want to talk about.

218
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 This is coming and going.

219
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 I can't imagine-- I mean, that's a lot of work,

220
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 to build up a cologne wardrobe.

221
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 A fragrance wardrobe.

222
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Because everybody's body chemistry

223
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 reacts differently to scents.

224
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 So you've got to find the one that hits home.

225
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 And for me, one just doesn't rock the boat.

226
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 CK1.

227
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Whatever I got going on jibes with CK1.

228
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 But there have been times when I've tried a little Burberry

229
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 and whatnot, and it's like, the vibe is off, kid.

230
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 I think I'm going to start just taking Tiger Snake whiskey

231
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 and using it as aftershave and just letting that be my musk.

232
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 All you have to do is take one drink of it,

233
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 and then it will just ooze out of your pores for a day.

234
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 I can't tell you how much that fucking Duke Cannon shit

235
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 that I stock on the target shelves every day.

236
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Yeah.

237
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 It's all bourbon barrel infused shit.

238
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 So you might as well--

239
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 It's all bourbon--

240
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 This is another cologne?

241
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 It's soaps.

242
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 It's aftershaves.

243
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 It's shampoos.

244
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 I was going to say, same with beard oil as well.

245
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Yeah, it's beard oil.

246
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 It's all of it.

247
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 All of it is oak wood bourbon barrel infused shit.

248
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Yeah.

249
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Everything smells like a basement in Kentucky.

250
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 It kind of does.

251
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 It kind of does.

252
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Yeah.

253
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Yeah.

254
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Well, that's interesting.

255
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 So are you encouraged by your son getting into scents now,

256
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 or are you worried?

257
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 No, I was way too early.

258
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Fucking 12, fuck off.

259
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 No, I hated that.

260
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 What are you talking about?

261
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 No, that's too much.

262
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 You hated it because it's your kids growing up.

263
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Exactly.

264
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 My son was starting to look so adult.

265
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Yeah.

266
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 And then he had to get braces.

267
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 And I literally picked him up from the orthodontist.

268
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 And I was like, oh, thank God.

269
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Oh, he looks like a kid.

270
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Oh, thank goodness.

271
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Yes.

272
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 He was literally just starting to just look like just a man.

273
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Yeah.

274
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 And it was really, really taking me.

275
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 That'll happen.

276
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 I know.

277
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 He sold me insurance the other day.

278
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Well, he's been doing that since eight.

279
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 [LAUGHTER]

280
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 I guess first, he convinced me that my current insurance

281
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 was not good enough.

282
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 I was just saying.

283
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 He's a good neighbor.

284
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Healer is there.

285
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 He is unlicensed.

286
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 And that is not FDIC insured, just so you know.

287
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 [LAUGHTER]

288
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Like the FDIC is going to be existing in two minutes.

289
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 I feel like your son will pay out, though.

290
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 If I get into a major automobile accident,

291
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 I feel like your son's going to take care of me.

292
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 [LAUGHTER]

293
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 That's true.

294
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 That's true.

295
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Yeah.

296
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 [LAUGHTER]

297
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 I think that's going to be fine.

298
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Aguirre Scoop has said braces, the puberty and virginity

299
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 extender.

300
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Yes.

301
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 [LAUGHTER]

302
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 That certainly helped in my situation.

303
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Oh, boy.

304
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Yeah.

305
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 It does not seem to be a deterrent socially at all.

306
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Not anymore?

307
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Yeah.

308
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 I don't think so.

309
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 No.

310
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 That's great.

311
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 I mean, everybody-- like, all kids now have braces, right?

312
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Yeah.

313
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 At some point.

314
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 They do.

315
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Most kids do.

316
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 And I--

317
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 I feel like it's a much more common thing now.

318
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 It wasn't completely outrageous for me.

319
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 A lot of people still had braces.

320
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 No.

321
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 But they do them younger.

322
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Yes.

323
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 Ah.

324
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 That's for sure.

325
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Yes.

326
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,680
 It's very rare that a kid in high school has braces now.

327
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,680
 They do them all in the middle school years.

328
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,680
 Yeah.

329
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,920
 They do that because younger gums, it works faster.

330
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
 Yeah.

331
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
 Teeth move around.

332
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,920
 Yeah.

333
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,920
 Yeah.

334
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,560
 Oh, Aguirre Scoop is saying, are braces smaller than they used to be?

335
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,560
 Maybe.

336
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,800
 Aguirre Scoop in the chat is saying that braces are super tiny and minor now.

337
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
 Or that they're asking.

338
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,800
 I think the--

339
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
 They're super tiny and minor now.

340
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,200
 They're able to stick to the teeth.

341
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
 Yeah.

342
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
 They seem smaller to me.

343
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,200
 Mine's just shining.

344
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,720
 Mine's just got a big gold grill.

345
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,520
 It's just a big-- it just holds so the teeth are just moving around.

346
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,520
 Oh, god.

347
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,160
 Have you seen those people that wear their grills too long and it fucks up their teeth

348
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,160
 forever?

349
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,160
 Oh, my god.

350
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,160
 It's the nastiest thing.

351
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,160
 They just keep--

352
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,160
 Well, it's just--

353
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,160
 They keep them in for, like, months.

354
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,160
 And it's like, what are you doing?

355
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,600
 Well, because it's a visible version of Invisalign.

356
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,600
 Oh, no.

357
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,080
 But it's not even-- no.

358
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,080
 Not Invisal-- it's like just-- they're not medically sound.

359
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,280
 No, I'm saying, like, the grill-- no, that's what I'm saying is.

360
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,960
 The grill is acting like just a visible Invisalign.

361
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,800
 But it's just not even helping anything.

362
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
 It's just correcting--

363
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
 Right.

364
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
 That's jacking them up.

365
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
 Oh, it's so gross.

366
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,720
 It's just doing what braces do, but in the wrong direction.

367
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
 Oh.

368
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,720
 [INAUDIBLE]

369
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:19,960
 Oh, Matt, Galactic President Scooperstar McScoopsalot has a great question in the chat.

370
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:25,120
 Did the boys convince you or did the HOA convince you to do anything about the giant skeleton

371
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,120
 in your front yard?

372
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,760
 The giant skeleton is still up in my front yard.

373
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,600
 That's a win.

374
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,000
 We keep joking that we're going to put a Santa Claus hat on it.

375
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,360
 I have a feeling the HOA will not approve of that.

376
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,360
 Most of the problems--

377
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,360
 But you can't ask permission.

378
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,360
 You can't ask permission.

379
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,360
 Oh, no, no.

380
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,360
 We're not going to ask permission.

381
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,920
 But I just-- I think we just still get fined is what I mean.

382
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,520
 The skeleton's head is bigger than mine.

383
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,680
 So I have some big Santa Claus hats, but not big enough for the skeleton.

384
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,160
 So I got to go out.

385
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:03,040
 I'm sure it's just a quick search on the internet will get me a giant Santa hat for the head.

386
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,800
 But plus, I think it put a little sac on his back there.

387
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,400
 But the problem is simply that it's a two-person operation.

388
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,680
 And my wife-- first I was away, and then my wife's so busy that we literally just huddled

389
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,800
 up right now for just to finally have an hour to play out the next two weeks.

390
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,840
 I have no idea when we're going to have time to take that thing down.

391
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
 Right.

392
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
 Oh, good news.

393
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,320
 Home Depot sells a Santa hat to go with that skeleton.

394
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,320
 Yeah, there's no doubt.

395
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,240
 There's no doubt about it.

396
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,400
 What about putting him in the pool?

397
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,920
 I did a Google search for giant skeleton hat, and that popped right up.

398
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
 Could he just live in the pool?

399
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,920
 Yes.

400
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:43,520
 Put him in the shallow end of the pool, so he's just out of it.

401
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,520
 That'd be funny.

402
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,520
 Yeah.

403
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,520
 That's pretty great.

404
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,520
 Yeah.

405
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,520
 That's pretty great.

406
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,520
 Yeah.

407
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,520
 Those bones will probably dissolve, and the chlorine in your pool will become toxic.

408
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,920
 I don't know.

409
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,080
 That's probably not good.

410
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,480
 That's probably not good for the--

411
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,440
 Or it'll activate the spell that lies within the skeleton, and he will simply grow and

412
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,440
 animate it.

413
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,160
 One way or another, something's going down.

414
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
 Yeah.

415
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,160
 It's not going to be--

416
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,160
 One way or another.

417
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,160
 It's not going to be safe.

418
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,160
 Oh my god.

419
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
 No.

420
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,160
 No.

421
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,160
 It's going to be unfortunate.

422
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:20,240
 Well, I got through yet another round of eyeball testing on Monday, and it was kind of crazy.

423
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,240
 Went in.

424
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,240
 Yep.

425
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,240
 Eyeball.

426
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
 Eyeball.

427
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,640
 And yeah, I'm certified eyeball, and we've done every test that we can except for the

428
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,640
 dye test.

429
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,440
 So he was like, "You want to just do the dye test and get it done?"

430
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
 And I'm like, "Great."

431
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,520
 So they could detect any possible swelling or whatever.

432
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
 I'm like, "Sure."

433
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
 Yeah.

434
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,720
 So they had to put dye in me, and then quickly get a bunch of pictures of my eyes, and then

435
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,520
 we looked, and, "Oh, there's no swelling.

436
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,520
 Okay."

437
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,800
 So everything's written off except I have crummy veins, and there's really nothing we

438
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,960
 can do about that until things go catastrophically wrong.

439
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,320
 So I'm going back in in seven weeks to see if things are better or worse.

440
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,320
 The yellow dye.

441
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,560
 Yes, it was very yellow.

442
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,740
 So as they're doing it and everything, they're like, "So you're going to notice discoloration

443
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,740
 in your urine and stool.

444
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,720
 That's going to last a day or two."

445
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,320
 I'm like, "Okay, cool."

446
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,360
 But then I'm getting ready to go back to my car, and I'm like, "Well, I better hit the

447
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,520
 head before I go."

448
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,960
 And I swear to God, it was the secret of the ooze.

449
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:27,000
 I fucking was so ... It was fluorescent.

450
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 Fluorescent?

451
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,120
 I mean, that's what it's supposed to be.

452
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
 It was fluorescent.

453
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,120
 I was like ...

454
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,120
 It's still upsetting.

455
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
 Kecto Cooler is shooting out your urethra.

456
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,120
 Yeah.

457
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,120
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

458
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,120
 He's used to that.

459
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,960
 I'm afraid of no ghosts.

460
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,000
 It was ... Well, okay.

461
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,480
 God, should I share this?

462
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
 This is too much.

463
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,480
 Wait a minute.

464
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,480
 What's happening?

465
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,480
 Hold on.

466
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,400
 The things that you've shared without this question has been paramount to this podcast.

467
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,400
 I can't believe ... Whatever you're about to say seems ...

468
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
 This is terrifying.

469
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
 I'm going to share it.

470
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
 I'm going to fucking share it.

471
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,400
 I don't care.

472
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,400
 I'm going to share it.

473
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,400
 I almost don't want him to do it now.

474
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
 I'm going to share it.

475
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,400
 I'm too scared.

476
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:11,520
 I had been peeing for a day, basically, and it was still pretty bright.

477
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,040
 And I was like, "Well, this is throughout.

478
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,400
 This is corrupting everything."

479
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:31,360
 So in the interest of science, I had to bust one out and see what was going on.

480
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:37,720
 And I'm here to tell you that it permeated everything.

481
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:48,840
 So I literally fired off some straight-up ectoplasm radio.

482
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:55,840
 My no-nut November was done a while back.

483
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,240
 But I also thought, not only in the interest of science, but also I thought, probably good

484
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,600
 to get this out of every part of my system that it could be lingering in.

485
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
 Yeah.

486
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
 Time to flush.

487
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
 Right.

488
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
 Yeah.

489
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,600
 Just general maintenance was what was going on.

490
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,600
 That's it.

491
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,600
 That's it.

492
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,960
 I'll tell you who else only does that in the interest of general maintenance.

493
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
 But here's the thing.

494
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
 Here's the thing.

495
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,000
 As I'm doing this, as I'm thinking about it, how many times have… because guys are

496
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,480
 the worst.

497
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:34,000
 How many times have guys had a die situation and then had a romantic interlude not long

498
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,560
 after?

499
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:43,040
 And what does that do to the possible children conceived, let alone the kind of intimate

500
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,400
 moment you're having?

501
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,880
 Oh, I didn't realize that's where you were going with this.

502
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:54,080
 I thought you were concerned about the fluorescent pearl necklace that I was giving out to all

503
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,560
 the peoples after getting my eye digest.

504
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,720
 I thought you were worried about your gym socks glowing in the dark when you tried to

505
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,640
 go to sleep or something.

506
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,320
 Here's the thing.

507
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,320
 Yes.

508
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,840
 So this is the other thing too is like, is this dangerous?

509
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:20,560
 And if it's not that dangerous, then I think we've found a weird porn subculture thing

510
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,560
 here maybe.

511
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,560
 You found a kink.

512
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,560
 Yeah, right.

513
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,320
 People who fire off multicolor shots.

514
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,320
 Upside down Spider-Man.

515
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:35,640
 I'll tell you who else has fluorescent semen.

516
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,160
 I want to tease go through this commercial break.

517
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,680
 After this commercial break, I have a bunch of new tour dates coming up in 2026 for the

518
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,680
 Jokers of Magic.

519
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,800
 It's all officially on the Jokers of Magic website and I want to talk about all the cities

520
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,560
 I'm going to when we come up after the break.

521
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:56,040
 Every single city on the Jokers of Magic tour will be jizzed on in fluorescent semen.

522
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,680
 That's the Jokers of Magic guarantee.

523
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,680
 That's right.

524
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,680
 Guarantee.

525
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,680
 Also, here's a sponsor.

526
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,080
 Today's show is brought to you by, oh, Matt Donnelly.

527
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,080
 There we go.

528
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,080
 From Kevin Chamberlain in 2022.

529
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,140
 It's brought to you by me.

530
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,080
 So yeah, I'm going to be going on the road.

531
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,080
 Go to jokersofmagic.com.

532
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,080
 Okay.

533
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,080
 Next commercial.

534
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,200
 Today's show is also brought to you by Leftover Lobster.

535
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,200
 That's right.

536
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,200
 From LAJ in 2022.

537
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,560
 This product is Leftover Lobster.

538
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:26,800
 You see, Ariel, sometimes people can't finish their entire meal and they need to take a

539
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,900
 basket home.

540
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,160
 Don't forget to have an extra cheddar biscuit.

541
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,160
 Why not?

542
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:39,120
 Ah, under the tin foil, under the tin foil.

543
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,760
 I will be waiting down on the shelf under the tin foil.

544
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,400
 You'll put me deep back in the fridge and you'll forget I ever lived.

545
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,720
 I was alive once.

546
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,880
 Now I am frozen under the tin foil.

547
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,240
 You leave me there for a week and then I start to reek.

548
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,400
 You remember only far too late that it was something you were going to eat under the

549
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
 tin foil.

550
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,400
 Under the tin foil.

551
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
 Under the tin foil.

552
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
 Under the tin foil.

553
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,040
 I am a stinky mess.

554
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,580
 The germs have coalesced and it's mold all over me.

555
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,000
 You spent 25 dollars on the plate.

556
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,520
 You weren't going to let that go to waste, but you should have left me because now I'm

557
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
 just scrudsy.

558
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,240
 Look, I'm covered in mold here.

559
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,740
 You don't want this, dear.

560
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,080
 Leave me, I'm rotten.

561
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,400
 All kinds of nasty under the tin foil.

562
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,600
 And eight scoops of checkout.

563
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
 Yes.

564
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,560
 Oh my God.

565
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:45,360
 We found a, at work the other day, we found just somebody's coffee cup that they had put

566
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,120
 somewhere and then it apparently had gotten hidden.

567
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,720
 Like other people got put in, other things got put in front of this coffee cup and the

568
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,400
 coffee cup got hidden and then, uh, long story short, several months later, a coffee cup

569
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
 was found.

570
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
 Oh, what?

571
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,120
 It was like a fancy cup, no, like a paper coffee cup.

572
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,120
 Oh shit.

573
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
 Okay.

574
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
 Good.

575
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,680
 An at work, an at work coffee cup, just right into the garbage.

576
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,720
 But it was, it was disgusting.

577
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,720
 Sure.

578
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,720
 Yeah.

579
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,720
 Yeah.

580
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,720
 Life.

581
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
 Disgusting, Matt.

582
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,720
 Speaking of disgusting.

608
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,520
 This is great.

609
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,200
 We saw this on a Dittleman's, uh, Instagram last night.

610
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,200
 Yeah.

611
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,120
 I believe I'm doing all of them with Dittleman and then, and then there's going to be a rotation

612
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,960
 and Mike Mills will be doing all of them.

613
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,440
 And then we'll be rotating between Derek Hughes, who I'm so excited to be doing a show with

614
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,840
 Derek is Matt King's number one filling guy had an awesome run on America's Got Talent.

615
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,400
 If you're watching our stuff, he, he's just killer everywhere.

616
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,800
 And uh, we're also going to Nick, the fats coming back for one of the legs of the tour.

617
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,360
 So Ruben Morland, who a lot of people don't know he's, he's actually been killing it in

618
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,360
 a fringe festivals.

619
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:13,000
 One of the nicest guys, uh, uh, it's the big goofy redhead.

620
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 I love Ruben.

621
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,640
 I've hung out with him a bunch of times.

622
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,760
 I'm so excited to be sharing my first shows with him.

623
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,100
 He's so he's super funny.

624
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,240
 So yeah, very, very excited.

625
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,000
 Each shows a four magician lineup, uh, of comedy magicians and it's going to be super

626
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 fun.

627
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 That sounds wonderful.

628
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Yeah.

629
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,400
 The magicians, I watched the most recent fool us, uh, the other day and, uh, that cat with

630
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,840
 the, with the fucking card trick, who, uh, who was it, uh, close talk to him like the

631
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,680
 day before or something like that to get him on Paco, a groudo, a guard.

632
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,680
 Yes.

633
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,400
 Uh, I wasn't even going to try to remember his name.

634
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,620
 He was amazing.

635
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:59,280
 So I was going to, this is a abracadabra spoiler, so I, but I guess, you know, we're here, uh,

636
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:07,120
 that is the reason why you don't see me on this season of I was in the chamber as an

637
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,120
 emergency guy.

638
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,080
 We had lost a couple of people to different, for different reasons.

639
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:16,720
 And uh, I was being, uh, primed up to do some kind of version of my card stab or ring trick

640
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,500
 routine for fool us.

641
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,280
 And then all of a sudden it was like, no, nevermind.

642
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:26,360
 We got this guy and of course I was like, you know, and uh, and then he came out and

643
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,920
 he was, he just killed, he just killed.

644
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:35,640
 So yeah, he was there just as a friend, uh, helping out, uh, John Carlos Scalia, uh, who's

645
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,640
 who aired an earlier episode this season and they was to have done a two person show with

646
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,000
 each other in Spain.

647
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 And so it was another thing.

648
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,720
 It's like the same way they got, uh, uh, Danny D or T's on.

649
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,200
 They simply said like, you're here.

650
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,200
 Like you're right here.

651
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,200
 What are you?

652
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,100
 Why are we not doing something here?

653
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,000
 And so he showed them a couple of stuff and yeah, he went on there and fooled the shit

654
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 out of them.

655
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 So yeah.

656
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,360
 Uh, and so did John Carlo.

657
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,600
 So, and I've worked with John Carlo a bunch on the princess cruise ships.

658
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,360
 He's the nicest guy.

659
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,640
 And uh, as someone said on, uh, abracadabra, maybe the only person who can just totally

660
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,680
 successfully use charm as misdirection, just, just totally can just be so charmingly goofy

661
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,760
 and whatever that you just, you just take your eyes off of everything he's doing with

662
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,760
 his hands.

663
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,080
 Uh, it's, it's really, they're, they're both just killer killer guys.

664
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,080
 Yeah.

665
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,080
 They're great.

666
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,080
 Yeah.

667
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,080
 Yeah.

668
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,080
 He was amazing.

669
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,540
 I've seen a fool us this season, man, they, it is, it is a good season to fool us.

670
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,540
 It is.

671
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:37,200
 We don't know what the future holds, uh, couple, you know, we, they took the season and split

672
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,200
 it in half, right?

673
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,920
 So the air 10 episodes and they gave like a big four month gap and then now they're

674
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,700
 airing the other 10 episodes.

675
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:49,280
 Um, the reruns get the same exact ratings as the new episodes, which is usually a bad

676
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,320
 sign for TV things.

677
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,060
 Uh, we've done over 140 episodes, so there's certainly enough to syndicate till the end

678
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,060
 of time.

679
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:01,480
 And that includes getting rid of three seasons of, uh, the COVID seasons, which they don't

680
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,240
 seem to re-air as much, uh, without the studio audience.

681
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,000
 Uh, but I think those episodes are now covered with the last two seasons.

682
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,160
 And so I don't know.

683
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:18,880
 And also what is CW in this modern media landscape, uh, it's, it's a really weird, uh, is not

684
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,200
 been gobbled up by any of the major streamers.

685
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,680
 It's still its own app.

686
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:28,120
 Uh, it's still a network television show, which is still airs on rabbit ears.

687
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,900
 Um, and so I don't, I don't, we don't, we don't know.

688
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,880
 So we, so it's all, it's all up in the air.

689
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,560
 I just don't, I don't know what anything in TV means anymore.

690
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:45,280
 I know that point now where like all of our experience in television entertainment doesn't

691
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,880
 mean anything at all.

692
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,160
 The models certainly aren't there anymore that we came up with.

693
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,160
 It's so strange.

694
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:56,440
 It really is a very strange time, uh, specifically for television and, and yeah, it is, it is

695
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,440
 weird.

696
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:04,200
 And so, yeah, I, you know, uh, would Penn and Teller wants to do another season would,

697
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,720
 would they want to maybe try a new show somewhere else?

698
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,720
 I don't know.

699
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,720
 You know, that kind of stuff.

700
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,120
 So I mean, we did, uh, 11 seasons and secretly like 13 and a half seasons if you do it by

701
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,080
 a regular episode count.

702
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,560
 And so that's the whole lot of TV and the whole lot of cool stuff.

703
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,320
 So I, I, I don't know.

704
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,000
 And how it's that many seasons over how many years now?

705
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 Gosh.

706
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,600
 Uh, I mean, it's over a decade.

707
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
 Yes.

708
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,600
 It's definitely over a decade.

709
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,600
 Yep.

710
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,600
 Yeah.

711
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
 I'm trying to think when I started.

712
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,600
 Well, yeah.

713
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,600
 So my kid was born.

714
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,600
 Uh, yeah, it's been a decade.

715
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,600
 It's been a decade.

716
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,600
 Oh, there you go.

717
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
 Yeah.

718
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
 Yeah.

719
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,600
 So my kid was born.

720
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,600
 My second kid was born during the first season.

721
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,600
 So, oh yeah.

722
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
 They're a supernova girl.

723
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,600
 Season one was 2011.

724
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,600
 Yeah.

725
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,600
 Yeah.

726
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,640
 So I mean, it's, that's, that's a run.

727
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,640
 Yeah.

728
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,640
 Yeah.

729
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,640
 He's coming over.

730
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,440
 We'll talk about the original season of air in England too.

731
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,240
 So season two is where I kind of start the American, uh, season.

732
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,240
 Oh, right.

733
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,240
 Sure.

734
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,240
 It's been 10 years since it was refired up in season two and it goes on.

735
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,240
 Gotcha.

736
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,240
 Yeah.

737
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,240
 Yeah.

738
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,240
 Are they thinking about a new show, Matt?

739
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,240
 They're always are.

740
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,240
 They always are.

741
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,240
 They always are.

742
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,960
 Um, yeah, the new show that they're talking about doing, it's not going to be as difficult

743
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,960
 to get a trophy.

744
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,520
 It's just a full Matt Donnelly.

745
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,640
 Yeah, it's just, it's just going to be like, if you don't get one, it's going to be like,

746
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,640
 what's wrong with you.

747
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,640
 It's just embarrassing.

748
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,360
 Cut piff's hand.

749
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,360
 Injure piff.

750
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,360
 Yeah.

751
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,360
 Injure piff.

752
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,360
 No, it's strange.

753
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,400
 It's strange to be busy enough that I don't need it.

754
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,800
 You know, I think, I think that was always like the weird thing of like, anytime full

755
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
 scale, I was like, oh good.

756
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,000
 That was always a nice, nice thing.

757
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,480
 And I think also like, I've really gotten like, like I heard, I heard me something about

758
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,480
 another magician.

759
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:54,200
 They're going to put, they're putting together a TV special for a magic thing and I'm not

760
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,560
 necessarily on this magician's radar, but like people around him are.

761
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:05,080
 And I am actually like, I think because we're going to show, like I have, I understand magic

762
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:09,600
 for TV versus magic for magic sake pretty well.

763
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,800
 And it's like, and I was like, I should be at least get a phone call from one of these

764
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,800
 people.

765
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:19,160
 It's like, and so I am a little bit like, oh wait, if this shows over, I need to figure

766
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:25,560
 out how to put myself out there more as a possible, like, you know, lower level producer.

767
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,560
 Yeah.

768
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,560
 Yeah.

769
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,560
 Cause of like, I really do.

770
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,640
 I did learn so much from that show and I think it could help a lot for something like that.

771
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,640
 But yeah.

772
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,640
 Yeah.

773
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,640
 We'll see.

774
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,640
 I bet you could buy the CW.

775
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,160
 That's probably, that's probably true.

776
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,840
 It's on the block.

777
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,840
 Yeah, uh, my, uh, improv classes are going great.

778
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:53,000
 I just got done with my first, uh, level one four week, uh, class and I had a couple of

779
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,360
 students who were so jazzed that they wanted me to keep teaching and go on to level two.

780
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:02,240
 And I was like, well, I don't have a level two class scheduled right now, maybe next

781
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,240
 year.

782
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,280
 And they were like, Nope, let's get this going.

783
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:14,080
 And so they contacted, uh, uh, and, and made a, made a thing and, and, and got, uh, got

784
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,200
 things moving forward and holy shit.

785
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:24,840
 Uh, Justin was up for it and they've got five students registered so far out of my class

786
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:30,560
 and they're going to get a couple more hopefully and by the, this next month I'll be teaching

787
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,040
 two classes a week.

788
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,040
 So yeah.

789
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,040
 Whoa.

790
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,040
 Yeah.

791
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,040
 I'll be doing a level one.

792
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,000
 I'm still doing my level one again and a level two.

793
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 So it's great.

794
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,360
 So we are doing what I was hoping to do, which is build out, uh, improv community in Pittsburgh.

795
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,560
 It's going to take some time, but it's going to happen.

796
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,760
 Uh, I believe we'll see.

797
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,760
 Oh, nice.

798
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,760
 Yeah.

799
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,760
 So that's going really well.

800
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,080
 Uh, thank you, bossy.

801
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:02,080
 Uh, yeah, it's, uh, it's just, you know, it's what I've been hoping for and I'm, uh, still

802
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,720
 teaching the occasional free class over there at the pod duty network.

803
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,720
 So that's going to happen.

804
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:13,760
 Uh, so I'm going to do, do that next Tuesday, then the Tuesday after that provided everything's

805
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,420
 lined up, we'll be rocking and rolling with, uh, Tuesday classes too.

806
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:25,600
 So very encouraged with that, uh, making some more, uh, yeah, making some more headway with

807
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,240
 getting, getting further away from, uh, retail gigs and more and more into, uh, this kind

808
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,240
 of thing.

809
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:39,320
 Although today, today we went and bought some stuff for Ann's garden.

810
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:46,920
 And in the, uh, complex where we went, no, we didn't, I know the complex where we went.

811
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,960
 What do you know?

812
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:55,760
 There's a brand new bricks and mini figs store opening up and I'm like, Oh shit.

813
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,200
 So for those of you who aren't familiar, this is a chain, a franchise that actually deals

814
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:06,160
 in used Legos and repurposed like, so, uh, huh.

815
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,720
 So I think they're not going to open till summer next year.

816
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,620
 It says, or, or spring at least.

817
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,160
 So I'm going to work there.

818
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,160
 I'm going to try.

819
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,800
 I think I might as well, right?

820
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,760
 If the, if the compensation is comparable, what the fuck?

821
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:25,140
 I mean, I could spend all day fucking around with Legos and hosting kids Lego parties rather

822
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,320
 than shoveling coal.

823
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,840
 And this is going to be like Ellsroth at the weed place, you're just going to rise up there

824
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,840
 without trying.

825
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,720
 And you're just going to become a kingpin.

826
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
 Yeah.

827
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,720
 Yeah.

828
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,720
 Oh man.

829
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,720
 Did you hear about the weed stuff though?

830
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,120
 That's, that was my first thought was Ellsroth today.

831
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
 What happened?

832
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,360
 Uh, no, they have, uh, our Congress has decided to outlaw weed again.

833
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,360
 Nationally.

834
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,360
 What?

835
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,360
 Yes.

836
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,960
 Couldn't possibly be a distraction from other things, but, uh, yeah, that's what they put

837
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,760
 in that, uh, fucking, uh, open the government backup bill that, uh, weed's going to be illegal

838
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,040
 nationally in 26 again.

839
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,040
 I know.

840
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,040
 I know.

841
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,040
 Right?

842
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,040
 Yeah.

843
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,040
 Why?

844
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,040
 Why?

845
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,040
 Indeed.

846
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,040
 It's almost as though they're trying to sabotage the country.

847
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,800
 It's almost as though they're trying to just bring us to the brink of no, I mean, I mean,

848
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:20,760
 like, okay, sure, because I can't, I've, uh, uh, it's, it's a weird time and Paul's more

849
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:27,440
 right than wrong about this crazy shit, but, um, uh, like, like, okay, why isn't the government

850
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,280
 bill is what I mean.

851
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,440
 So in other words, why was it allowed to be part of the opening up of the government again?

852
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,180
 Like is it helping prisons?

853
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,180
 Is it helping?

854
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,180
 Yes.

855
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,180
 Do you know what I mean?

856
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,180
 That's exactly it.

857
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,480
 It's helping private prisons, getting private, getting more people back because private prisons

858
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,800
 are complaining that they're not getting enough people.

859
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,960
 So they need something else criminalized again and the liquor industry wants their, uh, liquor

860
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,720
 money back from the people who are, have found out that weed doesn't make you want to kill

861
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,840
 your family as much as alcohol does.

862
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,840
 Uh, I feel like I still want to kill my family as much.

863
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,140
 I don't know, man.

864
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,140
 I don't know.

865
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,480
 But you're like, oh, the knife's all the way over there and my family's all the way over

866
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,480
 there.

867
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,480
 I'll do it tomorrow.

868
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,280
 Are either of them next to chips?

869
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,280
 Possibly.

870
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,920
 Oh my God, Mike Nelson or my family is totally calling me out.

871
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,140
 Uh, said I can't work at the bricks and mini figs place cause I kept saying Legos when

872
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,140
 it's just Lego.

873
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,200
 Oh, it is true.

874
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,200
 They are.

875
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,080
 They are pedantic about that, although bricks and mini figs.

876
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,680
 So I don't have to say fucking Lego at all.

877
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:37,280
 I just bring your bricks and mini figs about that figs is a weird, I've never heard that

878
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,280
 term.

879
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,280
 Yeah.

880
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,280
 Yeah.

881
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,280
 Yeah.

882
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,280
 Yeah.

883
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,280
 Yeah.

884
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,680
 Bricks and mini figs is a, uh, like I said, it's a, it's a franchise.

885
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,480
 So yeah, that's what they call the mini figs.

886
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:55,040
 Um, any Lego figures, mini figures, figs is for figures.

887
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,040
 Yeah.

888
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,040
 Yeah.

889
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,040
 Mini figs.

890
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,040
 Yeah.

891
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,040
 Yeah.

892
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,720
 When you said bricks and mini figs at first, I was pursuing some like tawny, like upper

893
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:08,360
 middle-class place for like bricks, like brick, brick, like masonry and trees and like beautiful

894
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,640
 things like that.

895
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,640
 Nope.

896
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:16,360
 I'm talking about tiny little Lego men.

897
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,360
 That's all it is.

898
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,360
 Teensy little Lego men.

899
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,960
 I'm looking at this stuff here.

900
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,960
 I don't know if this is about weed as much as it's about hemp.

901
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,200
 Well, it's saying THC products.

902
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:33,300
 So it's no products that contain a certain amount of THC, uh, or, uh, or what's the other

903
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,140
 active thing that's going on to the, the, any of it.

904
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,620
 But anyway, last night, the Senate passed a continuous CBD, CBD.

905
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,620
 That's it.

906
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,620
 Oh, there you go.

907
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:46,520
 Along with three appropriation bills, one of which an agricultural appropriation bill

908
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,040
 effectively shut down the U S hemp industry.

909
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:56,800
 Well, that's one way to put it, uh, growers use the plant cannabis sativa to produce both

910
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,840
 hemp and marijuana, blah, blah, blah.

911
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,840
 I don't know.

912
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,840
 This is weird.

913
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,840
 It's fucking weird.

914
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,760
 Like I'm looking through it now.

915
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,440
 I can't really read through the whole thing on the air right now, but like I'm looking

916
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,440
 through it right now.

917
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,840
 I guess I could, that's true.

918
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:19,600
 I guess I got him, Paul, fucking shut up and read Jacob.

919
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,600
 When you're right, you're right.

920
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,600
 We are nothing.

921
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:27,200
 If not a marijuana forward podcast forward, this is the thing.

922
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,160
 Like I, I am the least smoky of all of us.

923
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:35,000
 As in I have never, I have never imbibed and even a gummy, uh, you know, I'm just not a

924
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:42,160
 drug dude, but I, I am very much an advocate of, of all of it because, you know, I've seen

925
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,680
 the good effects it can have on people and it can make people feel good and mitigate

926
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,680
 pain.

927
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,040
 I, first of all, once lived in the Virgin islands, so we don't need to go over my partaking

928
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:58,360
 of weed, but, um, what in the Virgin islands, you know, you don't, you don't live in a tree

929
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,840
 house in the Caribbean and not smoke weed.

930
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:10,040
 How much of your, how much of the residents you lived in was constructed of hemp?

931
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,720
 How much of the building itself was just weed?

932
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,720
 Just weed.

933
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,720
 Yeah.

934
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,720
 You just lived in weed.

935
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,720
 Yes.

936
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:22,600
 Uh, it, it like literally like in the movie, like washed up, we, one time had a giant

937
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,200
 garbage bag of a wash up on shore.

938
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,960
 Uh, it was that stereotypical, was it just like Christmas?

939
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,200
 We may, Oh, that ended up leading cause it wasn't good weeds.

940
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,760
 I ended up leading to my friend, Colin making what I called, uh, instead of weed cookies,

941
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,640
 he made a weed briquettes is what I call them.

942
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,640
 It came out green.

943
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:47,360
 It was like, it was like your, it was like your gym sock, Paul, it was neon green, uh,

944
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,800
 and they were so strong.

945
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,720
 People accused him of lacing them with other illicit substances, which is hilarious because

946
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,400
 he was Rosifarian and like really just believed in like just skunk weed.

947
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,400
 And he's like, no, no.

948
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,600
 But it is such a density cooked into the cookie as like sugar.

949
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,600
 Yeah.

950
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,840
 Uh, we were, it was more weed than sugar.

951
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,040
 You're just feeling the power of jaw.

952
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,480
 It was weeks of the craziest behavior.

953
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:18,880
 It was just a really endemic, uh, uh, company.

954
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,960
 But I bet nobody, nobody got hurt.

955
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,960
 Nobody got enough brawl.

956
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,200
 People got paranoid and stuck on, on, on like a little Island key, like a snorkeling Island,

957
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:35,560
 like, uh, for like hours cause they were afraid to go back in the water, uh, they were worried

958
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,380
 about their ability to swim to shore.

959
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:40,320
 So there was an incident, there was an incident of survival.

960
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,320
 Nobody was hurt.

961
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,320
 Nobody was hurt.

962
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,320
 Nobody was hurt.

963
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,640
 It's, it's, you know, and like you said, I hate that I'm the diet of exposure on that

964
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,120
 Island injured before dying.

965
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,520
 I hate that I'm more right than wrong on this stuff, but I think, you know, weed is such

966
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,600
 as such a good calming effect on a lot of people and just chills folks out and alcohol

967
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,640
 just get some amped and people are going to turn to whatever substance they need to get

968
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,640
 through the day.

969
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:08,520
 I actually thought, like I thought, I thought, uh, legalizing weed in Nevada wouldn't be

970
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,520
 that big of a deal.

971
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,520
 Wouldn't change things.

972
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,520
 And it was I wrong.

973
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,400
 Like it changed things significantly.

974
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,000
 You can't walk down the street without smelling it.

975
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 Exactly.

976
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,400
 I don't enjoy the effect that weed has had on Vegas, but my answer to that is not jail.

977
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:29,440
 My answer to that is not let's get involved, but also the capital punishment.

978
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:35,480
 That's the fact that you can't walk down a Las Vegas street without smelling weed tells

979
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:42,480
 you if you're not brain dead that, Oh, they are selling tons of this shit.

980
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,840
 This is an industry, the stereotype of old cab drivers is they would take you to whatever

981
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,480
 club, but they would, you know, not the one you asked for, but the one that paid the cabbies

982
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:56,040
 the most, right, and that has now changed to weed dispensary.

983
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,040
 Yeah.

984
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,040
 Yeah.

985
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:02,600
 Well, remember how we were talking even before, like we, there's before I moved, there was

986
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:09,160
 still a real possibility that we could have been really fun dispensary, uh, entertainment.

987
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,160
 Right.

988
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,160
 Yeah.

989
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,440
 There's going to be the easiest job in the world.

990
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,440
 Exactly.

991
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,440
 Motherfuckers will laugh to anything.

992
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:23,520
 Oh, a couple of places here have tried the, uh, the cannabis lounges and nobody has figured

993
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,520
 it out yet.

994
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,520
 Yeah.

995
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,520
 How to do the lounge.

996
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,520
 Yeah.

997
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,520
 What's the problem?

998
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,320
 Just like hanging around and getting high somewhere else.

999
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,840
 Isn't that appealing to people?

1000
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,760
 It's not, it's not, it's not working with standup lineups.

1001
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,760
 That's for sure.

1002
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,040
 Well, I suppose if, if one of the major side effects is paranoia, you don't want to be

1003
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,040
 in a strange place.

1004
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,040
 Well, this is it.

1005
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,640
 I have all these different strands now that one can, you know, the, the, the, the, this

1006
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,200
 is not going to get you paranoid, man.

1007
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,640
 This is just going to give you a real mellow trip.

1008
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,640
 Yeah.

1009
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,640
 Yeah.

1010
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,640
 And it tastes like ice cream.

1011
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,640
 So let's go.

1012
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:04,920
 I just saw a video of some cannabis celebration and somebody had rigged up an apparatus where

1013
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:11,180
 they had a giant stack of weed inside what amounted to a stove pipe.

1014
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:17,000
 And that stove pipe was directly built on top of, and Jerry rigged to, and taped up

1015
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,280
 to a leaf blower.

1016
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:25,400
 And so somebody lit all the weed with a blow torch in the top of the stove pipe.

1017
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:30,360
 They turned on the leaf blower and it just for like two minutes straight, just billowed

1018
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,360
 weed smoke.

1019
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,360
 Just look, it just looked like a haunted house.

1020
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:39,500
 It's just in the business we call that the dandy isn't that dandy.

1021
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,500
 It's the dandy.

1022
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,500
 Yeah.

1023
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,920
 It was crazy.

1024
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,920
 It was crazy.

1025
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:51,600
 It was wild to see and just people just getting face full of weed smoke from a blower or from

1026
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,760
 a leaf blower.

1027
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,480
 The whole room was just coated.

1028
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,480
 Yeah.

1029
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,480
 Yeah.

1030
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,320
 So, but yeah, that really, that really bummed me out this morning.

1031
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,840
 And my first thought was Ellsroth cause he has found something he's exceptionally good

1032
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,840
 at.

1033
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,840
 He's enjoying the shit out of it.

1034
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,160
 He's trying to entrepreneurialize with it all.

1035
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,160
 He's trying.

1036
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,160
 He's become a true character, man.

1037
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,160
 Right.

1038
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,160
 And this is the thing.

1039
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,160
 Right.

1040
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:17,100
 This is exactly why I'm like, that's America.

1041
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,600
 That's fucking capitalism.

1042
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,600
 True.

1043
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,880
 That's, that's get it done.

1044
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:25,060
 And they're just putting a kibosh on it.

1045
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,060
 I guess we should.

1046
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,060
 What the fuck?

1047
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,060
 I'd be curious.

1048
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:31,720
 He's probably working, which is why he's not here, but I'd be curious what Ellsroth's

1049
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,400
 saying and what they're saying at his work.

1050
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,400
 I'd be curious about that.

1051
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,920
 Well, we've got a day here.

1052
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,480
 Maybe we can try and get him on tomorrow cause we're doing it again tomorrow.

1053
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,480
 Yeah.

1054
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,480
 Maybe we could get him into chiming.

1055
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,760
 Cause yeah, I would love to hear the initial cause and I'll give it a day to Stu cause

1056
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,200
 it just hit today.

1057
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,600
 So yeah, let's, let's hear it.

1058
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,160
 Let's hear it.

1059
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,160
 Speaking of hitting today.

1060
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,680
 So the, the new federal funding legislation moving through Congress is expected to impact

1061
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:05,360
 the sale, the sale of hemp driven THC products, but not state regulated sales of recreational

1062
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,240
 metal medical marijuana.

1063
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,240
 Okay.

1064
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,240
 Medical.

1065
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,240
 Medical.

1066
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,240
 Yes.

1067
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,240
 It's CBD.

1068
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:17,980
 It looks like though, from this, from this other article that I'm looking at over here

1069
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:24,720
 from the cannabis business times.com, which sounds, they sound very CBT.

1070
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,720
 Let's not.

1071
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,720
 Let's not get confused.

1072
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,480
 Can a business is right there in a business.

1073
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,480
 Can a business times.

1074
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,480
 It should be Canada's times.

1075
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,360
 And it's definitely looking at it again, I was wrong though.

1076
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,720
 It's cannabis business times.

1077
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,720
 It's right there.

1078
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:38,720
 You gotta go.

1079
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,720
 I gotta make some calls.

1080
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,720
 Yeah.

1081
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:46,240
 Can a business letter, no, I only take my news from the times of cannabis, the times

1082
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:52,560
 of cannabis business weekly times of cannabis business weekly is out of the, that's out

1083
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,560
 of the realm.

1084
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,200
 You know, that's the cannabis.

1085
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,200
 I'm pretty leftist.

1086
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,860
 So I do this, the Sativa Tribune.

1087
00:44:58,860 --> 00:44:59,860
 So I do this.

1088
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:04,120
 Sativa Tribune, you would you Pinko, how about, what about high times?

1089
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:08,120
 Oh, high times that old rag.

1090
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:16,760
 I'm all about cannabis business right now, people's front people's front, the people's

1091
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,760
 front.

1092
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,760
 Judea.

1093
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,920
 That's exactly what I was going for.

1094
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,920
 Jacob.

1095
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:22,920
 I knew you'd catch it.

1096
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,840
 Uh, yeah, this looks like it might be, uh, according to the, the, what should be the

1097
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:34,120
 cannabis in this times, uh, the bill if enacted would prevent the unregulated sale of intoxicating

1098
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:38,600
 hemp based or hemp derived products, including Delta eight from being sold online in gas

1099
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:44,000
 stations and corner stores while preserving non intoxicating CBT and industrial hemp products,

1100
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 according to the summary.

1101
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,040
 Meanwhile, meanwhile, Kratom runs rampant.

1102
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,040
 Right.

1103
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:53,680
 Oh, it's stupid that they're involving themselves in it at all.

1104
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,680
 Right.

1105
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,680
 Absolutely.

1106
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,680
 That's the thing.

1107
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,680
 Is it just stupid?

1108
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,680
 Right.

1109
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,680
 We've gotten this point.

1110
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,880
 We've had nothing but wild success.

1111
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:02,880
 Let's fuck everything.

1112
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,880
 Yeah.

1113
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:04,880
 Yeah.

1114
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,880
 Let's, let's mess with it.

1115
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:06,880
 It doesn't make it.

1116
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,840
 I'll tell you who else wants to mess with stuff just for the sake of messing with it.

1117
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:17,080
 And that's the following sponsor today's show is brought to you by, where'd you go?

1118
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,080
 Where did you go?

1119
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,040
 I brought the jokers of magic and now we're screwed.

1120
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:27,620
 Did you go, um, I'm doing a commercial, um, today's show.

1121
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:32,160
 And the makers of permanently wet socks, permanently crunchy socks.

1122
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,160
 That's right.

1123
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,880
 Scuba Troopa in 2025, permanently crunchy socks.

1124
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,240
 Hey everybody.

1125
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:45,480
 It's me, Apple Jack from Apple Jacks, the mascot that never existed.

1126
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:50,960
 Hi, are you interested in shit in your socks?

1127
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,640
 You should try the Apple Jacks.

1128
00:46:53,640 --> 00:47:00,940
 Apple Jacks is combining with Doritos to create a brand new sock full of Apple Jacks and Doritos.

1129
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,020
 That's right.

1130
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:06,200
 It's going to be crunchy, sticky, cheesy, and sharp.

1131
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,200
 Just like you like it.

1132
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,320
 It's the walking sensation that's sweeping the nation.

1133
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,160
 Crunchy cheesy, sticky sharp.

1134
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,160
 That's our guarantee.

1135
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,160
 C-H-I-T.

1136
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:19,760
 You can walk all over it.

1137
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:26,160
 Crunchy cheesy, not it, crunchy cheesy is two C's, crunchy is an S and a T. C-C-S-T.

1138
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,160
 Kissed.

1139
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,680
 You'll be kissed.

1140
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:33,960
 Your feet will be kissed with the delicious taste of Doritos, Apple Jacks, and the mixture

1141
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,920
 of the two with your sweat.

1142
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:43,200
 Nothing like foot sweat to get a Dorito to that perfect flavor taste place and combine

1143
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:49,040
 it with the sweet, sweet stickiness of Apple Jack cereal, which also have a certain crunch.

1144
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,640
 You can't beat it.

1145
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:57,280
 So go out and get yourself some Doritos and Apple Jacks filled socks from me, Apple Jack,

1146
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,080
 the mascot that never was.

1147
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,840
 Enter Hayscoops at checkout.

1148
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,480
 That's a cologne that I would wear.

1149
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,480
 Apple Jacks?

1150
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,720
 Apple Jacks and feet.

1151
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,560
 God damn it.

1152
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:15,280
 I mean, you wear any sweet enough cologne near your socks long enough and you've got

1153
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,280
 it.

1154
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,280
 Yeah.

1155
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:22,640
 By the way, Matt, it looks like Nextar Media Group already owns the CW.

1156
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,160
 Oh, okay.

1157
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:30,080
 We already owned, they, they own the biggest chunk of it.

1158
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:37,080
 And then like Paramount and a couple of other groups like that own like 12% stakes here

1159
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,080
 and there.

1160
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,080
 Oh, no, no, no.

1161
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,320
 I think I understood that they are.

1162
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,320
 Yeah.

1163
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:45,440
 I mean, I knew they had some organization behind them and Nextar I didn't know was Nextar,

1164
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,640
 but yeah, they're, they're already the big dog.

1165
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,440
 But doesn't, but it's weird that they're, they're still an independent streamer.

1166
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,440
 Independent.

1167
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,440
 Yeah.

1168
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,440
 They're still an independent streamers.

1169
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,440
 It's really important.

1170
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,440
 I'm pointing out.

1171
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,440
 Right.

1172
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,440
 I'm just, I'm confused now, now that I know that why they're still an independent streamer.

1173
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,440
 Right.

1174
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,440
 Yeah.

1175
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,320
 It seems like they would already have been looped into other things that their owners

1176
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,320
 own.

1177
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,320
 Right.

1178
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,320
 And they're not.

1179
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,320
 That's weird.

1180
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:13,120
 And they're not, which like the fact that they're not already part of the Paramount Plus or

1181
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:17,160
 Peacock or something like that makes it kind of weird.

1182
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,160
 Yeah.

1183
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,160
 Yeah.

1184
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,160
 And they.

1185
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,160
 Yeah.

1186
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,160
 All right.

1187
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,160
 Yeah.

1188
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,160
 That's fine.

1189
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,160
 Let's do a little Scoop Mail.

1190
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,160
 Let's do it.

1191
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,160
 Message for you, sir.

1192
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:32,000
 We got one here from Mrs. Cincy Scoop.

1193
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,320
 Dear Neapolitan, since this podcast is one of the reasons why I met the love of my life,

1194
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,680
 I wanted to share more happy news about our little family.

1195
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,680
 You're welcome.

1196
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,320
 And this is Manu.

1197
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,320
 Hi, Manu.

1198
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,920
 Manu, Mrs. Cincy Scoop.

1199
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,080
 A couple of weeks ago at the end of October, Mr. Cincy Scoop and I welcomed our Dippin'

1200
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:57,280
 Dot, a healthy little boy who was at 99, who was at the 99 percentile of size during most

1201
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,280
 of the pregnancy.

1202
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,280
 Oh, Jesus.

1203
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,600
 Which turns out to be great because he arrived three weeks early.

1204
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,400
 We were both fine and healthy after the birth.

1205
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,520
 I had my first hospital stay and do not recommend for anyone who needs to rest.

1206
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,640
 Baby is growing, getting nice and fat.

1207
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:15,560
 He likes to sleep so much that we need to pester him every few hours to feed him.

1208
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:21,200
 Then he feeds for about an hour straight until he falls asleep and the cycle repeats.

1209
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,200
 That's a baby after my own heart.

1210
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,760
 That's what I do on my days off right there.

1211
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:24,760
 That's exactly.

1212
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:25,760
 That is my life.

1213
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,760
 Zonk.

1214
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,840
 Most days are good, but the little one is getting the hang of being a human.

1215
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,720
 So other days are a little more challenging.

1216
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,000
 Overall, we are very happy.

1217
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,800
 The experience as a first time parent is interesting to say the least.

1218
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,880
 Honestly, the broken sleep is not the worst part for me.

1219
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:46,440
 Dealing with other people's bullshit comments and opinions are the real test on my nerves.

1220
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:51,360
 Since your advice is always impeccable, I come to you for solutions on how to deal with

1221
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,480
 the worst offenders.

1222
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,960
 I love these questions.

1223
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,960
 Oh boy.

1224
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,840
 Starting strong with questions about the baby's circumcision status.

1225
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:03,880
 I don't think it's appropriate to talk about my baby's genitalia at all, but I guess I'm

1226
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,200
 the weird one.

1227
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,320
 What do I even say to that?

1228
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,240
 Then how do I shut down the comments about the next baby?

1229
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:16,080
 There will be no next baby and it genuinely made me sad hearing those remarks only one

1230
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,840
 week postpartum.

1231
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,520
 That's insane.

1232
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,520
 That's insane.

1233
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:24,760
 People are asking you about the next baby while you're still healing from getting the first

1234
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,760
 one out of you.

1235
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,560
 Well, for the first question, you can tell them straight up and say, "No, Microsoft got

1236
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,560
 rid of Clippy."

1237
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:34,200
 So that's just done.

1238
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,600
 They phased Clippy right out.

1239
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,600
 Yeah.

1240
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,600
 Clippy is gone.

1241
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:42,600
 That's just not an option anymore.

1242
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,600
 Yeah.

1243
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,600
 I would say talk about their genitalia.

1244
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:54,700
 I was just going to say the short, quick answer is, "Why are you thinking about getting one?"

1245
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:58,560
 The bold one is to say, "Are you asking me about my child's penis?

1246
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,680
 Is that what we want to talk about right now?"

1247
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:01,680
 Right.

1248
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:07,640
 How about we just talk about other aspects of their genitalia instead of the tip of their

1249
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,640
 penis?

1250
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,640
 Let's talk about the shaft.

1251
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,640
 Oh, it doesn't have to be your child.

1252
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:18,320
 Turns out, you can just take any kid to the boil and they'll just nip the tip.

1253
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:21,840
 I remember one time having a guy, whatever, being like, "No, don't circumcise."

1254
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,840
 I didn't get circumcised.

1255
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:27,920
 I ended up having to get circumcised at 12 because of an issue or whatever.

1256
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,360
 I regret, "I wish we didn't get it done," or something like that.

1257
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,360
 I turned to the person.

1258
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:37,560
 I said, "You didn't stop fucking, did you?"

1259
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:42,960
 Then he laughed and I was like, "It just seems to me like ... " People try to compare it

1260
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:48,480
 to the oppressive circumcision of women that happens in different countries that's barbaric.

1261
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,480
 Right.

1262
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,480
 It's a little chore.

1263
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,480
 It's a lot different, actually.

1264
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,920
 It's a lot different than that.

1265
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,680
 It's a lot different.

1266
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:03,560
 For the most part, it is a sanitary thing but also, it's nobody's fucking business.

1267
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,560
 Yeah.

1268
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,560
 Mind your business.

1269
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:11,440
 This exactly goes right to this marijuana stuff.

1270
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,960
 Mind your business and let business mind its business.

1271
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:15,960
 It's outrageous.

1272
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:21,800
 The stuff, the talking out of both sides of their fucking heads with this, "We want business

1273
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,440
 to rock and roll and we're going to fuck with business," constant.

1274
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,440
 So stupid.

1275
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:31,720
 I mean, a nice response to it is, as much as I would love to talk about my baby's dick

1276
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:35,760
 with you, why don't we talk about anything else?

1277
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:42,560
 I've ... To say this, this is a life lesson from improv that I moved to real life, which

1278
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,720
 is don't get stuck having conversations you don't want to have.

1279
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,720
 Right?

1280
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,680
 If you're on stage in a scene and you and your scene partner don't feel like you're

1281
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,280
 enjoying the scene, either one of you, do anything to change the subject until you are

1282
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,800
 talking about something you want to talk about and the audience will be relieved, right?

1283
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:04,400
 And so, if you simply go like, "Oh, I don't want to get into this at all," if you just

1284
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:10,480
 say that and then just beat, silence, that person will not pester you about it.

1285
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,480
 They will change the subject.

1286
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,480
 Or if they do, get them out of there.

1287
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,480
 Yeah.

1288
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,480
 Yeah, yeah.

1289
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,480
 But simply saying like, "Oh, I don't want to get into this with you at all.

1290
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,480
 Not right now.

1291
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,480
 I don't feel like talking about it."

1292
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,160
 You know, anything along those lines, just shut the person up.

1293
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,160
 You know?

1294
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,920
 But you owe it to yourself to like, do not have conversations you don't want to have.

1295
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:31,720
 If you don't want to talk about your child's genitalia to somebody, you do not talk about

1296
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,480
 it.

1297
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:38,760
 And if you're confident and calm and almost quiet about it, that person will just freeze

1298
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:42,800
 up and one of you will move on.

1299
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,800
 Right.

1300
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,800
 Right.

1301
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,800
 Yeah.

1302
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:50,920
 Like, somebody will continue the conversation or the conversation will end and either way,

1303
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:54,320
 I feel like that's fine.

1304
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:59,440
 So also the people asking about the next baby, a week after this baby, they're asking about

1305
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,440
 the next baby.

1306
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,440
 I don't know.

1307
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,440
 You're going to pay for it?

1308
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:07,640
 If I have another baby, you're going to pay the bills for that baby?

1309
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,640
 I don't know.

1310
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,640
 I'm reading in chat.

1311
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,640
 Why are you worried about my kids?

1312
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:17,480
 I'm reading in chat saying, "My brother's wedding was just two weeks after I had my son and

1313
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:22,880
 everyone had a comment about not circumcising him.

1314
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:28,280
 And my aunt kept saying, "Well, my husband was, so I'm not going to talk about my kids

1315
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,280
 or husband's penis."

1316
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,280
 Yeah.

1317
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,280
 Yeah.

1318
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:37,120
 Like, it's really like they'll never be able to follow up on their hypothesis.

1319
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,120
 Right?

1320
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,120
 Right.

1321
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:44,360
 They have no medical background idea for this.

1322
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:48,280
 Whatever they're bringing up, they have no factual basis for it at all.

1323
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,520
 You know what could be really funny?

1324
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,080
 Tell them you're having it added on too.

1325
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,040
 I'm extending.

1326
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,040
 Yeah.

1327
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,320
 Tell them you're adding four inches.

1328
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,400
 My baby is going to have a five skin.

1329
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,400
 Exactly.

1330
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:07,800
 We're doing like a chip clip with like fishing weights on it and we're just going to stretch

1331
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,800
 this thing out.

1332
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,480
 It's going to be like the bungs of the rungs of the Notre Dame bell up there.

1333
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,760
 It's going to be like, "Bing-a-lay-lay-lay-lay-lay."

1334
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:18,000
 They're not going to be able to circumcise my kid because it would be a major surgery

1335
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,240
 based on how much they'll be removing.

1336
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,240
 The tip of his cock is going to look like the ladies' lips at Mar-a-Lago.

1337
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:28,680
 What I mean to say is like most people are concerned about it from the sake of like desensitizing

1338
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:32,960
 the children, the kids' penis, or that the person is going to be made fun of or ostracized

1339
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,080
 for not having it done.

1340
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,080
 Right?

1341
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,080
 Right.

1342
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,080
 Right.

1343
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:41,100
 And those people who have that opinion of a child that young are not going to remember

1344
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:46,560
 to check in 15 to 18 years from now to be like, "Hey, how's the fucking going with your

1345
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,560
 kids?"

1346
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,560
 Like they're not...

1347
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:49,960
 How's the head of your kid's dick doing?

1348
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,080
 You can't follow up.

1349
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,520
 You're never going to get an answer to your hypothesis.

1350
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,040
 You're only going off of your own personal shit.

1351
00:56:56,040 --> 00:57:00,600
 So it's just as like, yeah.

1352
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,440
 It's madness that people think...

1353
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:06,000
 Because they go through this with like C-sections versus natural birth and stuff like that.

1354
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:12,640
 The amount of shaming that people do to each other's children and stuff like that.

1355
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,640
 And it just comes from...

1356
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,640
 What does it matter?

1357
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:19,680
 Well, it just comes from people not being confident in their own life decisions.

1358
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,320
 That's what it comes down to.

1359
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,280
 People do not have the confidence to just live in their own decisions and they need

1360
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:29,200
 validation and they need conformity from others to make them feel like, "Oh, I did the right

1361
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,200
 thing."

1362
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,200
 It's like, "Fuck you.

1363
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,200
 You did the right thing for you.

1364
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,440
 That doesn't mean it's the right thing, period."

1365
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,680
 And it's not necessarily the right thing, and you got to learn to live with decisions,

1366
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,680
 man.

1367
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:43,140
 Also, how much happier would everyone be if they just didn't know all this shit about

1368
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:44,140
 everybody else?

1369
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,140
 Oh, for God's sake, yeah.

1370
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:50,400
 I don't even know about anybody else's kid's genitals to live my life.

1371
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,400
 I don't know.

1372
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:56,400
 I think it's important that people realize I fired glowing jism out of my cock earlier

1373
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,400
 this week.

1374
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,400
 I think that's important.

1375
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,400
 No, no.

1376
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,400
 That is important.

1377
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,400
 That's important.

1378
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,400
 No, no.

1379
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,400
 We have carve-outs in these rules.

1380
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,400
 That's it.

1381
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,480
 You should go, "Hey, I don't know if I want to talk about my kid's peace with you right

1382
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,480
 now, but you know what?

1383
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,480
 I was thinking about most people have some form of herpes.

1384
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,880
 What form do you have, and how are you dealing with it?"

1385
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:14,880
 It's true.

1386
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,880
 It's true.

1387
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:16,880
 It's universal, baby.

1388
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:22,040
 Before we get into this, what other aspects of my kid's genitals are you going to want

1389
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:25,720
 to talk about later so we can just knock all these conversations out right now?

1390
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:30,640
 You should be like, "Actually, the truth is I'm teaching a class on circumcision, and

1391
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,800
 I need you to give me $100 right now, or I cannot talk to you about it."

1392
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,800
 Yeah.

1393
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:42,520
 I didn't get him circumcised, but I got him a Prince Albert.

1394
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:46,560
 I'll let him make the choice a couple years later.

1395
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,360
 If he wants to keep it, he's got it.

1396
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,240
 If he wants to get rid of it, he's got a pull tab.

1397
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,240
 He can just click it away.

1398
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,240
 I got a pull tab.

1399
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,240
 He can just yerk.

1400
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,240
 He's got an injector seat.

1401
00:58:54,240 --> 00:59:05,920
 Also, Mrs. Cincy Scoop is saying that people have been following up asking about the birth.

1402
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,080
 How do I convey that that's an incredibly personal moment, so I probably don't want

1403
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,840
 to talk about it?

1404
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:16,240
 You just say that we kept the foreskin, but we clipped his balls, so he's a eunuch.

1405
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:20,800
 He's going to have a lovely singing voice.

1406
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,480
 We were asked to choose.

1407
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:28,840
 We flipped a coin two-face style, like a Batman villain, and just thought, "Well, either we're

1408
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:32,120
 going to give him a circumcision or no nuts."

1409
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,120
 Let's see.

1410
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:37,480
 We were too busy debating how we're going to handle the fact that he was born with three

1411
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:45,040
 buttholes to figure out what we were going to do about his circumcision.

1412
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,040
 My son is essentially a bowling ball.

1413
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,040
 We were mainly worried about his tail.

1414
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:50,200
 My son is essentially a bowling ball with a tail.

1415
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:55,040
 You tell me where to prioritize, lady.

1416
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:02,080
 Well, the half-grown twin in his ass cheek would like a word or two.

1417
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:05,400
 He has a psychic conjoined twin named Quado.

1418
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:10,320
 He's got a Quado in his left butt saddle, so yeah, priorities.

1419
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,840
 We haven't gotten around to the circumcision talk yet.

1420
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:16,760
 Yeah, we're still exercising the ass Quado first.

1421
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:21,200
 Lastly, any tips on how to raise my baby gay?

1422
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,760
 I think you just start engaging in all of these conversations about their genitals.

1423
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:30,280
 I think you just engage with as many people and converse about their genitals as you can,

1424
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,960
 and that's how that works.

1425
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:32,960
 We've been doing our best.

1426
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:33,960
 We have a gay agenda.

1427
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:39,440
 We're trying to raise our kids gay, and believe it or not, they just figure it out on their

1428
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,440
 own.

1429
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,440
 It's the weirdest thing.

1430
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,440
 Yeah.

1431
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,440
 Life finds a way.

1432
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,440
 Life finds a way.

1433
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:48,640
 We have gay porn around the house, we have nothing like our Christmas decorations are

1434
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:53,080
 just like different dirty decks of cards with hot dudes, and we just hang the cards on the

1435
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,080
 Christmas tree.

1436
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,120
 It's not getting it now.

1437
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,640
 Man, they're really getting a full mouthful of it.

1438
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:04,040
 We only serve phallic fruits and vegetables for dinner.

1439
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:10,360
 I heard this really interesting thing, and I may have said this before on the podcast

1440
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:18,280
 show, but we're talking about how a lot of your hardcore religious types want to talk

1441
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:25,200
 about sexuality as a choice, right?

1442
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:31,440
 What this person said was, for them, it is a choice because they've had to choose to

1443
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,920
 repress their natural sexuality their whole life, and they don't realize that it's not

1444
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:36,980
 a choice.

1445
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:38,780
 It's just what you're born with.

1446
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:44,560
 They've had to make the conscientious choice to say no to their instincts, to their basic

1447
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:45,560
 human nature.

1448
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:46,560
 That's an interesting way to look at it.

1449
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:51,280
 They have had to make a choice their whole life, so they see it as everyone has to make

1450
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,840
 this choice, right?

1451
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:54,240
 I made this choice.

1452
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,400
 Everyone must have made this choice somewhere along the lines, like, "No, man.

1453
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,400
 It ain't a choice.

1454
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,960
 It's just the cards you're dealt with," but for those people, they're in that zone.

1455
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:03,960
 They don't understand that it's not a choice.

1456
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,560
 I'm not going down to the fucking bath house.

1457
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,720
 It's not a choice.

1458
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:08,720
 It's just your nature.

1459
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:12,280
 Because I'm choosing every day to not go down to the bath house.

1460
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,280
 Yeah.

1461
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,280
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1462
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:15,280
 But it's just your name.

1463
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,520
 But they don't understand that, and they can't see that, and especially if they've been indoctrinated

1464
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:21,120
 in a very small community that has the whole-

1465
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,120
 That's a good point.

1466
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,120
 That's a good point.

1467
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,800
 I thought that was a really interesting look at it.

1468
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:29,520
 You would think it's a choice because you've had to choose to repress your own nature your

1469
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,520
 entire life.

1470
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:34,200
 Thank you for all the laughs and creating such an awesome community.

1471
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,320
 Murray is still a great name for a baby.

1472
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,320
 It sure as fuck is.

1473
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,440
 I'm going to pass on it because it doesn't work in Portuguese.

1474
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,440
 Okay.

1475
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,600
 Fucking you in the face with a boob full of milk.

1476
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,960
 That's Manu, Mrs. Cincy Scoop.

1477
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:45,960
 Thanks for the update, Manu.

1478
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:46,960
 Congratulations, Manu.

1479
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:47,960
 Yes, congratulations.

1480
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:48,960
 Yes.

1481
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:49,960
 Congratulations, Cincy Scoop.

1482
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:50,960
 Yes.

1483
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:51,960
 Both of you.

1484
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:52,960
 Yes.

1485
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:53,960
 That's wonderful.

1486
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:54,960
 It's time for a little jock-a-versus-a-nerd.

1487
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:55,960
 It's on.

1488
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:56,960
 You want to do a little jock-a-versus-nerd action?

1489
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:57,960
 Oh, am I?

1490
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:58,960
 Fuck yeah.

1491
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:07,360
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1492
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:12,480
 Oh, no.

1493
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,480
 Look at that.

1494
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:19,520
 There's a picture on the Zoom and the Twitch of the little baby Dippin' Dot Manu.

1495
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:20,520
 Baby.

1496
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:21,520
 Oh, that's two.

1497
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,520
 That's so cute.

1498
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:23,840
 Baby Cincy Scoop.

1499
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:29,520
 There's another reason why you should sub up and support the Patreon for as little as

1500
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:30,520
 three bucks a month.

1501
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:31,520
 You can see baby pictures.

1502
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:32,520
 You can come hang out with us.

1503
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,520
 Yeah.

1504
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:38,200
 Oh, we got a scooperty here today from...

1505
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,200
 Wait, wait.

1506
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,200
 Who's it from?

1507
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,000
 There's another note here I want to bring up.

1508
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
 Rebecca in chat.

1509
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
 Oh, yeah.

1510
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
 Go.

1511
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,160
 I had two kids, one in disposable diapers, formula-fed, hospital-born.

1512
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:51,600
 The second kid was born at home, breast-fed and diapered in cloth.

1513
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:52,940
 You wouldn't know.

1514
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:57,040
 They both turned out fine and I'm sorry, people said all this dumb stuff to you.

1515
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:03,520
 That's exactly what we're talking about is that we are the children you are worried about.

1516
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:09,100
 Look at all of us, which ones are formula-fed, which ones have circumcisions, which ones...

1517
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:10,400
 You can't tell.

1518
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,960
 You can't tell.

1519
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:12,960
 Babies survive.

1520
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:17,000
 They find them in freaking dumpsters crap and they all live.

1521
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,440
 Babies are amazingly resilient.

1522
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:25,200
 I put those babies in those dumpsters absolutely with the intention of them dying and they

1523
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,200
 won't.

1524
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,200
 No.

1525
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,200
 And Jacob still walks free.

1526
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,200
 Why?

1527
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,200
 I'm just a prom night dumpster baby.

1528
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,200
 Well, it's because they didn't die.

1529
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,800
 Prom night dumpster baby and I'm taking a stroll.

1530
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:37,800
 Yeah.

1531
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:42,360
 From Scala Wall Scoop, hey you face fucking tit farming socialists.

1532
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:49,240
 I'm gearing up for a trip to New Zealand and thought I'd dive into some Kiwi culture beforehand

1533
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:53,000
 in hopes to hear this New Zealand themed scooperty while on my trip.

1534
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,120
 Apologies to the real New Zealand scoops for what is a tourist take on what I'm sure I'll

1535
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,320
 discover to be a lovely country.

1536
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:05,600
 Definitely less cunty than their neighboring land, mass hole of a continent, and a country

1537
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:06,600
 across the water.

1538
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:10,440
 Now that I've probably insulted two wonderful nations, does that give me honorary American

1539
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,440
 status?

1540
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,440
 See you at the churn.

1541
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,440
 Yes it does.

1542
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,440
 See you at the cone with that talk buddy.

1543
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:27,960
 Let's see, this scooperty is, the categories are Flight of the Concourse, New Zealand cities,

1544
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:30,520
 New Zealand actors, New Zealand director.

1545
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:31,520
 Oh great.

1546
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:37,120
 Let's see, I'll try New Zealand actors for 200.

1547
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:41,540
 This leading man probably wishes that Jurassic Park spared a little more expense.

1548
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:47,320
 Not sure why he went back to that island multiple times, can't be the money.

1549
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:51,520
 I don't know which one of those guys was in all the Jurassic Park movies.

1550
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,520
 Who's from New Zealand?

1551
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:56,960
 Yeah I don't know, is Jeff Goldblum from New Zealand?

1552
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:57,960
 I don't know.

1553
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:58,960
 I don't think so.

1554
01:05:58,960 --> 01:05:59,960
 I guess I'll pass.

1555
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:00,960
 Paul!

1556
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:06,400
 Ah shit, I'm just trying to rack my brain for his name.

1557
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:12,880
 He's in Event Horizon.

1558
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,680
 I just can't, I can't remember his name.

1559
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:15,680
 You remember his name Matt?

1560
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,680
 I have to pass.

1561
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:18,360
 I was thinking of Richard Attenborough, but I don't know if it's Richard Attenborough.

1562
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,480
 Oh it could be Richard Attenborough too.

1563
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,480
 Oh yeah, I guess it could be, I don't know.

1564
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,280
 I'll do Richard Attenborough.

1565
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,280
 Alright.

1566
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:26,280
 Sam Neal.

1567
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:27,280
 That's it.

1568
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,280
 That's the name I could think of.

1569
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,280
 That's the name you could remember Paul.

1570
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,280
 That's the name I could remember.

1571
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:31,280
 Oh Paul, you're up.

1572
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:36,520
 Oh I'm in the hole, I gotta start changing my tactics.

1573
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,280
 I will go New Zealand director.

1574
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,280
 Answer the questions correctly.

1575
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,280
 Or no, I'll go Fly the Concords.

1576
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,000
 Fly the Concords for 200.

1577
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,640
 The Boom King, the Rhymos, the Rhymosaurus.

1578
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,880
 Yeah the Rhymosaurus.

1579
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,720
 And Oscar winning member of the band.

1580
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:56,720
 That is Jermaine.

1581
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,640
 Ah, it was Brett.

1582
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,200
 Brett McKenzie also will accept, Brett.

1583
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,200
 Wait a minute.

1584
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:08,400
 I hung out with those guys every night at the Attenborough French Festival in 2004 and

1585
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,400
 it's so funny.

1586
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,400
 That's amazing.

1587
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,400
 Yeah.

1588
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,400
 They were awesome.

1589
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,400
 They were so funny and so funny.

1590
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,840
 Wait, wasn't, oh no, he's the Hippopotamus.

1591
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:22,480
 Jermaine's the Hippopotamus, not the Rhymosaurus.

1592
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,920
 Well there you go.

1593
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:25,920
 And go my face.

1594
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,120
 I'll try New Zealand cities for 200.

1595
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:36,160
 New Zealand's largest city known as the city of sails, it's home to the Sky Tower.

1596
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,920
 What's the capital of New Zealand?

1597
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,560
 It starts with an A.

1598
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:41,560
 A.

1599
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:42,560
 Isn't it Queensland?

1600
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:43,560
 Eighths?

1601
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,560
 I don't think so.

1602
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,560
 Oh Queensland.

1603
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:46,560
 That's Australia.

1604
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:47,560
 Yeah.

1605
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:58,400
 Oh what the fuck is that city called, I don't know, I can't think of it.

1606
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,120
 Oh wait, this was Matt's turn.

1607
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,120
 What?

1608
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,120
 How's this Matt's turn?

1609
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,560
 I don't know, it says Matt's turn on top.

1610
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:07,040
 Oh, in that case, pass.

1611
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,040
 I don't know.

1612
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,040
 I pass too.

1613
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,040
 Paul.

1614
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,040
 I'll pass.

1615
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:12,040
 Auckland.

1616
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,040
 It wasn't A, you were right.

1617
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,040
 You were on the right path.

1618
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,440
 Yup, that is the city I was trying to think of.

1619
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,880
 The Queensland of New Zealand, Auckland.

1620
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:18,880
 The Auckland.

1621
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:19,880
 Auckland.

1622
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:22,080
 Wait, that was my turn?

1623
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,080
 Okay.

1624
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:24,080
 Alright.

1625
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:27,280
 Oh, it was because of the passing.

1626
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:28,280
 It's my fault.

1627
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,280
 I got confused because of the passing.

1628
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:30,280
 So yeah, that was Matt's.

1629
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:31,280
 I'm playing under protest.

1630
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:32,280
 I quit.

1631
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:33,280
 I'm leaving.

1632
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,560
 Matt is continuing the game under protest.

1633
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:39,080
 I'll go to New Zealand cities for 400, although I didn't get Auckland, so I don't know why

1634
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:42,720
 I'm going to other New Zealand cities, because that's the one that I knew.

1635
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:49,820
 Located on the South Island, this city is nestled between Lake Wakipu, maybe, and the

1636
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:55,120
 snowy peaks of the Remarkables, with a name that hints to the country's British colonial

1637
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,120
 history.

1638
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,120
 Teatimesburg.

1639
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:04,120
 Oh, this is going to be like Queensland or something like that.

1640
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:05,120
 I don't know what it is though.

1641
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,120
 Pass.

1642
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:07,120
 Paul.

1643
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:16,480
 I'll go with London.

1644
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:17,480
 Alright.

1645
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:18,480
 Queenstown.

1646
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,480
 Ah, shit.

1647
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:24,400
 The London of New Zealand.

1648
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:29,480
 You take me to Queenstown.

1649
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:33,560
 I'll do New Zealand director for 800.

1650
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:35,160
 I got to get on the board.

1651
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,160
 Alright.

1652
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:37,160
 Daily Double.

1653
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:38,160
 Oh, man.

1654
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:39,160
 This is where I get redemption.

1655
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:40,960
 Well, this is your opportunity.

1656
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:46,680
 Sadly, we just lost this giant of directing talent to Parkinson's disease, known for his

1657
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:53,960
 great work on Once Were Warriors, The Edge, Along Came a Spider, and the James Bond film

1658
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:59,560
 Die Another Day.

1659
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:09,240
 Oh, Dolly the Sheep.

1660
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,880
 No.

1661
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:17,200
 Shoot.

1662
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:20,320
 I'd give you hints if I had any idea at all.

1663
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:21,320
 I have to pass.

1664
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,320
 I'm sorry.

1665
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,320
 You can't pass.

1666
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:24,320
 It's a Daily Double, dude.

1667
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,320
 Oh, I'll guess Richard Attenborough.

1668
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,360
 Richard Attenborough is correct.

1669
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,360
 It's not.

1670
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:33,360
 Lee Tomohori.

1671
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:40,480
 I knew it was going to be a native name from the Maori, but I didn't, I didn't know.

1672
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,000
 Matt, you're up.

1673
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,480
 God, we are killing this, huh?

1674
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:45,120
 Look at us with our New Zealand knowledge.

1675
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,800
 We know so much about New Zealand.

1676
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:55,040
 Currently, I am winning with zero.

1677
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:58,920
 I will do New Zealand actors for 400, please.

1678
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:00,480
 Okay.

1679
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:05,320
 This actress born in Winnipeg, but raised in New Zealand, shared her Oscar-winning debut

1680
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:11,320
 with fellow Kiwi Cliff Curtis in The Piano and went on to famously play women with powers,

1681
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:14,960
 a mutant and a telepath.

1682
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:18,360
 Okay, pass.

1683
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:21,400
 Okay, that passes to me.

1684
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:26,920
 I watch The Piano at least once a week.

1685
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:30,040
 I actually know this one, Jacob, if you want to pass it to me.

1686
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:35,680
 Well, that's good, because unfortunately, I've never paid attention to the actress from

1687
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:37,720
 New Zealand in The Piano.

1688
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:42,520
 I purposely don't pay attention to her at all while watching The Piano, so I will pass

1689
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:43,520
 as well.

1690
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:44,520
 You just watch Harvey Keitel's Weiner.

1691
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:45,520
 That's right.

1692
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:46,520
 Anna Paquin.

1693
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:47,520
 Anna Paquin.

1694
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,240
 She won that when she was a baby.

1695
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,560
 That was a very young age to win an Oscar.

1696
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:54,680
 She was very, very young to get the Oscar then.

1697
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:55,680
 Yeah.

1698
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,920
 That changes the score completely now.

1699
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,160
 I am still in the lead with zero points.

1700
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:04,400
 Matt is still in second place with negative 200 points, but Paul is now still in third

1701
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,320
 place with negative 1,000 points.

1702
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,320
 It's anyone's game.

1703
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,320
 How am I still negative 1,000?

1704
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,320
 Good grief.

1705
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:10,320
 I don't know, because you lost points.

1706
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,320
 I guess.

1707
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:12,320
 I don't know how these games work.

1708
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,840
 You lost the Daily Double on the New Zealand.

1709
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:15,840
 Oh, that's right.

1710
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:16,840
 On the 800.

1711
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:17,840
 Yeah, that was 800.

1712
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:18,840
 But does it turn to 1,600?

1713
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:19,840
 What?

1714
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:20,840
 No, I guess it wasn't.

1715
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:21,840
 No, you had missed other ones too.

1716
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:22,840
 Oh, okay.

1717
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:23,840
 There you go.

1718
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:24,840
 I'll go to New Zealand Actors for 600.

1719
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:25,840
 Okay.

1720
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:31,080
 Known for her TV success, this actor has starred on iZombie, Once Upon a Time, and most recently,

1721
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,080
 Ghosts.

1722
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:35,840
 An actor by any other name would smell as sweet.

1723
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:36,840
 Okay.

1724
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:37,840
 Rose McGowan.

1725
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:38,840
 Good guess.

1726
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:39,840
 Rose MacGyver.

1727
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:40,840
 Oh, look at that.

1728
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:41,840
 You had three-fourths of it.

1729
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:42,840
 I did.

1730
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:51,840
 I had more of that name than I thought I was going to.

1731
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,440
 I'll do New Zealand Director.

1732
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,440
 What the hell?

1733
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,440
 For 800.

1734
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,440
 What?

1735
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,440
 That's not New Zealand Director?

1736
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,440
 Oh, you said Director.

1737
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:01,440
 I thought you said New Zealand Actor.

1738
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,440
 Sorry.

1739
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:03,440
 This is fine.

1740
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,440
 This young actor has made memorable turns.

1741
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:05,440
 Under protests.

1742
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:06,440
 More protests.

1743
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:07,440
 Yes.

1744
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,440
 So much protest.

1745
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:14,080
 This young actor has made memorable turns in Hunt for the Wilder People, Deadpool 2, and

1746
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,480
 How to Train Your Dragon.

1747
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:20,440
 He shares a name with the famous son of a beetle, not Dennis' son.

1748
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,880
 Uh, I don't know.

1749
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,600
 I'll have to pass.

1750
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,680
 Passes the map.

1751
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:30,800
 Probably Julie and somebody, but I can't tell you who.

1752
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:31,800
 Pass.

1753
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:32,800
 That passes to me.

1754
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:37,040
 Oh, I should have guessed.

1755
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,040
 Can I guess still?

1756
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,040
 Sure.

1757
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,040
 It's my turn, but you can guess.

1758
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:45,200
 I'm going to guess it's Julius Rodman.

1759
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,800
 Just on context clues.

1760
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:47,800
 Great.

1761
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,760
 I'll guess Julius Rodman.

1762
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:50,760
 Motherfucker!

1763
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:51,760
 It's Julian Dennison.

1764
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:52,760
 Oh, there you go.

1765
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:53,760
 Eat shit.

1766
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:54,760
 Matt, you're up.

1767
01:13:54,760 --> 01:14:05,480
 I'll take Dennis Rodman's relatives for 600, please.

1768
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:10,240
 Give me a flight of the concords for 400.

1769
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:15,480
 This fanatic co-star on the series went on to animated series fame as Mabel in Gravity

1770
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:16,480
 Falls.

1771
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:17,480
 Yeah.

1772
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:18,480
 Is this Kristen Schaal?

1773
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:19,480
 Yeah.

1774
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:20,480
 This is Kristen Schaal.

1775
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:21,480
 Oh, okay.

1776
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:22,480
 It sure is.

1777
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:23,480
 It is.

1778
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:24,480
 Nice job.

1779
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:27,280
 Just a legit correct answer for one of these questions.

1780
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:28,280
 It's so refreshing.

1781
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:29,280
 It's a new day.

1782
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,280
 It's me.

1783
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:35,400
 I'll try New Zealand director 200.

1784
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:39,240
 The most famous director to come out of New Zealand, he doesn't know when to quit when

1785
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:43,640
 it comes to hobbits and beetles.

1786
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:45,040
 What the fuck is that guy's name?

1787
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:48,040
 Who did he pass to?

1788
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:50,800
 I pass it to Paul.

1789
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:51,800
 Dennis.

1790
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:52,800
 Peter.

1791
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:53,800
 Peter.

1792
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:54,800
 Pumpkin eater?

1793
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:55,800
 Jackson?

1794
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:56,800
 Is it Jackson?

1795
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:57,800
 Peter Jackson?

1796
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:58,800
 That sounds right.

1797
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,800
 Peter Jackson.

1798
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:00,800
 That's right.

1799
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,800
 Hey, Peter Jackson.

1800
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:02,800
 Peter Pumpkin.

1801
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:03,800
 Two direct answers in a row.

1802
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:06,000
 Those two questions were the only ones I was hunting for.

1803
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,600
 They're the only ones I know I'd do in this category, is looking for Kristen Schaal and

1804
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:10,600
 Peter Jackson.

1805
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:12,600
 You got it.

1806
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:14,560
 Paul.

1807
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,600
 I will do flight of the concords for eight.

1808
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,960
 I got to get on the board.

1809
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:24,960
 This musician is depicted by Jamin Clement, who comes to Brett in several dream sequences

1810
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:29,320
 representing different personas and eras of the artist, even seeing a song named after

1811
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,600
 the musician.

1812
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:37,080
 It's me, Brett, David Bowie from the music video of Ashes to Ashes.

1813
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:38,080
 It's David Bowie.

1814
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:40,120
 David Bowie is correct.

1815
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:42,560
 Three right answers in a row.

1816
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:43,560
 Such a great.

1817
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:44,560
 What are we coming to?

1818
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,640
 I'm the runner for that episode.

1819
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:50,960
 So all right, Matt, let's see if we can make it four right answers in a row.

1820
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:55,980
 You're up for the Concord 600.

1821
01:15:55,980 --> 01:16:01,320
 He is the band's manager who later went on to play a gentleman turned pirate on our flag

1822
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:02,320
 means death.

1823
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,320
 Oh, shoot.

1824
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:06,920
 I know the guy, but I don't know his name.

1825
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:07,920
 He's great.

1826
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:08,920
 Yep.

1827
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:09,920
 Yes, he is.

1828
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:10,920
 He's really funny.

1829
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,160
 You know, really good.

1830
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:17,000
 I don't pass, pass to me.

1831
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,360
 I pass as well.

1832
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:19,360
 Reese Davis.

1833
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:20,360
 Reese Davis.

1834
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:21,360
 Oh, fuck.

1835
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,360
 Reese Darby.

1836
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:27,360
 Fuck my ass.

1837
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:32,180
 He was so sure of himself.

1838
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:33,960
 That was some last name revenge there.

1839
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:39,960
 I was fucking sure I'll go to New Zealand cities for 600 Darby.

1840
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:44,040
 Shit, it's the other daily double.

1841
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:47,200
 And the game is mine.

1842
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:51,360
 Now I just pass, pass, pass with my 200 point victory.

1843
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:52,360
 The capital of New Zealand.

1844
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:56,380
 This city is nicknamed Windy on account of the strong winds of the Cook Strait.

1845
01:16:56,380 --> 01:17:01,320
 Not sure if it's famous for its beef, too.

1846
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:06,960
 I thought Auckland was the capital of New Zealand.

1847
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,000
 Huh.

1848
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:14,960
 Auckland doesn't lend itself to any beef related anything, though.

1849
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,120
 The answer is, it sounds like it's trying to say the name is Chicago, but I don't think

1850
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:20,520
 that the capital city of New Zealand is Chicago.

1851
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:21,520
 Right?

1852
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:22,520
 Capital.

1853
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:29,040
 It'd be really funny if it was, though, and we just didn't know it.

1854
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,560
 I have beef experience.

1855
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:31,560
 Yeah.

1856
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:35,520
 If only I had a little more beef experience.

1857
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:43,840
 I have no idea Auckland, I don't know Wellington beef, Wellington Wellington.

1858
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:48,840
 I don't know how the windy is part of that, but OK, well, I guess it's just windy and

1859
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:49,840
 Wellington.

1860
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:50,840
 Oh, I guess it's windy.

1861
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:51,840
 Well, it's Nick.

1862
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:52,840
 OK.

1863
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:53,840
 Windy Wellington.

1864
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:54,840
 I don't know.

1865
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:55,840
 I dated it.

1866
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:56,840
 Windy Wellington.

1867
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:57,840
 Uh, she was lovely.

1868
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:02,360
 Director for why didn't you marry her 600 because she was disgusted by my uncircumcised penis

1869
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:07,440
 as she ran away was the chip clips on it.

1870
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1871
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:13,520
 This two time Oscar winning director has directed the following women in leading roles.

1872
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:19,000
 Kate Winslet, Meg Ryan, Nicole Kidman, Holly Hunter and Kirsten Dunst.

1873
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:27,520
 Oh, I watched an outtake of the first Spider-Man movie with Kirsten Dunst in it the other day.

1874
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:29,680
 And it was just over and over again.

1875
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:35,040
 This one crowd scene where she's in front of the crowd and the director is just trying

1876
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:38,160
 to get this one extra to stop doing something.

1877
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:39,160
 Yeah.

1878
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:43,920
 Oh, that's every time they'll cut the director over the speaker will be like, great, great,

1879
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:44,920
 great.

1880
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:45,920
 You were doing this.

1881
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:46,920
 Don't do that.

1882
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:47,920
 Kirsten is doing that.

1883
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,160
 So don't do that thing that you're doing.

1884
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:50,160
 Oh man.

1885
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,160
 Let's go again.

1886
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:52,160
 And then they'd go again.

1887
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,160
 And the extra would just do it again.

1888
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,160
 It was great.

1889
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,480
 It says Sam Raimi, right?

1890
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:57,480
 That was Sam Raimi.

1891
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:58,480
 Oh yeah.

1892
01:18:58,480 --> 01:18:59,480
 I guess it would be.

1893
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:02,280
 So I know that director exactly.

1894
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:07,560
 I'm the same here with like the original Spider-Man movie isn't on the, on the category.

1895
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:18,120
 Don't think Sam, Nicole Kidman, uh, Holly Hunter, goodness sakes, um, not to pass passes

1896
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,120
 the mat.

1897
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:25,360
 Uh, it's New Zealand's own Steven Spielberg, sheep fucker.

1898
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:36,960
 Oh, you're using his full name, Steven, New Zealand Berg did Stanley Kubrick direct all

1899
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:37,960
 of these people.

1900
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:38,960
 And does he New Zealand?

1901
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:43,320
 I don't think Kubrick directed Meg Ryan, maybe I'm wrong or, or Kate Winslet.

1902
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,320
 Yeah.

1903
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:45,320
 I don't know.

1904
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:46,320
 Uh, pass.

1905
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:51,000
 I was just about to say it's a lady.

1906
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
 There you go.

1907
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:59,640
 Jane, that's the, uh, you've got mail lady, I think maybe, uh, Matt, you got New Zealand

1908
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:01,440
 cities or New Zealand director.

1909
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,440
 Gosh, I won't know either.

1910
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:08,280
 Um, let's do, uh, luckily you are submitted in first place.

1911
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,280
 Yeah.

1912
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:10,280
 Yeah.

1913
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,500
 I'll do director for 400.

1914
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:17,620
 This actor slash director has lent his talents to both TV and films, notably reservation

1915
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:19,520
 dogs, the Mandalorian.

1916
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:24,280
 Our flag means death and Marvel movies, not to mention his turn as Adolf Hitler.

1917
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:29,400
 Oh, isn't this, uh, take, take Kiwa Titi.

1918
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,400
 That's it.

1919
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,400
 Oh yeah.

1920
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:32,400
 That's right.

1921
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,400
 Take away Titi.

1922
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:34,400
 Yes.

1923
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,400
 I got a last name.

1924
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,400
 Right.

1925
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,400
 I got a last name.

1926
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:38,400
 Right.

1927
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,400
 It's a different, it's a different day.

1928
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:40,400
 Tight.

1929
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,400
 Tight.

1930
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:42,400
 Titi walkies.

1931
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,400
 Tight.

1932
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:44,400
 Tight.

1933
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,400
 Titi walkie.

1934
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:49,680
 Walkie talkie bikini walkie talkie that's who it was.

1935
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:50,680
 Yeah.

1936
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:54,300
 And I'm closing out the category and the game New Zealand cities for 800.

1937
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:58,840
 This is the oldest city in New Zealand and was sadly devastated by earthquakes in 2010

1938
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:00,320
 and 2011.

1939
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:05,400
 Not sure if locals shouted out the town's name in frustration while it happened.

1940
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:06,400
 Still water.

1941
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,400
 Fucker.

1942
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:08,400
 Yeah.

1943
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,400
 Still water.

1944
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:18,000
 Still water.

1945
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,480
 This is bad.

1946
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:30,680
 I come from Aaron air, air, air, air, air towns full edited.

1947
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,960
 I guess I'll pass a Paul.

1948
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,680
 You seem to know this one.

1949
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:41,520
 Uh, uh, shite shite.

1950
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:44,920
 Let's try shite a Christ church.

1951
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:45,920
 Christ church.

1952
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:46,920
 Damn it.

1953
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:52,360
 That's the other city in New Zealand that I knew the name of Christ church on a cracker

1954
01:21:52,360 --> 01:22:00,920
 and there that is the game with 600 Paul is in second with negative 1600 and I'm in third

1955
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:04,880
 with the negative 1800 and that's from Scholar walls scoop.

1956
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:05,880
 Thank you.

1957
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:06,880
 Scholar walls.

1958
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:07,880
 Scoop.

1959
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:10,160
 If you want to send us a scoopity or a price of Skype jock versus nerd or an obelisk jock

1960
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,160
 versus nerd.

1961
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:13,520
 Oh, hold on.

1962
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,520
 Somebody just unmuted themselves.

1963
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:15,520
 Got it.

1964
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:16,520
 Oh, there we go.

1965
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:22,840
 Uh, anyway, if you want to send us any of those jock versus nerds up, you can hear us

1966
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:23,840
 though.

1967
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:24,840
 Can't you?

1968
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:30,160
 Oh, I think I muted 10 scoop and then he tried to unmute himself again or he tried to mute

1969
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:31,160
 himself and unmute himself.

1970
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,160
 I don't know.

1971
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:33,160
 I got it.

1972
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:34,160
 What a mess.

1973
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:35,160
 What a mess.

1974
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:36,160
 Price is right.

1975
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,480
 Obelisk, scooperty, uh, scoop mail.

1976
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:41,280
 Do all those things right over there at haste scoops.com.

1977
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,600
 Go to haste scoops.com.

1978
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:44,140
 You can do all those things.

1979
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:46,720
 We are still running low on those jock versus nerd.

1980
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:50,360
 So head over there, make us some jock versus nerds and send them on in.

1981
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:52,480
 You can see how much we crushed the New Zealand one.

1982
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,760
 So, you know, just pick a topic and knock it out.

1983
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:55,760
 Yeah.

1984
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,680
 We basically know everything about New Zealand.

1985
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:00,400
 Let's get another, let's get another New Zealand quiz in here.

1986
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,000
 Keep them coming guys.

1987
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,480
 All New Zealand all the time.

1988
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:04,480
 Line them up.

1989
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:05,480
 Knock them down.

1990
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,480
 Bam.

1991
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:07,480
 Bam.

1992
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:08,480
 Bam.

1993
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:09,480
 Bam.

1994
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:10,480
 Bam.

1995
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:11,480
 Bam.

1996
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:12,480
 Now we can get into the deep cuts where we can really shine.

1997
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:13,480
 Yeah.

1998
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:14,480
 If we did that same scooperty again, I feel like we'd get as many questions right.

1999
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,600
 I think you'd be pretty close to the same.

2000
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:17,600
 Yes.

2001
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:18,600
 Yeah.

2002
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:19,600
 Yeah.

2003
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:20,600
 Yeah.

2004
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:21,600
 Pretty close.

2005
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:22,600
 But we do sincerely appreciate everyone right again with all their stuff.

2006
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:23,600
 Of course.

2007
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:27,240
 Thank you all so much for, uh, signing up for our Patreon.

2008
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:33,480
 Those of you have, I did a test Patreon hangout trying to learn the ropes on, uh, how to get

2009
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:34,480
 the zoom thing going.

2010
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:35,480
 And I think I did it.

2011
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:39,240
 I'll have to double check with Jacob to talk it out, but I think I got it right.

2012
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:42,320
 Uh, joined my own meeting, but it worked out.

2013
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,320
 So I guess that's how it goes.

2014
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:44,320
 I don't know.

2015
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:45,320
 Is that how it works?

2016
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:46,320
 Yeah.

2017
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:47,320
 Okay.

2018
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:48,320
 Join your own meeting and it pops in.

2019
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:49,320
 Okay.

2020
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:50,320
 Great.

2021
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:51,320
 Yeah.

2022
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:52,320
 So yeah, I did it.

2023
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:53,320
 I figured it out.

2024
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:54,320
 I got the list from the, from the thing.

2025
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,320
 And yeah.

2026
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:57,120
 So anyway, yeah, we got some more fun stuff coming up.

2027
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:00,360
 And uh, please join in, support us if you can.

2028
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:04,600
 If you can't support us financially currently understood, but please don't forget about

2029
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:05,680
 the obelisk scheme.

2030
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:09,160
 Just tell one person and one person only about the podcast.

2031
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:13,800
 Someone you think would actually enjoy hearing about my glow in the dark jizz and then see

2032
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:19,880
 if they would like to listen to this podcast ever again, ever, uh, chances are they won't,

2033
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:25,460
 but you know, Hey, but if the answer is maybe, if the answer is maybe, give it a shot, man.

2034
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:26,460
 That's exactly.

2035
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:27,960
 That's how we get our scoops for life.

2036
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:32,960
 But anyway, we really appreciate all of your help, uh, both financial and emotional.

2037
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:38,000
 It's wonderful to, to, to have all of you listening out there and uh, yeah, we're pleased

2038
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
 that you're listening.

2039
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:43,640
 Oh, lemur, screamer, creamer in the chat, uh, Lord, there were no Lord questions and

2040
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:46,320
 lemur, screamer, creamer is sad that there were no Lord questions.

2041
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:47,320
 I am too.

2042
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:49,280
 I knew Lord was from New Zealand guys.

2043
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:52,640
 I might've gotten a Lord question time for another New Zealand quiz.

2044
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:53,640
 Let's go.

2045
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:54,640
 Get on it.

2046
01:24:54,640 --> 01:25:03,760
 New Zealand, all Lord Lord, just make Lord the answer to every one.

2047
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:09,680
 I want to thank everyone who supports us over on our Patreon page, uh, right now.

2048
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:14,080
 Some folks have just simply gone from the JLR level to the $3 level, just to, just to

2049
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,520
 go with the rising costs.

2050
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:16,520
 We appreciate that.

2051
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:21,440
 Other people who signed up for the first time, uh, we even got a new ice cream truck driver.

2052
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,760
 Oh man, that's immense.

2053
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:24,760
 Yes.

2054
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:28,120
 Um, so, uh, thank you all for, for doing that so much.

2055
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:29,120
 We really appreciate it.

2056
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:34,040
 Um, if you want to support our podcast and you have it within your budget to do so, pick

2057
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:37,000
 out a tier that fits your budget over at preachingfun.com.

2058
01:25:53,760 --> 01:26:13,560
, or if we didn't talk about Paul's jizz as much as you expected us to today, head on over to fartsinabag.biz.

2059
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:17,680
 Let's give them something to talk about.

2060
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:19,960
 That's fartsinabag.biz that along with preachingfun.com.

2061
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:24,080
 It takes you over to our Patreon page where for as little as $3 a month, you can help

2062
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,400
 keep this show on the air.

2063
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:26,400
 That's right.

2064
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:30,320
 If you think the show is worth more than $3 a month, uh, don't go there, or no wait, do

2065
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:31,320
 go there.

2066
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:32,320
 Do go there.

2067
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,320
 If you think the show is worth more than $3 a month.

2068
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,320
 Yes.

2069
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:38,320
 If you think the show is worth less than $3 a month, don't even bother.

2070
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,760
 And also we get it.

2071
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:40,760
 Yes.

2072
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:41,760

01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:42,760
 Stay safe out there.

2074
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:43,760
 We love you and we'll see you soon.

2075
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:52,400
 We'll see you at the cone.

2076
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:57,880
 At the cone we don't talk about us, the people's kids and their dips.

2077
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:17,760
 See ya!
