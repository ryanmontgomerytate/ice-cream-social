00:01:54,220 --> 00:02:09,620
 Anyway, you were gonna say something and you're like wait, I'll save it for air. Oh, I was talking about

18
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:15,560
 The new spawn universe comic book that just came out

19
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,240
 Called I saw Santa

20
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,280
 It's a two-parter. It was very holiday themed. It's wild

21
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,520
 It's a wild fucking book. So Santa Claus is doing his thing

22
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,600
 magical shit, you know and

23
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,060
 He runs into this kid

24
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,440
 Who basically booby traps?

25
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,600
 his house

26
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
 To kill Santa. Oh

27
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,120
 He's gonna catch and kill Santa

28
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,800
 All right, and Santa has to deal with this kid and then it's this whole

29
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,400
 story of how this kid gets away and

30
00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:00,060
 Becoming Santa is like trying to kill kids or is it said it's just being Santa Santa's just being Santa and this evil child

31
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,520
 has tried to kill Santa and

32
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:11,780
 Being Santa and this kid thinks he's at a home alone movie, but not not just a home alone movie. He's a bastard

33
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,600
 He's like he's like Santa. Why didn't you give me the one thing?

34
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,240
 I wanted and he's like I just you're you're five or whatever. You're six or whatever

35
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:27,180
 And he's like all I ever asked for is a bone saw and and and he's like

36
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,480
 I'm sorry. You've not been you've not been behaving well and this kind of thing and he's like

37
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,240
 No, you ever give me his coal and he has this wagon full of coal and he sets it on fire

38
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,100
 And he kicks it over and he sets his whole house on fire and he's killing his

39
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,200
 You bring up a good point Paul. I'm glad you bring this is this is our

40
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,800
 New Year's episode our post Chris Bosh episode and you bring up an excellent point

41
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:57,000
 I've always been confused my whole life when I was a child now. I've always been confused

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,440
 Why does Santa bring coal to the bad kids? The bad kids are going to start a fire. Yes, they're bad kids

43
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,680
 You're giving them coal. You're absolutely right. He literally added fuel to their fire

44
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:15,060
 Coal is delicious. It's delicious. Right, right. We don't talk about that. Well

45
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,960
 Just like I've learned in that latest

46
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:24,760
 Or one of the most recent last podcast on the last last lot podcast on the left episodes

47
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,040
 Hey, Paul, let's go back to one buddy. Let's start it over. Okay. Yeah, we're gonna edit that out

48
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,120
 Just like I wormed on the blast hotline on assess paper

49
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,240
 That was closer that was closer buddy

50
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:41,800
 We're gonna do it one more time as I just experienced in the SAS POM on harsh harem bin. I was tired of fear

51
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:51,080
 No, fuck this is gonna save us a ton and overdubbing costs no last podcast just had a whole thing about chimney sweeps and

52
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:56,440
 Of course, they are covered in coal dust and soot and soot

53
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,960
 Even more dangerous than coal more combustible. That's why they had to have chimney sweeps

54
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:10,480
 Japanese would light on fire. Yeah, so these kids were covered head to foot in soot and

55
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:17,320
 People they were smoking what like two packs a day easy packs a day easy

56
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,440
 People thought that they had great dental hygiene for some reason

57
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,320
 simply because

58
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,960
 When they would smile the contrast exactly. Oh

59
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,340
 And so people had all these myths around oh what well chimney sweeps must know what would be what to keep your teeth

60
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:43,200
 What in it and no, of course not? I'm sorry, sir. I didn't understand what you said. Look we want him sweeps

61
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,440
 Right now you've been going up and down up and down Bob's you're right. We'll get your thing clean taking a suit

62
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:54,680
 I come out. Give me a grin boom boom boom sparkly sparkly. I'm thinking all right, but the first mr. Pipples died, right?

63
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:01,760
 Well, he died, but he didn't leave let me tell you what he left a little bit of a DNA

64
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:08,400
 Little ribonucleic acid met and I'll got that motherfucker on lock for the next 1500 years

65
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,160
 Burying a tomb with me you will be

66
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:20,140
 Well, there you go wait so like I remember this I've still seen like there's like the like the more of the

67
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,880
 If you don't like fluoride, you know and and Robert Kennedy has taught me not to

68
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,880
 Yeah, clearly he's he's the one to take advice from you see

69
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,280
 You see

70
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,520
 Charcoal-based toothpastes and right super. I think that is holdover. I think I think that's a holdover

71
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,480
 I think so because it doesn't make any damn sense. You could do the same thing with the power of pumice

72
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,280
 I guess fuck if I know you know, just that's what I do with my teeth

73
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,760
 I take a pumice stone and just take a bar take a bar of lava soap

74
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,480
 I

75
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:05,880
 Remember watching the passage of time in his tooth shrinkage. I remember watching someone on tik-tok. Oh man back then I such long teeth

76
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:11,720
 I remember we were talking about she was using it was really long in the tooth. She was using magic erasers

77
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,880
 She started using magic erasers on her teeth

78
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:22,640
 Because she's like well, I think the principles the same and I sure she she kept posting for like a week and then she stopped

79
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,760
 I think she probably did she probably did a reprobable harm to her teeth. Yeah

80
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,040
 Or just poisoners

81
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:37,080
 With like gum cancer and stuff microplastic. Oh my god. If you guys heard that joke from it

82
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,160
 I don't I tear my fault by the way. I want to made this bit another one like creeped out right now, but I don't know

83
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,960
 I don't I don't know the comedian. I did it to myself

84
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:50,140
 It's terrible that I can't remember the comedian, but he says, oh, yeah, you know

85
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,080
 Microplastics are in everything now, right?

86
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:58,800
 Mike there's microplastics in semen detectable levels of microplastics in semen

87
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,240
 Mm-hmm, and he's like even lower even even billionaires

88
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,720
 Even billionaires have detectable levels of microplastics in their semen and he's like that's not good

89
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,240
 Kids eat that

90
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,640
 Oh

91
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:32,120
 This made me laugh and laugh and laugh yeah, yeah, it's a great joke. It's a great joke

92
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,980
 It is a good joke. So yeah, we're all we're all dying with

93
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,640
 Poison in ourselves, but yeah, I don't know

94
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:46,200
 It's all that's a big way the spawn book. I don't want to spoil it because it turns out really cool

95
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,880
 But it's he's basically Santa Claus in the second book

96
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:57,160
 you go and you see he's in his workshop and his study has become a

97
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,760
 Charlie from always sunny

98
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,080
 Maps and you know

99
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:11,160
 Yes, the conspiracy room because this kid has gone on to murder people every Christmas and

100
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,720
 Santa

101
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,720
 being and a

102
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:22,280
 Creature of the spawn and not last pet cast on the left, right? I'm talking about spawn now. I'm back on spawn

103
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:27,880
 So guys from last podcast on the left have gone on to murder someone every Christmas

104
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,280
 So Santa is within this is within the spawn realm. And so

105
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,880
 Santa Claus

106
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,280
 He tried to call 9-1-1 when he he ended up at a murder scene

107
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:46,800
 That this kid had set up for him, you know, yeah, and of course, they don't hear him because he's Santa Claus

108
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,960
 he's magical and so he grabbed a speaking spell to try and type out help and

109
00:09:52,960 --> 00:10:00,320
 Make it, you know say the thing so he could guess but he didn't get it in time and he got whisked back up

110
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:07,440
 And it's just it's a it's a really interesting well-done story and the end the ending is quite satisfying and interesting, too

111
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,500
 so I would highly recommend if any of you are into a little bit of gore a little bit of

112
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,180
 Creepy gore for your Halloween or Christmas

113
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:25,760
 As happy as an ending as any any spawn book yes, and how much plastic isn't that happy ending

114
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,320
 Ask the children, okay

115
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Ask the children

116
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:40,320
 Minor don't someone minor don't think of the children double poly mylar bag. So quite a bit of plastic smart smart

117
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:48,000
 Yeah, Matt you have a whole rock band in your house now I do I do yeah

118
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,440
 you did it to yourself you idiot you did the thing that uncles do to

119
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,440
 Other families. I did I am my brother with this for years

120
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, so my

121
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,020
 one can actually already had a drum kit for his

122
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:09,960
 His birthday, so we just he just he wanted an extra splashy crashy

123
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,880
 Symbol he wanted a splash symbol

124
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,360
 and so he got it he got us he got himself a nice symbol for for

125
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:25,860
 Have you discovered the the indoor like basically the practice symbols that are mute symbols yet

126
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,740
 There you know the ones that come with the original kiss the kids kits

127
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:36,880
 They have like a bunch of holes in them, so they still make a noise, but they're not like crazy loud. Oh, that's okay

128
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,680
 That's that's getting closer to them. We have we have mute symbols in our rehearsal our rehearsal room at the house here

129
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,640
 Yeah, yeah, they're metal symbols. They've got a fuck ton of holes drilled in them

130
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,040
 Yeah

131
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,960
 You can hit them as hard as you want and and they don't just deafen you because you're in a regular sized room right and so

132
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,060
 That my kid was that was not enough for my kid, and so he asked for a deafening symbol and got it good

133
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:03,280
 He was like oh, I make so much noise. It was just flashing. I was pretty sure that

134
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:09,400
 Where I come from the mute symbol is a slash through a speakers

135
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,500
 Yeah, that's we got one of those and he hits that he hits that and it's sponge

136
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,700
 So just because he just taps it with a drumstick and then that's that

137
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,800
 Symbols when he hits it it takes out all the sound for all of the drums

138
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,880
 And then they can't hit they can't hit it again. He's got to hit it hit it twice

139
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,000
 Twice

140
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,860
 Yes, that's same same band bossy

141
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:43,920
 What is it zell zell jan or whatever it's zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill

142
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:51,640
 Yeah, no, you spend say it some more you spend a zill gin on that well his his grandmother spend a zill gin on that whoa

143
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,160
 That's a real that's a real symbol. I think I think she's great on the x-files

144
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:04,020
 Zill gin and she's the other son. Yeah

145
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,900
 Do you think her and scully really did in real life her? I hope so

146
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:15,960
 But it's my youngest her and scully is my cup of tea her and Mulder whatever but if it was her and scully

147
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,360
 Whoa, don't be your pleasure. Don't be your fun

148
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,720
 She's scully when you just make a stupid sex joke

149
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,600
 And then Paul goes all nerd and gets horny on it. I

150
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:33,580
 Apologize Paul. What happens on page eight of the spawn book you describe detail. She gets scully fucked

151
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:47,960
 But my youngest he started taking electric guitar lessons over at the old school of rock

152
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,960
 And at home in an acoustic guitar and he was like, nope

153
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,200
 This shall not stand

154
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,520
 Dad I'm I was put on this earth thrash

155
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:05,780
 Play coffee houses. That's right a little more Dave Mustaine a little less John Denver, huh? All right

156
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:10,360
 So he's left-handed is a Southpaw. Have we discussed this on air? Oh

157
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,440
 Have we talked about this on air? I

158
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,200
 Feel like we must have but yeah, you're your youngest is a lefty

159
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:24,240
 That's an original less poor Southpaw with a sunburst finish Jimmy bitch. Would you look at that guitar? I don't even play that guitar

160
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,480
 No, no, no, no, put it down put it down put it down. Leave it low lately

161
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:36,280
 Youngest are you doing a Taylor Sheridan monologue? That is a classic bit from an old

162
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,520
 teaching

163
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,600
 That I have clearly

164
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:48,460
 Had yeah when I was a kid, yeah, it's useful useful Bozzie in the chat knows where this is going. So we started

165
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:55,640
 Giving him lessons and they try to teach him initially school of rock try to teach him right-handed. Oh

166
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:05,380
 So that's the that's the that's the easy easier thing to do and so what happens is that basically if kids are remotely ambidextrous

167
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:11,640
 Okay, the world is much easier for right-handed guitar player wherever they go. They'll have a right-handed guitar player

168
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,380
 right-handed guitar that kind of stuff and

169
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,160
 Most people like it's just it's just a one-to-one

170
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,480
 Kind of a easier to teach or whatever

171
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,360
 but and we wanted to have him go off to the school of rock to do it there before we committed to buying him anything because

172
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,160
 we want to make sure that he really liked it and you know, whatever just you know, and

173
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:35,320
 After the first lesson the instructor came out and goes well, we learned a couple things today

174
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,320
 I was what's that? He goes you sounds pretty good. He goes and

175
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,960
 He's definitely left-handed. He is left-handed. There's no

176
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:50,160
 There's no teaching him right-handed I said, okay, you guys have left-handed guitars here they go we do we do we can teach him

177
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
 I'll tell the guitars. I said, okay

178
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,480
 So then you know, we're gonna go now now he's into it

179
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,120
 He's been into it for a while. And so we're gonna actually gonna get him a guitar for him to play at home

180
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:05,080
 So we go over to guitar center and I walked up to and turned out the lessons booth

181
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,520
 I thought those customer service booth was a lessons booth. Ah, and I said

182
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:14,000
 Yeah guitar center doesn't really have a customer service booth. No, they sure don't Jacob

183
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,120
 You should go to a different store

184
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:25,760
 And I said, uh, I'm looking for a guitar for like a left-handed guitar and he goes did you start teaching him?

185
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,760
 Yes, did you start teaching him?

186
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,520
 Same opinion

187
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:36,840
 And I said, oh, I've been extra so much easier for the rest of his life. If he learns righty one thing

188
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,840
 He even had a substitute teacher

189
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,440
 for his guitar lesson at School of Rock and

190
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,000
 The guy was like again like and now he's like a month's of lessons in and the guy's like you

191
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,520
 really think about learning how to play right-handed guitar because if you ever had a party and someone busts out a guitar and

192
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:58,240
 You play left-handed guitar. You can't you can't play or whatever and then he came home and told us a story and my wife

193
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,600
 And I were furious

194
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,480
 Yes, I said, do you know what you should say back to that person when you if you should you have him again?

195
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:11,120
 It is like my kids like what I was like tell him Kurt Cobain Paul McCartney Jimmy Hendrix

196
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,120
 That's a you that's what you say back to him

197
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:22,500
 People it turns out are able to play the guitar. Yeah, they can they can make their way they can struggle through somehow

198
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,520
 I'm willing to bet if he gets good enough. He's gonna have that guitar with him at that party

199
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,400
 Right and or you know if you actually get skilled enough like Jimmy Hendrix actually would take a right-handed turn

200
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:39,320
 Just flip it upside down and play it. Yes. I told Matt the move is you learn how to play guitar

201
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,080
 Like he just learned how to play guitar as he's doing now as it gets good enough

202
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,520
 He'll be able to flip it in his head and then he will just be able to take a

203
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,800
 Regular guitar and flip it over at a party. It's a fucking power move

204
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,360
 Yeah, you know, the only the bag is the pickups and stuff on the top

205
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,580
 But I think if you're if you're if you're an artist, you're I think you like all that stuff

206
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,760
 You like like you like trying to navigate that stuff

207
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,880
 But anyways, I don't care about any of that. And so so guitar center it would turn out the guy was like

208
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,440
 Oh, I just teach lessons here. You got to find the salesman anyway, and so I said, okay

209
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,560
 And I found a salesman of roaming luckily. We don't have a booth where they hang out

210
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,000
 Yeah

211
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 They just they just roam and I found a guy roaming and they're kind of dressed the same way that everybody else at the store is

212
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 Dressed anyway, they just have longer hair. That's that's what gets them away

213
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,600
 The teachers have the longer hair than the sales force. No, no the my guitar centers

214
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,880
 There's just you know, people who work there are just around the floor just walking around

215
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:39,240
 But they look like they look like every other dude shopping there. They don't use it's really hard to figure out who works there

216
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,640
 Yes, so we found the guy you get approached all the time, right? Jacob

217
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:50,460
 Hey, man, you helped me out. You're you're you're basically like wearing a red shirt at Target

218
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,160
 The bad thing is I usually know the answer. Yeah

219
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,000
 It's usually easier to just be like, yeah, it's it's it's something. Yeah

220
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,120
 Yeah

221
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,120
 so I I

222
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,800
 Found a guy and I was like you have any left-handed guitars because oh jeez

223
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:14,120
 Here we go

224
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:21,160
 No one can keep this opinion to themselves. He's like he's like we don't really like there's not like a section for it

225
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,600
 So you have to walk around and just kind of find one and so we're playing this game. We're walking around

226
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,960
 And

227
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:37,560
 It's the only one like I can't go to like guitar world, right? Like there's no yeah, like I have no competitor. I can't

228
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:43,560
 And you're trying to be like I'm trying to not shop online, right? I'm trying to like I'm trying to shop

229
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,120
 You're trying to brick and mortar it you're trying to be a good guy

230
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:53,960
 Yeah, I'm trying to be the one is this the one inside the center. Yeah town square. Yeah town square. I know it well and

231
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,680
 So it's like there's one

232
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,260
 There's one and then I'm realizing I'm looking at it and like

233
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:09,420
 On electric guitars the the was it not the frets. What's the we what's the things you turn to tune the tuners the tuning?

234
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:16,320
 Yeah, the knobs. Yeah the knobs the tuning knobs, you know on an acoustic guitar. There's three and three on each side, right?

235
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,840
 Oh, you mean the the the tuning

236
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,760
 Shit now I can't think of the word

237
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:30,960
 Stretchers yeah, those guitar string stretcher. Thanks. Thanks. Oh, that's a whole different thing

238
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,880
 Yeah, so it is so this guitar teacher's trying to pay all he's old enough

239
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,880
 Circles in circles, I'm left-handed when it comes to pegging

240
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:48,680
 Left-cheek dominant. Yes, it used to hold the top of the headboard is your left hand when you're getting

241
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,240
 Yeah, that's well cuz it's cuz that cuz I loop I loop one leg around

242
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:01,400
 You'd be surprised. I can actually you know, what do you think happen to that old hip? I can pretzel up a little bit

243
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:12,440
 She said she no she does she we got code she looks at me and she give me a wink

244
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,840
 She'd be like you ready to get mr. Salty with it

245
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 That's how she that's how she rolls

246
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:31,960
 Well back to the story about my ten-year-old, thank you. Oh is it 10 now he's 10 I

247
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:37,280
 Know too old for most billionaires, but um count things

248
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:46,720
 So I'm realizing that the the pegs on these left-handed guitars that it's it's arbitrary and some of them the pegs are on the right

249
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,360
 Of the guitar, right? Oh

250
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:55,880
 So they just choose to string like two guitars left-handed and they choose to string the rest

251
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:02,420
 Right-handed and that's that and that's the end of the game. So shopping for a quote-unquote left-handed guitar is really just about

252
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:06,820
 Stringing them right? Yeah, is that right? I guess that's right

253
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:12,920
 This is what I mean. You yeah you get into like some of some other minutiae and stuff

254
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,460
 But you can definitely just do that. You can just string a guitar up to Z down Z

255
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,320
 Yes. Yeah. Yeah now I'm thinking about it

256
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:26,240
 Yeah, cuz the two the two left-handed guitars we found one the pegs were on the right side one on the left side

257
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,080
 It's just about you know, but you still but then but then it's it's a bet. So it's not about the frets

258
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,080
 It's about that where the knobs are

259
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,200
 Right you want the knobs on the bottom

260
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,920
 So once I realized it was about the the like all the other little things you have electric guitar that are on the physical

261
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,000
 Instrument you want that below the strings and not on top of the strings when you're right. I

262
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:50,560
 Was like, oh now now I see but I was looking at the shopping just got a lot easier. Yeah. Yeah

263
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,160
 So he's trying out a couple things

264
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,820
 I finally grab a right-handed guitar that looks good and I let it just go like here just put the strings on this one

265
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,420
 and we'll find out if they make a left-handed version of it, yeah or whatever and

266
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,400
 and and so

267
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,880
 Basically a beginner's

268
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,200
 Stratocaster called Squire. It's made by the Stratocaster. Oh sure. Yeah. Yeah

269
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,280
 That's been around for a long time and and it's a little more expensive than like a total starter guitar

270
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,740
 But it's not as expensive as some crazy electric guitars, right? And so

271
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:27,080
 He gets it. He goes. Oh, I like this a lot and he's really nice playing around with it. And so

272
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:35,360
 We go online guitar center. They have a left-handed version in inventory. We should be able to pick it up by Christmas

273
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,800
 great and

274
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:43,540
 Then we get notices or other kids concert. We're getting email notices that it's on backorder won't be there before Christmas

275
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,040
 Oh

276
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:51,840
 Okay, listen the story it's about to make me a terrible person, okay

277
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,400
 We're in the middle of it is the holidays we're in the middle of my oldest kids Christmas concert

278
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,600
 So we don't want to handle this right now, but I go ahead and open up Amazon

279
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,680
 Look for left-handed guitars

280
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,520
 Squire Stratocaster I was gonna say now, you know the making model

281
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,040
 It can be delivered to my house tomorrow

282
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,840
 Yep, I was like, sorry guitar center and then

283
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:25,520
 Boop done cancel the order guitar center and and gave gave gave more plastic to that seaman monster

284
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:31,520
 Jeff Bezos and yeah, and then my kids playing an awesome guitar downstairs

285
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:38,800
 If you're quiet right now we can we can hear Matt's youngest playing the guitar in the distance

286
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,440
 Well, I tell you what's neat about school of rock is that they teach him rock songs right away

287
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,720
 Oh

288
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,720
 Yeah, no, they make it so much fun

289
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,120
 Yeah

290
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,200
 And so my kids just playing songs like it's just like he's already just off just playing like tunes

291
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,240
 And so it's like it's actually really fun to have in the house

292
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,020
 And my oldest son was like let's go out in the garage and jam and I was like he just

293
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:03,520
 Got a good car. He doesn't know how to tune it yet. He doesn't do it. I don't cares. Yeah

294
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:10,560
 Let's go time to jam you time to jam you just triggered a memory. I meant to talked about this a couple weeks ago

295
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,720
 I forgot. Yeah, so Anne and I were going to the local Walmart

296
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,520
 this was two weeks ago, maybe not even and

297
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:25,320
 We had snow flurries coming down. So there was a dusting. It was early in the snowfall

298
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,240
 Right before things really got kind of hairy

299
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,920
 We're heading up towards the Walmart and as some of you may know

300
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:38,720
 Walmart allows for the Salvation Army to post up at their doors

301
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,440
 Okay, with their cat the bell guys. Yes

302
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:49,080
 On this day the bell guys had been replaced with a band

303
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,920
 Okay

304
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,640
 This a bell band no

305
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,440
 these were

306
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,360
 people playing

307
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,360
 wood instruments horns

308
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,120
 Okay. Yeah, and

309
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,960
 as we got out of the car

310
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,760
 Walking towards the thing they were

311
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,360
 warming up

312
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,360
 and it was and I was like

313
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:21,440
 And I was like who the fuck is skinning that cat it was

314
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,320
 Atrocious

315
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:31,400
 Atrocious but but hilariously bad like so bad. You're just like this can't be real and

316
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,360
 then

317
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,540
 Sir, and they go one two, three four

318
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:54,040
 Paul you're gonna get us demonetized

319
00:26:54,040 --> 00:27:00,160
 We go inside we walk inside and I'm just looking at and we are giggling our asses off

320
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,080
 idiots because we

321
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:10,920
 Stop it and I'm just losing my shit and we get inside and she's like what the fuck was that and I go

322
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,720
 That was Mariah Carey's all I want for Christmas

323
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,960
 Fuck you was not

324
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,880
 It fucking was I hear that song on loop in Target eight day eight times a day

325
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:29,600
 That was what they were trying to play. Fuck you bullshit. That is not what was asked. That is that sounds like they successfully played it

326
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,640
 Oh my god, it was so and then as we were coming out

327
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,940
 They were doing another one and it was just as horrendous and we get in the car. She's like

328
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,520
 They must have been special needs

329
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,480
 That were there for the Salvation Army

330
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:54,880
 I'm like, I don't know. I don't know. Let's say let's say fine. It was fine. But holy shit. I

331
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,040
 Just like it was

332
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:05,600
 Unbelievable. I wish I wish I had the temerity to have I think there's probably more than Salvation Navy than the salvation

333
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:12,300
 I should have sucked it up. It was maybe I've been like I'm gonna give this bigoted rat fuck organization a dollar

334
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:19,760
 Just so I can videotape some of this ear fuckery that is going on right here because it was maniacal

335
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,440
 maniacal the sounds that were coming out of these instruments and

336
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:30,520
 We were beside ourselves like how did how who who said yes who said yes

337
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:36,080
 I know it was it was my tongue with the bell ringers of people. I'd be like, you know that organization

338
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:43,280
 Sponsors female castration in other countries, right? Right. No, please do not ever donate anything to the Salvation Army

339
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,320
 They are garbage people. It's a garbage organization

340
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,080
 But yeah, but I would have told that band I think

341
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,320
 Yeah

342
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,320
 It was out

343
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,240
 rages

344
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,240
 It was outrageous

345
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:04,340
 I'll tell you who else really got in the holiday spirit walking into Walmart the other day

346
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:10,840
 And that's the following sponsor a squirrels guide to breaking and entering Paul's basement. That's right

347
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:16,800
 That's from 2025 cup of scoop get the squirrels guide to breaking and entering Paul's basement

348
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,440
 Hello. I am how you say a squirrel. I

349
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,960
 Am wanting to get warm, but I am cold

350
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:34,120
 So I am thinking hey, I will break into someone's ass and still they're warm. And so what I do I

351
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,560
 Get into the basement

352
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,920
 which is a

353
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,720
 fully furnished and as they say in the human circles

354
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:52,640
 Finished is a finished basement. Okay. I'm not I am NOT in Finland. It is a finished basement

355
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,440
 I go inside and I find a hole and I

356
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:04,960
 Squirreling, you know how you do a squirrel into the squirrel hole. He's slowly becoming Louisiana

357
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:11,960
 And it's it's a slow transition here I go into we get him into the squirrel or

358
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:20,520
 And I'm inside and suddenly I am there and I am warm and I am looking for a few

359
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,920
 It there is no

360
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,080
 There is only spiders

361
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,640
 Just a spider

362
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:35,800
 That is it and I don't want to eat spiders. So then someone puts a nut roll in a cage. I

363
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,960
 cannot resist

364
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:45,560
 Go and I eat a nut roll. But then the tello then the cage it closed

365
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,800
 And I am in traffic. Oh

366
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,760
 No, and

367
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,400
 My balls stick out of the cage because I have huge squirrel nuts

368
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,520
 and

369
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,200
 There it is. I am trapped

370
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,320
 like a squirrel

371
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,000
 Then I am set free back into mother nature

372
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:14,360
 To look and cry at the trees. I must now inhabit it

373
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,600
 instead of the warm

374
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,080
 basement

375
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,040
 But if you stay in the tree long enough, it gets warm

376
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:33,060
 Enter a scoops to check out despite all his rage. He's still just a squirrel a nut roll in the cage. It's true

377
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:37,360
 We are all that nut roll

378
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:46,040
 So when we leave town we usually have friends stay at the house and then house sit for us and everything

379
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:53,800
 Yes, they watch the dogs. We have we have several friends that we enlist to do this

380
00:31:53,800 --> 00:32:00,600
 Have roommates or whatever and yeah, they come they come stay at the house. They watch the dogs. They have a good time

381
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,160
 Whatever this last time when we left

382
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:10,360
 Is the holidays and so all of our friends had shit to do all of our friends that usually come and house sit for us

383
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:15,560
 They all had shit to do so they didn't stay at the house. You're gonna have so we hired a

384
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:22,880
 Professional we had we had multiple friends recommend this professional house sitter to us and she works

385
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:29,880
 She's she is a solo and she's from a service or she's a solo house watcher

386
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,480
 She is a solo house watcher. She is not from a service

387
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:40,080
 So she must work on just recommendations. All they then how does I believe size? How does one advertise? I will I will watch your house

388
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:47,320
 Trust me. It's a trust me. I believe she works entirely on word-of-mouth. I believe it is entirely an obelisk scheme and

389
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,520
 she also works in a

390
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:56,360
 Vet she works in a veterinary clinic and so she is a she's good with pets

391
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,940
 She's good with pets and she's more than just a like she doesn't just do

392
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:08,360
 You know civilian work in the veterinary clinic. She works with with the medicine and works with the animals and everything

393
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,720
 Does she do surgeries? I think she assists

394
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:19,560
 So I think she's kind of like the veterinary version of a just cysts. I think so. Yeah just cysts

395
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:26,840
 And not even removal placement just placement. That's the fucked-up thing people want that now

396
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:33,120
 They're asking can you make my Sharpe look more like a Frenchie? That's right. Can you just jam his head full of sis?

397
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:39,720
 Just cyst it up. Ain't no plans for sure Myra. Paul. How old are you picturing this person that Jacob's hiring?

398
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,440

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,400

 She's had to fend off home invasions a couple of times that's unsettling

409
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:38,380
 Just once I can leave you with the PTSD. Oh, this is a 29 year old

410
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:42,200

414
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,740
 I call out names and if they don't respond quick enough, it's a 22 right to the esophagus

415
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:13,740
 I don't I don't take it. I don't take a chance

 Just walking around whistling this tune from the good the bad and the ugly

432
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,760
 Hi, nice to meet you. My name's pts, Diana

433
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:51,880
 Did she did she have to come over the house

434
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:57,960
 To like be in the house to be with you guys before she before she watched the house. She did she did how

435
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:04,720
 Dogs your dogs usually go after the new ones. So did your dogs go nuts when she came in?

436
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:10,600
 They they go nuts a lot less than they than they did when they were younger these days anyway, right?

437
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,880
 Also, you certainly condition them. You're like look we have people over kids. There are people coming by

438
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,360
 Does she get her get her scent all on him I

439
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,740
 Didn't notice her

440
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:30,060
 Purposely getting her scent. Did you did you guys dogs or otherwise? Did you guys leave some dirty laundry for them?

441
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,520
 Do you do that? Do you do that for the puppers?

442
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,320
 Do we leave go ahead we answer the question

443
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,800
 Do you leave dirty laundry for a stranger or rubbing your dog's faces to calm them down?

444
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:51,400
 Here's our pile of dirty laundry when you want to rub it on the dogs you leave your dirty laundry

445
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:58,360
 You leave a shirt or or two in the in their sleeping quarters so they could still smell you when you're gone. It works

446
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,080
 Well shame on you

447
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,440
 I've learned shame

448
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,560
 Now did you realize that there's two people that have spent a lot of time around my dogs

449
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,560
 You know how deprived they are

450
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:17,200
 I don't even get me started. I'll tell you all about my fucking dogs here a minute, but fucking

451
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,000
 Did you realize that that is how dogs measure time?

452
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,440
 What yes through scent

453
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:30,160
 Dogs measure time through scent. I just so I read a poem when you leave the house

454
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,440
 Your scent is in the air

455
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:40,480
 Yes, and as the day progresses the smell of you being around your scent is in the air

456
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,720
 Not this scent not me buddy

457
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:56,880
 I forgot I was talking to a man with an unwashed ass. Yeah, it is a pungent. It is a pungent odor that stays

458
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,600
 This is the thing though. That's the scent in Matt's house. Matt is always there

459
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,560
 My cats have an easy day

460
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:12,640
 But that's how they can tell you've been gone for a while is the scent is less so you've been gone

461
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,440
 Having I can't smell you

462
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,480
 Yeah

463
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,760
 Yeah, that song was written for a dog and of course dogs don't understand the sun goes up and goes down

464
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,600
 They don't understand like light and day

465
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:32,800
 No, but no like I was saying man dogs are idiots. They they absolutely understand town

466
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,400
 Night and day they understand circadian rhythm, but i'm saying as far as

467
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,080
 Look

468
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,720
 Uh, I I would even emotionally be measured by scent. What do you mean?

469
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,120
 I I miss my I was trying to make a kelly clarkson as a dog joke and I lost it anyway

470
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:59,200
 Because she's not because she's not she's hot business whose husband just died

471
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,120
 Poor thing

472
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,120
 And it was strange

473
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,920
 Poor everyone were they ever

474
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,920
 As strangers in the night

475
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:17,680
 So she's there. She's got her guns comes by how many guns she's got her guns. Oh too many to count

476
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,440
 It shows up like schwarzenegger's commando the end of commando

477
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,680
 just

478
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,840
 I'm going to have to use your refrigerator a few times. I hope you don't mind

479
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:36,720
 If it's if this food in the fridge you don't want me to eat and eat it labeled labeled with the security deposit

480
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,760
 Put something on top to say do not eat

481
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:47,440
 Otherwise is our fair game because i'm one of these people who believes you're going to be gone for a week

482
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:53,200
 You don't want the food to go bad again moldy. Anyway, I can eat it. I can use it. I can get the value

483
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,760
 Won't you let me have that food?

484
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,840
 Why don't you let me have it?

485
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:03,280
 That's fine. You can eat anything in the fridge. Great. Uh, everything is off limits now to you and your wife

486
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,920
 For the next 10 hours before you leave the house. I call dibs on everything in the fridge

487
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:14,480
 This is part of our arrangement dibs

488
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,240
 No, also, I see you have a lot of drinks up there in this place. We're outside

489
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:26,160
 We've heard dibs has been called if you do not respect dibs, we will arrest you you better get out of this house right now

490
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:31,440
 It's not your house anymore. It's not your house squatters rights dibs dibs

491
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:38,320
 Police there's a person yelling dibs and saying they have squatters rights in my house

492
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:46,640
 That's right, I called it it's dibs I shit in the bedroom when you weren't looking so it's technically mine

493
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,720
 Oh god, she did shit in the bedroom

494
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,200
 Ha ha

495
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,640
 You should never let a stranger in your home unless you don't want your house anymore, but that's the lesson you've learned

496
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,040
 Goodbye get the fuck out

 Tough but fair tough, but fair is right. You're stupid. You're so dumb and your dogs are mine

499
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,400
 Oh at least something good came out of this

500
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,320
 Could you use some dirty laundry behind so I could comfort them?

501
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:23,120
 Yeah, you better leave a stinky shirt or a pair of underpants so I can stick it in the crate

502
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:27,200
 Let it dissipate slowly over the next few weeks

503
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,120

 Knock myself out there. You've been roofing all these beverages. I know what's going on

511
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,040

512
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,040
 This is roofy roulette

513
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,320
 Then she goes well, I don't

514
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:06,320

515
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,200

520
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,160
 If you change your mind

00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,200
 She goes oh no to her credit. She goes. Oh, yeah

522
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,760
 If I want to just sit around and be sad one night, maybe i'll do that

523
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:45,680
 Did you not just say well you could have someone over

524
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,640
 No

525
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,600
 Okay, listen

526
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:53,200
 No, I didn't I didn't propose that she did she have people over and like

527
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,120
 Entertain at my house. No, I didn't I don't think I don't think if you don't drink alone

528
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:01,280
 You want to be used some kind of filthy you don't have to entertain at the house

529
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,760
 But yeah, exactly you can do easily a hundred people in the backyard. That's true

530
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:10,560
 We've got rolls of visqueen in the garage several times. That's it

531
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:15,840
 If she lays down some plastic all bets are off. That's right. That's right

532
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,960
 dibs respect dibs

533
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:25,280
 I tell you what so she we uh, we left uh, we left town

534
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,760
 She told my wife, uh, because of course she and sj are the ones who put all this together

535
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:36,080
 Uh, so, uh, she told sj. Oh i'll send you you'll update pictures on the dogs

536
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:40,800
 Uh, it'll it'll be great. There won't be any trouble with the dogs. Everything's gonna be gonna be real good

537
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,600
 she sent

538
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:49,200
 Multiple update pictures to my wife every day so so that sj knew that the dogs were were being taken care of

539
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,480
 We got back to the house

540
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:58,800
 It was so much cleaner than it is when our asshole friends house it for us

541
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:06,400
 It had been vacuumed the dog shit in the backyard had been picked up and throw it away

542
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:12,000
 I was like this is incredible and I had told her I was like the dogs are small enough

543
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,280
 The yard is big enough

544
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,600
 If you don't pick any of it up because she was like, oh is there a trash can for the for the dog poop from the backyard?

545
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:22,880
 I said, yeah, there's trash can over here. Uh, really though. You don't have to sweat it. They're not big dogs

546
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,440
 Uh, so unless the mood just strikes you honestly, you don't have to worry about it. Yeah

547
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:33,200
 And uh, but yeah, like the the yard was completely clean. It's like man. Are you sure?

548
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:38,480
 Asshole friends got thrown away and she didn't eat it

549
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:44,800
 You sure she didn't straight up tootsie roll all those nuggets

550
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,520
 That's her whole scheme, right?

551
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,620
 Jacob, can you actually send her a text now whether she tootsie rolled all those nuggets?

552
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,240
 Oh

554
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,080
 She just wrote back up. She's she's replied

555
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:33,600
 Busted

556
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,760
 Oh, yeah, she

 That just gorged herself

563
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:10,720
 I did it again. I said I wouldn't do it

564
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,880
 I eat all the shits at the place. I was

565
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,160
 Of watching the dogs

566

 But in order to actually eat all the dog feces and that is the following sponsor

567

 Today's show is brought to you by creepy best spy guy and ray ramanos improv training classes

00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:35,600
 Okay, so um

 uh, so okay, uh

577
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,800
 The most important thing, uh is making or maintaining good eye contact with your partner

578
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,880
 honestly, because

579
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:18,800
 If you focus on that then you can't miss moves that are made or you won't miss here

580
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,440
 words that are said

581
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,720
 Usually and i'm sorry. Is that is that also creepy best buy guys?

582
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:29,680
 Number one rule is eye contact as well. It's my number one and my number two rule

583
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:37,200
 Both number one and number two number one and number two. That's my number one and number two rule is eye contact. Yes. Okay

584
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:42,800
 What if I don't want eye contact for my partner like the way could be guessed best by guys looking at me

585
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,280
 Like I want him to stop looking at me. Ray. How would I get him to stop looking at me? Uh,

586
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,240
 Invite your brother over to fuck your wife

587
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,480
 And her hate scoops to check out

588
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,160
 Wow

589
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,760
 Wow

590
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,160
 Is that a plot point from the show or from his real life?

591
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,960
 both

592
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:08,000
 Right what you know, she tootsie rolled his fiance. No, uh

593
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,760
 Matt did you know that those are my those are my first two rules?

594
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,600
 I did know that I didn't know that your number one number two rule or eye contact you set me up for it

595
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,680
 It was nice. I did I did. Yeah

596
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,480
 and it's true

597
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,800
 It's the most important

598
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,240
 If you ask me

599
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:33,600
 This is before the holidays right because you came back for the holidays, yeah

600
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,600
 Yeah, it was right before the holidays got it

601
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:36,560
 Okay

602
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:41,440
 Because it was it wasn't like a special rate to make a woman because I if you're making her work christmas

603
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,760
 Then I imagine it is sad drinking time

604
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:50,160
 I don't know. I mean she got up uh every morning and uh, all right

605
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:56,820
 But she told us her her grade to mecca matt you racist not everybody celebrates christmas

606
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:03,460
 She would get up every morning and light the menorah

607
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:10,100
 And she was very happy about it. She's very conflicted. She was she was not a smart person

608
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:16,960
 Well, she's out there just to tootsie roll them nugs man, that's right, that's all she came for

609
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,960
 No, she'd get it because she has a job so she'd just get up in the morning and go to her job at the at

610
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,960
 the vet's office and all and then

611
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:28,160
 Come home in the evenings, I guess and and let the dogs out and have dinner and go to bed who?

612
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,560
 Did she stay at the house

613
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:36,240
 Yes, she stayed at the house she sleeps over, huh?

614
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,880
 She sleeps over that's that's part of the deal

615
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,720
 Did she leave behind a pile of dirty laundry for the dogs when they missed her?

616
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,960
 She did does she sleep upside down like a bat?

617
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,280

620
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,480
 See these hooks on my shoes on the heels of my shoes

621
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:11,280

01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,880
 I just saw jerry seinfeld do it a bit the other day

736
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:23,680
 He was talking about how festivus was the uh, like the the main takeaway from that show

737
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:30,480
 He's like that is definitely the bit that has continued the longest from that television show is just people talking about festivus

738
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,640
 Well, it's because it's jerry stiller

739
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:37,520
 Exactly the immortal fucking jerry stiller, right? Yeah. Oh and that's the credit that he gave

740
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,960
 Absolutely, i'm paraphrasing what he was saying about it

741
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:46,160
 But yeah, he was like jerry stiller's speech about festivus is one of the best moments from the entire program
