 Here we go

 I want to thank you the ice cream truck drivers. Thank you so much ice cream truck drivers
 Let's see who are the ice cream truck drivers boy see I'm so distracted
 Who are the ice cream truck drivers? Those are the folks that deliver that fucking ice cream straight to your fucking ear holes

 But we will thank each and every ice cream truck driver before this show and a future episode this month
 If you want to be an ice cream truck driver
 And I sure hope you do preaching fun commas where you can go preaching fun comm head over there sign up to be an ice cream
 Truck driver and who knows?
 The life you save
 May be your own
 Oh a show
 Do you want to go to an ice cream social? Yeah, I'd love to great. Let's go
 Shout out to win Matt Donnelly discovered the best
 Manual nose hair trimmer that I've still ever used the eagle
 It's time for Matt Maddenly's ice cream social sitting in Las Vegas. It's Matt Donnelly also sick in Las Vegas
 It's me Jacob the audio guy sitting somewhere. We'll figure it out later. It's Paul. We're preaching fun. Yeah
 Paul's not here
 You know, it's funny. We got a couple of
 Compliments recently this thing our recent episodes have just been have been on a good in a good spot
 We've been out there
 What better way to bring it to a screeching halt than simply not knowing where Paul Mattingly is on this earth?
 I think it's maybe a good way to just slow it down
 We'll show you but the chat is continuing to find different ways to portray boobs in emoji form in the chat
 It's very exciting
 Lori else off the two sunny side eggs. Very nice. Very nice
 Everyone so creative. Oh, it's got text from Paul breaking news. Oh, hey
 Be home soon, so it wasn't sleeping. Oh
 Well, we don't know that you might have been like on a park bench somewhere just just dozing
 Just feeding the birds and just
 Fetch in the middle of January in Pittsburgh, no
 It's so nice out it is freezing for Las Vegas, right? It's 44 degrees
 40 degrees
 It's got down to 38 which is Celsius for our foreign listeners. So I don't know five
 I've were terrible at converting Fahrenheit Celsius. I have no idea
 But it's negative 30. I don't know. Yeah
 But I go to the gym and I'm my gym right now
 It's just like our little community center because my actual gym gym closed my gym gym closed
 Oh, oh Jim Jim top of the morning to you my Jim Jim closed
 So my my regular gym closed it's gonna be taken over by a crunch Jim eventually
 It's a coming soon what thing which is also funny, right? Like pizza places just become other pizza places
 Right like Jim's like what else you're gonna do that space it has like it has a pool and workout equipment
 Are you just gonna so it's gonna be another gym? Oh, yeah, I forget about the pool. Sure. That makes sense
 Yeah, it's why I had joined that particular gym is because all right
 Cuz you could go in there and and and and stare at the young ladies who were swimming exactly
 You can go swim exactly but I have those glasses that look like eyeballs that are looking up
 And so therefore you can't tell that I'm staring at the spring ones
 Yeah, but I taped them so they just look like they're looking up good smart. So that way that way I'm not creepy
 That's why he's the best and I
 Go, so what I do is I go to the community centers called the multi multi multi Jen multi Jen center multi generational center, right?
 Okay, so they have you know kids camps. They got swimming lessons. They have like classrooms for to teach classes for adults
 it's a big it's a big big outfit over there and one of the has is a gym in a walking track and a pool but
 A big like okay. It's like where the where the competitions are where the swimming competitions are
 locally for for the schools
 Gotcha, and so I go to the gym in the evening around like 530
 Which means the Sun has just gone down and spit was super windy yesterday like really windy crazy breezy yesterday
 And I look out the window and there's a fucking swim meet happening
 Was like what fucking hell on earth
 Where why it's it's still January. I know we live in the desert
 But it's still January
 Why on earth is an outdoor swimming meet happening?
 I mean best case scenario in the pool and I assume an unheated pool in the desert in January. It's not pleasant
 It's not nice
 No, like without a breeze. It's just it still was a cold day
 But it was like that means like, you know, like oh man when you get wet and then there's a breeze
 I mean, that's all right. Yeah, I couldn't believe I just all these kids
 It's honestly the reason that I don't swim half the time. I don't swim
 It's cuz right now I'm just not swimming in case a breeze comes up. I
 Mean it's been a minute, but I that story where I was hired to be a
 Bathing suit model by accident. I think I told the story on there
 It's been a while. It's been a while though
 But yeah, so so they'd cast just off of headshots and then it was me three male models and four
 gorgeous women models and then a bunch of bathing suits that didn't fit on my fat body and then
 Right. I forgot they had the bathing suits
 So I stuffed into one of them like a sausage and then yep
 Good
 We had it to go do like a pool shoot and there's literally like two pools like a giant lap pool and this beautiful kind of
 circular fountain pool for like
 Hanging out and renting cabanas, right?
 Mm-hmm. So they set this really fancy camera and they art directed me to the furthest place away from the camera
 They put a fake that
 That is good art direction
 They put a fake drink in my hand and put me literally 200 yards away from the camera
 All right, so they had the hotter people closer to the first pool
 I was just supposed to be decorative like background and the second pole
 Here's what they did. They put all the they put all the super hot people in the close-up pool and they put me behind
 the camera with a jib
 Can you you hold this this bounce this light bouncer this reflector? Can you hold it?
 I don't think I'm even on camera over here. No, you are you are don't worry about it. You're fine
 The look I remember still the art dressers face when I was trying to squeeze into a bathing suit and him just going like why
 Why are you here?
 What have I done to deserve this hanging out in the tent and listen to all the hot people talk about all the different
 Things they have for their veggies and vegetable smoothies and which blenders they use and stuff
 I was like I know what a blender is
 I
 Just put snakes in mine
 But it was freezing cold. It was like a freak. It was it was like it wasn't as cold as today
 But it was it was probably like 50 degrees still very cold to be in a pool. And so I
 Being the only person in pool B
 Really took my time getting in try to not even let it ripple
 He's like even if I just got up on my on my stomach like the wind was blowing and it would just freeze, right?
 So I was saying like perfectly still in the water to like not like to establish a level and not change it, right?
 That was yeah, that's what I was doing. And then at one point they want to shake things up
 I'm gonna shake things up and said I move people around
 Except me. They said to keep me right where I was
 I
 Had taken the first shoot to a build a wall
 They set the wall up between me and the camera. It's all one of the hot guys pretending your friends with fat
 So back there, right? So they sent him back there
 And you said that's not how you pronounce my name
 And
 And he was a big old beautiful dummy. So he ran great and just jumped in the pool
 Yes ran and just left into the pool and I was like, no I've established
 You're rooting for both of us
 He gets up he's wet and then we start saying still pretending to talk and gesture one another while they do this right and
 And he is like man. It sucks. It's cold
 Sure does buddy
 He's like cuz the winds blowing I was like, oh no one of us has already figured that out
 Yeah, the other of us knows which blender to have to make the best vegetable smoothies and the other knows how wind works
 on cold skin
 But we both got this game
 We're both getting the same check buddy
 I
 So remember that shoot came out it was it was it was not I was not in the pool stuff
 I was in the at one point they like decided like
 Set her attention on me and like do things with like they were pushing me in the pool, right?
 And that was oh, okay. Those were the those are the final shots. The pool was me getting pushed in the pool
 while girls with their dad showed up
 Give us money and let us gamble go away
 The those those didn't make it because they probably looked over things like it just looks like we're picking on someone
 Now I was just fat this time I was still young so I didn't come off as their dad
 I just came off as like I don't know their gay best friend or
 You know someone they went to high school with you know that kind of a thing
 Who's with us for the day
 This is a make-a-wish guy that said he wanted to hang out at the Caesars pool before he died. I
 Didn't know they did exchange students to the Caesars pool, but I guess they do. That'd be great
 Like you're dying like you want I want to you want to hang out with famous magicians
 No, I want to know what it's like to get bottle servers and have bottles hang out. That's my I
 Want you to just buy me a table at Omni
 Craziest nightclub make-a-wish is like we can't afford this. I want a poolside cabana at towel
 Right give it could we just buy you a pool just buy you a pool
 Someone in chat saying they're trying to distract me with their zoom background their zoom background is the crucifixion
 It's just it's it's three people on crosses on a hillside, but I'm not sure if that's the real one
 Cameras back then I mean
 You know not to put the car before the horse here, but that's a beautiful sunset. I mean, it's perfect
 Perfect sense. How could you see that sunset behind three people hanging on crosses and not believe in God?
 Wait, someone said do you see the letters the letters on there? Oh, it just says it says titties or tits. Oh good. Oh
 The cross of the crosses spell titties now I get it
 Great boy. Did that take me too long and
 Not help the audio version of this podcast at all
 All right, but yeah, I think we're doing great
 Hey when you were growing up Jacob did saying the word it sucks like that sucks was that considered like extreme oh
 That was definitely considered that was a that was a word we could get in trouble for yeah me too
 Yeah, my kids throw that like it's nothing all the time
 Really? Yeah
 Do you smack him just give him a taste of the back of the hand at one point?
 I was like, you know, I offered to make a breakfast whatever they're like
 Oh, do we have it? You know, do we have waffles? I look I was like, no, we're out of waffles and my youngest goes
 Well, that sucks
 and I
 Didn't go like hey timeout
 Was an extreme thing to say when I was a kid you guys start out like it's nothing and when you directed at me
 It's very jarring and it makes me really angry
 Sorry, I'm making you breakfast are you spoiled asses don't have waffles today mother
 But yeah, so my kids say sucks like no problem to hear other kids say it so I guess it's okay to say sucks
 maybe maybe um, I
 Definitely have a memory of me saying something sucks to my dad and him stopping and just just looking at me and saying something along
 the lines of sucks what?
 Go ahead
 What does it suck?
 You're like it was definitely something along those lines was like I put point-taken titties dad titty
 Yeah socks
 Saying something blows definitely couldn't say shut up. Although you can't you still can't say shut up. My kids know just say shut up
 We got in trouble when we were little for stupid if we if we called somebody stupid
 We got in trouble for that. I
 Remember really getting in trouble
 The first the first time I thought I had to like get caught cursing and had to confess to my dad
 I said up yours
 Which I don't even think
 I don't even think that's like even on the radar as an insult anymore
 That was huge. I I said up your nose with a rubber hose
 Mattingly is here Paul Mattingly everybody everybody everyone Paul Mattingly. Hey guys
 Well Paul, you're late. So up yours, buddy. Oh boy. Now I'm getting it now
 You know what it's absolutely fair the boys told me we adjusted for the time I wrote it on my calendar
 For some reason this morning I woke up and I go. Oh, yeah two o'clock podcast
 Do do do do do fart fart fart just tootling around that was part of it
 Okay
 The other part was I'm doing my morning business
 Getting ready to take a shower
 uh-huh, and I'm scrolling on my phone and
 What to my wondering eyes should appear but the local toy shop going business sale
 Oh, we never have everything we never
 Everything must go
 the fact that he came back is just
 It's only ten minutes away from my house, so I was down there is basically the bad signal went to the sky
 Yeah, I had no choice
 They entered the siren call and went to the toy store and just was zombieing out for an hour. Just oh
 What can I get? You know, I got I got a couple good little little trinkets. Nothing too crazy and go too crazy
 Local toy stores also go get a business. So pour one out. Yeah
 No
 this was a
 This place called Toyland
 Anyone has ever thought Paul isn't that selective with his rage? Okay. No, I this place is
 Okay, you guys have you guys don't have you guys don't have ollie's on that side of the world
 No, I don't always so ollie's for the East Coasters is this discount chain?
 That's sort of like big lots was in its heyday
 I'm from the East Coast. Okay, like a newer East Coast thing. I think so. Yeah, okay, so
 You remember big lots when it first popped off yeah get some really
 May as a kid you could get some amazing deals
 You could take five bucks down there and come home with something significant. Yeah, you know, oh, yeah. Yeah, so
 Ollie's does this they get warehouses full of old toys and things and put them at pretty deep discount and sometimes they
 You know clearance them out even there
 What this toy store Toyland was doing was clearing out the best of Ollie's sales
 Bringing them to their store and repricing them above and right at MSRP or higher
 So I was kind of like well, this isn't a business
 I mean
 So their business plan was take things out of the bargain bin mark them up and then try to resell them. Yes
 That's already called eBay. I know
 It's basically like an eBay but but not as many
 good
 Items now occasionally I found some deals at the win stores start doing corporate dumpster diving
 Things are bad all over things are bad all over and I hate to see a small business go under but I also know
 That they are straight-up just resellers and they put everything at a price that no one could deal with and they were doing big-time
 Pokemon scalping as well. So I'm just like man
 Do you think it's possible that they're just faking the out-of-business sale and they're just gonna be one of those stores
 That's perpetually going out of business. That's just their new thing
 No, I the owner was there and I heard you guys are listening to the last episode of Matt Madley's. Oh
 Now the owners the owners were there and they were talking about
 The next chapter or whatever. So clearly they've got some other scheme up there 11 is the next chapter
 11 you're right. You're right. That's yeah, there's two locations in the Pittsburgh area that are going under
 Again, it it makes me sad but you know
 Not that sad because it was a dumb model and I would go like I'd been there like four or five times
 They'd only been open about a year and I'd been there a couple times to try and support them and the last time I went
 I just walked right out with nothing because I was like there ain't shit here
 You know, it's just sad did you ever talk to him? Like did they properly nerd out about toy products where they know?
 It's not like that. They're not in it for the love. He's not in it for the love. He's just a scalpy. He's a scalpy scalp
 This is it Paul need some heart in there. I
 Imagine he has I imagine he has probably one
 Fixation. I don't know what that might be
 You come back to Vegas you always go to the same toy spot around the corner from my house
 Yeah, Ralph's his name, right? Well Ralph's is the comic book shop. Okay. Oh, right
 And then and then Ralph's just happened to have a new toy store rogue toys built
 Place right in that same slot. That's a total nerd cave now, man. It's got rogue toys. It's got that
 Smashing ground rogue toys has always been in that in that ballpark though
 They've always like when they were downtown and everything they were always that like real nerdy spot
 Like yeah, no rogue toys is great. I had wonderful
 I always I always knew that if Paul got a divorce and then got remarried I could go get his remarried gift at that rogue toys
 You could you could buy half my collection. I sold nearly four thousand dollars worth of toys to them and
 And that was at a loss for me
 You know when I was moving I had to get rid of so much stuff
 But they were cool about it. The only thing that really bugged me is I went back in and I'd sold them some of my
 Mega blocks turtle stuff and I I let go of a piece that I came back and I was like
 What are you charging for that that I gave you for ten dollars?
 So, yeah there were there one or two go back and look again
 Well, I mean well that was the thing I went back and I was like, oh look, it's my entire collection on display
 That's what SJ will do SJ will do that when we go to concerts
 She'll be like we'll be in our spot and then she'll I'll see her on her phone and then she'll be like hey
 What what did we pay for these tickets again?
 No, I mean hey look no regrets you gotta if you're a collector, you know collections come and go
 That's what it is, you know
 It's it's just and I've I've been so fortunate to build back so much cool stuff here in the new space
 And I don't know. I showed you guys last week last time the amazing
 Enterprise that I just got which was you know a lazlo I showed them the video
 Of the enterprise that I've set up. It's just it's a gorgeous
 So I've got I've got more collectibles and I know what to do with it's lovely, you know, it's just fun spending time
 so I apologize that
 My forgetful brain and my blindness in toys led me to be a half hour late. So
 we all assumed you were dead and
 That's the right assumption to make you know, and we started a podcast anyway
 A wellness check at your door. Just the
 Matt text to me is like I can't knock on your door. So good luck. Hope you're not dead
 Yeah, I'll stop Paul might be dead they would add into the podcast anyway, that's the following sponsor today's show

 Well, okay
 We're not shifting it around. I think it's been the same place the whole time. Oh, really?
 All right, Matt. All right, Matt, let's let's let's shift some other things around. How about this one? How about this one?
 Don't they a style of Bibliotheca?
 See one as Bibliotheca sure great
 One as Bibliotheca
 In the chat look at motherfucker
 Take a look at
 You stack of books. I'm not you over like a stack of books. I take you out like a stack of books
 Fucking why I'm always looking like a bibliotheca new fucking and rice collection looking son of a bitch
 Stephen King novels
 Section and then in the Bibliotheca looking so do we decimal have an asshole?
 You card catalog located motherfucker
 Do they even have card catalogs at the library more good. Yes, I don't know sure because we've all been to the library recently
 Yeah, I have why I was late to the podcast. I have
 50% off I take I take I take my kids at the library
 But we rarely we don't usually use the Dewey decimal system over there
 No, I guess most of its all been transferred to computer
 But I wonder if they ever I guess did they I know there's no reason to keep all that data. I guess on cards. I
 Wonder what the I should look online. I'm just asking questions into the fucking void, but
 What can you consider a good repurposing of those Dewey decimal card holders?
 Oh those huge those huge very specifically sized drawers
 well, what would you imagine would be a good second use for those spice rack comes to mind a
 Very large spice rack. I mean for a for like a for like an industrial kitchen. I
 Mean that's a lot of spice. It would take a lot. It does take up a lot of space gun rack
 Could you fit a rifle in some of those long boxes?
 Probably oh be kind of cool to just pull out a shelf of guns. I've got it. I've got it. What do you got?
 Don't even move them out of the library
 Turn them into beehives
 In the library just in the library
 Beehives an apiary. I mean they would work as hives. I
 Suppose. Yep. No, no, I think that's figured it out
 Can I bring crystal saying business cards?
 Ravi's a storage of Chinese medicine. Yeah, that's how yeah, I think rhino penises would slide in there pretty good
 Mm-hmm
 Well, once you dehydrate them
 Of course, I wasn't talking about non dehydrated rhino penises
 Those are what you're always talking about hydrated rhino penises, Paul
 You won't shut up about hydrated rhino penis just because it was my band in college
 You'll add that one single we did have that one single there's good the shirt was the thing that kept us going
 We had a really cool shirt for hydrated rhino penis. Oh, yeah. Yeah
 Oh, there's a three-dimensional aspect of it that I think people really appreciate it people liked it
 It was made of that pup. Remember that puffy paint. That was such a rage back in the late 80s
 It was all puffy paint
 Puffy paint dehydrate or hydrated rhino penis shirts were all the rage at my school
 Modern-day apothecary tables. Yeah, that could be cool. Oh my god that could store
 Pokemon and magic cards. Holy shit that'd be an awesome way to store your Pokemon and magic
 I like all these suggestions like we have a giant card catalog. What could we repurpose this as Oh a card holder?
 Okay, all right. Yeah, you're right. All right. What else what other thing could you do?
 But I already said beehive already got the right answer. What about a bunch of weird long ways aquariums?
 But that would have to be just fish that like living in the dark most of the time or
 Oh eels
 You don't want to turn around drawers of eels and snakes
 That don't want to turn around
 Eels that hate turning around
 Oh
 My god, oh it would be great for organizing Lego. Yes
 Would be awesome for that I keep waiting for Paul to move on to anything else
 But he just keeps listing off things that people are saying that you can do with a card catalog
 It's a great topic
 We're not talking about enough because think about the thousands of libraries that are out in the country right now and think about the disused

 Alpha fish don't don't aren't that's not real that the guy who wrote about the alpha fish regrets his paper about the alpha

 Do you like do you sprint to the toilet after after you have an orgasm?
 There must be there's a greater. There's a greater scientific
 Area of concern
 Going on and I was like wait wait isn't that isn't that the whole thing you orgasm and then pee like that's the whole thing
 It's like it's your doctor Paul. It's your doctor. It's just one continuous stream, right?
 You don't wait for you for you guys orgasm begin peeing is different

 You've been eating green eggs and ham
 We got an email from scoopy Ramon
 Hey gentleman of the churn and possible guest nope
 There was series of random middle connections not worth detailing here
 I recently found myself regaling someone with a story of enthusiasm over experience from my past
 It made me think that one or all of you might have a story that fits this category
 My stories are enthusiasm over experience
 Are we are we insinuating that our enthusiasm?
 Outpaces our experience well when we say I love boobies. What does that sound like it sound like we have experience or does it sound like?
 Yeah
 In that respect my
 Base is my experience
 So here's my example of enthusiasm versus experience in high school
 I first caught the acting bug by doing the school plays a friend of mine
 I'll call him Chuck because that was his name had played an extra as a freshman and had told me repeatedly about how much fun
 It was and how many girls were in the school plays one of those two things convinced me to audition
 Fast-forward a bit and Chuck and I are now both extras in the next school play the play was the crucible
 Oh as freshmen
 We were both relegated to extras in a scene where two or three other characters are talking Chuck
 And I were to play jail guards or something, but they were of course non-speaking parts, but shouldn't we do be doing something?
 Dumbass attention starve sixteen-year-old me asked that exact question
 Fine, just don't steal focus was the reply
 In the production of the crucible in my high school there were two
 Puritanical jail guards who so fervently believed that the rest of the world was too chill about
 Armageddon and stuff to stay in England
 Did their best to not make any noise as they shot dice in the background of the Salem witch trials?
 also, I
 Can't tell if it makes it better or worse that we all my cause
 I
 Can't tell if it makes it better or worse
 then we fashion our own dice out of clay from the art room so that they would be period in hopes that the director would
 Let us do more and that is
 way worse
 Definitely worse
 Hilarious that is how lair period dice
 No way those dice rolled true right so they could have rigged some kind of gambling scheme
 Because they certainly always rolled, you know six or something like, you know, right? There's no way they built a great
 evenly weight distributed clay dice
 Probably you are you guys want to get into my dice game here. I got a I got a dice game going on over here
 I got a special homemade dice. I just got to sell them hard
 Gonna sell them hard on the crucible thing and that these are, you know era appropriate gambling
 That's right
 What's that? What's a priest me for craftsmen? We could take him for all the money we have you remember how back in back in the day
 It was all
 Dice in the alleys down those puritan streets
 Anyway ever get it over your head on something with enthusiasm
 For something that now you have some more experience than it was an obvious rookie mistake much love FYI t f y da t f o
 W i a t f that's scoopy Ramon. Thank You Scooby Ramon. Thank you, and I appreciate this on a deep level
 I had this experience when I was in kindergarten and
 Was in a school play and I was an elf
 Sneaking on to the stage
 backing up and I was to bump into Santa Claus and be surprised and I insisted I
 Insisted that I hold a toy and then drop it in surprise and shock
 I was like, how about I tell you I was like I was giving I gave myself business
 I was like, how about I take a toy and I and I well when I bump into Santa. Oh, that's good
 That's good. I dropped the toy and they were like fine. Whatever, you know
 I was obnoxious and I was you know, 18 19 is my freshman year and only year of college
 We did Rosic Reds a gilded also your senior year
 We did Rosic Reds a gilded are dead. Yeah, I got cast is just polonius, right? It was just really in that show
 like not, you know in the hamlet a vital character, but still like a
 Tertiary role kind of thing and rose goes are dead. I really just came in to illustrate that that's happening
 Throughout the hamlet, right and I did so much
 Business and I tried to get so much laughs
 Like a baddie old man, like I was obnoxious looking back
 I'm like so ashamed like if I if I were me now in a play with me then I would be like
 Can you chill the fuck out and play your part? Can you just?
 Accept that you didn't get cast as Rosencrantz or gilded turn. Can you just move on?
 You know, it was it was it was it was obnoxious I
 Got to bust out during a ride. Oh, Matt. Donnelly has a question. That's correct. That's exactly that's exactly the level it was at
 During my college freshman year. I got to play rolling mall and present laughter and I had that character is just annoying and crazy
 And so I just got to go
 ballistic as a young
 Ham and it was fucking glorious and I killed it
 It was it was really really really fun. But then also I was like well fuck
 I that I was in a main
 Production with all the graduate students. I think I'm done here
 Boy, I was like, I don't know. Seriously. I got like third for the top billing like what the fuck what else?
 What else is going on? It's six more years to do this again. No, thanks. I'm fucking
 That was really one of those things I took away from that experience was like, okay, I can go do other stuff now
 And he did I sure did indeed go do other stuff and
 Still is doing other stuff and unless he's died between the recording of publishing of this episode
 you never know and I'm still doing the
 More enthusiasm than the experience when I got to do the the warm-up gig for P&T
 Yeah
 Exactly. That was ridiculously crazy, but it worked out worked out real good
 But I was just very lucky
 Right place right time and boy. Oh boy was that guy previous to me just tanking it
 Yeah, you just she had like a different job right or whatever we were you there when he got fired or I yeah
 I was there as pen stand-in. Yeah, I was doing that's right. Yeah, you were doing standard work
 Yeah, I was doing standard work and then I kept doing standard work and the warm-up right for that season. That was wild
 That was a lot of work
 Fun though. I think every job I've ever taken was definitely taken with enthusiasm over experience. Yeah
 Yeah, I mean at least up until I was 35 right
 Including including when Matt called me and said you want to do a podcast I
 Mean, I would say that would definitely be enthusiasm over experience for all three of us. That was Paul that well
 Yeah, I mean well, but not not really I don't have any experience. I had experience talking into a microphone. That's about it
 Oh, I don't I still don't know diddly squad about putting together a podcast properly. No, I mean I know a little bit
 But not not a ton
 Don't get on the feeds. I don't
 When other podcasters ask us for advice they are disappointed often
 Like I don't know record it and throw it in the ether
 Yeah, release the episodes on time. Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, I can't I can't don't show up a half hour late. I
 Can't start off my TED talk with be friends with Penn
 Why not be a hard one to do
 It's not easy to execute advice but it is that it is advice that can be executed can be can be done
 We got an email here from Anonymous, here's a what would you do story?
 We had a little what would you do action?
 Well, it starts when I visited a dance scene that I hadn't gone to in about 15 years
 I hit it off with a guy I used to know and like a scene from a film
 We danced together for most of the late-night blues party
 It was romantic and incredibly hot when we left he carefully asked I might be reading this wrong
 But would you like to have coffee sometime to reassure him on several levels?
 I answered. Yes, that is the perfect thing to say that is much better than my suggestion
 Which was to go to my hotel room and fuck
 Whoa
 It's a good answer. It's a solid answer
 When we met for a date, I was glad to find we were both vaccinated atheists
 He's 15 years older than me though, which put me on edge because of a bad experience. I had with an older guy
 I started worrying we wouldn't be compatible and saw a red flag when he mentioned a right-of-center newspaper
 Still he was kind and empathetic and the chemistry was hard to ignore at this point. What would you do?
 But this point I could continue on the day you keep on each other, right? Do we know the gender of our writer?
 We don't okay
 I feel like gay or straight if an older man came to meet you if you want to say let's let's cut through the
 Bullshit and go fuck. I feel like they would do it
 Well, I think the writer was was saying that to be funny more than more than like an actual suggestion
 The other person the other person they had been dancing with said like hey, you know, we've been dancing
 We were having a good time tonight
 Would you be interested in going to get a coffee and they're like I am interested in getting coffee
 I was gonna say we should go fuck but yes, let's go get coffee, right?
 So then the question is how we feel about if they start mentioning right-wing newspapers
 Yeah, like kind of just where we're at at this point with it, I guess
 So there's a little bit of a little bit of stuff that they're worried about a little bit of stuff that writers worried about age
 It made the newspaper I guess
 But still kind and pathetic and had good chemistry
 So, yeah
 We did our best to be respectful and with full consent that it might be a one-time only thing. We spent the night
 Okay turned out. He's good in bed
 Oh, yeah, and we have a kink in common
 So I got very excited at the potential to explore this which would be a first for me. Okay, big, right?
 That's what I'm guessing. So it's like the shrimp
 Let's go
 We spoke on the phone a few times
 In an impressive backfire of complimenting me
 He said he only wants to date women at least 10 years younger because women his own age look old
 What?
 Casual sexism and he apologized guys
 Know that I'll be breaking up with you in nine years. Yeah, right. I said good day
 Don't get comfortable universal all women age the same all men don't don't worry about it
 Wow, no problem I
 Called him out of this casual sexism and he apologized next it came out that he voted for a political party that I don't like
 But I don't want to be and I hate people who vote X person
 Finally, like he was quoting a soundbite. He said it's hypocritical to believe in global warming and still fly
 Yep, he doesn't believe in global warming. Come on
 I got the feeling he didn't always think before speaking most people wouldn't call their promising sex partner a hypocrite
 with a sell-by-date
 Oh with a sell-by-date, right and this is all just making this sex hotter. Yeah, you know
 Sure, that's the kink the kick. Oh
 Tell me more horrible opinions. Oh, yeah
 Shut up and keep fucking me you big dummy go
 Having my first period menopausal mood swings. I crashed hard
 Don't be I with your tongue on my toes go
 Hey, that sounds like a good night
 Having my first period menopausal mood swings. I crashed hard and ended things. Damn it
 I get very uncomfortable with debates and didn't attack his beliefs. I spoke my piece
 He listened and it and it didn't become an argument
 He apologized properly and was shaken by how much he had upset me
 It was the most respectful breakup call I ever had shortly after that time three people I knew got terminal
 Diagnoses and depressing political stuff was happening. Oh at a low point. I asked myself
 What would I do if I only had six months left? Oh, my reaction was I would call that guy and tell him
 Don't say anything about anything
 Let's just have some fun
 This is really hard right it is this is really hard because it's hard to meet anyone that you're
 Sympathico with in general. Oh that kind of hard. Yes
 And then to try and navigate especially currently just how polarizing opinions can be
 Sure, but what how important like we've made everything so important
 when I was a
 single I
 Remember being an atheist like factored faster than I thought it was
 Like I was certainly willing to not give a shit about that person being Christian
 And the early dating parts. Yeah, and it just it kind of it would come to a head faster than I than I thought it would
 Yeah time, you know, yeah, that's just a younger generation thing
 I mean, they don't they don't view blowjobs as a thing that you need to wait on as much anymore
 but it's it's true in relationships if you
 You know if you find out that your partner is prone to magical thinking
 then
 It opens up other doors and if you find your partner is prone to saying off-color possibly bigoted shit
 there's probably other shit behind there too, right like that's
 Well, I mean maybe if you you know, I think it's I think it's hard to examine like
 male loneliness white male only this has like its own thing, but like the truth is like this is an example like
 Wherever this guy is getting his echo chamber. Yeah, there's no yes global warming, right?
 You're breaking up with him sends him back to that space. Yeah, but but yeah, but I don't know
 Yeah, but it's not and it's not your job responsibility to save. Yes
 Right to save all of stupid white male America like I mean, you know, I've been having I've been out of the game guys
 No, but you know, whatever
 But we want we want I found a woman who would save me the thing that I do for my single friends is you know
 Like write down everything you want in a man, right? So in this case if you want to say
 Awesome in bed believes in science like, you know, like like what happens is like we write that list down
 It is not crazy to look at that list. That list is not like there's no one on earth who could fit this bill
 No, and like and I did I did that before I ended up
 Dating and I made my specific list of things
 I wanted in a partner and it not only does it reinforce what's important to you
 But it narrows your field of vision and you don't just go wild off the handle looking at people who it just quickly
 Nullifies possible bad choices, right? It sharpens your head man
 It's it's it's what I talk about an improv all the time too. You know, the the real key to improvisation is focus
 That's it. Where's your focus?
 Okay, and so that's it. That's it. It's really just focus
 like I can teach a lot of different stuff, but focus is what it really a lot of what it really comes down to and
 with anything
 decide what's important decide what you're truly looking for get clear about goals and
 things that are important to you and
 The bullshit falls away. Yeah, but it's hard to keep focus
 It's that and that's especially true now and that's why we see a lot of what's going on within our political spectrum
 It is designed to destroy
 focus
 Sure. Yeah. Yeah for sure
 I don't want to I'm gonna go back to other point, but what you're I don't want to no no no, no
 Yeah, that point is valid
 but I think so many times like our ability to be flexible to be giving to want to
 Put things on the line to like our willingness to possibly change to help to bend for other folks. Yes
 I think you get lost in that ship. Yes, and and then and then you combine that with the sunk cost fallacy
 Yes, good example. My yes. Yes. Yes, I envy
 I've been in this shitty really you're like I can't get $3,000 in a month. I can't do it
 And you think you're gonna get out of relationship you're gonna be embarrassed you think your friends are gonna think oh my god
 You put so much time in your friends won't care at all
 You know
 It's it they'll care about you, but they won't care that that that you put more time or less time in
 they don't
 You you you anytime you take a step towards being healthier your friends are going to be grateful that you're in a better space
 No matter how long it took you to do it
 That's worth saying on its own also
 If they're your real friends, right good and not your frenemies and that's it
 Those were talking about also you can be you should be also be more selfish about your friends
 You should be you know
 if you if you have a dysfunctional relationship with your friendship group or you feel like you're you know not truly a
 like
 Jive is not a mute. It's not truly mutual with your friends group. You should get new friends
 You should get to find it any kind of hobby any kind of club any kind of meeting. Yeah, you're right any kind of bar
 Oh, there he goes. Here we go. You know what he can do better than us Paul
 Jacob can do better than us and I'm glad he's gone. I
 Wait a minute. I looked around I turned out I couldn't do better. That's a double-edged right there
 I'm glad he's gone
 Then I'm saying as a guy who lives in like, you know an urban and suburban environment
 You know, we have numerous scoops right us
 You know where they have basically stayed in their religion longer simply because they would know they'd be completely alone in their community
 Sure, right become atheist like I understand that this is an uphill battle and bigger things
 I'm only saying in your heart
 don't think that like
 Compromise compromising all of your wants is the only way you know, right? Right?
 I think you made the right choice in put the kibosh on it
 Because fool me once shame on me shame on you fool me twice shame on on me
 And wait, what do you what kiboshes has happened here? Well, she she broke it off
 And the writer you they broke it off what I
 Haven't finished reading this email yet. Oh, I thought I I thought they broke it. Oh shit
 We've just got we've gotten sidetracked
 What would I do if I only had six months left my reaction was I would call that guy and tell him don't say anything
 About anything. Let's just have some fun. Oh, no, that thought stopped me crying
 I asked myself seriously am I that shallow and my brain said yes
 Oh, you asked what I want and I told you if you can broker that deal
 I'm in after a cooling off period. I arranged to call him
 We agreed that being friends was a disaster and I said I had heard of the concept of sex clubs
 Where apparently you don't discuss politics, how would he feel about meeting as if we were at a sex club?
 He said I can be there in an hour and a half
 He added if I turn up and you decide no, I'll drive home and I'll not sulk about it, which was a helpful reassurance
 This guy definitely had a had has some reassuring qualities to him. Sure. This is smart. This is yes
 We had a better night than the first at the time of writing
 We meet every couple of months always checking. We're still okay with it and enjoying it while it lasts
 We've had some amazing times and he said and done some very kind and thoughtful things
 The kink exploring is going very well. I can't believe it took me this long to buy some sex toys
 I found he's a fan of Tim mentions poem
 Storm and of Penn and Teller's bullshit. So he has critical thinking awareness
 It's just well behind the times and certainly not helped by the media and politics that he follows
 Maybe some of my attitudes will rub off on him
 Maybe some other things will rub off on him too
 Hey as I try to avoid generalizing or being negative and I really try to understand rather than judge
 So am I naive?
 Liberated morally challenged making the world a slightly happier place or all of the above
 Thanks for reading fucking with the faces in a private sex dungeon after a good spanking tied with easy escape cuffs. That's anonymous
 Anonymous. Thank you so much for sharing and being so open with us
 That's this is a lot of fodder here to think go through those options again
 Am I go ahead Jacob am I it was it was a BC and date? Do you remember?
 Let's see. Am I let me find here
 As I try to avoid generalizing and or being negative and I try to understand rather than judge so am I am I naive
 You want to go to a one at a time am I naive no, I don't think so
 Liberated yes. Yes, you're liberated. Yes. Definitely. Am I morally challenged? No, no
 Don't think so making the world a slightly happier place. Yeah, I think so. Yes. Yes, that's it. No like yes
 I don't think you're naive. I don't think you're morally challenged. I think you are liberated
 I think you I think you are making the world a slightly happier place both for you and your companion
 Yeah, the like look you said you have kinks and fetishes, right?
 Like that's a it's often a very difficult conversation to broach on in a regular dating environment. You found someone who fits that bill
 You want me to put this light bulb where and they agree to everything right you put out everything you want it again
 You just did we just talked about without whether we didn't got to it
 You were like if it could be this and not that and always this and never that and he said yes you both
 Intelligently made an agreement. Will that get sloppy at some points or we end up in the conversation at some points sure
 But that happens in every relationship no matter what you're doing. Anyway, so like what you did do was actually you literally
 Came up with your most selfish list for this person to still be in your life
 And this person said they'd happily fit those parameters. That's awesome
 You laid it out this person accepted and it seems like it's going okay
 because now you might need another guy who's also dynamo in the boudoir and
 And then decide I don't need to meet this
 This this is this right winger for for private sex anymore that might happen
 But you you've actually allowed yourself to leave that door properly open, right?
 Right, if you were dysfunctionally dating this person and you were going to meet someone to be like, oh, but I'm dating someone
 Oh, but it might get messy now. Now you're fucked up, right?
 But you you have the exact sexual relationship you want with this person you want to use this person. He says use me
 You're in that spot you've appropriately set expectations
 Yes
 And now you if you would now encounter someone you could have a more fulfilling rich with you'd be able to move on to that thing
 No problem, right?
 Now, I think this is a nice thing. I think this is a nice thing anonymous
 Very much so speaking of nice things. It's gonna be nice. How about I beat Paul Matt and Chuck versus nerd?
 Yeah, I'm on the hunt for balls
