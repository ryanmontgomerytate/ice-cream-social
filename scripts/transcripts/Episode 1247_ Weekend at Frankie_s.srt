00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
 I'm here on the job site with Dale, who's a framing contractor.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,080
 Hey, good morning.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,000
 Dale traded up to Geico Commercial Auto Insurance for all his business vehicles.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,680
 We're here where he needs us most.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,800
 Yep, they sure are.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,480

 With coverage that fits his business and bottom line.

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,120
 Oh, shouldn't have looked down.

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,160
 It's all right.

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,520
 We're so far up here.

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,800
 Look at me. Take a deep breath.

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,040
 Oh, I'm good. So good.

13
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,800

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,000
 It feels good to Geico.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,600
 Now we're recording.

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,040
 Oh, we're starting now?

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,680
 Now we're recording.

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,640
 Classic Jacob fake outs. Classic Jacob fake outs.

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,760
 Fake in your ass.

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,240
 Hey, Johnny. Do you want to go to an ice cream social?

21
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,600
 Yeah, I'd love to.

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,800
 Great. Let's go.

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,320
 I'm wrecked.

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:08,320
 It's time for Matt Madden's ice cream social sitting right across from me is Paul Madden.

25
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,000
 Right next to me is Mr. Matt Donnelly.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,560
 Over there on his own damn couch is Jacob, the audio guy.

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,280
 We're gonna go.

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,880
 We're preaching fun.

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,680
 Yeah, we are.

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,200
 And we brought in Mitzi here.

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,920
 Mitzi is here.

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,000
 I had a couple of scoops reach out to be like, there's no churn, right?

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,120
 I was like, that is correct.

34
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,520
 I didn't think it was right to invite people both to Jacob's house and Paul's bedroom to

35
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,400
 record tonight because those are the two places that we are right now.

36
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,280
 It's a little much.

37
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,680
 Yeah, I couldn't handle other people tonight.

38
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,560
 I had to bribe Paul with noodles.

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,600
 Reclined.

40
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,120
 Paul is supine.

41
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,240
 We actually had to push to record because we were losing Paul before recording.

42
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,080
 You were falling asleep on that couch.

43
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,280
 Well, it's midnight.

44
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:53,440
 It's midnight by time and I go to bed at nine now and that's late.

45
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:53,840
 Yes.

46
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,680
 I think I just might need you to sit up.

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,200
 I think I might just have to have you sit up.

48
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,400
 You can ask.

49
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,400
 Could I make a formal request that Paul Mattingly sits up?

50
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,480
 You may file form B13.

51
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,000
 I'm attorney for Paul Mattingly.

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,360
 File some forms.

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,240
 I'm attorney for Paul Mattingly and your motion is denied.

54
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,800
 There you go.

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,560
 I was afraid of that.

56
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,520
 I decline to incline.

57
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,280
 I decline to incline.

58
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,520
 I will remain declined.

59
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,240
 Supine.

60
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,920
 Supine and so fine.

61
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,400
 Oh yeah.

62
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,120
 Oh, lupine.

63
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,760
 He's a werewolf.

64
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,320
 Je suis le loup garou, as the French would say.

65
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,600
 That means skin changer, ladies and gentlemen.

66
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,720
 Loup garou.

67
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,640
 Look, I don't want to change the mood too quickly.

68
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,760
 Oh, for God's sake.

69
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,760
 Let's pour one out for Terry Fader, shall we?

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,880
 Oh, baby.

71
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,760
 No, you know what?

72
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,480
 It's so funny.

73
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,240
 We were just talking about this at the restaurant.

74
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,760
 We went and got some noodles.

75
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,000
 The effort you just put into sitting up was pretty amazing.

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,640
 We went and got some noodles.

77
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,120
 That entire sentence that you just heard, listening audience, was Paul sitting up.

78
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,520
 No, that was like a 15-point K-turn with your body you were doing to just try to sit up.

79
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,560
 There are so many elements.

80
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,320
 Remember that scene from "Boston Powers" when he's turning the golf cart around in the tunnel?

81
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,440
 So many elements are on their way out in this apparatus.

82
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,960
 And this is good hip Paul.

83
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,520
 This is Paul.

84
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,160
 This is Paul.

85
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,040
 Paul is pointing at various places on his body.

86
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,080
 The hip is fine.

87
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,880
 He fruit all day.

88
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,160
 It's now shoulders.

89
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,960
 Yeah, and he was on a plane.

90
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,320
 And boy, are his shoulders tired.

91
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,080
 But the shoulders are real bad now.

92
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,800
 But whatever.

93
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,760
 No, but we were talking about this Terry Fader, the famous ventriloquist.

94
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,760
 Well, the first winner of "America's Got Talent."

95
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,440
 Yeah, winner of season one of "America's Got Talent."

96
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,120
 He's the one who made NBC learn that they had to sign those people to

97
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,320
 binding contracts before they got famous because it became much more difficult for

98
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,480
 them to negotiate with Terry Fader after he signed a $100 million deal at the Mirage.

99
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,240
 That's why some people were saying, "Oh really?

100
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,960
 I've never heard of him."

101
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,800
 That's because "America's Got Talent" never brought him back.

102
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,200
 That's right.

103
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,240
 Never put him in a montage.

104
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,640
 They didn't.

105
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,840
 They don't mention it. He does not come up.

106
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,000
 He was the first winner.

107
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,240
 He has Terry Fader from memory.

108
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,640
 Yeah.

109
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,080
 And what we think, what my, I think.

110
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,880
 So it's a big news story in Las Vegas because it was abrupt.

111
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,320
 He literally just was like, "Oh, by the way, I've done my last show."

112
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:10,800
 Right.

113
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,560
 It came out earlier today that tonight was going to be his final performance.

114
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,400
 He was in the theater at the Strat.

115
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,720
 Paul has a theory.

116
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,760
 It's not just a theory.

117
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,040
 I think it's legit.

118
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,760
 Well, let's go ahead for legal sake, call it a theory anyway.

119
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,560
 All right.

120
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,200
 Allegedly.

121
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,840
 Paul thinking it's legit does not make it so.

122
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,280
 I'm pretty sure Terry Fader thought he was going to get raptured.

123
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,960
 Do you know that there's like a rapture thing happening right now?

124
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,440
 Okay.

125
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:35,940
 Okay.

126
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,800
 I, this was, there's been numerous rapture rumors in my lifetime.

127
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,280
 Yes.

128
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,600
 Different religious apocalyptic predicted in my lifetime.

129
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,640
 The Mayan one, the Mayan calendar.

130
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,320
 And we're not talking Debbie Harry Blondie.

131
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,320
 This was so, this was so late.

132
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,240
 It came out like a day before.

133
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,600
 It was so late.

134
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,720
 So, so late to the party.

135
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,440
 Pretty abrupt.

136
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,040
 Next time there's a rapture.

137
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,520
 Okay.

138
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,920
 Here's what we need to do or someone needs to do.

139
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,000
 Mitzi, actually, you might be able to help us with this.

140
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,440
 Someone needs to ahead of time figure out what sports teams would be most affected.

141
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,800
 You should go around to every professional basketball team,

142
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,080
 every football team and figure out how many real big Jesus Christians there are on each team

143
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,000
 and talk about who's going to go in the rapture

144
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,200
 and how that will affect the team going forward if they don't have them.

145
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,600
 Right.

146
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,480
 Over, under, number of players.

147
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,840
 Who will handle the future's betting?

148
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,840
 So like, for instance, like Baker Mayfield's probably

149
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,840
 the biggest heathen quarterback we have in the league.

150
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,160
 Is he?

151
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,480
 Right.

152
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:26,800
 Okay.

153
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,000
 I'm just saying, I'm guessing.

154
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,640
 Okay, okay, good.

155
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,160
 I'm guessing just by his energy.

156
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,840
 I've never heard him thank God or Jesus.

157
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,160
 Okay.

158
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,880
 Maybe I'm wrong.

159
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,120
 I don't know.

160
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,160
 Somebody could correct me on this.

161
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,280
 But I think it'd be hilarious if like Baker-

162
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,560
 I don't have any counter arguments.

163
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,400
 Baker Mayfield just looks left and right and is like, oh shit,

164
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,360
 I'm like one of three starting quarterbacks left in the league.

165
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,480
 So, Paul, tell Matt what you were telling me earlier today.

166
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,920
 I didn't know that any of this was happening.

167
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:51,200
 So it has come up real quick, but apparently through many

168
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:57,280
 different channels within the social media forums and whatnot,

169
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,280
 people really think the shit's hitting the fan.

170
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,760
 If you go on Facebook Marketplace right now,

171
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,360
 it's a goddamn fire sale.

172
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,960
 People are just putting everything and everyone up for sale.

173
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,320
 Because they think they're about to get rapture.

174
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,600
 People are selling their houses.

175
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,320
 Do you want to know why?

176
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,360
 I do.

177
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,520
 They think they're going to get a rapture.

178
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:13,840
 Yeah.

179
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,120
 Tylenol is what's causing people to believe they're going to get rapture.

180
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,680
 It might be.

181
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,800
 Or is Tylenol causing people to get rapture?

182
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,720
 Is it possible that Tylenol has both created a god

183
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,640
 and has made that god rapture?

184
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,760
 Guys, I bought a pill from Dr. Oz that makes me rapture proof.

185
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,360
 So it's okay.

186
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,400
 They're like, if Kimmel's coming back on air, get me off this planet.

187
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,560
 Maybe.

188
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,840
 Jesus, take me away.

189
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,640
 Maybe.

190
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,640
 They're afraid this is the second coming.

191
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,960
 Oh shit, that's what it meant the whole time.

192
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,080
 It was three days.

193
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,800
 You know what?

194
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,240
 It could have been deeper than we even think.

195
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,400
 You know, old Orangey Borgie had a little trouble getting the words out the other day

196
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,560
 during the Tylenol debacle.

197
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,280
 I won't hear it.

198
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,320
 He's sharp as a tack.

199
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,280
 Well, he may have actually had something going on.

200
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,240
 You are saying that this Tylenol could be responsible for rapture type stuff.

201
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,920
 He might have actually been trying to say ascendametaphen.

202
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,320
 Oh, ascendametaphen.

203
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,600
 Not acedametaphen, ascendametaphen.

204
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,560
 I feel like that's all the funny that our listeners can handle today.

205
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,720
 It's more than they fucking deserve.

206
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
 It's more than they fucking deserve.

207
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,680
 Eat all my ass all day.

208
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,400
 Wow.

209
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:32,880
 Yeah.

210
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,360
 What?

211
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,240
 Yes, we heard it.

212
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,120
 Our listeners?

213
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,800
 I think he means Trump, not our listeners.

214
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,120
 Yeah.

215
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,360
 Oh, I thought you were talking to our listeners and so did some of our listeners.

216
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,240
 Well, some of them too.

217
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,080
 They know who they are.

218
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,880
 You know who you are.

219
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,600
 I know who they are.

220
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,280
 Well, he's easier to do the Jack versus Nerd than me.

221
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,240
 Fine, Paul, I'll leave.

222
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,200
 You don't have to be out.

223
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,000
 That's right.

224
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,960
 I just wanted to be a little--

225
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,160
 You don't have to yell into that mic.

226
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,560
 Come on, Mitzi.

227
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,440
 We can do the Christian.

228
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,680
 We can find out how many Christian athletes are on each team, right?

229
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,360
 I got told to eat the mic in the last studio.

230
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,920
 But you're doing great.

231
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,880
 But yeah, definitely we can find out how many Christian athletes there are in these teams.

232
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,160
 We just have to be on top of it next time.

233
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,480
 It's the only way I want to discuss the rapture.

234
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,840
 Did you hear anything?

235
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,080
 I did.

236
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,760
 I heard about the rapture this morning.

237
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,640
 Performative rapture.

238
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,680
 That people were thinking about that the rapture might happen.

239
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,760
 And I saw an atheist TikTok.

240
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,960
 I was like, great.

241
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,640
 Exactly.

242
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,240
 Exactly.

243
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,440
 But Paul was saying people were leaving notes and stuff for their neighbors.

244
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,160
 And I was like, these people think their neighbors are just heathens.

245
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,200
 Are they going to get raptured?

246
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,840
 All of my neighbors.

247
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,240
 Are you kidding?

248
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,520
 My whole neighborhood is like, guys,

249
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,800
 I'm surprised we didn't just have a bunch of keys in our mailbox.

250
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,000
 That's exactly it.

251
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,720
 These jabronis are like, oh, yeah, here's the instructions

252
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,000
 to how to get into my basement.

253
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,520
 And here's my key card.

254
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,240
 Two gay pride flags on our little sign in the front yard.

255
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,920
 You're going to be feeding so many of their pets.

256
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,960
 Yeah.

257
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,680
 Oh, exactly.

258
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,080
 Yeah, yeah.

259
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,520
 We've taken care of so many animals.

260
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,240
 That's the whole thing.

261
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,000
 All of us are going to be left here just raising dogs.

262
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,840
 I guess we've been joking around.

263
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,000
 I guess we should say wholeheartedly, that's fucking nuts.

264
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 That's really fucking crazy.

265
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,840
 But it's just that really crazy.

266
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,080
 That is one stance that we could take.

267
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,080
 And I agree that that is a viable stance that we could take.

268
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,520
 A different stance, though, that we could take is give us your shit.

269
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,480
 Power for the fucking question.

270
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,040
 If you're going to get-- because you know we're not going to get raptured.

271
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,560
 Literally, the second word in the description of this podcast is godless.

272
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,200
 Yes, godless.

273
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,920
 Well, that's the other fucking--

274
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,040
 We're not getting raptured.

275
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,760
 Leave us your shit.

276
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,240
 Yeah, that's the other--

277
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,800
 Just give it to us.

278
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,600
 The fucked up thing.

279
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,040
 There's straight up preachers who got their flock to give them everything.

280
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,440
 Of course.

281
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,040
 And they are in Barbados.

282
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,440
 They are gone.

283
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,240
 Yeah, they left.

284
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,280
 They did get raptured.

285
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,680
 Wait, so straight up religious cons.

286
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,000
 Yeah, there have been a lot of con jobs happening.

287
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,400
 Was the con job a side effect or the actual inspiration for this?

288
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,440
 Was the con job the plan?

289
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,400
 Side effect and rapture.

290
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,000
 Because from what I understand-- again--

291
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,760
 So how did this rapture ever get started?

292
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,240
 Exactly.

293
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,280
 Everybody's laced up part of here.

294
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,560
 We can't pin this one on the Mayans, guys.

295
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,560
 I heard this was one fucking guy, one guy on the TikTok somewhere, started this up.

296
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,280
 And everybody just started going, oh, OK, that sounds right.

297
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,400
 One guy couldn't have started this.

298
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,040
 Oh, no?

299
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,400
 No, I've got it right here.

300
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:15,280
 If you take one guy, and then you take one religious rapture, and then you have them

301
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,440
 give him stuff, nah, it doesn't work out.

302
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,000
 Jacob--

303
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,040
 The math doesn't check out.

304
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,360
 I think you'll find that one guy did change a lot of things.

305
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,840
 He had some pretty far out ideas about where we go after we pass on.

306
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:36,480
 We're long hair, walked everywhere, had a lot of people following him,

307
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,320
 had a lot of people hating him.

308
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,820
 Huh?

309
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,520
 Huh?

310
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,000
 Yeah.

311
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,800
 Persecution.

312
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

313
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,520
 That guy?

314
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,020
 Yeah.

315
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,060
 Pretend.

316
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,200
 Fuck you all!

317
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,760
 Fuck you all in the face and mouth forever.

318
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,120
 Bullshit fairy tale that someone pulled out of their dickhole.

319
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,760
 No, no, no, no.

320
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,240
 He was a beautifully pasty white Middle Eastern.

321
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,440
 Sure, you're right.

322
00:10:59,440 --> 00:10:59,840
 You're right.

323
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,880
 Golden-haired Middle Eastern.

324
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,560
 Golden-haired blue-eyed--

325
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,240
 Shredded white guy.

326
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,740
 Yeah.

327
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,160
 Super shredded.

328
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,640
 And if you don't believe--

329
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,760
 Mitzi has hit it right there.

330
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,720
 If you don't believe Jesus was beautiful and white, then I've had it.

331
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:10,960
 Every--

332
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,560
 What has happened to this country?

333
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:19,040
 Every crucified Catholic Christ has five-minute abs for days.

334
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,720
 Just fucking washboard.

335
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,040
 In fucking Belize a couple of months ago, we went into a church from the 1800s.

336
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,240
 They had a painted Christ on the wall there, literally painted on bright blue eyes.

337
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,760
 And there's like stone relief coming out of this thing from the middle--

338
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,040
 Or like early 1800s.

339
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,320
 I think it was like 1813 or something.

340
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,280
 It's just all so fucking stupid.

341
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,480
 And now we see it--

342
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,480
 If you want to sell a religion, you got to have some sex appeal.

343
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,520
 We're seeing it all writ large here in our own country,

344
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,760
 where it's all like, fuck history, fuck truth.

345
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,200
 Oh, I thought you were talking about the sex appeals thing.

346
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,000
 No, that too.

347
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,240
 Well, people do draw this president in all kinds of heroic, handsome poses all the time.

348
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,440
 People do that.

349
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,560
 They sure do.

350
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,720
 Definitely not for any reason other than truth.

351
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,800
 But this goes back to-- we went a little-- we got a little real,

352
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,240
 a little heavy in our last episode.

353
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,960
 Maybe you did.

354
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,880
 Paul's trying to warm up tonight.

355
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,600
 That moment of silence was Paul searching for remembering the last episode.

356
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,480
 I know, I remember it.

357
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,000
 A second ago, it was great because I got to watch him in the eyes,

358
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,240
 decide whether or not to just say Jesus was fake

359
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,400
 or to name another long-haired celebrity person

360
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,360
 that he could have been talking about the whole time.

361
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,960
 I was just going to say something real dumb,

362
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,480
 and I was trying to think of something real dumb.

363
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,040
 Yeah, yeah.

364
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,480
 Nothing's funny to joke about anymore.

365
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,440
 I was ready for Axl Rose.

366
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,720
 What, what, what, yeah, what, what was it?

367
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,520
 I was ready for Axl Rose.

368
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,760
 Axl Rose, but what am I-- who am I going to throw under the bus?

369
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,720
 I didn't say it was a good joke.

370
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,440
 I'm just saying.

371
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,080
 I was ready for it.

372
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,920
 Who am I going to even throw under the bus at this point?

373
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,000
 Who am I going to say, like, I don't know, I was--

374
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,240
 The lead singer of Mr. Big.

375
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,440
 It can't be Axl Rose because he's all Matt Steel Horse, so you can't--

376
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,440
 He was the lead singer of Mr. Big.

377
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,480
 All right, that's pretty good.

378
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,040
 That should have been the one I went with.

379
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,840
 Jim Morrison.

380
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,320
 More than words.

381
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,280
 Could have been Jim Morrison.

382
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,200
 You know, a long time ago, there was another guy.

383
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,720
 He chose to go a different route, if you know what I mean, you know?

384
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,120
 Shaked things up a little bit.

385
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,000
 Moved to the beat of his own drummer.

386
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,320
 A little left of center.

387
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,760
 He beat up his own drummer?

388
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,120
 He beat up his own drummer.

389
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,160
 I mean, probably.

390
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,000
 I mean, that's how you get through talking to the industry.

391
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,520
 That guy was Peter Gabriel.

392
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,960
 He got into a big fucking fight with Phil Collins

393
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,720
 and left Genesis.

394
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,760
 And that was the Genesis.

395
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,400
 That was the Genesis of the Book of Genesis.

396
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:36,960
 That's right.

397
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,460
 Yep.

398
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,040
 Sledgehammer.

399
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,120
 I know it was old, but I didn't know it was as old as Phil Collins.

400
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,960
 Sledgehammer.

401
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,760
 That also explains why the drummer had to-- the gorilla was the drummer.

402
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,240
 That's right.

403
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:46,720
 Yeah, that's right.

404
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,080
 They got into a fight and the drummer couldn't go.

405
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,200
 There it is.

406
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,640
 Yep.

407
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,520
 This is how things go.

408
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,720
 My right eye is filled with blood.

409
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,800
 We're all old hobbling into this school fest.

410
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,120
 Nothing has been stressing you lately, has it?

411
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,240
 Old damaged men.

412
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,280
 I literally had this thought multiple times, Super.

413
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,440
 I was like, turnouts are just easier.

414
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,120
 I was like, go somewhere else.

415
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,080
 Holy shit, are they?

416
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,800
 Do it for a day.

417
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,680
 Holy shit, are they?

418
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,600
 All right, everybody enjoy the last Scoop Fest.

419
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,560
 Hope you had a good one.

420
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,440
 No, no, no, no.

421
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,000
 See you at Turnout.

422
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,760
 We love doing Scoop Fest, but it is just so hard.

423
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,960
 And when it's over, it feels so much cooler to pull off than at Turnout.

424
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,680
 Yeah, certainly.

425
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,240
 Yeah.

426
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,520
 Oh, no, it's so much more rewarding.

427
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,600
 Actually, what a great, terrible segue.

428
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,840
 We actually can announce something pretty cool that's happening.

429
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,200
 Oh, yeah, that's true.

430
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,680
 Yeah, yeah.

431
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,560
 So for people who missed out on Scoop Fest,

432
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,200
 I have this event that's happening in New York.

433
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,000
 And so I asked Paul if he wanted to join me just for fun.

434
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,680
 This is a total coincidence, but we're doing just a--

435
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,000
 I'm calling it random comedy night for no reason.

436
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,520
 But Paul is going to come out to Tierney's.

437
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,040
 Paul and I are going to do a show at Tierney's.

438
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,840
 This will be great.

439
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,000
 Recreate the magic of the first pre-Scoop Fest, Scoop Fest.

440
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,480
 Yes.

441
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,680
 October 23rd, we're going to be out there.

442
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,760
 And part of it is because my buddy Kurt Braunler,

443
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,600
 who also performed at one of the Scoop Fests,

444
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,440
 he got hired by The Tonight Show.

445
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,240
 Oh, good for him.

446
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,600
 And The Tonight Show doesn't film on Fridays.

447
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,960
 So Kurt Braunler, when he told me he's moving back to Jersey,

448
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,240
 I said, I'm so jealous.

449
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,520
 I said, I'm going to come back to Jersey.

450
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,400
 We're going to do a show at Tierney's.

451
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,040
 He's like, yes.

452
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,960
 So Kurt's going to do Stand Up.

453
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,200
 Great.

454
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,520
 Fantastic.

455
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,400
 Paul and I are going to do Improv.

456
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:30,640
 Perfect.

457
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,520
 I'm going to do a little magic.

458
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,360
 And I reached out to my buddy Dion Flynn,

459
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,360
 who plays Barack Obama, another character on The Tonight Show,

460
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,520
 because he told me he moved to Montclair.

461
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:44,400
 I said, well, Kurt and I and my buddy Paul are going to come out to the thing.

462
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,520
 And he goes, I'm in.

463
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,480
 I go, this is hilarious.

464
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,120
 Fucking A.

465
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,240
 So I have Dion Flynn.

466
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,760
 This is a no-joke phase.

467
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,880
 This is a real thing.

468
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,920
 So then I reached out to my buddies from Possible Side Effects to live in Jersey.

469
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,960
 And I said, just so you know, I'm doing the thing with Kurt and Dion.

470
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,000
 And Paul's coming out.

471
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,400
 Wait a minute.

472
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,680
 Now I'm mad I'm not going.

473
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,240
 That's what I'm saying.

474
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,120
 Why aren't you?

475
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,240
 So now, Dijory Douche and Pat Shepard from Redbaker are all coming out.

476
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,000
 Because all that was before was you and Matt going and hanging out at Tierney's for a night.

477
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,760
 And that seems like a lot of money for me to throw away to just go hang out at Tierney's for a night.

478
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,040
 Here's the thing, Jacob.

479
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,560
 You should just want to hang out with me and Matt to start with.

480
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,200
 And then your dick wouldn't be caught in a wringer like it is now.

481
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,120
 So if you go to-- hopefully this is in the notes.

482
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,640
 But if you go to heyscoops.com/comedynight--

483
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,040
 Great.

484
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,680
 --you will find tickets available for it.

485
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,960
 There's just a--

486
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,880
 Not for long, motherfuckers.

487
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,440
 Probably not.

488
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,400
 It's not a huge venue.

489
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,360
 Get on that shit.

490
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,000
 It's coming up soon.

491
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,440
 We're charging 20 bucks.

492
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,720
 30 bucks if you want a guaranteed seat because it's Tierney's and there's like four tables.

493
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,840
 Sorry, I just bought them all.

494
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,840
 They're now $50 on the secondary market.

495
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,320
 No.

496
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,000
 On the secondary market.

497
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Minsey Ticks got scalped on us.

498
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,920
 So it's a total random Tierney's comedy night, October 23, Thursday.

499
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,120
 Paul and I, it's going to be--

500
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,600
 And it's an easy jaunt for me.

501
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,640
 It's an hour flight.

502
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,720
 It's like I'd be losing money, not going.

503
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,680
 We're just-- yeah.

504
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,280
 I'm just picking up Paul at the airport and we're going to head over to Montclair.

505
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,160
 This is hilarious.

506
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,560
 Yeah.

507
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,520
 So it is--

508
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,200
 It's hilarious how much it's blown up.

509
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,600
 I know.

510
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,520
 It's like exploded.

511
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,520
 There's actually another name of a person I want to reach out to.

512
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,120
 I won't say it now because I think someone might say yes if I reach out to them.

513
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:21,600
 I think they will.

514
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,320
 Is it Letterman?

515
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:22,800
 It's Letterman.

516
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,240
 Well, I mean, no.

517
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,520
 It's already lining up, so--

518
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

519
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,480
 There's another Jersey guy that a lot of our listeners like.

520
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,360
 Frankie Valli?

521
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,080
 Frankie Valli.

522
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,960
 God damn you, Minsey.

523
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,360
 I told you.

524
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:31,840
 I'm not going to do it.

525
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,600
 Sorry, that was totally a confident death.

526
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,600
 Yeah, I feel like we'd make Frankie Valli happen.

527
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,400
 Danny DeVito.

528
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,840
 Buzz Aldrin.

529
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,680
 I think I can get Buzz Aldrin to stop by.

530
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,360
 I'm standing still as I can.

531
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,120
 OK, if you get Buzz to come, I'm in.

532
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,640
 Imagine Jackie's like, "God damn it.

533
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,680
 I could have hung out with Buzz Aldrin."

534
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,160
 I'm alive.

535
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,000
 I could have punched people with Buzz Aldrin.

536
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,760
 If I could have hung out with Buzz Aldrin.

537
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,320
 If I could have just gotten drunk with Buzz Aldrin, I'll be so mad.

538
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:04,000
 If I'm alive or dead, I may be a mannequin who can sing.

539
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,360
 I forgot what Bitt Paul's doing.

540
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:05,920
 I'm standing very still.

541
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,640
 He's Frankie Valli.

542
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,960
 He showed up at Frank Tierney's.

543
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,360
 I'm almost motionless.

544
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:20,640
 Can someone put a mirror near my nose to see if I'm breathing?

545
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,680
 Hey, man, he's someone who keeps one of our listeners kind of employed.

546
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,040
 We've got to be careful with Frankie.

547
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,560
 I got nothing but love for Frankie Valli.

548
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,480
 They're coming out with a new movie, Weekend at Frankie's.

549
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,720
 No one doubts that being true.

550
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,280
 No one's like, "I have tied his shoelaces to my shoelaces right now."

551
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,840
 They should just call it Jersey Boys 2 and steal the plot of Weekend at Bernie's.

552
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,040
 That would be a hilarious thing to film for just the cast.

553
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,200
 They should get Kenny's to direct that one, too.

554
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,200
 They hollowed my body out and fucking Teddy Ruxpin'd me.

555
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,440
 For that one, would they also ignore the fact that they're a movie?

556
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,680
 I've got a cassette tape in my belly and I just play the hits.

557
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,320
 I'm the fucking Teddy Ruxpin.

558
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,440
 Frankie Valli Ruxpin.

559
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,880
 And then the tape gets caught.

560
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,160
 I went to Sam's Club today to buy some stuff for Scoop Fest.

561
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,720
 How deep are we at?

562
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,440
 Should we do an ad?

563
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,640
 Oh, sure.

564
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,520
 Before your transition?

565
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,960
 Yeah, let's do an ad.

566
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,440
 Not to be.

567
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,840
 Following sponsor.

568
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,400
 Today's show...

569
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,240
 It's going to be a long week, folks.

570
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,680
 If you had two eyes, you would have nailed that.

571
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:43,520
 Today's show is brought to you by Pee Pee Vajayjay's Toilet Hole Lubricant.

572
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,640
 Get rid of the stick.

573
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,920
 That's right. That's Pee Pee Vajayjay's Toilet Hole Lubricant.

574
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,480
 Get rid of the stick.

575
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,880
 That's from Paul's brother in 2024.

576
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,120
 Oh, god damn it.

577
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,920
 I'm so tired of stabbing my turds down the toilet.

578
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,760
 Tired of it.

579
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,480
 Tired of it.

580
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,160
 I got so bad last year after I had some of my favorite milk thistle.

581
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,680
 I had to get a fucking rake.

582
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,760
 I bought a big garden rake for my toilet.

583
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,120
 You believe that shit?

584
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,080
 A whole garden rake.

585
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,560
 It was said up to 40 pounds and it broke in my toilet.

586
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:25,520
 Anyway, get some of my lube for your pipes.

587
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,480
 Basically, it is...

588
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,240
 Raccoon squeezes.

589
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,920
 Squeezes?

590
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:41,280
 You catch you a raccoon and you squeeze that motherfucker until stuff comes out.

591
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,320
 There is nothing slicker than a raccoon squeezes.

592
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,520
 Enter Hayscoops at checkout.

593
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,280
 Then just the poop goes right down.

594
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,360
 Matt.

595
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,280
 I just want you guys to know that you guys...

596
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,480
 Off air we said we should text Spadoni early to make sure he shows up on time.

597
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,640
 And then I told him to come early.

598
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,960
 And he wrote back like, "Why are you having me come so early?"

599
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,080
 Did you say cuz...

600
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,280
 Spadoni.

601
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,760
 He's like, "I thought the show was at seven. What the hell is going on?"

602
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,640
 I'll be there at six, six and a half.

603
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,080
 Because he thinks we're going to stage an intervention.

604
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,480
 That's why.

605
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,280
 No, we would never.

606
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,640
 I don't want to step on that genius.

607
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,000
 You ride that white dragon to the fucking cow come home.

608
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,960
 A pretty corpse.

609
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,440
 That's right.

610
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,720
 Matt.

611
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,400
 What time is loading tomorrow, Jacob?

612
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,360
 It's for another person.

613
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,760
 We're meeting at the...

614
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,160
 Oh, we're meeting at the house at noon, but he's not meeting at the house.

615
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,240
 No.

616
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,040
 So Orleans shortly afternoon.

617
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,200
 I'll say one.

618
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,760
 Great.

619
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,640
 We'll be there by one.

620
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,440
 One-ish.

621
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,560
 It won't take us that long to load up the truck before going to the Orleans.

622
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,280
 We hope.

623
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,720
 Production meeting.

624
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,000
 All right. It's just, it's happening.

625
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,760
 That's all. I'm just getting these texts out of the way.

626
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,640
 I know this is good.

627
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,520
 I don't blame you.

628
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,560
 This has been my life.

629
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:56,960
 The last several days.

630
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,160
 What are you holding in your hands, Paul?

631
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,120
 I hold in my hands more circle dots.

632
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,400
 This is for you.

633
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,320
 Your son can read it after you read it.

634
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,120
 Is this the trade?

635
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,600
 This is the trade of absolute Batman.

636
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,880
 So this is the first trade.

637
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,160
 So when I was young, I liked Batman.

638
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,640
 Yes.

639
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,920
 And I collected all the comics.

640
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,000
 And as the real world has caught up with everything, Batman's got...

641
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,920
 You mean the MTV reality show.

642
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,400
 The real...

643
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:20,960
 Correct.

644
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,760
 No, the real world.

645
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,480
 No, no.

646
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:22,800
 Oh.

647
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,200
 I mean...

648
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,240
 Road rules.

649
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:24,800
 Road rules.

650
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,120
 Ah.

651
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,680
 Challenge.

652
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,160
 Rapture edition.

653
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,680
 Where we get our next president from.

654
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,160
 Yeah.

655
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,520
 What's that empty RV?

656
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:39,440
 Okay. So basically what made Batman fascinating was that through his millions of dollars,

657
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,520
 he had advanced technology and military technology and all that.

658
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,240
 But now police all have that now too.

659
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,480
 Right.

660
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,640
 So it's like, it's weird to have Batman show up and be like, but me, but more so.

661
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,320
 But mine have bats on them.

662
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,720
 So Paul tipped me off to this new Batman comic called Absolute Batman.

663
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,680
 Paul?

664
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,040
 Yep.

665
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,840
 Take it from here, buddy.

666
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,800
 It's a reboot.

667
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,760
 Paul has made it backwards.

668
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,520
 Scott Snyder.

669
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,920
 Scott Snyder, the bat genius himself.

670
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,440
 Yes.

671
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,680
 He keeps knocking them out of the park.

672
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,640
 This is no different.

673
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,760
 This book is incredible.

674
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,800
 It is a re-imagining of the origin of the bat.

675
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,880
 He is a...

676
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,160
 He's still Bruce Wayne.

677
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,640
 Yep.

678
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:31,600
 He is a son's father, but his mother yet lives.

679
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,080
 Ah.

680
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,800
 She...

681
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,680
 Lucky lady.

682
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,040
 Does not have the money.

683
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,680
 He is a construction worker and a brilliant student.

684
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,720
 Okay.

685
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,200
 So he's got a lot of the tropes, but none of the cash.

686
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,400
 Okay.

687
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,960
 But at the same time, he works construction.

688
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:58,480
 So he is built like a fucking truck and his gadgets are like fucking the constructicons,

689
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:58,960
 basically.

690
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,360
 Okay.

691
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,840
 He comes at criminals with like backhoes and shit.

692
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,280
 He's got...

693
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,560
 You see his chest?

694
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,360
 I'd be scared.

695
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:12,320
 So he has a very big blunt looking emblem that doubles as an axe blade.

696
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,720
 Oh, he just like takes that off his chest.

697
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:14,880
 Yeah.

698
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,920
 He just goes, he takes a stick, sticks it at his chest and goes, "Let's fucking dance."

699
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,240
 And it's really cool.

700
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:22,880
 So it's like...

701
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,440
 His first move in a fight is to stab himself.

702
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,560
 Supposedly stab himself in the chest with a stick.

703
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,240
 He doesn't stab himself in the chest.

704
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,640
 What the perspective from his opponent would be.

705
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,440
 Yeah, kind of.

706
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,560
 This is a square up with somebody that's going to make you leave.

707
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,920
 Yeah, I'm out.

708
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,680
 And it's badass.

709
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,800
 There's all kinds of...

710
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,880
 There's an interesting take on the whole bat background.

711
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,920
 I don't want to spoil it all.

712
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,240
 That's fine.

713
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,280
 I want you guys to read it.

714
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,480
 I like that...

715
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,600
 It's called Absolute Batman.

716
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,560
 The fact that he's not a rich guy is...

717
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,960
 It's a big part of it and everybody's slightly just left the center.

718
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,720
 Alfred Pennyworth is in it, but he's not the Alfred Pennyworth we know.

719
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,880
 It's just all kinds of everything.

720
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,160
 It's just a little off center and off kilter, but it's wonderful.

721
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,400
 It's the best way to do it, to retell myths.

722
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,400
 It's almost like if someone were to take the story of Hercules

723
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:21,040
 and rejigger that a little bit, maybe add a little more of a downer ending.

724
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,640
 Let's see where we can take that.

725
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,120
 I wonder.

726
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,640
 I don't know what you're referencing.

727
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,760
 Are you referencing Samson?

728
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,920
 I'm referencing the whole goddamn Bible.

729
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,280
 Yeah, it's just Hercules, guys.

730
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,120
 Wait, Hercules wasn't born in the Middle East?

731
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,960
 Take it out.

732
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,520
 Semantics.

733
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,360
 I would try to call you on this, Paul, but all my Bibles disappeared today,

734
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,120
 so I can't find them anywhere.

735
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,400
 The Bible's weird.

736
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,520
 I can't read them anywhere.

737
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,920
 There's several absolutes in the lines.

738
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,560
 Aren't there now, though?

739
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,760
 There's a couple that have other retellings.

740
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,560
 There are.

741
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,840
 By the way, I'm just going to go back for a second.

742
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,600
 You really don't deserve enough credit for saying

743
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,000
 that Terry Fader thought he was going to get raptured.

744
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,920
 I really think it's a really good theory.

745
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,120
 It's what happened.

746
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,640
 I guarantee you it's what happened.

747
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,360
 If it's not the whole reason, it's part of the reason.

748
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,480
 Yeah, it was in there.

749
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,600
 Yeah, I think that.

750
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,720
 I hope.

751
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,040
 Because every fucking show, he's got to be like, "I love you!"

752
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,120
 So those Las Vegas media has listened to us.

753
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,200
 We've been quoted in some articles.

754
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,680
 It'd be great if we made any of the trades.

755
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,600
 Just vital Vegas real quick.

756
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,520
 Vital Vegas, hit up Terry.

757
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,080
 Or Johnny Katz, hit up Terry.

758
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,320
 Did the rapture factor into your quitting?

759
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,400
 Maybe he was afraid that his audience was going to get raptured,

760
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,000
 and that was like two days of his ticket sales.

761
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,880
 That's quite possible.

762
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,800
 With the Batman thing, he's also got these funky things on his arms

763
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,400
 that more closely replicate a bat's physiology.

764
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,440
 So that's kind of neat, too.

765
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,200
 But yeah, it's a whole new line of absolutes right now.

766
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,080
 There's Absolute Batman, Absolute Wonder Woman, Absolute Flash,

767
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,440
 and Absolute Superman, and Absolute Green Lantern.

768
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,200
 I have read Batman, and I just got through the first trade

769
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,320
 of Absolute Wonder Woman, which is fucking brilliant.

770
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,440
 And I picked it up because it's gotten so much hype.

771
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,560
 Overall, those are kind of the two standouts.

772
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,080
 They're all apparently real good,

773
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,000
 so I might even have to dip in some more.

774
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,720
 Much as I'm a Marvel kid, I like me some bats every now and then,

775
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,800
 and I don't read much Wonder Woman at all.

776
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,480
 But that Absolute Wonder Woman is fan-fucking-tastic.

777
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,680
 It's a seven-issue arc.

778
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,640
 Were you texting anyone?

779
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,280
 No, what do you call it?

780
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,800
 No, it's really, really good.

781
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:34,560
 No, I was checking on ChatGPT to find out what the origin of this Rapture thing right now is.

782
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,280
 Please find out.

783
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:35,760
 I want to know.

784
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,160
 No, I've got it.

785
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,560
 I've got it now.

786
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,840
 OK, so real quick.

787
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,240
 I was like, we could text a reporter or two.

788
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,560
 So Matt, I really do hope you read it.

789
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:52,160
 See if someone wants to go on air right now.

790
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,200
 It'd be really funny.

791
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,200
 It'd be really funny.

792
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,760
 Well, I really do hope you read it, and I hope you like it.

793
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,240
 I'm going to read it.

794
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,680
 And then I hope you give it to your kid.

795
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:04,400
 Because I'm leaving from ScoopFest to go on three weeks of cruise.

796
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:04,880
 Yeah.

797
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,400
 I was like, you're going to have hours of that time.

798
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,680
 Yeah, you're going to have some time.

799
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,360
 So I'm absolutely packing that.

800
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:17,200
 So this current Rapture myth is all apparently-- by the way, I feel like me doing a search is,

801
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,800
 why is there a big Rapture rumor right now into an open AI chatbot?

802
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,280
 It might be a sign of the Rapture.

803
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,560
 Sure.

804
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:26,960
 Just saying.

805
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:37,040
 But apparently, a South African pastor named Joshua M-H-L-A-K-E-L-A claims he received a

806
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,960
 vision that the Rapture would occur on September 23rd or 24th.

807
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,480
 Apparently, Jesus in the vision was not specific between the 23rd or 24th,

808
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,000
 or perhaps he hadn't made his mind up yet.

809
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,800
 Was there a time zone?

810
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,760
 There's always wiggle room.

811
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,440
 There's always wiggle room when you go back.

812
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,360
 But then that has apparently just gone crazy.

813
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,280
 This is where I think we're not a cult.

814
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,680
 I really-- I know that we joke going, oh, we're not a cult.

815
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,800
 I'm just like, we are a cult.

816
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,120
 No, we're not.

817
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,440
 We?

818
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:01,920
 Us?

819
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,360
 I don't think we could pull off Rapture.

820
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,240
 No, fucking no.

821
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,120
 I don't think we could pull it off.

822
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,480
 I don't think we could pull off anything.

823
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:06,640
 No.

824
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,360
 I wouldn't want to pull off anything malicious.

825
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,200
 We didn't even win "Best of Vegas" podcast.

826
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,560
 There is one thing that I thought about yesterday that I was like, if we did--

827
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,560
 By the way, I got straight to-- you were right, by the way.

828
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,280
 Did you know that?

829
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:19,760
 Sorry.

830
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,800
 We're all over the place today.

831
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,840
 No, we're very smart today.

832
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,960
 The organization that gave out the awards--

833
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,440
 Oh, yeah.

834
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,520
 --had editorial license over the awards.

835
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:27,840
 Yeah.

836
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,240
 No, I figured that had to be.

837
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,120
 And so the popular vote was not the only determining thing.

838
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,880
 So the people who won--

839
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,520
 I'll just say it.

840
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,040
 David Figgler was like, hey, by the way.

841
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,520
 And he was like, just so you know.

842
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,880
 The reason why is that they thought we were going to buy advertising from them.

843
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,440
 And that's why they--

844
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:41,920
 Oh, OK, great.

845
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,400
 No, honestly, I assumed that it was because they were looking for podcasts about Las Vegas.

846
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,080
 He's one of the people I thought I could text right now.

847
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,720
 I'd get on the air and ask him about Terry Fader.

848
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,360
 He might.

849
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,080
 He might bite.

850
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,640
 Yeah, he did.

851
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,240
 No, I was like, I thought that they were--

852
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,480
 I thought we had been edited out of it, because I couldn't see a way that we

853
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,840
 wouldn't have won that when the other two things we pushed both won.

854
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,600
 Every year, they tried to look up Jacob's Whiskey Pit.

855
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,080
 They were like--

856
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,960
 Yeah, I was like, they looked at Jacob's Whiskey Pit and said it wasn't a real thing.

857
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,240
 And they looked at us and said, we're not a podcast about Las Vegas.

858
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,280
 And that's not what they were looking for.

859
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,880
 I mean, I was fine with it.

860
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,840
 But I figured that's what happened.

861
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,320
 It's not me.

862
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,760
 I'm still burning in Vegas.

863
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,200
 I'm burning with anger.

864
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,000
 What can I say?

865
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,400
 I'm going to fucking burn that place to the ground.

866
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,320
 I don't remember who was giving out the award, but I remember.

867
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,520
 I will burn it to the ground.

868
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,640
 I will burn it to the ground.

869
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,120
 Whatever news source we don't give a shit about, it was giving out that award.

870
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,600
 I wanted it.

871
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,880
 No, no.

872
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,040
 We love that news source and think they're very reputable,

873
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,640
 because they gave awards to two of our friends.

874
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,200
 That's right.

875
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,680
 Yes.

876
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,720
 We love that news source.

877
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,280
 They're great.

878
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,160
 They hooked up.

879
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,840
 They gave awards to PIF and to SJ.

880
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,200
 Tertiary people in our orbit.

881
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,600
 Speaking of SJ, this is one thing I thought of yesterday.

882
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,920
 I was like, if we pulled the trigger on this, I feel like the scoops--

883
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,800
 a group of scoops, perhaps, would be unleashed.

884
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,280
 OK.

885
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:57,920
 And that is, there has been, over the last day or so, someone fucking with SJ online,

886
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,680
 with band stuff.

887
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,160
 And I think it has been quashed now.

888
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,360
 I think it's done now.

889
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:03,680
 OK.

890
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,160
 Whoa.

891
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,080
 But there was a few hours that I was like,

892
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:12,080
 I might just call this guy out online and just say what has been happening with this

893
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,160
 and just let the scoops fucking go hog.

894
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,400
 Like, basically docks the scoops on him.

895
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,440
 Dare we?

896
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:17,920
 Dare we?

897
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,960
 I was like, I can't do it.

898
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,520
 I can't do it.

899
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,520
 I can't use the scoops for evil.

900
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,120
 But I was like, if I just said--

901
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,120
 I don't want anybody to harm anybody, first of all.

902
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,000
 Let me be very blunt.

903
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,120
 I don't want anybody to harm anybody.

904
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,520
 No.

905
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,360
 Some of those people that fucked us out of that award.

906
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,000
 Yeah, except for them.

907
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,520
 I want to harm them badly.

908
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,720
 Anyone fucking with Garbage Man Batman.

909
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,220
 Yeah.

910
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:43,360
 But there was a misunderstanding through a booking thing and everything with the band.

911
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,720
 And there was a request.

912
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,880
 It doesn't matter what any of the details were.

913
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,560
 Someone took their petty shit to the internet.

914
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,440
 That's it.

915
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,000
 That's it.

916
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,720
 And put videos out and comments and like--

917
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,200
 Oh, no.

918
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,680
 Really kind of went like, burn the bridges behind them.

919
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,240
 Oh, dear.

920
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,080
 Type raid on SJ's social media stuff.

921
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:02,640
 That's--

922
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,880
 And I was like, I'm about to fucking turn the digital scoops loose on this motherfucker.

923
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:14,640
 Because I was like, the only things that we could do with this guy we have done,

924
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,560
 which is basically reply to his initial message saying, here's why this got lost.

925
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,200
 Whatever.

926
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,480
 He accused her of ghosting.

927
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,200
 This person accused the band and especially SJ of ghosting him.

928
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,000
 Said that SJ wasn't a real name.

929
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,600
 Made a parody porn thing that we were told about.

930
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,960
 So this person really wanted to inflict pain.

931
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,440
 Yeah, yeah.

932
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,280
 And was going after different--

933
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,120
 But apparently, everything's been taken down now.

934
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,480
 A parody porn.

935
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,440
 We've been told.

936
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,480
 I have no idea.

937
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,040
 That is the worst--

938
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,920
 Don't send that to me.

939
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,320
 Don't put that in my inbox.

940
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,240
 No, thank you.

941
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,040
 Gross.

942
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,800
 Parody porn was reported to us by one person.

943
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,120
 What kind of URL would that be, exactly?

944
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,000
 We didn't see what it was.

945
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,080
 Apparently, it was on OnlyFans.

946
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,960
 Oh, OK.

947
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,080
 Apparently, it was on OnlyFans.

948
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,280
 Under what, though?

949
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,080
 I don't know.

950
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:04,640
 Under what now?

951
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,320
 Under what names and--

952
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:06,880
 Weird.

953
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,320
 What specific search would you like to do?

954
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,560
 Yeah, how would you find something like that?

955
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,120
 There's definitely ghosts there.

956
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,360
 Paul was talking about this awesome OnlyFans he found at dinner.

957
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,760
 Like, the kind you can save to your files.

958
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,400
 And can I introduce this guy to my wife also?

959
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,360
 And can he put my wife in your wife?

960
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,920
 Just because he's so mad?

961
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,160
 Yeah.

962
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,520
 Oh, boy.

963
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,240
 But I was like, if I--

964
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,440
 I hope he doesn't get mad with me.

965
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,240
 If I start explaining this to, like, publicly, I was like, scoops will--

966
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,280
 Oh, it would have gone crazy.

967
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,120
 Because scoops would have gone crazy.

968
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,560
 There are some scoops, especially, that would go crazier on that than would go--

969
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,200
 than they would go if somebody had come after me, certainly.

970
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,400
 I have never worried that if any one of us three are wrongfully besmirched,

971
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,960
 that we would have not--

972
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,320
 Don't you be besmirching.

973
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,120
 I say wrongfully besmirched.

974
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,360
 We could be righteously besmirched.

975
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,760
 There's plenty of opportunity for us.

976
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,240
 That's correct.

977
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,040
 So please don't do that.

978
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,640
 No one righteously besmirches us.

979
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,920
 There's plenty of opportunities for us to put our fucking foot in the water.

980
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,280
 My life is very fragile.

981
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,240
 Or wrongly.

982
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,320
 Though wrongly or rightly besmirched.

983
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,400
 Just know that it's a house of cards.

984
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,280
 You know, any--

985
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,480
 We're barely being held together.

986
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,480
 My eye is filled with blood.

987
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,520
 Take a mess of one eye.

988
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,920
 Any one of us could throw rice on the fire.

989
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:24,320
 But we hopefully would not do something intentionally wrong.

990
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,360
 But if we ever did get called out for some bullshit,

991
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,400
 I know we'd have a lot of--

992
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,600
 Scoops would have backs.

993
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,440
 In-- we're not-- you basically got squashed today.

994
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,040
 I believe it is squashed.

995
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,680
 OK.

996
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,960
 So nothing new happened today?

997
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,840
 Nothing new happened today.

998
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,360
 There was an email this morning.

999
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,280
 But nothing new has happened since that email this morning.

1000
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,240
 And it seemed, after we got that email--

1001
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,760
 I'm not being vague about that.

1002
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,080
 The email just saying, like, everything is done.

1003
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,480
 From a-- this was an email from a third party,

1004
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,240
 saying it appears that everything has been deleted.

1005
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,440
 Everything looks good.

1006
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,440
 So someone stepped in.

1007
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,280
 Well, a third party.

1008
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,920
 Not an official third party, but like a friend of his.

1009
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,800
 Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1010
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,280
 Yeah.

1011
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,280
 You may not be far enough away from it.

1012
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,640
 Yeah.

1013
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,440
 But actually, what you've just said is, like, so sad.

1014
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,840
 Oh, no.

1015
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,120
 It's horrible.

1016
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:11,920
 Do you know what I mean?

1017
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,520
 Like, in other words, like, that was--

1018
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,800
 Oh, I'm not mad about it at all.

1019
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,200
 I am-- I feel horribly for this person.

1020
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:17,680
 That's what I mean.

1021
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,120
 It's like, that person really thought

1022
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,320
 they were going to scorch Earth.

1023
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,720
 And the result of it was like, wait, what'd you do?

1024
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,200
 Yeah.

1025
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,040
 Like, it's like, aw.

1026
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,760
 Oh, no.

1027
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,560
 It's bad.

1028
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:26,880
 Yeah.

1029
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,120
 It's bad from every angle.

1030
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,080
 It really is.

1031
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,640
 Because it's like, he failed at that part.

1032
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,360
 The whole thing was silly.

1033
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,960
 Yeah.

1034
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,640
 At one-- yeah, there was a lot of just weird accusations

1035
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,920
 and weird things and lawsuits being threatened.

1036
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,200
 And which I'm like, literally made a song request

1037
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,640
 and is now threatening a lawsuit.

1038
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,040
 And like, did Alison feel like-- I'm sorry, SJ.

1039
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,400
 Did SJ feel like--

1040
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,200
 [LAUGHTER]

1041
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,320
 Also, like, that's why your real name is a weird fucking

1042
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,360
 debate to have online.

1043
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,200
 Pretend that she has a fake name is really funny.

1044
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,880
 On the internet, like, where people

1045
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,800
 don't have fake names already?

1046
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,440
 And I was like, you're-- you are a public figure.

1047
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,000
 Yeah.

1048
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,480
 It's easy to find out who you are.

1049
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:10,960
 Yeah.

1050
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,480
 That your name is SJ.

1051
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,840
 This is all-- this is ridiculous.

1052
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,040
 That's so strange.

1053
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,360
 Now, if you want to say that's not her real hair color--

1054
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,000
 Oh, no.

1055
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,960
 I'm going to fight you.

1056
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,760
 Yeah.

1057
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,480
 It is real.

1058
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,640
 But on the OnlyFans, the curtains match the drapes.

1059
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,240
 So you don't have to worry about that.

1060
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,320
 Ooh, a natural redhead.

1061
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,040
 Nope.

1062
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,040
 On my wife, there are neither curtains nor drapes.

1063
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,120
 Where would you possibly find that?

1064
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,320
 There are shutters.

1065
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,200
 Where could that be?

1066
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,320
 Shutters?

1067
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,200
 Oh, god.

1068
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,480
 She just wears a helmet?

1069
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,280
 Yes.

1070
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,080
 No, she has like a--

1071
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,440
 But tornadoes don't affect her.

1072
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,200
 She has a bevy of ticks down there.

1073
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,000
 Oh, no.

1074
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,280
 A bevy.

1075
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,000
 It's a bunch of-- it's a bunch of engorged ticks.

1076
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,520
 You know who else has a bevy of engorged ticks

1077
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,040
 instead of genitalia?

1078
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,520
 No, no, no.

1079
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,880
 She got the genitalia.

1080
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,680
 It's in place of pub-- pubis-- pardon me.

1081
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,080
 Pubis.

1082
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:00,720
 You know who else has a bevy of ticks instead of pubic hairs?

1083
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,640
 Blood engorged ticks.

1084
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,240
 The following sponsor, Yeti and Andretti's Spaghetti

1085
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,280
 and Confetti.

1086
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,960
 This is from episode 507.

1087
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,160
 Jeez, that's so old.

1088
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:10,800
 This is Ranchan.

1089
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,680
 I did that already.

1090
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,560
 Ranchan bringing it back in 2024.

1091
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,320
 This is Ranchan wanting it back.

1092
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,360
 This is fine.

1093
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,480
 This is fine practice because we're

1094
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,680
 doing Hollywood Squares with you this year.

1095
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,240
 That's right.

1096
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,120
 Yeti might be in there.

1097
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:25,760
 That's all right, Yeti.

1098
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,400
 You know exactly what time it is.

1099
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,000
 It's time for Yeti and Andretti's

1100
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,680
 Confetti Spaghetti.

1101
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,800
 That's right.

1102
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,760
 Everybody love it.

1103
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,120
 It's a party when the Confetti Spaghetti come out.

1104
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,720
 It's always al dente when I crash into the wall.

1105
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,000
 [INAUDIBLE]

1106
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,720
 You're right.

1107
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,080
 I drive pretty good.

1108
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,440
 I make a joke.

1109
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,280
 But it's no joke when you're hungry for colorful pasta shapes

1110
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,680
 and you want something to fill your belly.

1111
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,680
 Go ahead and order up a big plate of Yeti and Andretti's

1112
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,080
 Confetti Spaghetti just 10 minutes in the pot.

1113
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,800
 And mom, you're going to love how it tastes.

1114
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,440
 And dad, you're going to love how it feels.

1115
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,440
 And babies and kids, they're going

1116
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:16,640
 to love how it looks because it's colors, like a rainbow.

1117
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,000
 [INAUDIBLE]

1118
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,960
 You're right, Yeti.

1119
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,560
 I forgot to mention it's loaded with protein

1120
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,680
 and low in saturated fat now.

1121
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,480
 So go ahead and eat your pasta confidently.

1122
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,040
 Yeti and Andretti's Confetti Spaghetti.

1123
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,840
 Come and get it before it goes cold.

1124
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:46,000
 [INAUDIBLE]

1125
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,920
 And red number five.

1126
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,360
 Thank you.

1127
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,720
 Hey, Scoops, a check out.

1128
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,800
 ChatGPT can't find any credible evidence

1129
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,880
 that Terry Fader quit his Las Vegas show

1130
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,400
 because of the Rapture.

1131
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,920
 He gave no reasons, though.

1132
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,320
 No.

1133
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,520
 And didn't return phone calls.

1134
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,000
 No.

1135
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,200
 He hits the Rapture.

1136
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,480
 Because he had been Raptured?

1137
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,160
 No, he just wanted to be ready.

1138
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:13,040
 For Vegas style, like typical Las Vegas stuff, is that--

1139
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,080
 Well, usually you want to get a last minute boost of ticket sales.

1140
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,120
 Well, here's the thing.

1141
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,400
 You want to announce the show is closing.

1142
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:18,720
 Right.

1143
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,000
 And get a little bit of that last minute influx of cash.

1144
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,240
 Yeah, here's the thing.

1145
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,440
 Maybe it wasn't him, but he's in those circles.

1146
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,720
 His fans were getting Raptured.

1147
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,920
 He was worried he was going to have ticket sales.

1148
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,960
 Maybe not fans, but possibly family, you know?

1149
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,480
 Could have been like, Terry, I'm getting ready to go meet the Lord.

1150
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,080
 It's like, well, I better go down to go see Grandma one more time

1151
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,320
 because she's going to be jumping off the roof.

1152
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,720
 No, the Rapture is on the 26th and 27th.

1153
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,520
 I think he thought--

1154
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,360
 I think if anything, I think it's more credible

1155
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,880
 that he thought he was going to be Raptured.

1156
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,520
 No, it's his next two days.

1157
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,320
 It's today and tomorrow.

1158
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:50,560
 Yeah.

1159
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,200
 Right.

1160
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,440
 But no, he wouldn't have like quit the show just to go

1161
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,760
 visit somebody who was going to go get Raptured.

1162
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,440
 Maybe he did.

1163
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,640
 No, maybe he did.

1164
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,440
 Because he knows down in his heart he's a sinner

1165
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,960
 and he's not going to go because remember,

1166
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,160
 he got caught up in some shit.

1167
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,480
 So you think he quit his show because he's a sinner

1168
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,840
 and isn't going to get Raptured?

1169
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,160
 Maybe because he's like, I better really--

1170
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,600
 he better clean it up.

1171
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,200
 Maybe he's going to take this next day and after.

1172
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,560
 In the course of the last 38 minutes.

1173
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,120
 Yeah, he's going to figure it out.

1174
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,240
 You've gone from he quit his show because he was getting Raptured

1175
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,480
 to he quit his show because he is not going to get Raptured.

1176
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,960
 But others--

1177
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,800
 I'm sorry, Paul did not answer that question.

1178
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,440
 I'm his attorney.

1179
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,000
 I like that question stricken from the record.

1180
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,120
 To be fair, I'm pretty sure I said--

1181
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,480
 He got past his first issue.

1182
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,600
 I said at the top, I said he quit the show

1183
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,200
 because of the Rapture.

1184
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,920
 Point and match.

1185
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,240
 So I think-- I honestly do think, like I bet, you know,

1186
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,680
 because almost all the religious shit is about guilt.

1187
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,960
 If it comes out that Terry Fader considered the Rapture

1188
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,680
 in any way when quitting this show--

1189
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,960
 Yes, how much money?

1190
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,920
 I think you're just right.

1191
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,560
 OK.

1192
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,480
 I think Paul 100% correct.

1193
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,040
 All right.

1194
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,640
 If he even considered for a moment that the Rapture

1195
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,840
 might play into a part of this.

1196
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,760
 I'm very happy with this, Terry, only because the other answer

1197
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,320
 is only that like this Vegas entertainment's becoming

1198
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,960
 a hellscape and that all of these things that we know

1199
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,480
 and love are going to go away.

1200
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,400
 I hope you can program LED lights.

1201
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,040
 Right, exactly.

1202
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,640
 I hope you can work with an AI program

1203
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,320
 and make Dorothy appear huge.

1204
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,320
 Well, I just did with Paul's with my favorite bits.

1205
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,360
 I think it's so funny.

1206
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,760
 I love when on television or movies,

1207
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,040
 lawyers yell, don't answer that.

1208
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,280
 And I was doing a show in San Antonio,

1209
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,280
 and I forgot to put bullshit in one of my pockets.

1210
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:43,760
 Uh-huh.

1211
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,560
 So I went to do a bit.

1212
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,400
 I was like, oh, shit, there's nothing in my pockets.

1213
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,600
 And I had the audience member on stage.

1214
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,720
 I go, quick, stall.

1215
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,840
 I got to put things in my pockets.

1216
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,040
 And I ran off stage.

1217
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,960
 And that thunder you just heard is SJ's car starting.

1218
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,920
 That thing sounds so amazing.

1219
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,200
 It really sounded like thunder thunder.

1220
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,640
 And I was like, what the fucking hell?

1221
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,760
 That was SJ's car?

1222
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,400
 And it's speakers.

1223
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,200
 And it's an electric.

1224
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,880
 SJ, can you hear my air quotes?

1225
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,640
 It's an electric.

1226
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,280
 That's Vivian.

1227
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,320
 I mean, SJ's car.

1228
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,000
 It's an electric, and it makes that startup noise.

1229
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,720
 That's so funny.

1230
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,920
 It's just from the speakers.

1231
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,680
 It's just got a Tesla coil in it.

1232
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,640
 It just fucking rattles.

1233
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,480
 So I go, be funny.

1234
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,440
 Tell a joke or something.

1235
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:21,920
 And I left.

1236
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,640
 And I went on stage.

1237
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,520
 And I put stuff in my pockets.

1238
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,080
 It was a small venue.

1239
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,200
 So the stage is right there.

1240
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,640
 And I just put stuff in my pockets.

1241
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,680
 And he got comfortable.

1242
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,680
 Like he said a couple things and got a laugh.

1243
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,280
 And then he just started talking.

1244
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,720
 And someone yelled a question at him.

1245
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,120
 And he was starting to feel himself, whatever.

1246
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,560
 And I go, do not answer that.

1247
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,680
 Do not answer that question.

1248
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,880
 And I went on with a bit like that.

1249
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,000
 But yelling, do not answer that.

1250
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,880
 You don't have to answer that.

1251
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,600
 From anywhere across the room, it's a good bit.

1252
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,080
 My favorite bit of yours still will always be my pearls.

1253
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:50,560
 My pearls.

1254
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,040
 Yeah.

1255
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,480
 If the lights go out anywhere--

1256
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,040
 My pearls.

1257
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:53,760
 My pearls.

1258
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,400
 It's the best.

1259
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,840
 It's a good bit.

1260
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,480
 The best.

1261
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:56,960
 Yeah.

1262
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,400
 I haven't had an opportunity to do it

1263
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,920
 because lights never go out.

1264
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,000
 We talk about, Paul, you lose power all the time in Pittsburgh.

1265
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,240
 Yeah.

1266
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:02,480
 Yeah.

1267
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,320
 But it's just me and the dogs.

1268
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,160
 The dogs don't laugh at the my pearls bit.

1269
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:06,720
 They don't.

1270
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,640
 They hate it.

1271
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,840
 And they go, no, they hate it.

1272
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,880
 Terrible.

1273
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,600
 They hate it.

1274
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,200
 They all pee instantly.

1275
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,920
 They're like, fuck you, dude.

1276
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,360
 That's fucking cheesy.

1277
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,560
 They're like, you got pearl money

1278
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,760
 and we're still feeding us this shit?

1279
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,000
 Yeah.

1280
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,480
 What do you do?

1281
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:20,720
 What?

1282
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,880
 I just ate a Caesar's dinner for the umpteen billionth.

1283
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,240
 They love Caesar's so much.

1284
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,960
 God, they love those little Caesar's dinners.

1285
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,520
 Your dog--

1286
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:29,840
 What?

1287
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,200
 Does this just make dog dinners?

1288
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,800
 Caesar's is a brand of dog food made by the Mars Company.

1289
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,880
 I thought the Little Caesar's Pizza Company as well.

1290
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,120
 No, because the Starbucks has those weird, like, lippy--

1291
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:39,520
 Lick cups?

1292
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,480
 They have like the dog cup thing.

1293
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,360
 No, these are--

1294
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:41,840
 Pup cups.

1295
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,520
 Pup cups gross me out, man.

1296
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,920
 It's just a cup full of whipped cream.

1297
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,080
 I just look so disgusting when I watch myself eat it.

1298
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,160
 But the boys love them, so he just gets them every time.

1299
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,680
 He's just covering your beard.

1300
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,960
 Did I get three pup cups?

1301
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,920
 You got a dog?

1302
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,080
 No.

1303
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,760
 You got a big old white spot on his nose.

1304
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,120
 Since when do you ever have a dog?

1305
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,480
 Yeah.

1306
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,520
 To order a pup cup?

1307
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,240
 Don't answer that.

1308
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,040
 Nazi Germany?

1309
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,440
 I live as a dog.

1310
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,040
 Next you can tell me I can't order off the kid's menu,

1311
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:07,760
 because I don't have a kid.

1312
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,080
 My pronouns are bow wow.

1313
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,480
 They do tell me I can't order off the kid's menu.

1314
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,520
 So I actually-- I order the kids at Cane's.

1315
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,400
 I do the kid's menu.

1316
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,280
 Oh, yeah, yeah, the Cane's.

1317
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,160
 The Cane's kids menu is perfect.

1318
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,280
 Two fingers is plenty.

1319
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,320
 Not Chinese guy.

1320
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,200
 Do you see the Japanese guy who lives as a dog?

1321
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,040
 Have I?

1322
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:25,680
 Yeah.

1323
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:25,920
 No.

1324
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,880
 He has a custom made--

1325
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,400
 Listeners, you'll notice I had to do it that way,

1326
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,400
 or Paul would just repeat that five times.

1327
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:38,240
 He has a custom made multiple thousand dollar fursuit

1328
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,040
 that makes him look like Lassie.

1329
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:41,840
 For real?

1330
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:46,000
 And it looks so real.

1331
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,200
 OK.

1332
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,040
 It will scare your--

1333
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,040
 He lives as this person or does this as a bit?

1334
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:55,680
 He lives as this dog as much as he can.

1335
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,400
 OK.

1336
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,800
 He has people take him to parks.

1337
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,440
 Oh, my God.

1338
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,520
 And be like, I'm their dog.

1339
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,600
 And he'll play with kids and shit and have other people--

1340
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,320
 No, he will not.

1341
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,240
 Have people--

1342
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,000
 No, he will not, actually.

1343
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 Oh, yeah.

1344
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,400
 It's like kids birthday party entertainment.

1345
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,160
 Dad went to the park and this guy, just like a dog,

1346
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,360
 started playing with us.

1347
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,880
 Don't ever go to that park ever again.

1348
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,600
 We are moving.

1349
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:24,160
 You remember what it was like when you were playing games on--

1350
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,680
 It's better if I kill you now.

1351
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,800
 Playing games on the PlayStation.

1352
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,760
 That's him?

1353
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,960
 Sorry, Mitch, you just showed me a photo

1354
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,160
 and I'm seeing a picture of a dog.

1355
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:30,560
 That's him.

1356
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,680
 Dude, that's what I'm saying.

1357
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,960
 You can't-- from that distance, you won't be able to tell.

1358
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:35,680
 Oh, wow.

1359
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,800
 Yeah, that just looks like a dog.

1360
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,000
 That's what I'm saying.

1361
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:38,960
 It does look like Lassie.

1362
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,480
 Do you see it in motion?

1363
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,120
 Yeah.

1364
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,760
 It's like you're playing a PlayStation game.

1365
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,800
 Like an original PlayStation game.

1366
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,040
 You're like, the graphics are right.

1367
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,440
 The internal skeleton is off.

1368
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,280
 The mocap is fucked somehow.

1369
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,880
 It's just a little off.

1370
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,600
 It's uncanny valley to an nth degree.

1371
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,480
 But for dogs.

1372
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,600
 For one fucking guy.

1373
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,600
 Paul, you have to surprise Ann by getting this guy to be your fifth dog.

1374
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,300
 Dude.

1375
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,000
 Poor Ann.

1376
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,360
 He doesn't have a corgi costume.

1377
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:13,760
 She--

1378
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:19,440
 There is a Patreon level, Scoops, if you want to be Paul's fifth dog.

1379
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,480
 No, seriously, I think it's like a $20,000 outfit.

1380
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,480
 Anyway--

1381
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,360
 Sorry, right now.

1382
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:25,920
 Go fund me.

1383
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,560
 It's above that.

1384
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,520
 Go fund me.

1385
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,280
 Well, poor Ann.

1386
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,880
 She's home already.

1387
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,400
 Today's her first day alone.

1388
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,080
 Did you get any calls from Ann about anything going on in the basement or anything?

1389
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,800
 Fuck, I got a squirrel in the basement again.

1390
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,360
 You do not.

1391
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,000
 I think I do.

1392
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,160
 She told me there's a bunch of stuff falling off my shelves.

1393
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,680
 I'm like, no, that's a squirrel.

1394
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:50,720
 But Ann is clearly going to go down into the basement

1395
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,160
 and take care of the squirrel problem, right?

1396
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:52,660
 No.

1397
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:59,120
 When Paul first got here, he was like, I just got off the phone with Ann.

1398
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:02,240
 She said some DVDs and some figures and got knocked off a shelf.

1399
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,000
 The squirrel's back.

1400
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,200
 She said she's going to leave it down there until I get back,

1401
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,160
 so I'll have to deal with it.

1402
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,720
 Well, it's getting your time.

1403
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,760
 They got to come back inside.

1404
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,800
 You had a guy, didn't you?

1405
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,840
 Didn't you call a guy?

1406
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,040
 No, I did it all myself.

1407
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,920
 Did you consider dressing up as a squirrel?

1408
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,280
 I called people, but they were like, I can't really do anything.

1409
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,800
 Good luck.

1410
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,640
 That's what they say.

1411
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,280
 Now, the last time you had a hole in the wall--

1412
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:29,920
 We still do.

1413
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,720
 OK, maybe that's the culprit.

1414
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,680
 No, shit.

1415
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,280
 That hole is structural.

1416
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,000
 No, this is--

1417
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,160
 But now we call that hole off limits.

1418
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,520
 We're getting the house fixed.

1419
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,000
 There's a sign with a no squirrel, a big no strike through it.

1420
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,040
 They can't figure it out.

1421
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,680
 The house is going to get repaired in like three weeks.

1422
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,280
 They're coming out to fix the building.

1423
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:47,840
 OK.

1424
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,760
 But of course, three weeks.

1425
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,800
 And here comes another fucking squirrel, because it was raining so hard.

1426
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,160
 Now, Ann thinks possibly the sump pump kicked on

1427
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,720
 and it was enough vibration to shake stuff loose.

1428
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,360
 But we know.

1429
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,040
 We know that's not true.

1430
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,080
 It's maybe.

1431
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,640
 I'm giving that sump pump vibration.

1432
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,520
 It's maybe, but I don't know.

1433
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,320
 I don't think so.

1434
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,760
 Nope.

1435
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,320
 Squirrel.

1436
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,040
 I guess we'll see.

1437
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:16,480
 Is it possible that this squirrel only wants to be on this podcast?

1438
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,800
 This is not the same squirrel.

1439
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,560
 We don't know that.

1440
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:20,960
 I do.

1441
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:26,160
 We caught that squirrel and we drove him five miles away.

1442
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,600
 This is how long it took him to get back.

1443
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,560
 Five miles.

1444
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,400
 No way a squirrel could travel five miles.

1445
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,120
 You might be right.

1446
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:32,640
 I don't know.

1447
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,880
 Do you think it's a Japanese guy dressed up like a squirrel?

1448
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,760
 If it is, I got it.

1449
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,360
 I got a very sexy night ahead of me when I get back home.

1450
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,840
 Yeah, exactly.

1451
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:47,680
 Speaking of sexy nights and problems that Paul can't solve,

1452
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,680
 it's time for Jock versus Nerd.

1453
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:57,920
 Ladies and gentlemen, it is time.

1454
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:13,040
 Time for Jock versus Nerd.

1455
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:13,760
 Explosion.

1456
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,440
 Rapture Teens.

1457
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,840
 Rapture Teens?

1458
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:18,480
 Teens, yeah.

1459
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:23,840
 That's the only fancy company that has SJ's face on it.

1460
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,340
 Oh, shit.

1461
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:29,520
 RaptureTeens.org/rapture Sorry, guys, I can't do this.

1462
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,720
 I got to go check a website out real quick.

1463
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,360
 At your computer.

1464
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,000
 Mitzi is here.

1465
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,520
 We're going to have him come on on Zoom, but he's here in person.

1466
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:43,520
 He's been touting this version of Price is Right to us for quite some time.

1467
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,160
 Yes, that's right.

1468
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,400
 And he learned what everyone else learns, which is like, just do it and we'll say yes.

1469
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,880
 Not hard.

1470
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,840
 This is borrowed from Dropout TV on the internet.

1471
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:54,960
 Shout out Dropout TV.

1472
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,280
 Great.

1473
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,880
 They had an episode and it was very tilting and fun to watch.

1474
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,400
 Dropout TV's Emily Gillette called me.

1475
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,640
 He's like, you have to get these shows on Dropout TV.

1476
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,360
 They're layups for you and Paul would crush on them.

1477
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,880
 And I was like, Emily, we're old.

1478
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,800
 20 years ago, it would have been perfect for you.

1479
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,360
 Yeah.

1480
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,560
 Young people were on that.

1481
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,240
 Young people at the UCB theater are on it.

1482
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:14,640
 So they have...

1483
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,840
 My students became teachers, those students became teachers,

1484
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,240
 and those teachers taught the people who are on Dropout TV.

1485
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,040
 Right.

1486
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,480
 So you're like the great, great, great grandfather of Dropout TV.

1487
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:30,080
 Look, you know, when Ben Schwartz was like, yeah, I mean, you guys really

1488
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,600
 paved the way and put me in a generation above him comedically.

1489
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,320
 But I was like, you would sit in on my show all the time.

1490
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,480
 Why am I old?

1491
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,320
 We graduated together.

1492
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,800
 And then I was like, oh, I guess he's right.

1493
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:43,300
 Yeah.

1494
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,920
 I looked back and I was like, wait, he's right.

1495
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,960
 Sometimes they're just right.

1496
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,120
 We still have a fun podcast.

1497
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:53,200
 Paul, thank you for waking up in time to say that.

1498
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,040
 All right.

1499
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,400
 So this is second closest scooperty.

1500
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,000
 The point is not awarded to who gets the answer correct.

1501
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,760
 The point is awarded to who gets second closest to the actual answer.

1502
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,000
 OK.

1503
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,920
 More importantly, there's no price is right rules.

1504
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,280
 There is no price is right rules.

1505
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,120
 The only time that factors is if two people are equally wrong,

1506
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,520
 the person that's lower gets the tiebreak.

1507
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,000
 Gotcha.

1508
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,800
 So if you're both five off, if Matt's five over, Paul's five under.

1509
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,400
 I've never been happier with a game.

1510
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:20,880
 All right.

1511
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,960
 I did add a wrinkle.

1512
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,960
 If somebody gets it exactly right, second closest gets a bonus point.

1513
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:29,840
 Hilarious.

1514
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:30,640
 That's really funny.

1515
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,200
 I like that rule.

1516
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,080
 Yeah, I like it.

1517
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:32,320
 All right.

1518
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,680
 So these are all numbers.

1519
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,240
 Even when they're exactly right, second closest is still right.

1520
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:36,320
 Yeah.

1521
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,960
 So even if you're right, the answers are always numbers.

1522
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:39,200
 Yes.

1523
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,400
 Everything is going to be a number.

1524
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:40,900
 Great.

1525
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:44,080
 I could find a way.

1526
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,400
 I mean, you can find a way, but it's going to be really hard to input in the spreadsheet.

1527
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,920
 All of these numbers are based off of Google AI.

1528
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,040
 So we can trust that source.

1529
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,680
 As of getting warmed up.

1530
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,800
 I thought he was just yelling numbers.

1531
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,080
 Yeah, I'm just yelling out some numbers.

1532
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:58,720
 Yeah, you were right.

1533
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,000
 He's yelling out numbers.

1534
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,200
 Starting with the first question.

1535
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,400
 Jacob, you are first on the list.

1536
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,200
 So you go first.

1537
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,480
 All three of you will give your answers and then I'll give you the right result.

1538
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,600
 You're not the boss of me.

1539
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,800
 How many hotel rooms are there in the Las Vegas Valley?

1540
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,640
 Las Vegas Valley.

1541
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,160
 So all of Las Vegas area.

1542
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:14,800
 Yeah.

1543
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,520
 Not just the strip.

1544
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,200
 For a hint, according to Google, there's 50,000 on the strip.

1545
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,760
 Yeah, I think it's like 200.

1546
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,120
 I like 225,000.

1547
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,320
 225,000.

1548
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,520
 Some people would say that differently.

1549
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,600
 Some people might, Matt.

1550
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,000
 Those people have two not bloody eyes.

1551
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,400
 I will go with 175,000.

1552
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:38,880
 Interesting.

1553
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,600
 Interesting.

1554
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,960
 Some people would have said that differently.

1555
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:45,920
 175,000.

1556
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,200
 And Paul?

1557
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,880
 300,000.

1558
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,420
 Wow.

1559
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:53,600
 Trying numbers.

1560
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,080
 All right.

1561
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,840
 The actual answer.

1562
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,640
 Thank you very much.

1563
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,120
 Nailed it.

1564
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:02,160
 150,859, which makes Matt our closest guess.

1565
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,040
 One point.

1566
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:03,520
 Nope.

1567
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,720
 That's not one point to Matt.

1568
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,080
 No, it's one point to Jacob.

1569
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:06,880
 One point to Jacob.

1570
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:07,760
 Our second closest guess.

1571
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,480
 Yes.

1572
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,280
 Damn it.

1573
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:09,600
 All right.

1574
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,000
 One second.

1575
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,040
 I'm great at this game.

1576
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,640
 One of my equations got broken.

1577
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,360
 Mitzi's already having a hard time with it, but I'm great at it.

1578
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,800
 Okay.

1579
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,640
 150,000 you said?

1580
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,840
 I'm locked in now.

1581
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,800
 I've got it figured out.

1582
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,360
 Sorry, one second.

1583
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:30,080
 I have never been more angry that we're not on video for a show.

1584
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:34,400
 I've been on video for how many shows in a row, and we're not on for this one.

1585
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,840
 Paul is just a face and a sea of comfort around him.

1586
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,160
 Keeping it in Vegas parking and weather related.

1587
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,080
 Going with Matt first on this one.

1588
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:46,400
 How many jets, blasters, and nozzles are there in the Bellagio fountains?

1589
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,680
 Oh, fuck.

1590
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,160
 What counts as a jet, a blaster, or a nozzle?

1591
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,360
 Well, the jets is a gang.

1592
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,200
 Blasters are time travelers.

1593
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,840
 When you're a nozzle, you're a nozzle all the way.

1594
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,400
 Nozzles are just, you know, idiots.

1595
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,100
 Muggles.

1596
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:03,680
 Nozzles is what we call the people watching the show.

1597
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,880
 Not just jets, it's jets.

1598
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:11,440
 Nozzle squirt, water up in the area.

1599
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,520
 Nozzle squirt, water up in the area.

1600
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,300
 800.

1601
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,360
 Matt guesses 800.

1602
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:20,500
 Paul?

1603
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,360
 I'm gonna need about 350.

1604
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:32,720
 How is Paul as a drunk?

1605
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:39,200
 I'm gonna say 801.

1606
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,160
 801.

1607
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,360
 All right.

1608
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,720
 There are 1214 jets.

1609
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:51,840
 Which means Jacob would be closest, so Matt gets the point.

1610
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,240
 I thought it was gonna be like seven something or six something.

1611
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,040
 I love it.

1612
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,960
 It's already the much better version of Price is Right.

1613
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,760
 I love this.

1614
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,160
 I gotta fix this because I just realized there was one little error in my equations.

1615
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,040
 You're cooking, buddy.

1616
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,240
 All right.

1617
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,560
 How many pounds of ice cream?

1618
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:07,440
 We're starting with Paul this time.

1619
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,160
 Zoned in.

1620
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:12,240
 How many pounds of ice cream were used for the world's largest ice cream sundae

1621
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,880
 made in 1988 by Palm Dairy?

1622
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,920
 10 pounds.

1623
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,320
 10 pounds of ice cream is the world's largest ice cream sundae.

1624
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,160
 All right, Jacob?

1625
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,880
 Wait, go this way?

1626
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,760
 Beat it.

1627
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,040
 Beat that, all right?

1628
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:25,760
 Good luck.

1629
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,240
 Good luck being better than second best on that.

1630
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,040
 I'm gonna say...

1631
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:29,920
 How much?

1632
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:30,880
 More than 30.

1633
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:31,760
 Oh, really?

1634
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,880
 More than 30?

1635
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:33,920
 I only said 10.

1636
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,040
 Oh, I don't know what you said.

1637
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:35,840
 I said 10.

1638
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,240
 800 pounds.

1639
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,080
 Oh my god, that's insane.

1640
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,760
 And Matt?

1641
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,680
 11.

1642
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,180
 11?

1643
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:46,400
 You sneaky fuck.

1644
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:51,040
 The correct answer is 44,687.

1645
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:55,280
 Jacob would have been closest, but due to math,

1646
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,880
 Matt is second now there.

1647
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,680
 I played it right.

1648
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:02,880
 He gamesmanshiped it properly there by knowing that Paul was so far off

1649
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,040
 that you could be one better than him and be correct.

1650
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,040
 I was close.

1651
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:12,560
 This might give an even bigger advantage to the person who goes third.

1652
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:13,120
 That's true.

1653
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,680
 Well, I mean, it depends on genuine answer or not.

1654
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,560
 Right, right.

1655
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,440
 All right, next up.

1656
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,480
 That's a genuine answer.

1657
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,200
 This one we are starting with Jacob.

1658
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:21,760
 We're back to the top.

1659
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,520
 As of May 19th, 2025.

1660
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,640
 Ask something about ghosts.

1661
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,880
 How many episodes of The Simpsons have aired?

1662
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,080
 Something about ghosts.

1663
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,840
 I asked for a ghost question.

1664
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,680
 Oh, Simpsons episodes?

1665
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,200
 How many have been?

1666
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,280
 As of when?

1667
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,480
 As of May 19th, the most recent airing of their most recent episode.

1668
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:47,120
 So there have been 532 episodes.

1669
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,320
 532.

1670
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:54,720
 Matt, what episode?

1671
00:56:54,720 --> 00:57:00,160
 Five hundred and thirty.

1672
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,080
 Five hundred and thirty.

1673
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,680
 All right.

1674
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,080
 There have been 790 episodes.

1675
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:06,480
 Yes.

1676
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,680
 No.

1677
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,320
 Locked in.

1678
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,040
 What did I say?

1679
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,320
 You said five thirty two.

1680
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,120
 I got it.

1681
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,640
 Paul said five thirty.

1682
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,360
 So he's second.

1683
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,120
 Oh, in my mind, I said five twenty two.

1684
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:18,160
 I don't even know what I said anymore.

1685
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,040
 All right.

1686
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:19,360
 All right.

1687
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,200
 Starting going in the middle is really tricky.

1688
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:21,840
 It really is.

1689
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,520
 Just say ten.

1690
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,600
 How many minutes is the combined run?

1691
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,480
 Where's my ghost?

1692
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,840
 Of all 21 official studio albums by Bruce Springsteen.

1693
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:33,120
 Oh, wait, what about ghost?

1694
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,400
 How many minutes?

1695
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,520
 It's spooky season.

1696
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:41,360
 Is the runtime of all of 21 of Bruce Springsteen's studio albums?

1697
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:41,680
 Wow.

1698
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:46,240
 One thousand eight hundred.

1699
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:51,600
 Paul.

1700
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:59,200
 It's hard to game this one.

1701
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,800
 Yeah, one thousand eight hundred and one.

1702
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:07,200
 Oh, Jacob.

1703
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:13,120
 It'll be weird when Paul gets it on the nose.

1704
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:18,080
 Which way is wrong?

1705
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:18,960
 Right, right.

1706
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:19,680
 So this is the thing, right?

1707
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,600
 So now you have to figure out what your right answer is.

1708
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:21,840
 Right.

1709
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:22,560
 In your mind.

1710
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:23,200
 That's it.

1711
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,280
 And then figure out where you want to be.

1712
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,800
 I have a 50/50 chance.

1713
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,960
 Well, if Matt is closer to the answer than you are right now.

1714
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,080
 Not possible.

1715
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:35,200
 If Matt is closer to the answer than you are, then you get a point.

1716
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,920
 If you're closer to the answer than Matt is, then Matt gets a point.

1717
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,960
 Wait, no, but you have to guess and that'll change it all.

1718
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:41,120
 Right.

1719
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,000
 But you said right now.

1720
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,480
 I was answering the question that you asked.

1721
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,520
 Oh, I guess you're right.

1722
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,760
 Something about ghosts, please.

1723
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,320
 There's not a lot of ghost math.

1724
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,200
 Sorry, man.

1725
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,800
 What were the two answers?

1726
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,400
 Eighteen hundred.

1727
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,560
 Eighteen hundred for Matt and eighteen oh one from Paul.

1728
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:59,360
 Eighteen oh two.

1729
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:02,800
 All right.

1730
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:07,200
 The call was between eighteen oh two and seventeen seventy nine or seventeen ninety nine.

1731
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:07,600
 Right.

1732
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,280
 I'm getting this one locked in.

1733
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,640
 The correct answer is one thousand one hundred and seventy eight minutes.

1734
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:12,960
 Shit.

1735
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,640
 Paul gets the point.

1736
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,280
 Oh, yeah.

1737
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,080
 Closest.

1738
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:16,480
 Yeah.

1739
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,920
 Matt was closest with eighteen hundred.

1740
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,520
 Paul was second with eighteen oh one.

1741
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,720
 So by sandwiching Paul.

1742
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,360
 I meant through the other.

1743
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,320
 But you couldn't have sandwiched yourself in between us.

1744
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:26,480
 Right.

1745
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,640
 Right.

1746
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,840
 OK, this is fascinating.

1747
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,360
 But you couldn't.

1748
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,240
 But I couldn't that time.

1749
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:32,320
 Right.

1750
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:32,800
 That's right.

1751
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:37,040
 Oh, that is a different because I'm using ghost math.

1752
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:37,760
 That's right.

1753
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:38,720
 In September.

1754
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:39,600
 OK, I like this.

1755
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,480
 OK, OK, OK.

1756
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,600
 I think we found a new tactic.

1757
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,000
 I like this.

1758
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,480
 That's true.

1759
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,440
 We definitely found a new tactic.

1760
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,200
 How many distilleries are currently operating in the United States of America?

1761
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,240
 Do they count Guam and Taiwan?

1762
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:54,560
 Matt, we are starting with Paul.

1763
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:55,520
 Of course not.

1764
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:00,160
 Now, distillery means makes rum, makes alcohol, makes alcohol.

1765
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,560
 Distilleries.

1766
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:03,360
 Although it just makes.

1767
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,760
 So St. Croix counts with Cruz and rum.

1768
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,840
 So I'm going to guess there's probably.

1769
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:11,280
 Oh, probably.

1770
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,560
 I'm going to rough guess.

1771
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:16,080
 Let's say a hundred.

1772
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,960
 No, probably two hundred per state.

1773
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,720
 Per per state per state.

1774
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:26,960
 Oh, so you want to maybe this is my.

1775
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,840
 You want us to just tell you now that's wrong and showing.

1776
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:33,200
 Not all states are like Kentucky.

1777
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,400
 Thank the fuck God.

1778
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,600
 And the fuck God is my favorite.

1779
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,120
 Yes, he's the good one.

1780
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,040
 Hello, God of fuck.

1781
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,000
 I am the God of fuck.

1782
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,880
 Wait, are you done?

1783
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,760
 Two hundred states.

1784
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,520
 Two hundred per state is not right.

1785
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:57,200
 So using ghost man.

1786
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:02,640
 If this is your first episode of listening to Matt Madley's ice cream social, I would.

1787
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:03,920
 I'm sorry.

1788
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,840
 Just stop now.

1789
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:06,560
 This bail.

1790
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,960
 I really thought he was just relying on me to do the math.

1791
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,480
 Like two hundred per state.

1792
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,040
 Go for it.

1793
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,640
 Whatever you think that might be.

1794
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,560
 No, no, no, no, no.

1795
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,600
 You got the number in front of you.

1796
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:16,640
 Just put me close to it.

1797
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:17,280
 Yeah, no.

1798
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,240
 OK, well, let's do.

1799
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:27,680
 Is this the first guest on this question?

1800
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,080
 Five thousand five thousand.

1801
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:33,040
 OK, Jacob.

1802
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,360
 Four thousand nine hundred ninety nine.

1803
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,000
 OK, now we're playing for shit.

1804
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,560
 No, so I get the gamesmanship, right?

1805
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,800
 Because then if I go somewhere more realistic.

1806
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,080
 If you if you go realistic.

1807
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,880
 Yeah, then you give me the point that I give you to go unrealistic.

1808
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:49,760
 You give Paul the point.

1809
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:50,880
 No, yes.

1810
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,600
 You went forward and you know, no, no.

1811
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,280
 I went one under you even one.

1812
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,680
 So Matt can't get between us, right?

1813
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,000
 But you either has to go under or over.

1814
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,720
 If he goes over, then that's going to be point to me.

1815
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,600
 That's what I just said.

1816
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:09,040
 And you followed that up and say no and then said the same thing here.

1817
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:12,880
 Basically, I'm in a position to either give Jacob or you a point.

1818
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,800
 That's the only thing I can do exactly yet.

1819
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,600
 So the question is, do you think the number or less than their number?

1820
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:22,480
 Or you could get it exactly right and give us two points.

1821
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,440
 That is true.

1822
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,640
 That is an opportunity.

1823
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,200
 Matt, get it exactly right.

1824
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,080
 All right. For the sake of getting exactly right.

1825
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,800
 Here we go.

1826
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,520
 Daddy's rolling the dice.

1827
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,680
 Thirteen hundred twenty one.

1828
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:38,400
 Ghost math.

1829
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:45,760
 All right. The correct answer is two thousand two hundred and thirty,

1830
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,800
 meaning Jacob is second closest.

1831
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,160
 So Paul was closest.

1832
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:50,480
 Yes.

1833
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,000
 Have you gone over?

1834
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
 No, no, I was close.

1835
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:54,800
 Matt was closest.

1836
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,320
 I was way over.

1837
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,320
 Oh, you both are way over.

1838
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:01,040
 There's only two thousand places making booze.

1839
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,080
 Yeah. Can you imagine?

1840
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,520
 That's why there's such a shortage.

1841
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,040
 That's why you can't find booze anywhere.

1842
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,360
 I'm realizing right now.

1843
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:10,480
 I'm like, holy shit, why can't I remember any of these answers?

1844
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:11,600
 It's because I never have to.

1845
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,280
 I usually have the computer screen in front of me.

1846
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,400
 Next up, we've got a fun one.

1847
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,440
 This is one of my favorite ones.

1848
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,880
 This is about ghosts.

1849
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:19,840
 Are you keeping track of the points?

1850
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:20,800
 Yeah, I got it.

1851
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,960
 It is currently a three way tie at two points a piece.

1852
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,120
 Who has the second most points?

1853
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:28,960
 Me. I am currently winning with the second most points in this game.

1854
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,480
 How many more questions do you have?

1855
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,040
 I have four plus a couple of backups.

1856
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,800
 So a lot of questions.

1857
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:35,600
 I got two more.

1858
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,120
 Two more sounds great.

1859
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,720
 Then we'll keep going if we want to keep going.

1860
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:43,520
 How many college football teams are currently playing football in the Big Ten?

1861
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,320
 We are starting with Jacob on this.

1862
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,240
 The Big Ten.

1863
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:57,040
 For you non-sportsball fans, this is actually a very good question.

1864
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:57,680
 I think like.

1865
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,580
 Four.

1866
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:04,080
 Four is Jacob's guess.

1867
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,560
 Matt, how many teams are currently playing in the Big Ten?

1868
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:07,060
 Ten.

1869
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,480
 Solid guess.

1870
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:10,980
 Paul?

1871
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,660
 Five.

1872
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:14,100
 Five.

1873
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,280
 So you're thinking of the Pac-12, which has two teams.

1874
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:21,520
 And not the Big 12, which has 16 teams.

1875
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,760
 Because, you know, math.

1876
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:27,680
 The Big Ten obviously has 18 football teams.

1877
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:33,600
 Which makes Matt the closest guess and Paul the second closest guess with five.

1878
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:34,880
 I thought Paul went below me.

1879
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,480
 No, he didn't go below you.

1880
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,640
 He went ten, he went five.

1881
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,000
 I'm using ghost math.

1882
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
 So currently, ghost math is winning the game.

1883
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:44,720
 Come at me.

1884
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:48,240
 Casper is running this thing.

1885
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:53,840
 How many days, how many days were there between the groundbreaking

1886
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:57,520
 and the grand opening of the Fountain Blue Las Vegas?

1887
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:58,320
 Oh, Jesus.

1888
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:58,880
 Holy shit.

1889
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,000
 That was a boondoggle.

1890
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,760
 How many days?

1891
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:02,560
 How many days?

1892
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:06,000
 With ghosts.

1893
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:06,720
 With ghosts.

1894
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:07,840
 Who goes first?

1895
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:08,960
 This one starts with.

1896
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,200
 I think I went first last time.

1897
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,160
 Matt, you start first.

1898
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,000
 Oh yeah, because I said four on the last one.

1899
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,120
 Fourteen hundred.

1900
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,720
 Fourteen hundred days.

1901
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,560
 Fourteen hundred days.

1902
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:23,200
 Paul, how many days between the groundbreaking to the grand opening?

1903
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,480
 Fourteen hundred and one.

1904
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:29,520
 Eat that.

1905
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,640
 Fourteen hundred, fourteen hundred, fourteen, no one.

1906
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,560
 Fuck.

1907
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,560
 So again, like I just decide, I decide who to use.

1908
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:46,240
 No, who you want to give two points to going for this.

1909
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:49,760
 Let's see.

1910
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:53,040
 Three hundred sixty five times.

1911
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,960
 Seventeen.

1912
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,720
 Oh, you think they did it on the actual anniversary?

1913
01:05:58,720 --> 01:05:59,680
 No, no, but like.

1914
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:00,800
 Oh, but you're just doing that.

1915
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,640
 It was roughly 17 years.

1916
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:03,920
 Was it?

1917
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,280
 Yeah, 17.

1918
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,720
 It was a fuck ton of time.

1919
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,800
 Seventeen years.

1920
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:12,080
 So let's see if I go high, Matt gets a point.

1921
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,360
 If I go low, Paul gets a point.

1922
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:13,600
 Right.

1923
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,200
 Not 17 years.

1924
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,160
 Paul has the lead.

1925
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,640
 Matt has fourteen hundred guests.

1926
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,560
 Paul has fourteen oh one.

1927
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:21,680
 Ah, OK.

1928
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,200
 So if you go high, I get a point.

1929
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:23,760
 Right.

1930
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,280
 You go high and I get a point.

1931
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,760
 Wait, wait, you say the Fountain Blue?

1932
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:28,160
 Yes.

1933
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,440
 Oh, one day.

1934
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,080
 One day.

1935
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:31,280
 Yeah, one day.

1936
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:31,760
 That's right.

1937
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:32,320
 It was one day.

1938
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,280
 All right. Well, Jacob was close.

1939
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,840
 It was I couldn't find the official day of the groundbreaking,

1940
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,480
 but I found an article on February 2nd of 2007.

1941
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:39,040
 OK.

1942
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:41,280
 And it opened December 13th, 2023.

1943
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:41,760
 Yeah.

1944
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,000
 So six thousand one hundred and fifty eight days.

1945
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,600
 That was a lot of time.

1946
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,200
 Five ownership groups, I believe,

1947
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,800
 and multiple other things that happened in that time.

1948
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:52,320
 I think a couple of court orders to tear down what had already been constructed.

1949
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,400
 So that means I get the point, right?

1950
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:54,800
 Yes.

1951
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:55,520
 It does.

1952
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:59,280
 Which means right now, Matt and Paul are tied at three,

1953
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,120
 which means Jacob has the second most points.

1954
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,640
 And when Matt and Paul are tied in Jack vs.

1955
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,200
 Nerd, second most points win the game.

1956
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,800
 Yeah, we could do that if we really want to.

1957
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:09,600
 It's really funny.

1958
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,440
 Second most points wins the game.

1959
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,960
 You can say that adds a whole other layer of strategy.

1960
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,320
 It's so much more confusing.

1961
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:16,800
 It does.

1962
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:17,360
 I have three.

1963
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:17,920
 I have four more questions.

1964
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:19,920
 We can play for second second second if we want.

1965
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,840
 No, let's wrap it up.

1966
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:22,720
 No, that's good.

1967
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,960
 One more, but this is all right.

1968
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,160
 This is this is one last one.

1969
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,160
 He doesn't have any about ghosts.

1970
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,600
 Well, not with that attitude.

1971
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:32,080
 All right.

1972
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,760
 Oh, we're going to go with this one.

1973
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,120
 I have two that I'm trying to between.

1974
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:38,480
 What is the current cost to join the Las Vegas a season

1975
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:42,240
 ticket holder priority list in American dollars?

1976
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,800
 You're probably going to say you're pride, but that doesn't.

1977
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,800
 Starting with Jacob.

1978
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,640
 Oh, shit.

1979
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,280
 God damn it.

1980
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,880
 Why does it start with me?

1981
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:55,440
 Four hundred seventy two dollars.

1982
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:01,040
 Matt, this is just to get on the list.

1983
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:04,720
 This is the this is the down payment to put your secure your spot

1984
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,480
 for the A's season tickets.

1985
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,360
 What did you say?

1986
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,720
 Four hundred seventy two.

1987
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,360
 Four hundred seventy three dollars.

1988
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:14,240
 All right, Paul.

1989
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,360
 It is definitely more than that.

1990
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,280
 Shit.

1991
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:28,640
 But I think four hundred and seventy.

1992
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,080
 What did you say, Jacob?

1993
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:32,480
 Two.

1994
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,520
 That's a four seventy two.

1995
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:34,880
 Four seventy two fifty.

1996
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:39,120
 This is actually the only time you can technically get in there

1997
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:39,840
 with a middle number.

1998
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,120
 It's terrible.

1999
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,840
 Oh, it gets even better, guys.

2000
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:48,080
 The current price to join the season ticket list is 19 dollars

2001
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:48,800
 and one cent.

2002
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:49,520
 Oh, shit.

2003
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:50,560
 I got that right.

2004
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,520
 I still won.

2005
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,640
 No, I knew you got the point.

2006
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,240
 Yeah, I thought it was like a hundred bucks.

2007
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:54,480
 Yeah.

2008
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:55,200
 So here's the thing.

2009
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,920
 Paul got the point, which now gives Paul four points,

2010
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,840
 which means Matt wins the game because he has three points.

2011
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:01,440
 Jacob loses with two.

2012
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,280
 We did it, guys.

2013
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:04,400
 Well, that made me the first runner up.

2014
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:08,800
 I like it.

2015
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:11,840
 Excellent new game, Missoula.

2016
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,600
 Hope Jack have fun programming that one.

2017
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:14,400
 Yeah, holy shit.

2018
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,720
 Well, here's the thing.

2019
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,080
 If you were to host a live again,

2020
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:23,360
 I think the way to do it would be for all of us to.

2021
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,120
 You could write your answer down and then show it.

2022
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,320
 So that way you can't do it this way.

2023
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:27,760
 So you can't do gamesmanship.

2024
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:32,720
 So even if we did on Zoom, we could private message you.

2025
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:33,600
 Yeah.

2026
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,120
 Our guesses without you.

2027
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:35,680
 Right.

2028
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,760
 That's something that we can or we could just write it down.

2029
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,040
 Or just write it down and hold it.

2030
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:39,760
 We can figure it out.

2031
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:43,040
 Yeah, we could write down a piece of paper, hold it to the camera.

2032
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,400
 Normally, I'm like the lowest tech guy.

2033
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,840
 I can't even come up with a lower tech solution.

2034
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:46,960
 What are you talking about?

2035
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,400
 Matt's like, just make all the answers below 10

2036
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:49,360
 and we can just use our fingers.

2037
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:52,960
 You know what?

2038
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:53,760
 That's actually better.

2039
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:57,200
 For one of them is not a bad idea.

2040
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:00,320
 This is this game is all just all within 10 to 1 to 10.

2041
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,320
 Feel free to sign your answers to me at any time.

2042
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,480
 I want to thank Penn Jillett for creating this podcast.

2043
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:05,360
 Thanks, Penn.

2044
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:06,640
 We don't have anyone else to thank right now

2045
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:10,480
 because we are in the back and I've done a bad job at prepping for this show.

2046
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,000
 That's we're going to do a lot.

2047
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,040
 We got a lot going on.

2048
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:13,920
 We got a lot of thanking.

2049
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,080
 We got a lot of jiggering with our Patreon.

2050
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,480
 I want to thank Mitzi for stopping by with a brand new game.

2051
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:18,800
 Of course.

2052
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:19,680
 Thanks for having me, gentlemen.

2053
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:23,680
 Or an updated or an old version of the game.

2054
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:24,960
 A fun, a fun version.

2055
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,720
 Yes, a fun old version.

2056
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:29,760
 Yeah, and thank you to everybody who supports us over on Patreon.

2057
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,240
 You are the reason that we're able to do this show.

2058
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:36,000
 You are the reason that we are able to do things like ScoopFest this week,

2059
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,120
 which is the reason that you're getting an insane show right now.

2060
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:42,480
 So there are a lot of reasons and they're all for you.

2061
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:43,680
 Congratulations.

2062
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:46,240
 Yeah, for anybody who has left a bunch of money

2063
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:50,080
 by their unraptured neighbors, you can send that our way.

2064
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:50,640
 Yep.

2065
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,320
 At preachingfun.com.

2066
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:55,440
 Slash Rapture.

2067
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,160
 I was all ready for it.

2068
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:00,160
 I expect to be thanking Terry Fader next week.

2069
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:02,240
 It is so weird.

2070
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:06,320
 It is so weird hearing these sound clips not at one and a half feet.

2071
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:15,120
 And if you want more questions about ghosts, go to fartsinabag.biz.

2072
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:22,320
 Bring it.

2073
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:26,160
 Next second closest, just ghosts, oops, all ghosts.

2074
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:29,840
 That's fartsinabag.biz along with preachingfun.com.

2075
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,200
 It takes you to our Patreon page.

2076
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,520
 We're for as little as three dollars a month.

2077
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,120
 You can upkeep this show on the air.

2078
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:38,160
 Like I said, the Patreons are the reason that we are able to do this show

2079
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:44,320
 twice a week each and every week, no matter what is going on in life like this week.

2080
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:44,560
 Exactly.

2081
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:45,200
 So here you go.

2082
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:46,720
 Enjoy.

2083
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,120
 Take care.

2084
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,240
 Thanks, everybody.

2085
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,880
 I was going to ask Paul, did you like the video I made for the bucket show this week

2086
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,080
 with their pop up guys?

2087
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,480
 Yes.

2088
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,240
 I really thought they were going to kiss at the end.

2089
01:11:58,240 --> 01:11:59,360
 I was disappointed they didn't kiss.

2090
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,440
 There's a lot of sexual tension between those two dolls.

2091
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:02,480
 It was really heavy.

2092
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,080
 Thanks a lot for this, everybody.

2093
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:04,960
 Take care of yourselves out there.

2094
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,320
 We love you and we'll see you soon.

2095
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,160
 We'll see you soon.

2096
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:08,880
 I did like it.

2097
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:09,680
 I liked it.

2098
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:38,240
 It's funny, though.

2099
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:40,640
 It's just somewhere in the middle, that's all.

2100
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,560
 There's a bunch of Christians who aren't Christian at all right now.

2101
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:46,240
 There's a bunch of other Christians who are diving way too in on this rapture stuff.

2102
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:47,760
 But that's me in the middle.

2103
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,040
 Those aren't Christians either.

2104
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,200
 That's not what Christian Christianity is not about going up into space.

2105
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,840
 Wait, whose rapture is that Christian?

2106
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,920
 It's not it.

2107
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:03,200
 It is a weird small sect thing that came up in like the 20s.

2108
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:07,040
 It's not truly Christian.

2109
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,640
 It's evangelical at best.

2110
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,080
 There's not a way to buy yourself out of it.

2111
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,280
 So it's definitely not from the Catholic Church.

2112
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:11,920
 Exactly.

2113
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:12,960
 It's right to who?

2114
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:17,360
 If it's if it can't be cured with a plenary indulgence, I don't want to hear about it.

2115
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,520
 See you tomorrow.

2116
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:24,800
 You've heard me talk about Samaritan.

2117
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:29,360
 And today I get to tell you about an additional sharing option called Redeem HealthShare.

2118
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:33,440
 It's everything we love about Samaritan, like the freedom to choose your providers

2119
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:37,600
 and be in control of your health care, but with more program options to fit your budget

2120
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,480
 and health care needs in a modern digital platform.

2121
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:44,640
