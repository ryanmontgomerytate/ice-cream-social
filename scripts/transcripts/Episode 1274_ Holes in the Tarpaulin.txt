 Sorry, we got interrupted by the start of the show Paul, please continue your case for the 13-month calendar
 Anyway, you were gonna say something and you're like wait, I'll save it for air. Oh, I was talking about
 The new spawn universe comic book that just came out
 Called I saw Santa
 It's a two-parter. It was very holiday themed. It's wild
 It's a wild fucking book. So Santa Claus is doing his thing
 magical shit, you know and
 He runs into this kid
 Who basically booby traps?
 his house
 To kill Santa. Oh
 He's gonna catch and kill Santa
 All right, and Santa has to deal with this kid and then it's this whole
 story of how this kid gets away and
 Becoming Santa is like trying to kill kids or is it said it's just being Santa Santa's just being Santa and this evil child
 has tried to kill Santa and
 Being Santa and this kid thinks he's at a home alone movie, but not not just a home alone movie. He's a bastard
 He's like he's like Santa. Why didn't you give me the one thing?
 I wanted and he's like I just you're you're five or whatever. You're six or whatever
 And he's like all I ever asked for is a bone saw and and and he's like
 I'm sorry. You've not been you've not been behaving well and this kind of thing and he's like
 No, you ever give me his coal and he has this wagon full of coal and he sets it on fire
 And he kicks it over and he sets his whole house on fire and he's killing his
 You bring up a good point Paul. I'm glad you bring this is this is our
 New Year's episode our post Chris Bosh episode and you bring up an excellent point
 I've always been confused my whole life when I was a child now. I've always been confused
 Why does Santa bring coal to the bad kids? The bad kids are going to start a fire. Yes, they're bad kids
 You're giving them coal. You're absolutely right. He literally added fuel to their fire
 Coal is delicious. It's delicious. Right, right. We don't talk about that. Well
 Just like I've learned in that latest
 Or one of the most recent last podcast on the last last lot podcast on the left episodes
 Hey, Paul, let's go back to one buddy. Let's start it over. Okay. Yeah, we're gonna edit that out
 Just like I wormed on the blast hotline on assess paper
 That was closer that was closer buddy
 We're gonna do it one more time as I just experienced in the SAS POM on harsh harem bin. I was tired of fear
 No, fuck this is gonna save us a ton and overdubbing costs no last podcast just had a whole thing about chimney sweeps and
 Of course, they are covered in coal dust and soot and soot
 Even more dangerous than coal more combustible. That's why they had to have chimney sweeps
 Japanese would light on fire. Yeah, so these kids were covered head to foot in soot and
 People they were smoking what like two packs a day easy packs a day easy
 People thought that they had great dental hygiene for some reason
 simply because
 When they would smile the contrast exactly. Oh
 And so people had all these myths around oh what well chimney sweeps must know what would be what to keep your teeth
 What in it and no, of course not? I'm sorry, sir. I didn't understand what you said. Look we want him sweeps
 Right now you've been going up and down up and down Bob's you're right. We'll get your thing clean taking a suit
 I come out. Give me a grin boom boom boom sparkly sparkly. I'm thinking all right, but the first mr. Pipples died, right?
 Well, he died, but he didn't leave let me tell you what he left a little bit of a DNA
 Little ribonucleic acid met and I'll got that motherfucker on lock for the next 1500 years
 Burying a tomb with me you will be
 Well, there you go wait so like I remember this I've still seen like there's like the like the more of the
 If you don't like fluoride, you know and and Robert Kennedy has taught me not to
 Yeah, clearly he's he's the one to take advice from you see
 You see
 Charcoal-based toothpastes and right super. I think that is holdover. I think I think that's a holdover
 I think so because it doesn't make any damn sense. You could do the same thing with the power of pumice
 I guess fuck if I know you know, just that's what I do with my teeth
 I take a pumice stone and just take a bar take a bar of lava soap
 I
 Remember watching the passage of time in his tooth shrinkage. I remember watching someone on tik-tok. Oh man back then I such long teeth
 I remember we were talking about she was using it was really long in the tooth. She was using magic erasers
 She started using magic erasers on her teeth
 Because she's like well, I think the principles the same and I sure she she kept posting for like a week and then she stopped
 I think she probably did she probably did a reprobable harm to her teeth. Yeah
 Or just poisoners
 With like gum cancer and stuff microplastic. Oh my god. If you guys heard that joke from it
 I don't I tear my fault by the way. I want to made this bit another one like creeped out right now, but I don't know
 I don't I don't know the comedian. I did it to myself
 It's terrible that I can't remember the comedian, but he says, oh, yeah, you know
 Microplastics are in everything now, right?
 Mike there's microplastics in semen detectable levels of microplastics in semen
 Mm-hmm, and he's like even lower even even billionaires
 Even billionaires have detectable levels of microplastics in their semen and he's like that's not good
 Kids eat that
 Oh
 This made me laugh and laugh and laugh yeah, yeah, it's a great joke. It's a great joke
 It is a good joke. So yeah, we're all we're all dying with
 Poison in ourselves, but yeah, I don't know
 It's all that's a big way the spawn book. I don't want to spoil it because it turns out really cool
 But it's he's basically Santa Claus in the second book
 you go and you see he's in his workshop and his study has become a
 Charlie from always sunny
 Maps and you know
 Yes, the conspiracy room because this kid has gone on to murder people every Christmas and
 Santa
 being and a
 Creature of the spawn and not last pet cast on the left, right? I'm talking about spawn now. I'm back on spawn
 So guys from last podcast on the left have gone on to murder someone every Christmas
 So Santa is within this is within the spawn realm. And so
 Santa Claus
 He tried to call 9-1-1 when he he ended up at a murder scene
 That this kid had set up for him, you know, yeah, and of course, they don't hear him because he's Santa Claus
 he's magical and so he grabbed a speaking spell to try and type out help and
 Make it, you know say the thing so he could guess but he didn't get it in time and he got whisked back up
 And it's just it's a it's a really interesting well-done story and the end the ending is quite satisfying and interesting, too
 so I would highly recommend if any of you are into a little bit of gore a little bit of
 Creepy gore for your Halloween or Christmas
 As happy as an ending as any any spawn book yes, and how much plastic isn't that happy ending
 Ask the children, okay
 Ask the children
 Minor don't someone minor don't think of the children double poly mylar bag. So quite a bit of plastic smart smart
 Yeah, Matt you have a whole rock band in your house now I do I do yeah
 you did it to yourself you idiot you did the thing that uncles do to
 Other families. I did I am my brother with this for years
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, so my
 one can actually already had a drum kit for his
 His birthday, so we just he just he wanted an extra splashy crashy
 Symbol he wanted a splash symbol
 and so he got it he got us he got himself a nice symbol for for
 Have you discovered the the indoor like basically the practice symbols that are mute symbols yet
 There you know the ones that come with the original kiss the kids kits
 They have like a bunch of holes in them, so they still make a noise, but they're not like crazy loud. Oh, that's okay
 That's that's getting closer to them. We have we have mute symbols in our rehearsal our rehearsal room at the house here
 Yeah, yeah, they're metal symbols. They've got a fuck ton of holes drilled in them
 Yeah
 You can hit them as hard as you want and and they don't just deafen you because you're in a regular sized room right and so
 That my kid was that was not enough for my kid, and so he asked for a deafening symbol and got it good
 He was like oh, I make so much noise. It was just flashing. I was pretty sure that
 Where I come from the mute symbol is a slash through a speakers
 Yeah, that's we got one of those and he hits that he hits that and it's sponge
 So just because he just taps it with a drumstick and then that's that
 Symbols when he hits it it takes out all the sound for all of the drums
 And then they can't hit they can't hit it again. He's got to hit it hit it twice
 Twice
 Yes, that's same same band bossy
 What is it zell zell jan or whatever it's zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill zill
 Yeah, no, you spend say it some more you spend a zill gin on that well his his grandmother spend a zill gin on that whoa
 That's a real that's a real symbol. I think I think she's great on the x-files
 Zill gin and she's the other son. Yeah
 Do you think her and scully really did in real life her? I hope so
 But it's my youngest her and scully is my cup of tea her and Mulder whatever but if it was her and scully
 Whoa, don't be your pleasure. Don't be your fun
 She's scully when you just make a stupid sex joke
 And then Paul goes all nerd and gets horny on it. I
 Apologize Paul. What happens on page eight of the spawn book you describe detail. She gets scully fucked
 But my youngest he started taking electric guitar lessons over at the old school of rock
 And at home in an acoustic guitar and he was like, nope
 This shall not stand
 Dad I'm I was put on this earth thrash
 Play coffee houses. That's right a little more Dave Mustaine a little less John Denver, huh? All right
 So he's left-handed is a Southpaw. Have we discussed this on air? Oh
 Have we talked about this on air? I
 Feel like we must have but yeah, you're your youngest is a lefty
 That's an original less poor Southpaw with a sunburst finish Jimmy bitch. Would you look at that guitar? I don't even play that guitar
 No, no, no, no, put it down put it down put it down. Leave it low lately
 Youngest are you doing a Taylor Sheridan monologue? That is a classic bit from an old
 teaching
 That I have clearly
 Had yeah when I was a kid, yeah, it's useful useful Bozzie in the chat knows where this is going. So we started
 Giving him lessons and they try to teach him initially school of rock try to teach him right-handed. Oh
 So that's the that's the that's the easy easier thing to do and so what happens is that basically if kids are remotely ambidextrous
 Okay, the world is much easier for right-handed guitar player wherever they go. They'll have a right-handed guitar player
 right-handed guitar that kind of stuff and
 Most people like it's just it's just a one-to-one
 Kind of a easier to teach or whatever
 but and we wanted to have him go off to the school of rock to do it there before we committed to buying him anything because
 we want to make sure that he really liked it and you know, whatever just you know, and
 After the first lesson the instructor came out and goes well, we learned a couple things today
 I was what's that? He goes you sounds pretty good. He goes and
 He's definitely left-handed. He is left-handed. There's no
 There's no teaching him right-handed I said, okay, you guys have left-handed guitars here they go we do we do we can teach him
 I'll tell the guitars. I said, okay
 So then you know, we're gonna go now now he's into it
 He's been into it for a while. And so we're gonna actually gonna get him a guitar for him to play at home
 So we go over to guitar center and I walked up to and turned out the lessons booth
 I thought those customer service booth was a lessons booth. Ah, and I said
 Yeah guitar center doesn't really have a customer service booth. No, they sure don't Jacob
 You should go to a different store
 And I said, uh, I'm looking for a guitar for like a left-handed guitar and he goes did you start teaching him?
 Yes, did you start teaching him?
 Same opinion
 And I said, oh, I've been extra so much easier for the rest of his life. If he learns righty one thing
 He even had a substitute teacher
 for his guitar lesson at School of Rock and
 The guy was like again like and now he's like a month's of lessons in and the guy's like you
 really think about learning how to play right-handed guitar because if you ever had a party and someone busts out a guitar and
 You play left-handed guitar. You can't you can't play or whatever and then he came home and told us a story and my wife
 And I were furious
 Yes, I said, do you know what you should say back to that person when you if you should you have him again?
 It is like my kids like what I was like tell him Kurt Cobain Paul McCartney Jimmy Hendrix
 That's a you that's what you say back to him
 People it turns out are able to play the guitar. Yeah, they can they can make their way they can struggle through somehow
 I'm willing to bet if he gets good enough. He's gonna have that guitar with him at that party
 Right and or you know if you actually get skilled enough like Jimmy Hendrix actually would take a right-handed turn
 Just flip it upside down and play it. Yes. I told Matt the move is you learn how to play guitar
 Like he just learned how to play guitar as he's doing now as it gets good enough
 He'll be able to flip it in his head and then he will just be able to take a
 Regular guitar and flip it over at a party. It's a fucking power move
 Yeah, you know, the only the bag is the pickups and stuff on the top
 But I think if you're if you're if you're an artist, you're I think you like all that stuff
 You like like you like trying to navigate that stuff
 But anyways, I don't care about any of that. And so so guitar center it would turn out the guy was like
 Oh, I just teach lessons here. You got to find the salesman anyway, and so I said, okay
 And I found a salesman of roaming luckily. We don't have a booth where they hang out
 Yeah
 They just they just roam and I found a guy roaming and they're kind of dressed the same way that everybody else at the store is
 Dressed anyway, they just have longer hair. That's that's what gets them away
 The teachers have the longer hair than the sales force. No, no the my guitar centers
 There's just you know, people who work there are just around the floor just walking around
 But they look like they look like every other dude shopping there. They don't use it's really hard to figure out who works there
 Yes, so we found the guy you get approached all the time, right? Jacob
 Hey, man, you helped me out. You're you're you're basically like wearing a red shirt at Target
 The bad thing is I usually know the answer. Yeah
 It's usually easier to just be like, yeah, it's it's it's something. Yeah
 Yeah
 so I I
 Found a guy and I was like you have any left-handed guitars because oh jeez
 Here we go
 No one can keep this opinion to themselves. He's like he's like we don't really like there's not like a section for it
 So you have to walk around and just kind of find one and so we're playing this game. We're walking around
 And
 It's the only one like I can't go to like guitar world, right? Like there's no yeah, like I have no competitor. I can't
 And you're trying to be like I'm trying to not shop online, right? I'm trying to like I'm trying to shop
 You're trying to brick and mortar it you're trying to be a good guy
 Yeah, I'm trying to be the one is this the one inside the center. Yeah town square. Yeah town square. I know it well and
 So it's like there's one
 There's one and then I'm realizing I'm looking at it and like
 On electric guitars the the was it not the frets. What's the we what's the things you turn to tune the tuners the tuning?
 Yeah, the knobs. Yeah the knobs the tuning knobs, you know on an acoustic guitar. There's three and three on each side, right?
 Oh, you mean the the the tuning
 Shit now I can't think of the word
 Stretchers yeah, those guitar string stretcher. Thanks. Thanks. Oh, that's a whole different thing
 Yeah, so it is so this guitar teacher's trying to pay all he's old enough
 Circles in circles, I'm left-handed when it comes to pegging
 Left-cheek dominant. Yes, it used to hold the top of the headboard is your left hand when you're getting
 Yeah, that's well cuz it's cuz that cuz I loop I loop one leg around
 You'd be surprised. I can actually you know, what do you think happen to that old hip? I can pretzel up a little bit
 She said she no she does she we got code she looks at me and she give me a wink
 She'd be like you ready to get mr. Salty with it
 That's how she that's how she rolls
 Well back to the story about my ten-year-old, thank you. Oh is it 10 now he's 10 I
 Know too old for most billionaires, but um count things
 So I'm realizing that the the pegs on these left-handed guitars that it's it's arbitrary and some of them the pegs are on the right
 Of the guitar, right? Oh
 So they just choose to string like two guitars left-handed and they choose to string the rest
 Right-handed and that's that and that's the end of the game. So shopping for a quote-unquote left-handed guitar is really just about
 Stringing them right? Yeah, is that right? I guess that's right
 This is what I mean. You yeah you get into like some of some other minutiae and stuff
 But you can definitely just do that. You can just string a guitar up to Z down Z
 Yes. Yeah. Yeah now I'm thinking about it
 Yeah, cuz the two the two left-handed guitars we found one the pegs were on the right side one on the left side
 It's just about you know, but you still but then but then it's it's a bet. So it's not about the frets
 It's about that where the knobs are
 Right you want the knobs on the bottom
 So once I realized it was about the the like all the other little things you have electric guitar that are on the physical
 Instrument you want that below the strings and not on top of the strings when you're right. I
 Was like, oh now now I see but I was looking at the shopping just got a lot easier. Yeah. Yeah
 So he's trying out a couple things
 I finally grab a right-handed guitar that looks good and I let it just go like here just put the strings on this one
 and we'll find out if they make a left-handed version of it, yeah or whatever and
 and and so
 Basically a beginner's
 Stratocaster called Squire. It's made by the Stratocaster. Oh sure. Yeah. Yeah
 That's been around for a long time and and it's a little more expensive than like a total starter guitar
 But it's not as expensive as some crazy electric guitars, right? And so
 He gets it. He goes. Oh, I like this a lot and he's really nice playing around with it. And so
 We go online guitar center. They have a left-handed version in inventory. We should be able to pick it up by Christmas
 great and
 Then we get notices or other kids concert. We're getting email notices that it's on backorder won't be there before Christmas
 Oh
 Okay, listen the story it's about to make me a terrible person, okay
 We're in the middle of it is the holidays we're in the middle of my oldest kids Christmas concert
 So we don't want to handle this right now, but I go ahead and open up Amazon
 Look for left-handed guitars
 Squire Stratocaster I was gonna say now, you know the making model
 It can be delivered to my house tomorrow
 Yep, I was like, sorry guitar center and then
 Boop done cancel the order guitar center and and gave gave gave more plastic to that seaman monster
 Jeff Bezos and yeah, and then my kids playing an awesome guitar downstairs
 If you're quiet right now we can we can hear Matt's youngest playing the guitar in the distance
 Well, I tell you what's neat about school of rock is that they teach him rock songs right away
 Oh
 Yeah, no, they make it so much fun
 Yeah
 And so my kids just playing songs like it's just like he's already just off just playing like tunes
 And so it's like it's actually really fun to have in the house
 And my oldest son was like let's go out in the garage and jam and I was like he just
 Got a good car. He doesn't know how to tune it yet. He doesn't do it. I don't cares. Yeah
 Let's go time to jam you time to jam you just triggered a memory. I meant to talked about this a couple weeks ago
 I forgot. Yeah, so Anne and I were going to the local Walmart
 this was two weeks ago, maybe not even and
 We had snow flurries coming down. So there was a dusting. It was early in the snowfall
 Right before things really got kind of hairy
 We're heading up towards the Walmart and as some of you may know
 Walmart allows for the Salvation Army to post up at their doors
 Okay, with their cat the bell guys. Yes
 On this day the bell guys had been replaced with a band
 Okay
 This a bell band no
 these were
 people playing
 wood instruments horns
 Okay. Yeah, and
 as we got out of the car
 Walking towards the thing they were
 warming up
 and it was and I was like
 And I was like who the fuck is skinning that cat it was
 Atrocious
 Atrocious but but hilariously bad like so bad. You're just like this can't be real and
 then
 Sir, and they go one two, three four
 Paul you're gonna get us demonetized
 We go inside we walk inside and I'm just looking at and we are giggling our asses off
 idiots because we
 Stop it and I'm just losing my shit and we get inside and she's like what the fuck was that and I go
 That was Mariah Carey's all I want for Christmas
 Fuck you was not
 It fucking was I hear that song on loop in Target eight day eight times a day
 That was what they were trying to play. Fuck you bullshit. That is not what was asked. That is that sounds like they successfully played it
 Oh my god, it was so and then as we were coming out
 They were doing another one and it was just as horrendous and we get in the car. She's like
 They must have been special needs
 That were there for the Salvation Army
 I'm like, I don't know. I don't know. Let's say let's say fine. It was fine. But holy shit. I
 Just like it was
 Unbelievable. I wish I wish I had the temerity to have I think there's probably more than Salvation Navy than the salvation
 I should have sucked it up. It was maybe I've been like I'm gonna give this bigoted rat fuck organization a dollar
 Just so I can videotape some of this ear fuckery that is going on right here because it was maniacal
 maniacal the sounds that were coming out of these instruments and
 We were beside ourselves like how did how who who said yes who said yes
 I know it was it was my tongue with the bell ringers of people. I'd be like, you know that organization
 Sponsors female castration in other countries, right? Right. No, please do not ever donate anything to the Salvation Army
 They are garbage people. It's a garbage organization
 But yeah, but I would have told that band I think
 Yeah
 It was out
 rages
 It was outrageous
 I'll tell you who else really got in the holiday spirit walking into Walmart the other day
 And that's the following sponsor a squirrels guide to breaking and entering Paul's basement. That's right
 That's from 2025 cup of scoop get the squirrels guide to breaking and entering Paul's basement
 Hello. I am how you say a squirrel. I
 Am wanting to get warm, but I am cold
 So I am thinking hey, I will break into someone's ass and still they're warm. And so what I do I
 Get into the basement
 which is a
 fully furnished and as they say in the human circles
 Finished is a finished basement. Okay. I'm not I am NOT in Finland. It is a finished basement
 I go inside and I find a hole and I
 Squirreling, you know how you do a squirrel into the squirrel hole. He's slowly becoming Louisiana
 And it's it's a slow transition here I go into we get him into the squirrel or
 And I'm inside and suddenly I am there and I am warm and I am looking for a few
 It there is no
 There is only spiders
 Just a spider
 That is it and I don't want to eat spiders. So then someone puts a nut roll in a cage. I
 cannot resist
 Go and I eat a nut roll. But then the tello then the cage it closed
 And I am in traffic. Oh
 No, and
 My balls stick out of the cage because I have huge squirrel nuts
 and
 There it is. I am trapped
 like a squirrel
 Then I am set free back into mother nature
 To look and cry at the trees. I must now inhabit it
 instead of the warm
 basement
 But if you stay in the tree long enough, it gets warm
 Enter a scoops to check out despite all his rage. He's still just a squirrel a nut roll in the cage. It's true
 We are all that nut roll
 So when we leave town we usually have friends stay at the house and then house sit for us and everything
 Yes, they watch the dogs. We have we have several friends that we enlist to do this
 Have roommates or whatever and yeah, they come they come stay at the house. They watch the dogs. They have a good time
 Whatever this last time when we left
 Is the holidays and so all of our friends had shit to do all of our friends that usually come and house sit for us
 They all had shit to do so they didn't stay at the house. You're gonna have so we hired a
 Professional we had we had multiple friends recommend this professional house sitter to us and she works
 She's she is a solo and she's from a service or she's a solo house watcher
 She is a solo house watcher. She is not from a service
 So she must work on just recommendations. All they then how does I believe size? How does one advertise? I will I will watch your house
 Trust me. It's a trust me. I believe she works entirely on word-of-mouth. I believe it is entirely an obelisk scheme and
 she also works in a
 Vet she works in a veterinary clinic and so she is a she's good with pets
 She's good with pets and she's more than just a like she doesn't just do
 You know civilian work in the veterinary clinic. She works with with the medicine and works with the animals and everything
 Does she do surgeries? I think she assists
 So I think she's kind of like the veterinary version of a just cysts. I think so. Yeah just cysts
 And not even removal placement just placement. That's the fucked-up thing people want that now
 They're asking can you make my Sharpe look more like a Frenchie? That's right. Can you just jam his head full of sis?

 Do you leave dirty laundry for a stranger or rubbing your dog's faces to calm them down?
 Here's our pile of dirty laundry when you want to rub it on the dogs you leave your dirty laundry
 You leave a shirt or or two in the in their sleeping quarters so they could still smell you when you're gone. It works
 Well shame on you
 I've learned shame
 Now did you realize that there's two people that have spent a lot of time around my dogs
 You know how deprived they are
 I don't even get me started. I'll tell you all about my fucking dogs here a minute, but fucking
 Did you realize that that is how dogs measure time?
 What yes through scent
 Dogs measure time through scent. I just so I read a poem when you leave the house
 Your scent is in the air
 Yes, and as the day progresses the smell of you being around your scent is in the air
 Not this scent not me buddy
 I forgot I was talking to a man with an unwashed ass. Yeah, it is a pungent. It is a pungent odor that stays
 This is the thing though. That's the scent in Matt's house. Matt is always there
 My cats have an easy day
 But that's how they can tell you've been gone for a while is the scent is less so you've been gone
 Having I can't smell you
 Yeah
 Yeah, that song was written for a dog and of course dogs don't understand the sun goes up and goes down
 They don't understand like light and day
 No, but no like I was saying man dogs are idiots. They they absolutely understand town
 Night and day they understand circadian rhythm, but i'm saying as far as
 Look
 Uh, I I would even emotionally be measured by scent. What do you mean?
 I I miss my I was trying to make a kelly clarkson as a dog joke and I lost it anyway
 Because she's not because she's not she's hot business whose husband just died
 Poor thing
 And it was strange
 Poor everyone were they ever
 As strangers in the night
 So she's there. She's got her guns comes by how many guns she's got her guns. Oh too many to count
 It shows up like schwarzenegger's commando the end of commando
 just
 I'm going to have to use your refrigerator a few times. I hope you don't mind
 If it's if this food in the fridge you don't want me to eat and eat it labeled labeled with the security deposit
 Put something on top to say do not eat
 Otherwise is our fair game because i'm one of these people who believes you're going to be gone for a week
 You don't want the food to go bad again moldy. Anyway, I can eat it. I can use it. I can get the value
 Won't you let me have that food?
 Why don't you let me have it?
 That's fine. You can eat anything in the fridge. Great. Uh, everything is off limits now to you and your wife
 For the next 10 hours before you leave the house. I call dibs on everything in the fridge
 This is part of our arrangement dibs
 No, also, I see you have a lot of drinks up there in this place. We're outside
 We've heard dibs has been called if you do not respect dibs, we will arrest you you better get out of this house right now
 It's not your house anymore. It's not your house squatters rights dibs dibs
 Police there's a person yelling dibs and saying they have squatters rights in my house
 That's right, I called it it's dibs I shit in the bedroom when you weren't looking so it's technically mine
 Oh god, she did shit in the bedroom
 Ha ha
 You should never let a stranger in your home unless you don't want your house anymore, but that's the lesson you've learned
 Goodbye get the fuck out
 Thank you for participating
 Tough but fair tough, but fair is right. You're stupid. You're so dumb and your dogs are mine
 Oh at least something good came out of this
 Could you use some dirty laundry behind so I could comfort them?
 Yeah, you better leave a stinky shirt or a pair of underpants so I can stick it in the crate
 Let it dissipate slowly over the next few weeks
 Yeah, she came by she met the dogs
 Uh showed showed her around the house
 Yo, I did I was like here's the bar
 Uh, and I was like anything that's open on the bar
 just
 Knock yourself out. Whatever whatever you want
 And she goes she took a bottle and hit herself on the head
 Knock myself out there. You've been roofing all these beverages. I know what's going on
 I've played this game before
 This is roofy roulette
 Then she goes well, I don't
 I I don't drink alone is the only problem
 with that dude
 She and I was like she and then you 24 and then you pulled out 45
 And then you and then you pulled out the torso you bought a week ago for
 There you go, this is also open do whatever you want with this
 And I was like well if you do if you change your mind if you want anything go ahead and
 If you change your mind

 If I want to just sit around and be sad one night, maybe i'll do that
 Did you not just say well you could have someone over
 No
 Okay, listen
 No, I didn't I didn't propose that she did she have people over and like
 Entertain at my house. No, I didn't I don't think I don't think if you don't drink alone
 You want to be used some kind of filthy you don't have to entertain at the house
 But yeah, exactly you can do easily a hundred people in the backyard. That's true
 We've got rolls of visqueen in the garage several times. That's it
 If she lays down some plastic all bets are off. That's right. That's right
 dibs respect dibs
 I tell you what so she we uh, we left uh, we left town

 Uh, so, uh, she told sj. Oh i'll send you you'll update pictures on the dogs
 Uh, it'll it'll be great. There won't be any trouble with the dogs. Everything's gonna be gonna be real good
 she sent
 Multiple update pictures to my wife every day so so that sj knew that the dogs were were being taken care of
 We got back to the house
 It was so much cleaner than it is when our asshole friends house it for us
 It had been vacuumed the dog shit in the backyard had been picked up and throw it away
 I was like this is incredible and I had told her I was like the dogs are small enough
 The yard is big enough
 If you don't pick any of it up because she was like, oh is there a trash can for the for the dog poop from the backyard?
 I said, yeah, there's trash can over here. Uh, really though. You don't have to sweat it. They're not big dogs
 Uh, so unless the mood just strikes you honestly, you don't have to worry about it. Yeah
 And uh, but yeah, like the the yard was completely clean. It's like man. Are you sure?
 Asshole friends got thrown away and she didn't eat it
 You sure she didn't straight up tootsie roll all those nuggets
 That's her whole scheme, right?
 Jacob, can you actually send her a text now whether she tootsie rolled all those nuggets?

 She just wrote back up. She's she's replied
 Busted

 If you focus on that then you can't miss moves that are made or you won't miss here
 words that are said
 Usually and i'm sorry. Is that is that also creepy best buy guys?
 Number one rule is eye contact as well. It's my number one and my number two rule
 Both number one and number two number one and number two. That's my number one and number two rule is eye contact. Yes. Okay
 What if I don't want eye contact for my partner like the way could be guessed best by guys looking at me
 Like I want him to stop looking at me. Ray. How would I get him to stop looking at me? Uh,
 Invite your brother over to fuck your wife
 And her hate scoops to check out
 Wow
 Wow
 Is that a plot point from the show or from his real life?
 both
 Right what you know, she tootsie rolled his fiance. No, uh
 Matt did you know that those are my those are my first two rules?
 I did know that I didn't know that your number one number two rule or eye contact you set me up for it
 It was nice. I did I did. Yeah
 and it's true
 It's the most important
 If you ask me
 This is before the holidays right because you came back for the holidays, yeah
 Yeah, it was right before the holidays got it
 Okay
 Because it was it wasn't like a special rate to make a woman because I if you're making her work christmas
 Then I imagine it is sad drinking time
 I don't know. I mean she got up uh every morning and uh, all right
 But she told us her her grade to mecca matt you racist not everybody celebrates christmas
 She would get up every morning and light the menorah
 And she was very happy about it. She's very conflicted. She was she was not a smart person
 Well, she's out there just to tootsie roll them nugs man, that's right, that's all she came for
 No, she'd get it because she has a job so she'd just get up in the morning and go to her job at the at
 the vet's office and all and then
 Come home in the evenings, I guess and and let the dogs out and have dinner and go to bed who?
 Did she stay at the house
 Yes, she stayed at the house she sleeps over, huh?
 She sleeps over that's that's part of the deal
 Did she leave behind a pile of dirty laundry for the dogs when they missed her?
 She did does she sleep upside down like a bat?
 I
 Not that I know of you don't know though. I didn't ask you showed her guest quarters. She's like no. I see this chin up bar
 I'm good. I got my brought a chin up bar. She's really into health and no I sleep upside down

 I use them to lock on to chin up bars and other protruding bars
 I oftentimes
 Find myself sleeping at gymnasiums and or playgrounds which can be troublesome
 That's why I keep this I keep this tarpaulium with me at all times
 To wrap myself
 If I have to sleep at a playground, I wrap myself in the tarpaulium so I don't arouse suspicion
 people think it's just a tarpaulium over a
 Reportedly broken piece of playground equipment not a human woman sleeping upside down. I emphasize human
 Well, it's i'm doing a little jock versus nerd
