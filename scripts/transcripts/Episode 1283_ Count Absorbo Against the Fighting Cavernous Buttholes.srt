1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,740
 Oh hello there, I am so glad to see you. I want to thank you, the ice cream truck drivers.

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:17,820
 Thank you so much, Richard Dunn, Roy Stansberry, Sarah Boyle, Sax Guy Jimmy D Scoop, and Slurpee

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:24,100
 K.A. Motherfucker. If you are a what? I can't talk today. If you want be ice cream truck

4
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:29,920
 driver. If you want to be an ice cream truck driver, head over to preachingfun.com. Preachingfun.com

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:36,600
 is where you go to sign up to be an ice cream truck driver and who knows? The life you save

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:46,000
 may be your own. Buckle up, I can't talk for the podcast. Hey Johnny, do you want to go

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,440
 to an ice cream social? Yeah, I'd love to. Great, let's go. We are here in the middle

8
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:59,640
 of snowmageddon part two. I am broadcasting from the frozen tundra, where none can pass.

9
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,440
 The white walkers are on their way, the wall is falling. It's all ice dragons from here

10
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:11,040
 on out. Forget it, fuck. Well it's time for Matt Mattingly's ice cream social sitting

11
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,040
 over there. It's Matt Donnelly sitting over there. It's Paul Mattingly over here. It's

12
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,040
 Jacob the audio guy. I'm a little chilly too. We're preachingfun. Yeah, what are y'all,

13
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,960
 60 degrees over there? I think it's closer to 70, but I do have a space heater going

14
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,120
 right over here next to me because my feet are a little chilly. It's so crazy out here.

15
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,880
 We got so much snow yesterday. It just did not stop. 12 consecutive hours of snowfall.

16
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:44,080
 It's time for Pittsburgh, parking and weather, with the famous Paul. Yeah, so it's thick,

17
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,760
 thick and rich up in this motherfucker. Like Gatorade. We've had to dig passageways for

18
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:57,720
 the dogs to go out to poo and pee. There's a big mound of snow up on one side of our

19
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:04,260
 porch that Ted keeps playing king of the mountain on it, so it's really cute and very funny.

20
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,280
 They love it. The corgs love it. They got those double coats. They don't give a shit.

21
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,040
 They're out there farting around in the snow, and then they come running right back as soon

22
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,960
 as they get the littlest bit. Inconvenient, so they're like, "Well, I'm just going to

23
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:19,680
 come back inside now." But they're ridiculous. Yeah, they're spoiled. We're very fortunate.

24
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,240
 We did not lose power at all during all this, so we didn't get any kind of ice per se. We're

25
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,240
 still digging out. We had generous, lovely neighbors come by at the height of the storm

26
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:39,400
 yesterday, and one guy on his ATV with a snowplow on the front plowed most of our driveway,

27
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,000
 and another neighbor came and snowblowed the rest of the driveway, and then it got another

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,480
 six inches on top of that where they'd cleared. We had to shovel again, and I've got to shovel

29
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,040
 again today before it's all done. And you called them back? You called them back over?

30
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,520
 I did not call them back over. They did more than they needed to know. Where are you guys?

31
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:02,520
 We got six more inches. Guys, we're at six more inches. Hello. Hello. No, they did great,

32
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:08,340
 so it's going to take a little while to dig out. I was supposed to have my first new class

33
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:15,240
 this evening for a new semester at Skit, but we put everything on delay because everybody

34
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,680
 is buried in snow, and it's still pretty difficult to get around. Lots of schools are closed

35
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,640
 for the next couple of days. The temperature is only going to go down from here. Yeah,

36
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,640
 sexy temperature. So the tough part is going to be, as there's a little bit of snow melt

37
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:36,600
 during the day, then the temperature goes way below freezing and ice, ice, ice, baby.

38
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,100
 So we'll see. We'll see how it goes. I don't go back to work till Wednesday, thank goodness,

39
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:48,200
 or until Thursday, Wednesday night, Thursday morning. So yeah, I got a little bit of time.

40
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,200
 Ann had to go in today, but she's got that snow mode. And she said once she got onto

41
00:03:52,200 --> 00:04:00,140
 the main roads, it wasn't terrible, but still not great. Yeah. Unless you're a corgi. Unless

42
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:05,800
 you're a corgi, then life is pretty fucking good. Yeah, they're loving it. Jacob, I wasn't

43
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:14,120
 paying attention. Who'd you think the ice cream truck driver, the top of the show? Not

44
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,640
 technical school port. You do not. No, no, he's on the next show. That's why I laughed

45
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,320
 to myself before we started the show. Cause you said he hadn't been thanked yet. I was

46
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,840
 like, I got him on the list. He's queued up for today. Too bad for him. We're doing a

47
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,440
 double show today. So he's going to hear about himself on two episodes. Well, we'll thank

48
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:39,240
 technical school port twice. How about that? Holy shit. A large black cat just walked past

49
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,560
 my back door and it just scared the shit out of me. You don't have a black cat. No, I don't

50
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,780
 own any cats. It should get the shit out of you. Large animal. He's coming for your, coming

51
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:55,800
 for your puppies. Oh, it just turned into a human. It just turned into a human. Just

52
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:03,880
 turned into a goth. Look at human. Well, we also found out we have a, we have a fire hydrant

53
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:10,320
 in our front yard and during dirt. Cause we had about three days of real heads up on this

54
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,200
 major storm coming through. And so, and doing her due diligence, looking up different factoids

55
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:21,160
 and whatnot about preparation, et cetera. It turns out we are responsible for keeping

56
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:28,720
 that fire hydrant accessible during winter storms because it is on our property. So really?

57
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,640
 Yeah. I didn't realize that either, but funny enough, it's not really covered. It's kind

58
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:41,600
 of clear. That leads me to believe that that water line has some, it's a big kind of heat.

59
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,840
 It's a big metal fire hydrant, right? Yes. But it also, I think it has, must have some

60
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,240
 kind of heat source in that water line to keep that all warm. You don't think it's moving

61
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,040
 though? I guess that's it. It's just flowing. Everyone knows that hot water puts out fire

62
00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:00,560
 faster than cold water. It's science. It's just science. It's just a big metal fire plug.

63
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,440
 Like that thing's going to hold heat longer than stuff around it. Nick Newman is giving

64
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,680
 me the wave off, uh, that there is no heat under that, that, uh, fire hydrant. What are

65
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,520
 you going to listen? You're going to listen to a fireman? I guess I'm listening to a firefighter.

66
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,280
 I don't know why Nick gets all the fucking credit around here. I said it wasn't fucking

67
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:24,440
 heated. He didn't listen to me. He sees a fire fucking fireman shows up, makes some chili

68
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,960
 and says, it's not heated. You go, well, I guess it's not heated. I very quickly changed

69
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,640
 my opinion on the, on the information of experts. Jacob, something, something I think more of

70
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,080
 us could learn. I just was going to say it's 2026. Are you really going to listen to a

71
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,280
 fireman tell you what, how a fire hydrant works? Right. What a dumb ass you listening

72
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,080
 to the experts. You want to do your own research. Why don't you vote? Yeah. Get a glass of warm

73
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,840
 milk, a warm, raw milk and a spit at the house. That puts it out. Did I talk, did I talk about

74
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,960
 this? I was at, I had lunch when I was in, uh, when I was in a Burbank with my friend,

75
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:05,480
 uh, Eli, uh, his wife, Erica, and then she's a doctor. Yeah. And, uh, she says all the

76
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:11,400
 time now she goes, we're going to, you know, we, we think your child has, you know, blank

77
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,200
 and we're going to, and our plan to take care of them is to do blank, blank, blank. And

78
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,800
 they go, hold on, hold on. And they type whatever she's saying into like chat. Oh, they don't

79
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,760
 even already have an opinion. I was already cringing. Cause I thought the parent would

80
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,840
 already have an opinion, but they have to look, they're not that informed. Oh, that's

81
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,160
 even worse. Yeah. They quest, they, they, they go, hold on before I tell you to proceed,

82
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,040
 I have to look this up and figure out what this chat. GBT tells me about what you just

83
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,880
 told me and whether or not I approve of the doctor's plans. This is why no one should

84
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,240
 be using chat GPT. No one should be using any of this AI garbage. It is a detriment

85
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:57,520
 to all of us. Absolutely. I use it all the time, but I don't use it to chat GPT. I don't

86
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,680
 use it to question experts. I don't use it, but you're feeding the beast, baby. You're

87
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,840
 feeding the beast. Just be careful. I just tell chat every day that Paul Mattingly loves

88
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:14,280
 you. I want to get Paul's, I want to get Paul's name into that chat. GPT brain chat. GPT can

89
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,720
 come to my house and we'll have real nice talk. Come to my house. I fed that beast a

90
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,480
 long time ago. Uh, I remember when it first happened, I don't think I've told the story

91
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,680
 on air, but I think it's been long enough. I can. The statute of limitations has run

92
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,880
 out. Yeah. So I, when it first came around, it was fascinating. And, and, and, and so

93
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:44,880
 I put every approved script of pen and teller, fool us into chat GPT. Yeah. And I figured

94
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,760
 it could, maybe it could help me write more scripts. Cause one of the biggest challenges

95
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,260
 being a writer on that show was writing 80 versions of, we'll be right back with more

96
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:58,600
 magic after this. Sure. Right. Right. 80 versions of that every year. Try to put some cute jokes

97
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:06,840
 in it, that kind of stuff. Yeah. So I put it in there and then one season, uh, all of

98
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,520
 a sudden, like the producers started experiment with chat, GPT to see if it was like worth

99
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,080
 doing it. All of a sudden I got like a note that was like, Hey, this chat, GPT stuff is,

100
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:23,560
 it's pretty good. I know I gave it all of our scripts, like whatever, but I didn't make

101
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:30,240
 that argument. And then they were like, uh, we, we had switched from a 14 episode season

102
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,040
 to a 20 episode season. Yes. Right. Which means that I thought you had longer to shoot

103
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,680
 it. So that was fine. But I got paid. It was about money. It was about whether I, how much

104
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,720
 more am I getting my episode rate? Is there a flat rate? Like what's happening with it?

105
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,520
 And they were dragging their heels. Uh, I was, the executive producer was not getting

106
00:09:52,520 --> 00:10:00,920
 back to me. And then they kept making jokes about chat GPT and replacing me with jet GPT.

107
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,040
 So all of a sudden it was like three weeks before the season started. Yeah. And I wrote

108
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:15,600
 a very, uh, uh, formal note. They hadn't hired Paul back yet. Um, and I wrote a very formal

109
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,640
 note being like, Hey, if you don't want to fly Paul back out, uh, I happily switch from

110
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:32,800
 being a writer to warm up comic for this upcoming season. Ah, because clearly you guys, I guess

111
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,680
 don't know what's getting back to my contract. I'm hearing jokes about replacing with jet

112
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:45,440
 GPT. Just make me the warmup comic and let's call it a day. Uh huh. And I wrote it to the

113
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,320
 one is a producer wasn't getting back to me. I wrote to both executive producers and the

114
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:56,520
 show runner. Good, good. This seems like a reasonable response because I was just getting

115
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:04,800
 pissed. Yeah. I got the angriest voicemail I've ever gotten from the executive producer

116
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:15,560
 of cursed me the fuck out. Like read me the riot act. Like I know exactly where he's coming

117
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:23,960
 from because obviously when I did work, the two other producers called the, that executive

118
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:33,240
 producer who's in charge of signing the contracts and what the fuck's going on. But that was

119
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,880
 an awkward, it was awkward backstage a couple of times throughout that season. It was a

120
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:45,880
 little frosty in the green room a few times, uh, that particular season of full with that

121
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,560
 producer with his chat GPT for Halloween that year, Matt felt like it was pointed a little

122
00:11:50,560 --> 00:12:01,640
 bit at him. Uh, yeah, no, I mean, look, you know, yeah, it is what it is. Uh, I said that

123
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:07,560
 like my current opinion with AI and chat GPT is like, we thought we were creating like

124
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:14,920
 this God of all knowledge, right? That we could consult and what we created was like

125
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:21,480
 a really eager, fresh out of college assistant. That's like, who's just like wants to just

126
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,440
 supply you with everything. Sometimes they're right. Sometimes they're wrong, but like they

127
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,440
 got your back, right? Right. They're just like, ah, here, maybe, maybe you want all

128
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,160
 this. You're like, ah, maybe two of those things, but thank you. Yeah. You said this,

129
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,080
 but that's not even true. What you wrote here. I don't think you researched that properly.

130
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,600
 It's just wrong. This is entirely wrong. Yeah. Yeah. So now that's how I look at. That's

131
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,120
 how I look at chat. GPT is, is like, it's a, it's a really, really wants the gig. It's

132
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,000
 really going places, but right now it's just fresh out of college and it's, and it's trying

133
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,680
 too hard. Boy, do I like using it to, uh, to sort information. I like putting a lot

134
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,200
 of information into it. And they were like, make me a table that shows me all of that.

135
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:06,280
 Yeah. Yeah. It works really well for that. That's it for the clerical and like clinical

136
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:14,680
 things. It's good. You know, for knowledge and like advice, it's terrible. Oh,

137
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:23,880
 advice. Forget it. And for humor, it's abominable. Yeah. Right. But for sexy dating chat,

138
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,040
 go ahead. Let's go. They'll tell you exactly what you want to hear.

139
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:39,480
 I'll tell you exactly who loves a good sexy Twitch chat, not Twitch chat, chat, GPT chat

140
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:45,240
 on Twitch. And that's the following sponsor today's show, man, man, at least ice cream

141
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:51,800
 social. No, no, I'm getting a boner. Stop. Absolutely. I can help you that boner if you

142
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,280
 want. Would you like me to list seven things you can do with your boner? Seven things you

143
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:04,600
 can do with your boner. Today's show is brought to you by, Oh, new sentient tampons hungry for

144
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:11,080
 blood, hungry for action. New tampons from goof scoop in 2023.

145
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:33,480
 Hello. It is that time of the month. I know because I looked at your calendar. Hey,

146
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:45,640
 I am count absorbable. I am here to fill your vaginal cavity and suck up your blood. Yes.

147
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:54,040
 Count absorbable guarantee is no leaks. A dry panty every time.

148
00:14:54,040 --> 00:15:04,840
 You never have to fret when count absorbable. He sees the wet. I will take it away. Slurp, slurp,

149
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:17,480
 slurp away. It goes into my hungry maw. I count absorbable promise that no blood shall go wasted.

150
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:26,600
 Please run to your local supermarket or big box retailer and pick up a package

151
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:36,040
 of count absorbable insert upon. They are fresh and ready to be used in your vaginal cavity.

152
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:44,920
 Insert upon what? I insist upon you insert upon.

153
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:51,560
 Better hay scoops to check out. Why aren't they called insert upon?

154
00:15:53,080 --> 00:16:07,480
 It is a trademark way of saying tampon is insert upon. They should be called. I honestly think

155
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,560
 that all of the world has kept everyone in the dark about everything for as long as they can.

156
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,320
 Everybody just tries to obfuscate and confuse everything constantly.

157
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:24,440
 Something wrong this week. Why are condoms constantly being placed on bananas in health

158
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:30,520
 class? Use a fucking dildo. Use a fucking penis. What the fuck? I don't know. Everything's weird.

159
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,920
 Everything's a fucking game. Everything's a fucking shell game. I don't know.

160
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:43,720
 How you doing, buddy? It's all bullshit. I'm fine. I'm covered in fucking snow is what I am.

161
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:52,360
 I don't mind it, though. We went out to a fancy dinner on Friday night, which was lovely.

162
00:16:52,360 --> 00:17:02,440
 Matt and Malia. How much of what you ordered was cut in half and put in a plate of molten cheese?

163
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:08,760
 Oh, my God. Have you been seeing the videos of the thing? Have you seen the videos? It's exactly

164
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,160
 what I said. And they're all just like they eat the first one and then they go for the second one

165
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,520
 and the whole plate comes up because it's fucking glued to it. It's hilarious. Congealed. It's

166
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:26,840
 hilarious. Oh, my God. We just chat GPTed Count Absorbo. Oh, my God. That is outrageous. Who did

167
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:34,920
 that? Is that Laurie? My God, Laurie. That's great. Oh, no. That's really good. That's going

168
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:41,240
 to be at Scoop Fest. I mean, that somebody's coming as Count Absorbo for John versus Dirt.

169
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:49,880
 Can you save that for a sticker art, please? That is wonderful. My God. That's great, Laurie.

170
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,800
 Holy shit. That's exactly what I was thinking. He likes. He's like, let's make a sticker out of it.

171
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,960
 I know. Well, yeah. Well, I mean, we're not making stickers anymore, but you also just

172
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,680
 ranted against using chat GPT. Now you're blown away by chat. I am. I know. I hate it. Well,

173
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:07,320
 but you know, and it's terrible because I don't use chat GPT to make our stickers. We don't use

174
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,800
 chat GPT. We have artists to make all our stuff. We don't have any of that. Stealing from other art.

175
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,080
 That's clearly stealing from other art. It's clearly stealing from whoever makes garbage

176
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,720
 pill kids. Oh, there's also that does look a little bit like garbage specifically.

177
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:26,680
 However, it should serve as inspiration for the Jack versus Nerd costume ball. So there you go.

178
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,600
 No, I do want people to come as Count Absorbo for John versus Dirt ball.

179
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:40,840
 I am very excited about that. Nick Newman says that he is less disgusted by Count Absorbo than

180
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:48,680
 he is by the cheese pool burger. I agree. The cheese pool burger is out of hand. It's so dumb.

181
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:53,880
 So anyway, yeah, we went and had a fancy dinner at the little winery down the road, which was

182
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:59,800
 lovely. And we also had my friend Scott and Sarah came with us too. So that was awesome. And it was

183
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,000
 just kind of one of those nice little things. Anne was still on vacation. And this was a thing I had

184
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,720
 planned for a long time, the six of us to go have dinner together. But Anne schedule, we'd made plans

185
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,280
 with Matt and Malia a couple of times and Anne had to bail because she got pulled into work. So I was

186
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:22,360
 like, hands off work. So I didn't invite anybody until Thursday. This is like, fuck it. Last minute

187
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,720
 is the way to go with all this kind of stuff. And we did it. Social butterfly. It worked. It worked

188
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:34,360
 out. It worked out great. And then I ran back home to get back on the, uh, the zoom and we had a real

189
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:42,120
 fun scoop zoom night game night. And that was great on Friday night. Super, super fun. So yeah,

190
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:48,840
 who was the one who was the big winner from the scoop hang? Oh man. Um, well, no one wins the

191
00:19:48,840 --> 00:20:18,680
 scoop hang. No, no, no. Um, uh, scooper star McScoop slot, general scooper star scoops lot. He won a bunch. Uh, and, uh, scoop shooter was tearing it up too. Uh, galactic president, scooper star, scoops lot. Thank you, Richard. Yes, that's, that's, and, uh, Richard, uh, did really well too. Slurpee CA came through pretty hardcore. Uh, yeah, we had a bunch of great, we had the cavernous buttholes. That was a great one, Leon. Yeah. Uh, I won one or two, but, um, yeah, it was, this is a really fun night.

192
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:48,040
 We played one weird game, this murder game that we didn't understand. And, uh, it didn't, it was wasted like 20 minutes, just fire. But we were all having fun just chatting and, you know, having a good time. So it was really nice. So we'll do it again next month. We'll set it up. Uh, I'll try and aim for, I'm trying to aim for different nights of the week so that different people can play here and there weapons drawn. That was the game. It did not make any sense. Um, yeah, but thirsty won that one. I don't know. He didn't know how I want it, but.

193
00:20:48,920 --> 00:21:11,480
 Props to him for tearing it up. So yeah, it was fun. So we've had, we had a good week off and then we kind of buckled down for snowmageddon coming in here. And here we are. Unfortunately, Anne had to go back to work today, which sucks, but I've got a few more days to still kind of just literally chill out. And I am so, so cold.

194
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:42,360
 I am, I'm looking for a, there we go. I see Matt dirty and Chad here. He sent us a breakdown of our scoop fantasy football league interview here. Oh, good. Coming down to the wire. I forgot. I know it's done. It's all over. It's all over. Yeah. It's all over. Uh, but, uh, let's see, uh, here's a wrap up of the 2025 scoop fantasy football league in the upper league. Jake Harrington team, 185 lumberjacks took the championship over.

195
00:21:42,640 --> 00:22:10,480
 Mike brosberg, the manable. Yeah. Uh, Otto Eisenberg, sweat house employees, uh, took third place over Matt dirty, savory, Maddie D being relegated down to the lower league is Matthew Burdick, Matt Matthew. Welcome to the lower league, buddy. I've been down here the whole time. Uh, I want to give you a welcome. We have free lemonade and I think you're gonna really like it here. It's pretty cozy. Do not drink the lemonade.

196
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:41,720
 It is gone bad. I will absolutely be here waiting for you when you get down here. So no worries there. Uh, and so is a Troy Soto, uh, Troy Sato. I don't say no. How do Troy? How do we ever said your last name correctly? I don't know. I say Sato Troy Sato. Yeah, he's been, well, he's been obviously running, helping run this league for the very beginning. So he's, he's, he's welcome to lower league, buddy. Uh, and the lower league, Jacob Smith, Matt has team hassle.

197
00:22:41,720 --> 00:23:11,700
 Back, Matt has sold back that ass up. Uh, you won the championship in the lower league, Jacob. Oh, did I? Yes, you did. Oh, that's interesting. This is the first I'm hearing of it. Uh, you beat Paul Clayton, whose team arsonist gets all the TDS. Uh, he, he, he, you beat him, but you'll both be moving up to the upper league next season, buddy. Jacob Smith, everybody, Jacob. No, I'm in trouble next year. I'm in trouble next year.

198
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:35,700
 Also, I guess I have to play next year. I guess after winning, I'm obligated to play another year. I joined, uh, 12 magicians in another league and I won that league and just want you to know how much worse magicians are than scoops at fantasy football. Just so I'm sure that tracks that definitely tracks.

199
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:51,220
 Definitely tracks. Yeah. So Paul Clayton, let's see in third place game, Dave Peterson, whose team Tyreke of Alcohol beat Justin Jelenek from the Fighting Squirrels. So, yeah, that's it.

200
00:23:51,220 --> 00:24:02,940
 So if you want to join our league next year, this year we were better. We had like a Facebook group and the Facebook chat was a good place to interact and bust balls. So we set up some fun trash talk.

201
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:14,780
 We stepped it up this year. For those that was the only thing I was missing in the other years is there was no consolidated place for me to make fun of myself. But this place was very, it was very comforting this year.

202
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:29,020
 I told us, Jay, she was like, did you win your fantasy football league? I said, well, my my because she was asking about the big one that I play every year. Yeah, I said, oh, I got I got third place in that one. But I won the the scoops one.

203
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:46,020
 She looked at me. She's like, you you played a fantasy football league with the listeners to your podcast and then you you won. That's precisely what happened.

204
00:24:46,020 --> 00:25:04,820
 She goes, did you organize this league? I said, I did not. I did not. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thankfully, I at least did not put the thing together. I just played at least the illusion of arbitrary. Yeah. We had 22, 22 people, 22 people, 22 teams.

205
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:20,820
 We have over 24. So if you want to get in touch with Matt Daugherty or Troy next year as we head into it, we'll announce it as we head into it. But they always we all pay to get in the league. And then they give a big chunk of change right back to us as a donation for our our podcast, which is very generous of them.

206
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:45,820
 It's wonderful. Thank you. Oh, wait, that means I won money for this, too. Yeah, I forgot about that. Technically. Yeah. Yeah. So I took money from the scoops insult to injury over here. I if you if you look over on the chat, Leon has posted one of the winning T shirts from the T Fury battle, which is no AI. That was my illustration of a duck.

207
00:25:45,820 --> 00:26:02,820
 And then people put cavernous butthole under it and you can order that through TV. Great. I think the cavernous butthole ducks would be a great team to add to the football fantasy football league for next year.

208
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:24,820
 My team name this year was I say horse, you say beans. So maybe go with cavernous butthole, having this butthole. The cavernous buttholes. Yeah. The fighting cavernous buttholes. Yeah. So I was 18 out of 22 players, which is pretty good. Hey, look at you holding your own pretty good.

209
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:40,820
 You're regular Kansas City Chief over here. I'm 22. You're a regular Dallas Cowboy. I'm in the lower league, right? So they're automatically above. Oh, they're all just all guys. They're automatically above. Who's even in the Super Bowl? Is it happened already? Do we know it did happen?

210
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:59,820
 It did happen. Paul breaking news because this airs Thursday. So yeah, the Patriots with a decisive victory over backup quarterback step up one head to seven. So they're coming into the Super Bowl with a lot of heat. That's a lot of heat.

211
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:13,820
 Head to seven. Did you did you watch that game at all? I did because I'm on tour with Eric Dillman, who's in New England there. Oh, sure. Sure. And we were snowed in, right? Which I haven't got a story yet, but we were we were. I am.

212
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:36,820
 I am the Snowden Hotel in Bloomington, Indiana. And so we trudged through the snow to the upstairs bar here in town, and it was packed because it's a snow day. Sure. And we watched what should have been an awesome day watching football and instead was one of the most boring.

213
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:52,820
 Actually, one of the most poorly kicked games I've ever seen. Was it one of those games where was all field goals? No, it was all missed field goals. Oh, no. And all botched punts like right. And so that shows the outcome of the whole thing.

214
00:27:52,820 --> 00:28:20,820
 Huh? Yeah, it was. It got snowy and super windy like the game started, and it was a clear, beautiful, sunny day in Denver. Oh, and then like a blizzard rolled in. Like third quarter, it was clear and fine. By the fourth quarter, you couldn't see your hand in front of your face. Well, that was crazy. That was the weirdest thing on Thursday. I guess it was out here. Thursday was like.

215
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:34,820
 Spring. It was weird. We were like, What the fuck is going on? It sunshine. Beautiful. Still snow on the ground, but just gorgeous. And then turned on a dime weather wise. Yeah.

216
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:55,820
 And then, well, then the Rams in Seattle played probably the best game. I don't think the Super Bowl is going to be better than that game. No, I don't think so. I think that was that was a really good game came down to really like crazy, weird mistakes. And yeah, like it was a real battle. Yeah, it was fun. That was a great game.

217
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:04,860
 I haven't seen you all see for the minute. He says go Pats. Yeah, I mean it is it's going

218
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,940
 to be it's it's funny that like both teams will be an underdog story. If the Patriots

219
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:13,060
 win it'll be crazy for a team that had four wins last year to take a second year quarterback

220
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:18,520
 and win this early would be bananas. Right. And Sam Darnold has literally been shipped

221
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:24,720
 off by two teams. And if he was the Seattle quarterback it'll be a crazy story for him

222
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,740
 to win. If Sam Darnold wins as the Seattle quarterback the Jets should have to go to

223
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:37,620
 the SEC because if he wins as the Seattle quarterback that means the Jets are so much

224
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:44,420
 worse as an organization than we ever even thought they were. Also. No I'm reconsidering

225
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:48,660
 we don't want them in the SEC. I was just gonna say I think every jet fan I know would

226
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:52,740
 take that deal. Yeah. I think every jet fan. I'm thinking about what LSU is doing right

227
00:29:52,740 --> 00:30:00,620
 now. LSU is definitely running its team better than the New York Jets. I would. Vinnie Grasso

228
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,860
 is a huge jet span. I was like I bet he'd be like yeah yeah let's do that for them.

229
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:08,700
 Let's do that for a few years. Let's see how we can handle the Tennessee volunteers for

230
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:15,820
 a while go down there. I'll tell you who else can handle a bunch of volunteers. And that's

231
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:22,420
 the following sponsor. Today's show Matt Manningley's ice cream social is brought to you by Dan

 That's my life. That's what I do. But my side hustle now is a new one and very intriguing.

237

00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,740
 wrong spelling of weather in one of my little advertisements for the class I'm teaching

251
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:29,700
 on Saturday night out out in Toronto. You went with the H. Yeah. I went with the wrong

252
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:36,620
 one the one that describes how the the atmosphere is doing rather than you know. Oh no I went

253
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,460
 the wrong way. Yeah. So I still can't even get it right when you're to correcting me.

254
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:45,220
 I don't even know. I just that's that's that's a that's an Achilles heel for me that one.

255
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:50,340
 But also it's a blind spot. I think in the future it will be an advantage for me to have

256
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:58,140
 my spelling errors riddled throughout my writings as it will be indicative of my non chat GPT

257
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:03,300
 infused work. So people go oh yeah there's Manningly trying to spell again. He clearly

258
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:10,100
 wrote this without any fucking help. Obviously from him is obviously him with his no no ability

259
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:21,660
 to spell. You guys want to do a little scoop mail. Yes. Scoop mail. I would love it. We're

260
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:26,140
 starting off with a with a heavy one today. We're starting off with one from the OG scoop.

261
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:29,340
 He's in the chat with us as well. But he wrote this a while ago. Hey guys I want to reach

262
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:34,460
 out and just say thanks to you guys and all the scoop community. In early October I lost

263
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:39,860
 my brother at the young age of 56. Sadly he had suffered from mental illness and addiction

264
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:45,500
 for most of his life and was homeless when he passed. He was in my town living in Section

265
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,640
 8 housing for the past few years but drifted to Florida and ultimately ultimately to Las

266
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:56,340
 Vegas in August. Coincidentally he was in Vegas during scoop fest because of ICS and the scoops

267
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:00,900
 I consider Vegas a treasure at home away from home and the fact that he passed in that area

268
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:05,660
 near scoop family gave me some peace in all of the sorrow and issues that arose concerning

269
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:10,080
 his arrangements. I just want to remind you that you guys and the scoops have brought

270
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,220
 me laughter joy and friendship and it doesn't go unnoticed. Thanks again for all the love

271
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:21,060
 and support. Love you all. Even you. You know who you are. That's Andy. The OG scoop. Andy

272
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:25,580
 I'm sorry pal. Yeah man. Yeah. That's tough. And then the whole scenario that you brought

273
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:32,500
 up that seems really tough. I don't know how I would deal with. Yeah. With a situation

274
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:38,140
 like that. That's really. And I know there was an issue. I know Andy had a you know just

275
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:43,460
 all of the stuff that goes along with that. You know transporting the remains back and

276
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:49,700
 doing doing all of that stuff. Right. You know it makes a lot of it makes a lot of work

277
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:57,620
 and it sucks. Yeah. Yeah it's incredibly difficult. You have to almost delay your grief and put

278
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:01,500
 on your professional hat. Yeah. Remember Anne having to go through a lot of that shit when

279
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:07,220
 her father passed and she really had to kind of postpone her feelings for a while to get

280
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:12,940
 everything else lined up properly. It's hard. It's incredibly hard to be responsible. I

281
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:18,660
 can't imagine being in Las Vegas and be like my brother is unhoused somewhere around here.

282
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:22,980
 That's a really weird thing to deal with. It's a hard thing to have to deal with. Yeah.

283
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,540
 I don't think there was crossover. I don't I don't think Andy was in town while his brother

284
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:32,100
 was here because Andy didn't make the most recent scoop fest but his brother was in town

285
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:40,300
 during the most recent scoop fest. Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. No it sucks. But the scoop community

286
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:47,340
 of course is always fantastic. And that's part of what O.G. was was trying to say there.

287
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:53,380
 And that is something that's always worth compliment rescinded. No never mind. Never

288
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:58,100
 mind. I tried. I tried everybody. You heard me. You heard me try. Rejected. I will not

289
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:06,060
 take it. We got one here from poutine scoop. Hello fuckers. What was your first clue that

290
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:12,540
 you guys liked music as a kid. I don't mean bus dumping bands while on the island music

291
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:19,140
 but the first time you knew. For me it was Alanis Morissette. I didn't get you. I didn't

292
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:25,860
 get you. You ought to know. That must be what that's supposed to be. Auto correct. I had

293
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:30,240
 a field day with this email. Sorry. I didn't get you ought to know as a teenager but when

294
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,060
 hand in my pocket came out as a single I had to get my first CD and radio. What was it

295
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:43,160
 for you. Poutine scoop. Poutine scoop. I know that my first CD that I bought when CDs come

296
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:55,900
 out came out was AC DC's Razor's Edge. The classic AC DC album Razor's Edge. And I stand

297
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:02,500
 by that purchase. I stand by that. I you know I've always been embarrassed about my musical

298
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,700
 tastes and I've always been something else about that. Even like I shared a room with

299
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:14,220
 my brother Rob and when we did homework together I would default to his taste in music. He

300
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:21,640
 played the music in the room that we did homework to. Like I was still buying just like Springsteen

301
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:26,420
 and Billy Joel stuff. I was going to say having watched that Springsteen documentary I think

302
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:34,740
 you're I think your embarrassment is justified. Fully justified. The movie you said doc right

303
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:42,700
 but the movie the movie's bad but the documentary's good. Oh I haven't seen the documentary. He

304
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:47,700
 was playing like Dylan he was playing old school R.E.M. He was this weird British band

305
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:52,100
 called the Levellers. I remember he was into whatever. The Levellers. He was always like

306
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:56,300
 playing like cool stuff and then I was always just aping whatever my brother older brothers

307
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:05,140
 were into. So yeah I would say I my first CD purchase I literally was like what's the

308
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:12,320
 greatest selling CD at the time was Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon. All right. I would

309
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:20,380
 actually probably say is when when post island time I think like when Steve and I did reduce

310
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:27,940
 and I moved to San Diego as our less interesting and less fruitful sequel. We had a roommate

311
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:32,860
 Mikey there and he got me into all kinds of cool bands. I really got it. Tom Waits at

312
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:38,500
 that time. Yeah it was just a bunch of cool bands came out of that and that really kind

313
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:46,580
 of shaped the way of the music. I swear to God that I don't think like I'm curious how

314
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:53,220
 I listen to music before I took acid once once I took acid. I heard music differently

315
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:59,460
 the rest of my life and I can you describe that. Well yeah I don't. I was just a melody

316
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:04,380
 person. I was into whatever the catch was. You weren't listening to lyrics. And then

317
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,900
 all of a sudden I took acid. No. So to this day I'm still not a good lyric person but

318
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:13,060
 I love arrangements instrumentation like how far where is the brass of the mix like versus

319
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:18,420
 like where's the drums like where the keyboard and I get fascinated by arrangements and sounds

320
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:24,060
 and quality of sounds and types of sounds. And I like all of that stuff in music now

321
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:30,660
 and that did not happen until I took LSD. OK. I don't know Matt. I didn't often. You

322
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,220
 know I mean like I can count on my hand how many times I've done it. But it changed the

323
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:38,900
 way I heard music forever. I think you really need to watch how I listen to music. I think

324
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:43,060
 you need to spend some time with Nine Inch Nails The Fragile. I think that album will.

325
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:46,740
 I bet I would go back and really appreciate it. I think you would because that's a double

326
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:51,380
 album and it is just layers and layers and layers. A lot of shit. I mean I definitely

327
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:55,940
 listen to music in a very similar way. I definitely listen to it. I'm listening to like the structure

328
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:03,380
 of it. I'm listening to like interesting side melodies and harmonies and all. Yeah I'm bad

329
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:09,580
 about listening to lyrics as well. Yeah I remember like going to Beyonce's album and

330
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:13,900
 like hearing she puts hints of her other songs and other parts of the songs and like following

331
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:19,100
 those threads and stuff and the patterns. Yeah I like all that stuff now. But I'm still

332
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:23,140
 self-conscious. You remember years ago when 50 Shades Closed I was an Uber driver for

333
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:29,820
 two weeks. Oh yeah. And the thought of putting on my own music when someone else got into

334
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:34,500
 a car stranger was like good lord. Like that was the most stressful thing to me was what

335
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:41,220
 to have on the speakers when someone entered my vehicle. Yeah. My brother and I were very

336
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:47,220
 lucky as kids for a little while while we were going to St. Mark's. Mom and Dad couldn't

337
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:51,420
 pick us up after school. We had a babysitter for a couple months and she would come and

338
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:58,380
 get us and she was a cool college student and she was jamming to the violent films.

339
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:06,140
 She had that. Oh solid. In her car the whole time. And that first violent films album it

340
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:12,220
 was fresh. It was brand new then. John and I listened to that a lot. That was her jam.

341
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:15,900
 And so we both got to that. John even more than me. I think he's seen them in concert

342
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,980
 a couple more times than I have. He's a big violent fems head. And then we just got into

343
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:28,660
 a little more alternative stuff. He went to Pesh mode Tom Waits. I went they might be

344
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:34,060
 Giants and body count. So you know we both had our things. We listened to all kind of

345
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:41,860
 crazy shit. That's the thing. Both of us very diverse musical tastes. And I'm on a tour

346
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:46,220
 right now and we're sharing a Sprinter van. Yeah. And we were doing a late night drive

347
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:49,380
 and all of a sudden it was like we should put on some music and I was like I'm in the

348
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:53,900
 front seat you know. So you have control. You couldn't do it. And I literally was like

349
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:58,020
 what is everybody like. I was like I'm not going to lead the charge. I will not lead

350
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:05,300
 the charge on this. I will not do it. I was too scared. I was like I don't think this

351
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,660
 whole place is going to jam out to the Aved brothers. I don't think that's going to happen.

352
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:13,580
 You never know. You just got to go for it. Southside Johnny baby. I say the other fails.

353
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:18,220
 The other part of John and I's music and I think I don't know if this applies to you

354
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:23,700
 or Jacob. Jacob probably you but we were in a region coming up through college and whatnot

355
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:29,980
 that got a lot of bands. Tons of bands come through Ohio and Louisville. Oh yeah. There's

356
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:35,000
 just a touring circuit through there with venues that are older venues that can house

357
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,460
 you know three hundred to a thousand people for mid-level bands coming up. And at that

358
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:46,100
 time you could go see a concert for fifteen twenty bucks. You know. Yeah. So got to see

359
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:52,180
 all kind of shit coming up in college. I don't I don't guess that's really an option for

360
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:57,700
 a lot of college students today. I don't know. I got to see this is a weird random one. I

361
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:04,540
 got to see vanilla ice on one of his first concerts that he did when he switched over

362
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:11,460
 to like thrash metal. Oh yeah. When he first came out of rap. All right. Yes. Like vanilla

363
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:17,220
 ice ice ice baby would even still been on the charts when he was doing this and he was

364
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:24,900
 doing like scream thrash metal versions of all of his rap song crazy. It was crazy. It

365
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:32,460
 was at a place called the bait shack in Louisiana. And yeah it was like this is insane. I remember

366
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:38,300
 going up to Ohio with John one time we went to see Alanis Morissette right before she

367
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:43,060
 blew up. We saw her on her jagged little pill to her right before everything really got

368
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:51,500
 huge. Like I said we probably saw her for 20 bucks. And Tyler what's his name. The Foo

369
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:58,460
 Fighters drummer was with her at that point. Oh that was one of his early hits. The guy

370
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:02,180
 who just passed away sadly. Yeah yeah. Tyler Hawkins thank you. Hawkins that's it. All

371
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:07,580
 I could think of was Horton. Thank you Scoop Chat. So yeah and it was just you know yeah

372
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:11,700
 that's cool. And I also got to see Guar at that same spot. I saw Guar twice in the same

373
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:15,900
 weekend. I saw him in Louisville and then saw him again in Cincinnati. Oh by the way

374
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:22,380
 Guar's cover of Pink Pony Club is so good right. It's just spectacular. If you haven't

375
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:27,220
 seen Guar cover Pony Club then do yourself a favor. Pour one out for Odorous. Also there

376
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:32,140
 was a really good there was a really good rock radio station in my hometown growing

377
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:36,580
 up. So I could I could pull that up. They always had really good songs. They played

378
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:41,780
 some really good stuff. They played some fucking bangers on there. And yeah it was like I

379
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:47,140
 don't know what the number was like 106 or something like that. But yeah that was that

380
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,980
 was probably the most that was most of my music growing up because like we had cassette

381
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:57,540
 tapes and all. But like I wasn't going out and buying them. I didn't have we didn't

382
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:03,740
 have cassette tape money. Not all that. I was just looking at my library to see like

383
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:13,420
 what what what are my top like what. Not my top my most recent ones. F1 soundtrack I really

384
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:21,300
 liked it. Springsteen Arctic Monkeys Jesse Wells Brandi Carlisle. Jesse Wells that's

385
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:30,300
 good. Jesse Wells is killing it. Yeah Noah Cyrus Irish band called Seal another Irish

386
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:34,940
 band called The Heistle Prophets. That was obviously inspired from Scoop Fest. Yeah yeah

387
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:44,860
 more Irish music in my life. Two Skinny Jays Lena Hall Imagine Dragons Ava Brothers Brandy

388
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:54,340
 Carlisle again. We got also service. Yeah. What's the skinny with Pina Plain. They still

389
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:59,140
 out and about there. Now they're going out two out of three at a time and rotating between

390
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:05,020
 the three of them because the cruise ship changed their policies about hosting trios

391
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:10,500
 because of the amount of cabin space it takes up. Oh for fuck's sake. Yeah. Well there's

392
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:17,100
 only one solution one. They have to pair up. Somebody has to pair up right. Yeah yeah yeah.

393
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:21,100
 There's only one solution. They have to become one of those things like they have to attach

394
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:24,980
 each other's mouths to their assholes. They have to become one of those things. They have

395
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:29,380
 to become a centipede. They have to become a human centipede. So they can go on tour

396
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:33,780
 together. That's the only thing that they can do. Hey guys it's Matt, Fiona and Phil.

397
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:43,980
 Start fucking. Quick. Let's see what have I listened to lately. Oh yesterday I was listening

398
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:52,420
 to Victory Lap Nipsey Hussle album. Oh I forget what triggered Nipsey Hussle in my head but

399
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:58,980
 boy was that album fucking great. Gone too soon. And then randomly, boy talk about two

400
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:03,620
 sides of a different coin here, randomly last night I was listening to One More From the

401
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:13,300
 Road which is a live Lynyrd Skynyrd concert from the 70s. Wow. So that's my two most recent

402
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:20,900
 Nipsey Hussle and Lynyrd Skynyrd. So I guess nobody living I suppose now that I'm thinking

403
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:28,780
 about it as well. Nobody living. Nobody living. Let's see we got one here from Hey Scoop Get

404
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:34,580
 Off My Lawn. Hey guys exciting news for Christmas. My wife bought us tickets for Matt's show

405
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:40,140
 in Lexington next week. Oh hell yeah. I don't think it's next week anymore right. It happened.

406
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:45,500
 It means I saw you. It means you came and we hung out. Yes. I kept talking about it

407
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:50,060
 and she had to pretend it would be awful to see Matt for a third time just so I wouldn't

408
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:58,220
 think that she didn't want to go or just so I would think she didn't want to go. Ah boy

409
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:03,300
 is she right. Now the real question is will you do Battle of Dreams again? I'm convinced

410
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:08,540
 and possibly wrong about how the trick works so I'll be watching carefully. The last time

411
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:13,780
 you did it you kept my wife's dream and put it away for later. Still waiting to know why.

412
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:18,780
 See you soon Matt. And here's an obelisk I did a while back for you guys. Enjoy Hey Scoop

413
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:25,780
 Get Off My Lawn. Quickly before you get to that game. Yes. No Battle of Dreams was cut

414
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:36,420
 from this show. That was a foolers run and the jokers they did not want it in the show.

415
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:41,380
 I don't do that trick as often as I used to just because I haven't ever been performing

416
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:45,620
 in an environment where I have I try to do it on cruise ships and what happened was I

417
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:50,820
 found that the staff would not get all the papers out to everybody but they would get

418
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:57,940
 out to like 20 or 30 people and it made it feel more exclusive than inclusive with people

419
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:03,860
 in the audience there. People were upset that they didn't get to do it. Yeah and it's also

420
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:08,140
 part of the prover that anybody can do it. That's it. Anybody can participate. Yeah.

421
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:12,740
 So sometimes people don't even have the papers like what the hell do I care. Yeah. I actually

422
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:19,460
 want to change the so right now Penn and Teller are doing it in their show and they have made

423
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:23,980
 it much more sophisticated. Is it going well? And it's going very well and Penn has really

424
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:28,940
 made it his own. And Hondro who invented the trick and performed the trick saw the latest

425
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:33,060
 version of Penn and Tellers and said I'm not going to do it anymore. You guys are doing

426
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:39,140
 such a better job. Oh wow. I did. And so he said I'm going to stop performing it. Are

427
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:43,020
 they back at it? You should have started by saying that. You should have started by being

428
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:47,940
 like I'm not doing it in my show anymore because Penn and Teller are doing it so well. So Hondro

429
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:51,860
 and I have decided not to for now. Penn really liked that we were all doing it and like we

430
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:54,340
 would all three of us would kind of like talk about different things we've learned from

431
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:58,420
 different versions of doing it kind of thing. That part was awesome you know to feel like

432
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:05,900
 I'm included in the group with Hondro and Penn. And I actually want to change the trick

433
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:15,300
 for myself now because of doing crowd work of people's dreams. It's like I basically

434
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:21,100
 I'm trying to like figure out a trick that could I could cut into more social media friendly

435
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:27,180
 things right and put it earlier in the show not make it like a finale piece. I think about

436
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:32,840
 asking people for fun facts about them or someone in their family as a go to ask instead

437
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:38,280
 of asking people to come up with a crazy dream. I think I want to get like hardcore some kind

438
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:43,300
 of fun fact. Oh yeah fun fact about somebody that you're there with. That's a fun that's

439
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:47,880
 a fun ask. Yeah and I think that and so but right now I'm doing the Joker's tour so there's

440
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:55,780
 no room for new material. I pitched it. Right. I said no. And I pitched it they all said

441
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:59,820
 not funny enough so we moved on. And I have a bunch of cruiser coming up and then lately

442
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:02,820
 I've been doing more corporates. I don't think it's the kind of trick I want to do for corporate

443
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:07,540
 yet. Right. I want to like put it in a live environment first to feel what it really is

444
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:11,120
 before I figure out what the corporate version is. So I'm trying to figure out when the hell

445
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:15,160
 I can add new shit to my show. But the first time the first opportunity I get I'm adding

446
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:22,260
 that to the to the routine. Oh yeah. Because it was finishing with a physical production

447
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:31,620
 of the dream when I was touring. And especially for my show a production is a big deal. Because

448
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:37,460
 I'm a one man operation. And I think I have a fun thing for that. I think I have a fun

449
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:43,340
 way to finish the trick out. So we'll see. And you got that. And you got that prop that

450
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:54,100
 I sent you for your new finale. Jacob sent me a sale on like Facebook marketplace for

451
00:52:54,100 --> 00:53:01,820
 like a giant fire cage like a disappearing. So you go inside set yourself on fire disappear.

452
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:06,020
 Right. Yeah. The best thing about Las Vegas is people selling magic props on Facebook

453
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:18,020
 marketplace. Well I I gave away my levitation rig on Facebook marketplace and we're interacting

454
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:23,220
 and the person who did it is actually performer here in town. She showed up right. So we're

455
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:27,560
 interacting and also a woman pulls up in a truck and I was like oh I didn't know the person

456
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:34,700
 I was interacting with as a woman. And then it's that thing of like oh God we're meeting

457
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:42,020
 over Facebook marketplace. How do I not be creepy. But then the thought of that makes

458
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:46,980
 me automatically creepy. Right. Plus you were saying all of this out loud. You were thinking

459
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:54,940
 out loud. Oh God a girl. And I just dropped my pants down to my ankles. That's what he

460
00:53:54,940 --> 00:54:02,420
 does folks. And I basically was like hi wife wife wife my wife your wife my wife my wife

461
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:13,580
 my wife my wife my kids I have wife and kids. We are not. This is not weird but we ended

462
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:18,160
 up becoming we actually end up becoming Instagram friends and now I'm going to see the rig in

463
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:23,740
 action I think in April. Nice. Which would be great because I never put into my fucking

464
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:30,260
 show. But yeah. So now to be in Jim Kramer show. Yeah. Yeah. But Lexington. So a bunch

465
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:34,180
 of scoops came out to Lexington and obviously obviously like not keeping that fresh in my

466
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:39,220
 mind that we did a turnout here. But yes. Oh yeah. Scoop John B. Mike Wens. Nicholas

467
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:45,260
 Newman his lovely wife. So many scoops came out. I was giving out the chips Paul. You'd

468
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:48,780
 be proud of me. I was given. I am. I'm very proud of you for giving out chips. And the

469
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:53,020
 Christ Angel has a question stickers that Harry the grill edition made for me. Thank

470
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:57,820
 you. And of course we huddled around because as you know everyone's entitled to free high

471
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:08,940
 fives and to watch the video on my phone of the sex doll eyes explosion. Hilarious. I

472
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:20,800
 mean it delivers. That's all I'm going to say. It's pretty intense. I've got to pull

473
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:26,640
 that up and save it on my phone just for when people ask. I haven't saved them for that

474
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:32,540
 reason. Actually send it to me. Send me the text of it. I'll save it. I'll send you all

475
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:36,420
 three videos because you have to watch the first two before. Oh right. You got to see

476
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:42,580
 that. Yes. The awkward set up for the buildup. Yeah. Yeah. I have it all on a messenger somewhere

477
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:52,660
 but I don't have it on my phone. Hilarious. I was a little jock. I'm going to do when

478
00:55:52,660 --> 00:56:02,580
 I find the button versus nerd action. Oh am I. Yeah. I'm on the hunt for balls.

479
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:18,300
 Oh. We got an obelisk jock versus nerd today from hey scoop get off my lawn. This starts

480
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:23,740
 at $200. It goes all the way up to $5,000. We have double downs. We have super steals

481
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:26,180
 where you steal the other people's points. You have regular steals where you just steal

482
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:32,260
 the control of the game. And we have 50 50s. That's the other one. Yeah. We have 50 50s

483
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:38,220
 just like the old millionaire game. And yeah. Let's see. The question is the $200 question

484
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:43,740
 is states and it's going to me first. Nobody's doing anything yet. Let's see what this question

485
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:53,980
 is. Which state was founded first? New Jersey, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nevada. Nevada is out.

486
00:56:53,980 --> 00:57:00,300
 We know it's not Nevada. Yeah. It was one of the last. Yeah. I mean, it's got to be

487
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:09,780
 Jersey, right? I'll say Jersey. Yeah. Jersey. One of the original 13. Yeah. Oh, it's still

488
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:16,920
 me. Right. Sports. If somebody's gonna steal, yell at me. No. Proceed. The Pelicans, the

489
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:25,100
 minor league baseball team has origins dating back to 1887. What state are they in? Kentucky,

490
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:32,300
 New Jersey, Nevada, and Louisiana. I mean, I think the answer to this is Louisiana. Yeah.

491
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:36,980
 I'm just gonna say Louisiana is the answer to this question. It's Louisiana. Louisiana

492
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:44,380
 Pelicans. There is a minor league baseball team. I think it's South Carolina. That's

493
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:52,420
 the, that's the Pelicans as well. Uh, let's see capitals, capitals. Paul, you love capitals.

494
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:59,380
 You ought to steal this question. No, I really don't. You go ahead and crash. Largest capital

495
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:07,100
 city by area. Spell this capital. Nevada, Louisiana, New Jersey or Kentucky. Largest

496
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:13,700
 capital city by area. Ooh, that's a good question. All right. Nevada is Carson city. It ain't

497
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:23,340
 that big. You know what? I mean, Baton Rouge is pretty big. I would bet Kentucky. What's

498
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:29,420
 the capital of Kentucky? Is it Louisville? Jefferson. Jefferson. Jefferson. I mean, Baton

499
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:36,460
 Rouge is pretty big. Baton Rouge. Baton Rouge. I don't think it's Jersey. I don't think it's

500
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:41,340
 isn't Jersey City. Trenton. Trenton is the capital. Oh, well, in that case, I really,

501
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:44,900
 I think it's even less Jersey now. Trenton. I'm going to say Louisiana. I think it's Baton

502
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:52,500
 Rouge. Trenton is French for the red stick. Interesting. Holy shit. It's Nevada. Carson

503
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:57,020
 city. Carson. Oh yeah. It's sorry, Nick. I meant Frankfurt, not Jefferson. I'm confused.

504
00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:03,700
 Jefferson. Jefferson County. I don't fucking know. This is like God, we're on a, uh, uh,

505
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:08,460
 like everyone, uh, uh, Zoom Twitch and zoom and yeah, which is zoom because otherwise

506
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:13,260
 we'd have to just be corrected over emails. Preserve it for life. It's fine. I I'm fine

507
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:21,700
 to be a question for the $800 question comics. Paul, the, uh, it switches over to you, Paul

508
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:28,260
 for comics. Okay, great. Oh, it's always naturally switches turns when I, I missed it. Oh right.

509
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:31,900
 Now I got it wrong. So I lost control. That's how games work. I understand moving. That's

510
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:39,220
 right. That's right. What state has the most comic book stores? 103 is the estimate, Kentucky,

511
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:49,460
 New Jersey, Louisiana, or Nevada. Ooh. Which state has the most comic book stores? Kentucky,

512
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:58,800
 Louisiana, New Jersey, Nevada. I'll go Kentucky. Let's try it. I'm sorry. It's New Jersey.

513
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:06,740
 It was between New Jersey. That's pretty great. Oh, and the switches over to Matt just in

514
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:14,980
 time for magic. The thousand dollar question. Yes. How is Penn and Teller's bullet catch

515
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:25,140
 trick performed? Ah, is it a mirrors AI search? Which state has the most magic shops? Nevada,

516
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:31,120
 Louisiana, Kentucky, or New Jersey. Well, now what do you consider magic? Uh, are we

517
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:36,740
 talking like stage magic or are we talking like who do voodoo dolls and shit? Louisiana

518
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:41,260
 got it all beat. Oh, Oh, I thought you were going to talk about the other card shops,

519
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:47,260
 the magic cards. Oh no, no, no, no. Those are specialty though. And it's rare to have

520
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:55,260
 just a card shop. Those are always like multiple games shops most of the time. What? I know

521
01:00:55,260 --> 01:01:00,500
 the one in Kentucky just closed. So Kentucky is right out. It's gotta be. Well, I don't

522
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:06,700
 know when he wrote this obelisk, Matt. That's true. That's true. It is a few weeks old.

523
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:10,740
 I'm missing Lexington. There was a magic shop was only open for an hour a week. It was also

524
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:16,980
 a clock repair shop and I went for an hour a week. He would just be, yeah. Yeah. And

525
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:21,460
 the line was out the door with people holding the clocks because there was like one that

526
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:26,020
 was a much bigger need than selling magic stuff. I still, I bought a chop cup and a

527
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:29,980
 couple of other little magic things from there. That's cool. That's cool. But he died. So

528
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:40,540
 it's gone. Oh, Oh no. Lazy ran out of time. Did he go with Jersey again? Let's try it.

529
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:49,540
 Oh, Nevada. Oh, Nevada. Makes sense. It's cause there's a bunch of them in the strip.

530
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:55,500
 Is this one of those that like Penn and Teller's a merch booth counts as a shop on AI or something?

531
01:01:55,500 --> 01:02:02,640
 No, but I can, I can name three here in town and that's, that's a lot. Three is more than

532
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:09,380
 most towns have. Yeah. Most towns don't have magic time for audio video. $1,200 question.

533
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:17,980
 Are they stealing? Nope. According to AI search, which state has the most audio video stores?

534
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:25,860
 Oh, like best buys and shit. Nevada, Kentucky, New Jersey, Louisiana. All right. I'm taking

535
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:31,380
 Louisiana out. People in Louisiana don't have money. It ain't about money. It's about, did

536
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:37,700
 you get that base in your car? Did you want the jams? Yeah, man. I understand what you're

537
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:44,740
 saying. They ain't got no money. I bet it's Jersey. I bet it's Jersey too. I'm going Jersey.

538
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:52,100
 It's Jersey. Yeah, they got their electronics in Jersey. We're known for our malls and the

539
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:56,420
 amount of malls we have. And so there's gotta be an electronic store in every mall. Yeah,

540
01:02:56,420 --> 01:03:04,260
 of course. Oh, let's see. I've got gambling. So $1,400 question gambling. Which state has

541
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:11,300
 the second highest revenue from gambling? Louisiana, Nevada, Kentucky, New Jersey. Jersey

542
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:16,220
 again. I don't know. Louisiana's got all the casinos. Oh, Louisiana's got a bunch of river

543
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:21,580
 boat casinos too. Yeah. She's got Atlantic city. Yeah, they've got Atlantic city. Oh,

544
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:26,980
 yeah. I mean, they've got casinos in New Orleans and there are a bunch of river boat ones. Yeah.

545
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:31,900
 I like this play, Jacob. I like where you're going. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it is like, there's

546
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:36,580
 more in Louisiana than you think. Yeah. That's what I think. I feel like is out. Well, Nicholas,

547
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:41,580
 we have to go to Indiana. How much money is just better than the Kentucky Derby alone?

548
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:49,580
 Oh, sure. Yeah. God damn it. Horse racing. Yeah. I mean, that's gotta be the Kentucky

549
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:54,940
 Derby in the super bowl. I think are still the two biggest gambling events, like single

550
01:03:54,940 --> 01:04:04,700
 single day gambling events. Even the chat split on this all over. This is a crazy one.

551
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:11,780
 This is a head scratcher. I'll try. I'm going to, I'm going to Atlantic city. I'm going

552
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:23,380
 Jersey. It is Jersey. Jersey pride. Eat it. $1,600 question. It stays in my wheelhouse

553
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:31,860
 drugs. I will steal. Oh, I think Paul said it first. Paul stealing. I'm stealing drugs.

554
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:38,500
 He has the most drug related death. New Jersey, Nevada, Louisiana, or Kentucky. I'll go with

555
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:47,860
 Kentucky. Let's try it. It's Kentucky. Yeah. I honestly feel like all three of us would

556
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:51,580
 have gotten that right. No, you know what's crazy? Like honestly, the last time I was

557
01:04:51,580 --> 01:05:00,020
 back in Kentucky, this was probably 10 years ago. Plus now, uh, driving in my hometown

558
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:09,900
 of Richmond, the areas that were just normal, everyday little side streets were absolutely

559
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:17,620
 ramshackle crack house. Yeah. Death row looking just awful. It's awful. I think meth has just

560
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:24,020
 ripped through that state. It's, it's meth. It's a lack of money. It's lack of good jobs.

561
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:29,580
 It's lack of people, uh, feeling like they have, uh, somewhere to go. And like a, a finish

562
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:36,020
 line and life to try to get to it's awful. I hate all of it. Yeah. Uh, speaking of really

563
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:45,980
 good things, alcohol would have helped those promises. Less immigrants. God damn. Oh boy.

564
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:50,860
 It's so crazy. Uh, Matt, you stealing the alcohol questions? Yeah, I'm stealing it.

565
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:55,340
 You want you stealing or you super stealing it. I'm going to steal just because of this.

566
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:57,740
 I got to stay right. Cause you're going to super still for me and I have to be able to

567
01:05:57,740 --> 01:06:04,140
 super steel back. Which state has the most alcohol related crimes slash deaths, Kentucky,

568
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:08,420
 Louisiana, Nevada, New Jersey. Oh, this is a tough one because obviously that's gotta

569
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:13,900
 be Louisiana, right? Or maybe Nevada. New Jersey is a huge population, but Nevada man,

570
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:18,860
 people get drunk and run people over here. That's just, yeah, we were, it's our, it's

571
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:24,540
 our state task. We just had an article touting that we were actually did not hit 400 vehicular

572
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:31,260
 deaths in Las Vegas this year. I saw that the first time since 2021. We finally celebrate

573
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:40,220
 our first time. No one was on the road first time since horse and buggies. Yeah. But Jersey's

574
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:47,900
 so huge. Yeah. Jersey's big. And Louisiana, I mean, yeah, I mean, that's not, that's not,

575
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:53,580
 it's not a sober state. Nope. Nope. I call it related crimes, but it's not per capita.

576
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:59,500
 All right. I'm going to go. He's got a lot of bourbon. I'm going to go with, uh, uh,

577
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:09,580
 Richard and Chad sub 400 sub 400. I'm going to go with Jersey just because of the population.

578
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:19,500
 Jersey. It's Louisiana. Oh, good job, Louisiana. Whoa. All right, guys. Getting with it.

579
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:26,780
 Paul is getting happiness. No, he's not. I'm stealing. If it was, I would have guessed

580
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:35,580
 Louisiana the second of this state is ranked fourth in the U S uh, in happiness in recent studies

581
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:45,020
 fourth, the fourth happiest. So fourth happiest overall, I guess, probably Nevada. Cause there's

582
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:52,700
 nobody living there comparatively. Yeah. Like Nevada's population is pretty low. Right. Oh,

583
01:07:52,700 --> 01:08:00,940
 we are a lot of self-esteem down here in Nevada. We do. Uh, I feel like Louisiana is not happy.

584
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:07,500
 I feel like it's filled with not happy people, especially right now. They're all snowed in and

585
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:16,140
 iced in, uh, shout out to my mom's neighbors who, uh, took my mom and my, and my sister-in-law and

586
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:22,780
 my niece when all their power was out generators. They have a generator. So my, my family stayed

587
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:28,300
 with them. That's very, that's very sweet and neighborly. Certainly. Certainly. Uh, I would

588
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:33,820
 expect nothing less from these neighbors. They're, they're wonderful people. Uh, it's got, okay. I'll

589
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:40,860
 say, I don't know, Nevada. I'm not happy with this question at all. Oh, wait, no, I want to 50 50.

590
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:49,740
 I'm 50 50. Oh, that got rid of Nevada. I got rid of Nevada and Kentucky, Louisiana or New Jersey.

591
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:56,220
 It's gotta be in New Jersey. Then I'll go see New Jersey. Oh yeah. Living in the shadow of New

592
01:08:56,220 --> 01:09:08,300
 York and Philly. Just so unhappy. Supersteel. Paul is super stealing category birth over 80% of people

593
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:16,540
 born in this state. Never leave it for residency. New Jersey, Louisiana, Nevada, Kentucky. Wow. 50

594
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:23,740
 50 me there, Dick. All right. My name is Jacob. That got rid of New Jersey and Nevada. I was

595
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:31,820
 going to say, I'm going to go with Kentucky. These, these were the two that I would have

596
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:39,820
 questioned is Louisiana and Kentucky. Got to be. It is Kentucky. I wouldn't be surprised by Louisiana

597
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:51,580
 super stealing game. I didn't think this through money is the category. The estimated net worth

598
01:09:51,580 --> 01:10:04,780
 of all residents in this state is $7.79 trillion. The estimated net worth of all residents in this

599
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:14,060
 state is $7.79 trillion. Kentucky, Louisiana, Nevada, New Jersey. Ah, 50 50 me there, Dick.

600
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:21,980
 That got rid of Louisiana and Nevada. Yeah. Uh, which I feel like we're the two easy ones to get

601
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:29,820
 rid of. I felt the same way. The word residents and that got rid of Nevada and Louisiana as I've

602
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:35,660
 discussed in this show ain't got no money. So once again, I mean, Kentucky, Louisiana needs to have

603
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:40,780
 a fucking Patriot ongoing state of Louisiana. I'll tell you that just, just the horse farms alone

604
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:45,980
 in Kentucky might be worth trillions of dollars. Yeah. Uh, you know, New Jersey, like I said, it's,

605
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:50,780
 it's, it's a community. You got that old money. You drove me past all those mansions. They have

606
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:55,420
 rows of mansions. Yeah. And it's, and it's, it's right near New York and it's right near Philly.

607
01:10:55,420 --> 01:11:01,020
 Yeah. They got that money and I got that money. Giving it up, giving it up for a new Jersey,

608
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:09,420
 Jersey. All right, let's see it. It's Jersey. Oh my God. He got it all. He got it all. And that is

609
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:21,900
 the game. Oh yeah. Atlantic city. Paul and I are tied with zero points a piece and Matt eat out

610
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:28,540
 the wind with, with 16,800 points. Springsteen and Bon Jovi live there. You know what I mean?

611
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:37,340
 Like it's gotta be way up there. There's some, there's some money there. Uh, thank you. Who,
