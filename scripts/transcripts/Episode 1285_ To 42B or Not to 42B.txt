 that the jokers of magic we're making fun of this microphone on my face for
 the life part because you look like Britney Spears yeah I didn't stop the
 microphone man you just look like Britney Spears
 it's time for Matt and Mattingly's ice cream social sitting over there in Las Vegas it's Matt Donnelly sitting over at
 Pittsburgh BA it's Paul Mattingly also in Vegas it's me Jacob the audio guy
 I love the microphone on your face Matt I think it's dapper backstreets back
 alright yeah it is it's kind of cool I mean it did it improved our the audio
 quality of our show dramatically when I was traveling so yes there you go I'll
 take I'll take the jokes can't fight that oh yeah yeah no I I want to be very
 clear I'm very willing to in exchange for improving the quality of this show I
 am willing for you to be made fun of by your peers I said fine with that trade
 off I packed it with my regular microphone road runs road rig microphones
 you know handheld microphones for right Africa Babel and I said I packed this
 one because that way I thought if I could drive and do that we could do the
 podcast while actually driving and like Mike Mills our producer/host said what a
 terrible idea well once we ended up driving through not one but two
 blizzards well that would have been distracting so trying to podcast would
 have been really really difficult we honestly I'm sad that we don't have just
 recordings of you guys trying to podcast through a blizzard yeah we we hit a
 second blizzard and we were all upset because the first blizzard was very much
 talked about in the news as is coming towards us and then we hit a second
 blizzard in India and I was like what no we had no idea we had no idea we're
 gonna hit a blizzard and then we we hit this gas station at like like midnight
 trying to fuel up and get some food and we're just surrounded by snow coming
 down it was I guess the tip of the lake they kept saying so like the flakes are
 really big chunky flakes tip of the lake I was like I'm not not to borrow from my
 clown name but chunky flakes a lot of chunky flakes coming down and then the
 clown the guy in the gas he was like oh my god no we're getting at least ten
 inches and I just heard from Valparaiso they're getting you know 15 inches and
 the other reports I mean everywhere I go it's like he was like don't go anywhere
 and one oh we were at a gas station in the middle of some town that they have
 hotels so terrible advice we were a gas station intended to give anyone we were
 going somewhere yes and then we were like kind of starting to panic about
 like what do we do and looking at the nearest hotels and then I remembered hey
 guys the all the information we just got was from a cashier at midnight in a gas
 station so like all of the reports are coming from you know one point even the
 cashier he's working with she was like can you chill out and he's like I'm just
 telling them
 great and then she was like that guy's a soft guy over there you can ask him and
 I was like well this is the kind of town we're in where we're actually at the
 coffee shop you know the coffee stop where the guy who's salt in the roads is
 there yeah I said oh you know the salt guys because he's my dad and I was like
 we are in a tiny tiny town oh boy but you made it out we made it out we lost
 an hour driving from Milwaukee to Wabash Indiana and then we got in end up
 getting in with the snow at like five o'clock in the morning with a 9 a.m.
 lobby call so it's pretty great it's pretty great so we had two shows Wabash
 and then they put the man a two o'clock instead of four but we did two shows in
 Wabash we were a little delirious but they were super fun great crowds came
 out and including the else Roth's yeah and Michael else Roth always being a
 gentleman brought me a dr. pepper cream zero for me to delicious he knows is my
 favorite he goes brings him to scoop fest he knows he knows his stuff but I
 got to sneak out and have a little bite to eat with with the else Roth the hard
 part is always finding a hooker that's named dr. pepper cream zero I think he
 just tells how Matt happens to be in I think he just pays extra for whoever to
 just say it I don't think he can to do the legal name change does anyone who's
 in the commitment it's Michael else wrong that is true that is true so are
 you still in snowed in areas now or you're back no I'm back go back in Vegas
 yeah yeah yeah but you've been driving through crazy snowpack everywhere well
 yeah and the good the good news for me I seem like I was making the big
 sacrifice everyone else was flying out of Fort Wayne I drove the Sprinter van
 back to Cincinnati to drop off where we rented it from and flew out of
 Cincinnati and everyone's flights were messed up and delayed out of Fort Wayne
 and everything everything in Cincinnati is going off without a hitch so I was
 like if you look yeah would you drive three hours just to make sure your
 flights were totally normal you would say yes fine yeah yeah yeah there's some
 driving who decides to introduce letters to exit numbers you know this has been
 at the top of my list to talk about four years I'm glad we're finally getting to
 as a secondary component of the exit right so you go 42 B right so you go by
 exit 41 then 42 a 42 B 42 C and you're there come driving out here in fucking
 Pittsburgh you will it is everything is just blabbered a blabbered a blaze oh
 Pittsburgh is no I mean like it has so confused riding with the uber drivers in
 Pittsburgh it's the worst I just had I had to stop paying attention but it has
 to be a meeting right and that means some of the meeting goes whoa whoa whoa
 those exits are too close together to have their own numbers well I guess
 that's it I guess that's it numbers are mile markers yeah essentially mm-hmm I
 mean on the right on the interstates growing up you'd have the mile markers
 and then you would have an exit and the exit would serve as a mile they're
 supposed to correspond pretty closely yes right all right I guess the letters are
 just between the mile markers but yeah it seems like they've they've raged out
 of control Jacob Jacob just said something that makes a lot of sense and
 I feel dumb for bringing it up but no I think that's how it's supposed to be I
 don't think that's how it is out here well it's definitely because they're
 just too close exits like we have like on the freeway here we have you know the
 flamingo eggs and the tropical eggs that are not a mile apart from each other
 right the designs of all of it are just so it's just so bad I drove I had to
 drive in for class last night and just two or three times I was like god damn
 it where did you learn the driving in Pittsburgh just isn't designed at all no
 it's not and it's it's it's terrible roads stacked on each other over the
 years and I just you know we keep discovering everything in our society is
 built as a massive Psyop to confuse and upset us and control our brains and I
 feel like the driving shit is a big component of that too like they make
 these things now we're talking Jacob's making sense Paul saying it's because of
 a Psyop we're back in business I'm telling you it's all just like I mean of
 course the interstates were built for interstate trucking primarily but now we
 always have to use them to just get to our third and fourth jobs I don't know
 it just seems fucking insane to me how much we have with the interstates
 initially built primarily for trucking yes yes oh I didn't know that yeah
 Eisenhower was the president who did a lot of interstate stuff right yeah yeah
 yeah I like when you could point at a president and just casually list the
 thing that they did here's just something that happened under this
 administration that was just I don't know I guess a net positive I guess I
 don't know sure at the very least it's something that got accomplished also the
 crazy fucking thing with my commute now I've got into where I'm really leaving
 very early because I know how insane the commute can be but it's
 approximately I think as the crow flies as you'd say about 12 miles from my
 house good shape and I couldn't fly 12 miles if you paid and it takes me no
 less than 45 minutes yeah ever that's the that's the quickest ever that's just
 the amount of time that that trip takes because you got and I and I'm so I got
 so spoiled in Vegas too because it's all on a grid out here it's yeah be a horsey
 trail this guy owns a part of this this is where you cannot be this is a
 demilitarized zone it's just fucking bananas the loopy doop floop driving shit
 on the horse 150 years ago does that how you were gonna get to work today yeah
 oh well there's the easiest way for the nag to get through without breaking its
 leg my wife I keep asking you not to call her that that'll work that'll work
 for a Porsche in about a hundred years that's perfect no problem yeah I'll be
 perfect for a German engineered piece of machinery horse rhymes with horse I'm
 sure it'll be fine anyway uh yeah so I've been busy with improv this week I
 had a free class on Saturday that I co-taught with my friend Sarah we had a
 couple of ladies come out we're gonna be working with them on a project too which
 is cool they got to see it big shout out to Malia for coming out to the class too
 and it was awesome to have her there and a couple other scoops Alex and Anna
 showed up which is awesome just great to see scoops coming through at my little
 events I don't know the algorithm is not promoting the stuff I'm promoting I
 thank every scoop for retweeting and putting out as much info on that class
 we could we still had nine people I promoted the shit I mean I got promoted
 I didn't pay for anything you're having a crazy winter aren't you that's part of
 it too yeah yes yeah ultimately it was we had nine people show up in two degree
 weather so that's pretty good right possible that everybody knew about it
 it's also possible that the algorithm just did its job and everybody in
 Pittsburgh knew about that class and just nine people were in it's possible
 it's quite possible it's cold as fuck it's cold as fuck out here and just
 insane and every time and like and then I was going to teach my new level one
 which had to get postponed I was teaching they're doing that yesterday so
 last night again I'm heading out early my class starts at 630 I'm in the car
 around 5 I open up the garage door and it's fucking snowing again it just
 doesn't stop but we've got a solid you know almost ten to twelve-inch he's got
 a solid twelve inches it's just not moving it's not going anywhere it's just
 there I've already had to dig out my mailbox I had to dig out a place for my
 fucking take out your mailbox I had to dig out the mailbox because the mail
 people were like please dig a path so we can get to your mailbox so I had to dig
 dig a big old path to get him yeah that big high of seven on Saturday scooping
 over girl yeah it's cold as fuck out here and then I dug a place to put my
 trash can so that it wouldn't be out on the street exactly you know and the
 plowing is is crazy so it's where I'm digging out is like 14 inches no I mean
 my buddy my oldest friends Pat said picture him and his kids standing on the
 Navis Inc River in Red Bank New Jersey oh that river never froze over the
 entire time that I lived in like my entire lifetime I've never heard of that
 river being frozen it was it was nuts this is when Matt goes into his no such
 thing as global warming because the river froze spiel now that's right
 exactly it the people just don't understand like it's guys it goes both
 ways it's real cold we've been asked to have an emergency Vegas parking and
 weather from Ryan is it me or is there a recent increase in people who insist on
 backing into parking spaces why is this what does it mean for our society as a
 whole I need an emergency Vegas parking and weather this is a great point I have
 noticed this too and I asked but I just like Jacob had a very logical answer for
 my exit thing there is a logical answer as to why there's an increase in this
 happening great because I've noticed this too I want to know the same thing
 quality of reverse cameras you're right yeah all these cars put much better ways
 where they show you the lane that you're turning in and everybody would rather
 park pulling out of their spot that way then backing up it's annoying ready rich
 has the best take on this is that you shouldn't be mad that people do it you
 should be mad that people are bad at it that's right because that's it it's like
 what happens is that it takes so much longer if you're waiting to park and
 you're behind someone and they have to do this giant production to get the car
 back into just pulling in a goddamn space I I'd like to I'm a backer inner
 I've been a backer inner for for decades unapologetically especially with the with
 the truck you know if I'm driving a pickup truck it's just so much easier to
 back in and then pull out nose first I am but yeah when people are bad at it
 it's terrible and if there are a line of cars behind me in the parking lot then I
 do the gentlemanly thing and I go nose in just just to do it a little faster so
 I don't have to pull forward and then back in yeah I'm a consummate pull
 through guy so I go all the way to the other side that's backing in but I'm
 going through and then then I'm ready to go that's only dangerous for like two
 split seconds yeah what do you mean dangerous if someone else is someone
 else wants to pull into the regular spot that you're pulling forward you don't
 understand how I do my pull throughs I park in BFE there is not another car
 around me my friend this is the thing that drives seriously and goes fucking
 crazy over my parking she's like you always zig when I think you're gonna
 sag manically I go I go so far away she's like the other night it was it was
 balls cold again the wind was blowing we had to go to Lowe's this was right
 before the fucking crazy storm hit and we went to go find a terracotta pot just
 in case we needed an emergency heater type thing we could pack because we had
 plenty of candles and we just needed a terracotta pot to use as an emergency
 heater if we absolutely lost power and everything went to shit hey man it works
 it fucking works so we went to go pot it was freezing cold backstage at Madison
 Wisconsin and and Mike noticed that the dressing rooms had old light bulbs not
 LEDs but old style light bulbs there's a yeah close the doors leave the lights on
 and we went and did a sound check and we came back took the toastiest dressing
 rooms we basically easy we easy baked ovened our dressing rooms and they are
 they are hot yeah this is how you fucking do it and yeah so these are the
 hacks but yeah I parked over by the garden section and pretty close to the
 front but there was nobody else there and we had to walk all the way and she's
 like what the fuck you doing Mattingly you're killing me this is crazy she's
 like just shivering and shaking the whole way and I'm cold too it's cold as fuck but
 then we got the thing and we're heading out the door and I'm like can we go back
 over to the door we came in on she's like no we have to go out this exit which
 is even farther away from where you fucking parked and I'm I didn't know I
 thought we could go out the front again she's like no we can't why did you do
 this this is insane that's really she she does not like my parking but I don't
 sound like this she does but my parking could not be could not be safer in so
 much as there's no one there no I don't like people combat park when it when the
 spaces are diagonal you don't back into spots when they're dying what that's
 right even no you don't you do not back into that's that's how they're designed
 and so you don't have to back yet yeah that's of the douches and still do it
 buddies literally doing that right now listen to me douches stop it here you
 hear you douches that's like almost doing a donut to get into that shit that's
 making a you what a load of people do that in the Caesars parking garage all
 the time sure has the angled parking spots but they will get into the the
 wrong lane you know they'll be they'll be going up the down lane and now they
 have to back into the spot just because they they can't get into it that's a
 double douche it's not to two negative don't make a positive that's a double
 douche that stays double douche it's two squared it doesn't make a positive I
 don't know when I see them doing it I give them the stink eye they know what
 they did they know what they did we've got snow lined up on the streets

 and snap the pic of it to to send out to the scoops yeah yeah they're the the
 cross pieces on it they're starting to test the the lights oh cool Wow so it's
 still I think like a year out from being open but they're starting to test like
 individual those these giant LED lights that cross the entire tower they're
 started to test those out and yeah it's pretty fucking cool it's it seems like
 it's curving back up so like the shape of the guitar is kind of completing if
 you want to see something that kind of looks like it if you're curious about it
 though there's one in Miami that is similar to the one the one that they're
 building here but the one they're building here is just right on the Las
 Vegas strip and I mean right on it like yeah all the other casinos are set back
 from the road this tower is like next to the sidewalk that's crazy that that's
 wild and it's gonna yeah it's gonna stick out like a sore thumb but that's
 it's the landscape of it dramatic yeah the strip is definitely gonna be but

 congratulations Starfleet SJ had some weird travel this week oh yeah she's
 been it she's been in Canada for the last I don't know week and a half or so
 doing shows with the the Spice wannabe show back up and cooking huh a lot of
 road gigs SJ just stay there you're better off well that's just hang out
 that's just it that's just it Matt on Monday she had a gig back here in Las
 Vegas oh and so she flew down did her gig here was in town for about 15 hours
 yeah and then 430 this morning back at back to the airport back to Canada to do
 a show tonight holy shit and she's back in Canada until I think Saturday how's
 she doing this it's insane oh air travel Paul those things those things that pass
 over you would the sky no boy I'm talking about the physical toll my god
 that's got she's hurting she is hurting uh yeah we did that show together with
 Saris Arash she was talking about this travel uh schedule and I said you know
 these are the kind of things like in our 20s like we've been loved we did it in
 our 20s I got to do this gig here and they got a fly yeah you can fly right
 back here and finish out this gig yeah and when you're older you're like now
 that SJ is in her late 20s she hates it it is different in your late 20s it's
 true yeah it's very different in your late 20s it's because Saris Ross I guess
 I don't know do you trigger warn for the only curse would we really have in the
 English language the only one that's left yeah she has go for it she's a song
 cunt trigger warning she called serving cunt and if you look closely you can see
 me dancing as an Elvis impersonator on Fremont Street with her there it is it's
 very fun is directed by my wife my very talented wife who may or may not be in
 the room with me right now and she did she did an amazing job that was super
 fun and gave me my backup plan for if anything goes south as I got stopped
 multiple times for pictures just walk to my car dressed like Elvis on Fremont
 Street I now know what's gonna happen you know when when my me too scandal hits
 so right we'll be right there you got a solid thirty dollars a day coming to you
 there remember remember when people listen to the will of people wasn't that
 fun back in the day I don't know anymore I don't even know if ever the will the
 people ever listen to I don't know what the fuck's going on at the time it
 didn't seem like it was but now it seems like it really was oh god damn shit is
 fucking crazy right now it's crazy oh somebody wrote us the other day on pod
 therapy actually as this comes out of that show might not even be released yet
 so I might be crossing timelines here but they were saying because you know we
 commented on pod therapy when the most recent presidential election happened and
 just said you know basically let's all let's all stay calm and react to things
 as they happen and you know a lot of things have happened since then and
 continued to and so they wrote in and they said you know hey you guys you know
 you said react things as they're happening and now a lot of things are
 happening and now what and we were like yeah you whatever you want ever you
 think about that that's that's what we think too we agree that's yep I am that's
 that's just it I have a lot of friends in Minneapolis from the improv community
 back in the day many apps sure I'm so grateful that we got to go out there
 that you brought me along for that festival just recently because I got to
 get a taste of that place and the people who were working a huge at the time got
 to take me on a quick little tour we went around they showed me the George
 Floyd Floyd Memorial and everything so I was in that whole zone right like it was
 chill no Minneapolis is a great city and there's a lot of pride in it and so like
 what I'm seeing in my timeline is like I am actually like really proud of my
 Minneapolis friends I feel like I feel like I feel like oh yeah I feel like
 they chose the wrong city to mess with in a lot of ways yeah it really seems
 like that I proud is a good word it's they're doing a really good job I feel
 bad this is just arbitrarily heaped on them because someone was mad they didn't
 win the state in an election oh no I'm not mad about that at all I have I am
 thoroughly not bothered by the arbitrariness to heaping on Minneapolis
 the shit that just that seems fine blows my mind the stuff that just making me so
 I don't know not hopeless but I'm very curious as to where we go from here in a
 lot of ways because it seems to me that no one is exempt from this shit no
 matter what side of the aisle it's getting you know where we're going from
 this we're going we're going to full-on anarchy colonies Mad Max style I think
 you might be right Jacob because here we go it's just gonna be city-states it's
 gonna be old-school city-states there's no one each other Athens and Sparta
 there is no no for me there is no one at the federal level I would trust in any
 respect so how do you take directions like there's no one to give us a voice
 there's no one to unify and say hey maybe this is our next move or maybe we
 should try and improve this next you know there's no there's no steps that
 are being lined out there's no actionable plan to be taken as I simply
 do not trust anyone and I mean nominate you Paul Paul you should take us to take
 us to the promised land no no ah all right no Jacob will you I'm just gonna
 go around the horn here no I don't I don't know that I don't I'll go to the
 rest of the zoom technical school port will you take us to the promise it's not
 supposed to be any one person it's not supposed to be any one person that's why
 we have a group of government oh you know you're right Paul you're right Matt
 I think we're doing wrong zoom chat zoom chat this group of people will you take
 us to the promised you know one person it's a group of people I would love to
 have scoop community lead us into whatever's next for a fee for a fee
 there's a patreon level for that chaotic clumsy who the fuck knows what's going
 on anyway I'm just SJ just texted me she is at the hotel in Canada oh good she
 made it back they didn't she made it back her passport well we were a little
 leaving Canada because she's there on like a work visa thing you know it's all
 legit and everything and she was like leaving and then coming back in less
 than a day later during the during my work visa that was the only thing that
 she was a little itchy about going back yet of course but I like it all she has
 the paperwork for everything and it was all just legit Paul it is nice that is
 the nice thing about doing this in your late 20s versus your early 20s is you're
 you're prepared and you're just doing it all legit this time we did it in our
 early 20s we were just doing like tourist visas be like what we're not
 working while we're here I still remember bring a suitcase of mr.
 Piffles customs of being like it's just for friends gonna show it off to some
 pals right if we had our merch confiscated multiple times by Canadian
 officials sell t-shirts and mr. Piffles dolls what what do you do they hold it
 for you to come back is that how that yeah yeah pick it back up on your way
 out yeah that's not so bad if they sell it at the duty-free shops I was gonna
 say I doubt they just doubt they just hold on to it for you now anymore yeah I
 don't think anybody's doing us any favors at the borders these days I think
 our goodwill ship has sailed back through and everybody's wearing the dog
 who knows shirt yeah Paul just say I was I did Penn Sunday school yesterday and
 again yes this will probably come out before that so we're jumping on podcasts
 in multiple directions here okay but Penn always brings up it's a quote
 attributed Gandhi but people are suspicious whether it is but that it is
 first they ignore you then they laugh at you then they fight you and then you win
 and the the quote is about fight you stage yes yeah I mean there is reason to
 be hopeful Donald talks about all time protests always work protests always
 work yeah and I know I brought up on presented school the counter example you
 know that I don't like is there was anti-abortion protests my whole life and
 I thought there's no way they're gonna take away freedom of choice from from
 women that's that's a right it's it's it's really bigoted towards one gender
 that's the way laws supposed to work but it did it worked so January's you're
 absolutely right j6 definitely kind of worked it worked so you know we were at
 that we were at the fight and jail phase of of the protest movement so yeah I'm
 just my hope is that we can survive the fighting the fighting stage yeah I agree
 with you I think the I think the the the old way is is dying and this and these
 are the death throes yes there is some of that too I just hope we can we can
 survive it I hope we're good at the end of it and a lot of people who are staying
 on the sidelines are no longer staying on this like it is it is it is galvanizing
 what is happening that is true yeah well I've certainly I've certainly seen you
 know plenty within the podosphere coming forth and letting our voices be heard
 and I don't want us to be out of that conversation anyway I want everybody to
 know which side we're on at least what side I'm on for sure and I want
 everybody to know they're not alone out there we see it we feel it we hear it
 it's fucking horrible and I like guess like Matt said we're coming together
 we're getting out there we're getting our voices heard and we're gonna get
 through it somehow I think so we don't have any choice we don't have any choice
 but to get through it I mean I don't think we'll ever do things that are
 better for the environment there's certain things I've think the ship is
 sailed on but I think for protecting our own freedom and stuff I think we're
 gonna we're gonna get better at it hopefully hopefully yeah the river will
 freeze over a few more times and somebody will go hey wait a minute well
 I mean it's all fucking connected right like I truly believe we're gonna have to
 dismantle these goddamn data centers and holding cells we're gonna have to
 dismantle all that we're gonna actually physically have to get in there and
 break apart some structures I'm following there's a new giant data
 center being built in rural Louisiana not too terribly far away from my mom's
 house mm-hmm and so I've been following this and it's it's a you know huge it's
 I I don't even know how many multiple acres yeah yeah acres and acres of
 warehouse being built and it's the new meta like AI Center and it's being built
 in a town of like I don't know a few thousand people and everybody there is
 just like scared and yeah weirdly in the dark about everything that's happening
 cuz it's gonna it's gonna take all their water supply it's gonna fuck that's it
 it's water electricity is gonna be a thing and yeah the fact that they can
 just arbitrarily decide well now electricity cost five times what it used
 to because we need more of it for this I guess so Will Smith can eat spaghetti in
 a more convincing way what the fuck man you know what I was off of it and

 tenth that is doing he's right here doing the dip I want to do a Matt was
 right segment beast games continues to be the craziest fucking bat shit thing on
 television anywhere I'm on episode up to episode 3 with my kids are watching that
 oh my god I see that survivor also can't watch it it scares me to see it okay so
 last year this is a spoiler never mind I'll wait it's crazy though like last
 year we talked we talked about beast games because Matt started what Matt
 started watching beast games with his kids that's right came out yeah because
 Matt Matt's kids like every other child on the planet watches mr. beast on
 YouTube uh-huh and so watch that I watched it because I love really bizarre
 reality TV game shows like the the competition reality TV thing is like a
 weird spot that I like to dig into in these things games is truly like the
 weirdest one it is this year is much more competition based and less
 psychological torture based so far yes that I've been watching so that part I
 like it is still so funny where he sets up things to have like this twist and
 when people don't become absolute assholes it's so clear he's so
 disappointed like he's so upset people I am on episode 4 yeah I'm one episode
 ahead of you yeah and I'm gonna tell you that he has noticed that too and
 changes some of his tactics going forward to get them to do it so the
 niceness might not continue as it is in the earlier episodes it doesn't go it
 does not go to psychological torture though I mean it definitely doesn't do
 that laugh about it the first season there was so much crying yes and so much
 like it was just awful yeah I can't I can't do it it makes me upset to see in
 the clips like I said I'll just get something else come up in a scroll I'm
 like oh this looks awful yeah I know it's tough but it is it is really like
 super we I watched this one this other reality show competition game out of
 Korea because they make some fucking weird ones over there and this is the
 idea of it and the execution of it both are so much bigger and stranger because
 of it because they're doing these things on such a large scale I mean when they
 when they filmed it in Vegas they were in Allegiant Stadium they go out to
 these places out just in the open areas and build these giant scale things and
 it is weird the amount of effort that goes into something that is so stupid
 yeah yeah yeah I say that as a podcaster but we have it on the effort and we're
 we're right we're in check we're in check we got it we got it I don't know I
 keep watching it and I'm like every time I go every time it says TV PG at the
 beginning of it I notice that and I think of your kids and I go like yeah
 cuz kids are cuz kids are watching this and I've been trying to watch it through
 the lens of a young person watching it which is impossible for me to do it is
 it bothers me on it doesn't bother me but it like it it it makes me
 uncomfortable on a different level yes well on a more positive media note new
 show new show note I will shout out mystery science theater and rift tracks
 are combining again or should I say rift tracks is basically re taking up the
 mantle of mystery science theater 3000 and they are going to produce four new
 episodes utilizing Kevin and Mike and oh my god Bill from the OG rift tracks crew
 as you know reprising their roles Tom Sarvone Crowe and him and yeah it's
 gonna be really cool to see them back in the saddle instead of the whole new crew
 which nothing against the new crew for the most part there were one or two
 times that whoever was voicing Crowe on a couple of this last season I was like
 shut up they were just screaming like that is not the fucking voice but yeah
 it's already up to 1.6 million on Kickstarter that's amazing brand new
 thing and they've still got 45 days to go something like that wow but it's a
 wonderful thing to see them back at it and this is the rift tracks fans coming
 through big time for them because I've backed several of their kickstarters to
 a back the mystery science theater crew too but I am far more in the camp of
 what rift tracks has been doing than the last because laughing and more than the
 than the MS the last MSC 3k failed because people were just kind of like
 that like because that last season was just not great and it's because they
 really jacking around with who they had voicing Crowe they had a couple people
 really knew how to do it but then if you're watching a movie and someone's in
 there shut fucking up I can't I love the things that bother you about about
 movies Paul it's I watched that mystery science theater 3,000 season and there
 was a single time that the robots voices even occurred the most recent one the
 most recent season I don't know if you saw this most recent season I didn't see
 the most recent one you'd because you would go oh shit I can't unhear this
 it's awful it's awful it's just a screeching banshee and and it just ruins
 any of it so they had good performers that first reboot they were fine I was
 like this is great you know let's go but now I'm really excited because it's the
 old bots with the old voices it's you know you don't want weird sounding
 Muppets it's the same shit people are all on the Kermit thing too you know
 there's something to it there's really something to it and you know Kermit the
 Frog always said it's not easy being blue hey invent some new robots they
 invented some new robots throw them in there that's fine but also just don't be
 screechy screechy ain't gonna just goddamn screechy ain't funny it's not
 not Dustin Diamond is he's no longer with us yeah he's no longer and so I
 mean just just bringing it up and it's truly in bad taste so everybody who is
 doing screech impressions on mystery science theater 3,000 episodes just
 stop it exactly well they've they've stopped it because they didn't get fun
 in our last one but anyway Mary Jo Peel is gonna be back as Miss Forrester and
 that's gonna be funny Pearl Forrester so that's gonna be funny too they got the
 proper antagonist with them I think it's gonna be quite good I'm looking forward
 to the new four episode mini season thing I went ahead and backed it on the
 Kickstarter and of course got to get my physical media on so I ordered the four
 DVDs and VHS tape yeah the VHS tapes are going up dude the money on those it's
 crazy it's true I don't doubt it they're really expensive now comparatively
 especially like horror I think it's dumb but I don't doubt it I know it's done
 but there is a huge market for it but anyway just want to say shout out to the
 rift tracks guys I listen to them every night pretty much Matt have you dipped a
 toe yet on the old to be did you take in any of the rift tracks films yet to try
 and use them as sort of your lullabies I have not used them as lullabies or check
 them out I should I should really should you really should they had some really
 great stuff in there right now yeah I'm about to do another two-week stint on
 the old Sun Princess so maybe I can crack it then well and I'll just put this out
 there's my number one recommendation for anyone who wants to see if they like
 this kind of shit go on to be look up rift tracks and then watch samurai cop
 the samurai cop episode of riff tracks is one of the funniest things I've seen
 it so many times still laugh my ass off even just thinking about it it is a
 super cheese-o B movie action thing it's crazy I it's great you know if you if
 you grew up like us when that was the thing like you know aping commando and
 all those kind of things but samurai cop god damn it's the movie is so crazy on
 its own so check it out if you get a chance it's also amazing like how many
 movies have they covered they are I think they they're cracking around 500
 maybe more it's amazing like how many like because it's not like there's a
 certain aesthetic because there's a lot of like just bad bad yes yes and it's
 it's it's it's a very fine needle of thread you wouldn't think but it really
 is and there's some of them that are better than others by far basically it
 feels like what their show basically is is it seems like if Penn's old movie
 night had morphed into a podcast I mean yeah that's what you know mystery
 science theater was always that but there there has to be a certain level of
 watchability to the movie that's right it can't just be absolute trash
 unwatchable and again has to have decent audio and all that kind of thing
 because otherwise it just you know you can't sit there for two hours and
 watch it and there's been a couple of of them that are really pushing the line
 because they are digging pretty deep in the catalog but yeah man oh god this
 samurai cop will fucking well I mean we we learned that lesson too with some of
 the episodes of what was the the Michael Landon angel show oh yes I would have a
 highway to heaven I would have it not all gems not all some of those were just
 so bad you can't make fun of them right oh this thing's like I love the movie
 night at Penn's house it was like one of my favorite things and then when I was
 younger and I had a house full of guys that's what we do we would just flip to
 find the worst movies on HBO and make fun of them it was an activity I loved
 it I miss it I was like I'm basically hoping like my kids are now getting funny
 enough that like if I can get them on board I have to figure out a way to like
 get them into the idea of making fun of a movie while we watch it out loud to
 make use of the lap but I feel like I can recreate it with my with my boys
 right now show them some mystery science theater riff tracks has some some
 question like samurai cop would not be suitable for your young ins it's it's
 violent and there's boobies and shit circles and circles you wanted me to show
 them terrifier three I mean I do still want you to show them terrifier three on
 Christmas I would give you I might I would I might actually give you money for
 that it's the first 15 minutes it lose their fucking minds all right tell you
 what if Matt loses jock vs. nerd today he's showing his kids terrifier 3 on Christmas
 the hunt for balls we have a winter Olympics themed scooperty from freehold
 scoop today the categories are curling biathlon luge and bobsled I'm up first
 oh let's see I'll try curling for 400 this is how much the stones that the
 players slide down the ice way in pounds within five this is the first one this
 is the first how much does the Rockwell is the first question but Jacob they're
 called stones and you know in Europe when you say oh I lost 30 stone or more
 oh you know or I lost five stone over the summer vacation because I stopped
 eating gummy bears or whatever so maybe I believe that's 20 pounds you think you
 think one stone is 20 pounds I was about to say I don't know I think that's what
 it is uh fine Paul 20 pounds that's my logic all right let's try it 42 oh the
 answer 42 that's much heavier than that's heavier than 20 that's two
 not within five at all I think it's well I don't know what it's I thought is one
 I was gonna ask you is one stone 20 pounds that's what I thought I say
 somebody weighs how many stones oh it's 14 pounds oh one stone is 14 pounds yes
 sorry Paul you're up okay um biathlon let's go for 14 for 400 biathlon
 combines cross-country skiing and this other sport target shooting target
 shooting I'm sorry it's rifle shooting Paul you're not shooting targets you're
 shooting rifles Matt you're up um curling for 800 curlers use these
 household devices to melt the ice causing the stones to go further and
 curl less rooms brooms and rushes chimney chimchimmy chimchim surey Jeff Loomis not
 in my house it's me I'll try bobsled 400 mmm an Olympic bobsled team consists of
 either two athletes or this many I believe it's four I believe of two or
 four yeah don't they have single-person bobsleds or are they called something
 that's skeleton oh that's right skeletons over you lie down yes feet
 first skeleton what's the one what's the one where you go headfirst is that the
 last skeleton head first and skeleton feet first is luge oh maybe that's the
 first question on luge Paul you're up I will take biathlon for 8 by athlete
 shoot it targets from two positions standing and this lower position fucking
 that's why they're biathletes they have to show that they're biathletes yeah
 fucking a lady and the other is fucking a dude
 band kick kneeling one leg up kneeling prone prone like the like the oh so we
 were talking about sexual positions like the shrimp dog go prone trim is prone
 kneeling okay elbows but up elbows out I'll show you gotcha I'll teach you some
 pronin yeah I'll do curling for 1200 all right oh shit oh my god the target
 scoring area of the ring is called this the same thing you might call your
 residents buck house domicile to the tickle house
 this is the house or the I think it's home base like in tag oh I think it's
 just home I think it's just home
 they send it home I think that's what that's from I'll go I'll go with home
 all right the house we were close nobody listens to Jacob I would have been
 closer to the fuck house yeah it's me I'll try but curling well I'll try
 biathlon for 1200 to both in Vegas you should know the house always wins
 athletes must hit targets at this distance in meters during Olympic
 competition within five meters 14 pounds Jacob 14 pounds final answer it's
 English money I feel like it's I want to say it's like 25 but it might be 50 I
 don't I got a pass Paul I'll go 50 all right it is 50 yeah I'm a biathlete sure
 Paul you're up I'll do it for 2000 let's go daily double look at this here we go
 Norway's all inner yours run holds the record for most olympic biathlon medals
 with this many within three or John for every in our board Boria Dean borderland
 borderland for every person offended by Paul's accent earlier think about how
 the norwegians feel okay only in our borderland Bjorn Bjorn Dylan that's it
 so those things only come around so often four years four years I think no
 no Matt every so often can you win multiple medals like swimming yeah in
 biathlon I mean I think I just win for the biathlon that I'll go here right I'll
 go with five okay let's see 13 Jesus fuck me what you were doing the right
 math you just did not get close to what Norway shit early in your version so
 well you just had he had multiple events to place in I didn't realize it was a
 multiple event I mean you're assuming he I'm not assuming anything only I only
 don't know only is a dude's name sure I think all right great double down same
 points is only a man Matt you're up I got a curling for 2000 the main two types of
 shots are curler throws are draws and this other type designed to remove the
 opponent stones dickhead ministration boppers boppers great answer if it's not
 called Bob should be boppers I'm gonna go with knockouts oh good guess good
 guess I'm getting Chinese food later tonight I can't fucking wait I'll go
 bobsled for 800 the athlete who steers the bobsled from the front position is
 called this captain suicide Edward his name is Edward it's something about the
 hell they have like a leash right it's like it's a couple of little strings
 pull things yeah a little pulley string so it's probably something like the
 leashman or the the stringman the leashman I saw those I saw those guys
 they played prim the quartet I saw it with Chuck Connors was still on it
 deletion but he says they saw Chuck Connors in the leachman nobody saw Chuck
 Connors in the leachman ah it's like the the steerer or the wheel man there you
 go wheel man he's the wheel man he's using ropes he's like the rope stir or
 something no they call him the wheel man ironically Paul oh because he drives to
 the event well uses his feet probably - oh I don't know I don't think I don't
 think they use their feet yeah it's on a thing uh yeah I don't I don't know I
 passed Paul okay here we go they use their feet final answer ropesman show me
 ropesman pilot or driver well well well well well aren't we creative mr. Bob
 sled or should I call you Robert sled Paul you're up fuck I'll do luge for
 2000 oh let's do it I gotta get back on Germany has dominated Olympic luge
 winning approximately this fraction of all gold medals in the sports history
 within ten percent 73 percent Jacob that is dominant for sure let's see I'm sorry
 it's 60% you're off by three percent
 oh no now that I've leapt into second place by the way we got five questions
 left quick score check I am currently winning with zero you're not uncatchable
 donnelly Matt has negative 2400 anybody negative 4000 anybody just say at this
 point in the show that the three of us really know our winter Olympic sports oh
 got that winter Olympic fever that's right man I think it's the flu Matt
 you're up let's go I'll go lose for 1200 okay luge runs are time to this tiny
 fraction of a second where races are often decided my penis oh it does come
 in second I would guess thousands oh good get a thousandth of a second I mean
 that's a that is a tiny fraction of a second on thousand yeah I'm sorry it's
 100 ah mr. by mr. by one order of magnitude a bridge too far a bridge too
 far gift of the Magi last place is within my grasp mattingly mine too this is the
 maximum weight limit in pounds for a four-person bobsled including crew
 within 100 pounds well each of the people weigh a hundred and twenty pounds yes so
 that's another five hundred and and twenty pounds right plus some of them
 been snacking so that's okay 550 just for the people about 550 550 maybe let's
 let's be generous their athletes they're hefty muscle weighs more than fat let's
 say 600 just for the four individuals okay the thing itself is very lightweight
 I think the sled the sled I would imagine the sled the chassis is all
 fiberglass II right sure it's something yeah so I don't know 30 pounds for the
 chassis okay then you've got to have the structure and the thing to hold it
 together that's where the real weight comes in but I would see isn't the
 thing holding it together no I'd say the the the legs and the thing would be the
 that's that's another 200 so probably get 250 for the whole kitten caboodle so
 250 plus 600 so 850 that would be my guess okay I pass Paul you're up all
 right so the so 850 I think would be a safe bet maximum weight I'm gonna guess
 is a thousand let's try a thousand I'm sorry 1389 pounds I underestimated you
 underestimated Paul you're up yet Luz and Bob sled left Bob sled down on the farm
 for 2000 Jamaican famously competed in this year's Winter Olympics inspiring
 the film cool runnings Oh cool runnings happened when I was still in high school
 which had to be 92 or 93 okay John Candy was alive right but when was that winter
 Olympics okay now I got to count it down so 6 2 18 10 6 to 98
 94 90 had to be in 1990 I guess 1990 and it wasn't that's not even I was off by
 two years somewhere we're gonna lose two years or gain two man I suck a man Matt
 yet lose for 400 or 800 no matter what you do it doesn't matter I'll do one
 bomb sled question right but then I clearly lost that money somewhere lose
 sleds have no break so athletes slow down using these parts of their body
 what parts of their body they use to slow the sleds down I think it's grow
 them whoa Bob Evans it's like a beaver tail just like dragging it down
 oh if you're if you're scrotum as beaver tail oh I mean it's gotta answer feet
 right it has to be one of the I'm done guessing at this at this fucking game is
 it is it their knees the back of their own heads now the luge are they on
 there on there are they on their stomach or on the on their back no they're on
 their backs they're sitting skeleton his head first okay so the sitting loses
 feet first okay chaotic either hand they use their opponent's stones oh they
 throw up parachutes I'll say hands let's try hands their feet
 damn it I've been really gonna marry it down to 50/50 on this one the wrong way
 every time you have been really good at least saying the correct answer
 somewhere in your discussion I'm closing out the category and the game lose for
 400 if I get this question right one of us will be in positive points well I'm
 not counting a day unlike Bob's letters who sit upright yes lose up right news
 athletes race in this body position they're on their backs yeah wait a
 minute Jacob that puts you in positive points
 400 points I will just happened is I won the game with 400 points Matt is in
 second place though with negative 4400 points and Paul is in third place with
 negative 7200 points Winter Olympics catch the fever everybody the fever get
 pumped JJ just popped in the chat I'm trying to get JJ on earlier but she had
