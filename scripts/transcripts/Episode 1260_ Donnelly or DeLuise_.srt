1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,920
 Oh hello there, I am so happy you're here, because I want to thank the ice cream truck

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,920
 drivers.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,700
 Thank you so much ice cream truck drivers.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,220
 It's a new month, I don't have a new list just yet, but we will thank each and every

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:20,120
 ice cream truck driver before the show, uh, this month, we'll do it this month.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,680
 We're gonna get it done.

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,220
 It's all gonna get done, people.

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,220
 Nobody panic.

00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,840

 Oh yeah.

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,840
 Oh yeah.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,840
 Oh baby, this is what I like.

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,080
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social?

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,080
 Yeah, I'd love to.

17
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,080
 Great, let's go.

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:01:04,320
 That song did not age well, none of that stuff, none of those old 50 poppy songs, I was just

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,320
 listening to one this morning, it's the uh, Splish Splash, it's basically you're arrested

20
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,320
 and not a list for life.

21
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,320
 Oh yeah.

22
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,320
 Yeah.

23
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,520
 It's time for Matt and Mattyley's ice cream socials, sitting in the bathtub, that's Paul

24
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,000
 Mattyley, sitting in a different bathtub, it's Matt Donnelly, and sitting in the shower,

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 it's me, Jacob the Audio Guy, we're preaching fun.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Yeah.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,440
 Splish Splash, I jump back in the bath, how was that, I know there was a party going on,

28
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:37,120
 it's so strange, they didn't have headphones back then, what kind of a, what kind of quiet

29
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,480
 ass weird party is happening outside your bathroom that you can't hear it and you come

30
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,800
 out with a towel, and he had a towel on, he claims, and then he's like, I mean, I think

31
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,040
 the answer to your question, Paul, is swinger party.

32
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,880
 I think a swinger party is going on outside of his bathroom door.

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,880
 Is that what it's about?

34
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,880
 There's an orgy.

35
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,880
 I'm thinking that right now.

36
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,640
 There's an orgy happening and he's like, oh God, yeah, a whole orgy, a very very quiet

37
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,640
 orgy.

38
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,640
 I gotta get back in the tub, cause my boner is going crazy.

39
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,600
 There are 18 different, no, 19 different people having sex out here very quietly.

40
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,720
 There's one odd man getting double digits.

41
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,280
 Oh, that guy is a good sport.

42
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,280
 Look at him go.

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,320
 I turned him into a bowling ball.

44
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,320
 Oh, that's nice.

45
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,320
 Ooh, that was a spare.

46
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,240
 How are you doing, Matt?

47
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,240
 Where are you?

48
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,240
 Good.

49
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:38,080
 I'm still in San Antonio and we received some feedback that my audio is super weird and

50
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,080
 bad.

51
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:45,640
 One, this is addressable, definitely going forward.

52
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,960
 I have traveled with a directional microphone before.

53
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,000
 It's just, I traveled with so much stuff that I was like, oh, if I just take a room recorder

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,740
 with me, that's easier, but we're going to go ahead and call that experiment failed.

55
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,040
 But we're going to keep the recorder and I think what we're going to do is do it.

56
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,560
 This is just a good, here you go.

57
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:21,000
 We're going to do like a headset mic or something like that into Matt's recorder so that he's

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,760
 only going to carry, there's going to be a small additional thing to carry when he's

59
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,760
 on the road.

60
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,560
 This is something that we were going to address anyway and then some people said something

61
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,560
 about it as well.

62
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
 And so yeah, here we are.

63
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,080
 Would you like like an airplane pilot headset?

64
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,920
 Why not get him the, the, the, the cans that have the mic coming off of it?

65
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
 Would that work?

66
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,920
 Too soon.

67
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,920
 Too soon.

68
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
 Bring up airlines right now, Paul.

69
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,920
 This is too soon.

70
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
 Oh, buddy.

71
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,040
 Are you, are you feeling the crunch?

72
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,240
 I don't know yet because I don't, I don't know if San Antonio's airport qualifies as

73
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,520
 one of the top 40 airports in the country.

74
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,520
 It's only the top 40.

75
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,720
 It's the top 40, but Vegas definitely does.

76
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,080
 So the airport you're flying into definitely qualifies.

77
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:11,120
 And here's the top 40 airlines in the U S coming in at number 40 it's STL St. Louis's

78
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,640
 own hub of choice.

79
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,940
 That's right.

80
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:19,720
 And it's getting fucked raw dog style by our own American president.

81
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,480
 If you can fucking call him that, what a ridiculous waste of skin.

82
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,160
 All right, let's see how else he can destroy the middle class even further and kill small

83
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,720
 business with his fat, stupid thumbs on every goddamn scale in the States.

84
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,720
 What a bitch.

85
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:43,440
 Dear Casey, my dad used to buy me that popcorn Oprah like the Chicago's O'Hare airport.

86
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,840
 I was wondering if you could play Chicago O'Hare for my dad.

87
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,480
 Here we go.

88
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:59,120
 Coming out at number 39 with no kernels, it's popcorn O'Hare.

89
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,080
 You guys got sending me these dead dog stories.

90
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,800
 I got to read these dead dog stories and then go right into a pop pop hit Casey Casey.

91
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,800
 The mic's still on.

92
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,800
 Mike's on Casey.

93
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,800
 Yeah.

94
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,800
 Well, it's going to be on your ass.

95
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
 You fucker.

96
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
 Fuck you.

97
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
 Casey.

98
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
 Casey.

99
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
 I'm gone rogue.

100
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
 Look, I'm bumblebee.

101
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,120
 No, I'm cliff jumper and shaggy.

102
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,320
 So eat my shit.

103
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,800
 So Mike in the chat says, I don't know what the airport thing is because of air traffic

104
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,640
 controllers being part of the budget for the government and the government being shut down.

105
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:40,400
 The transportation secretary has asked 10% of flights to be canceled and they're targeting

106
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:48,360
 40 of the top 40 major airports to cancel those flights to decrease air traffic since

107
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:55,120
 so many air traffic controllers are either quitting or working a second job and calling

108
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,280
 it out because they're not getting paid.

109
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,680
 They're not actively not getting paid.

110
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,680
 Gross.

111
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,800
 It turns out they have bills.

112
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,480
 We have air traffic controllers who listen to the show.

113
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,480
 Yes.

114
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,480
 I know several.

115
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,480
 Yeah.

116
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
 Yeah.

117
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,480
 And my heart goes out to you guys.

118
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,720
 Thank you for all the incredible hard work you do.

119
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,000
 Also God damn my old hometown stomping grounds.

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,560
 You see that horrific shit that went down in Louisville.

121
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
 Sorry.

122
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,120
 I can't hear you outside of a Casey case invoice now.

123
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,140
 I'm now stuck hearing you in case.

124
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:33,080
 Well friends, it turns out we went back to the bluegrass state and the bluegrass state

125
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:39,960
 is now blue and charred, charred black with the remnants of thousands and thousands of

126
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:46,680
 gallons of gasoline, jet fuel that dispersed all over human and animal alike, killing them

127
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,000
 all in one fell swoop.

128
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,680
 UPS made one special delivery to hell.

129
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,960
 Oh, that that one is what you're talking about.

130
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,960
 Yes.

131
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,960
 I did see that one.

132
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,960
 Casey.

133
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,960
 That's what I'm talking about.

134
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,960
 It's a horrific event.

135
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,960
 Casey Kasem is just here to do the horrible.

136
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,480
 Perhaps it's a little too soon.

137
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,920
 Now I guess that's the way you do it.

138
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,960
 Casey Kasem from now on.

139
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,320
 All horrible news is covered by Casey Kasem.

140
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,000
 No, it's, it's really sad.

141
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,200
 A terrible, no, it's horrible.

142
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,760
 I that that I used, I flew out of that airport to come to Vegas.

143
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:26,360
 I flew out of there to go to go to the air, Chicago.

144
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,360
 That was my one way trip.

145
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,760
 There was a Chicago, then to think what there is on the plane, not the airport.

146
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,760
 Right.

147
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,760
 Yes.

148
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,800
 But the airport got fucked and their surrounding areas got.

149
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
 Oh yeah.

150
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
 Yeah.

151
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
 It literally crashed into businesses.

152
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
 Yeah.

153
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
 It's terrible.

154
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
 It's, it's horrific.

155
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
 Yeah.

156
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
 It's really, really scary.

157
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,640
 And they basically closed down Louisville for a day because of the noxious fumes and

158
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,640
 shit.

159
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,360
 Uh, is that what they, is that what they're calling the area around your house?

160
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,040
 The area of obnoxious fumes, the area of noxious fumes.

161
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
 Yeah.

162
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,560
 Especially if I've had microwave hot dogs.

163
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
 That's right.

164
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,560
 Oh Jesus.

165
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,520
 Can we close this down for just, just a couple more hours?

166
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,080
 Cause he is about to shut down Pittsburgh.

167
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:11,160
 Oh, green cloud trying to come to cause you just doing, doing this service for mankind.

168
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,680
 My guy, my guy has not been happy with late.

169
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,680
 I will say that.

170
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,480
 I will say that we're climbing and there's a cloud of Paul.

171
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,280
 Uh, yeah, it's terrible.

172
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,680
 So the airline stuff is really awful.

173
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,060
 It's really, really bad.

174
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,060
 And I'm just great.

175
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,060
 Oh yeah.

176
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,060
 No, it's bad.

177
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,060
 I reflect on it.

178
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,080
 And I think how grateful I am that I'm not flying anytime soon, but then I think there's

179
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,140
 so many people that are.

180
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,140
 And yeah.

181
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:39,920
 And then, and we, we narrowly missed coming into some shit with scoop vest and fuck.

182
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,800
 Who knows what the next one's going to be like.

183
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
 Yeah.

184
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
 We're screwed.

185
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
 I guess we're done.

186
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,640
 We'll see you soon.

187
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,640
 All right.

188
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,640
 Uh, okay.

189
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
 See you next year everybody.

190
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,640
 Happier news.

191
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
 Happier news.

192
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,640
 Okay.

193
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,640
 Tomorrow.

194
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,640
 Happier news.

195
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,640
 Are you asking for it?

196
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,640
 No, I've got it.

197
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:08,920
 Tomorrow marks 19 years married to Ann McPheeters for a while.

198
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
 How about that?

199
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,920
 Oh, that'll be good.

200
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,920
 Yep.

201
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,920
 Tomorrow's our anniversary.

202
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:26,360
 Of course she has to work and so, so we spent, she works that ass all the time.

203
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,200
 Uh, so I want you to guess.

204
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,200
 We took, we decided today we were going to do our anniversary.

205
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,960
 You will never in a million years guess what we did for our first dog in, in the Chili's

206
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,220
 parking lot.

207
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,840
 You're not that far off.

208
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:50,320
 Put on, put on bee costumes and culled your own honey into jars?

209
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,320
 Nope.

210
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,320
 Okay.

211
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,320
 Shit.

212
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,800
 That was my next guess.

213
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
 What is that called?

214
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,200
 What are beekeepers called?

215
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
 Beekeepers?

216
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
 No.

217
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
 Beekeepers?

218
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,000
 No, there's a, what's the hobby called?

219
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Keeping bees.

220
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 A, apists.

221
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 That's it.

222
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Thanks, Leon.

223
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 A, apiarist.

224
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 A, apiarist.

225
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,800
 There's an extra syllable in there somewhere.

226
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
 Apiarists.

227
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,800
 A, apiarists.

228
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
 Rapists.

229
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
 That's it.

230
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
 Not rapists.

231
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
 Nope.

232
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
 Yeah.

233
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
 I keep bees.

234
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
 I'm a rapist.

235
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
 Apiary.

236
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
 It's an apiary.

237
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
 That's right.

238
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,800
 A beehive is an apiary.

239
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
 So api-ists, I guess.

240
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,400
 Api- I'm the api-ist here.

241
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
 We're, we're doing an api-ist talk.

242
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,760
 It was called that because an ape invented it.

243
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
 Oh, beehive.

244
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,760
 Says Rich Scoop.

245
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,760
 Good one.

246
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
 Bees.

247
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,760
 They're gre-pe.

248
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,760
 They're gre-pe.

249
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,120
 Uh, no.

250
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:45,080
 We decided earlier this week, really and decided, but I, I was totally in on the plan.

251
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:50,680
 We decided that for our 19th wedding anniversary, we were going to go join Costco.

252
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,020
 Oh, man.

253
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:59,040
 I didn't want to cry on today's show, but I really just-

254
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,040
 Too bad.

255
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
 Too late.

256
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,040
 Here come the Waterworks.

257
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,040
 Oh, my God.

258
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,080
 Everybody in the chat is weeping openly.

259
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,800
 Uh, yeah.

260
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,000
 Oh, Costco.

261
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,880
 How I love thee.

262
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,880
 It was-

263
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:26,080
 I love that Paul refuses to talk over his own song.

264
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,840
 He's like, I will not use my own song as a, as an underbed of music.

265
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,840
 We will just sit and listen to it.

266
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,400
 I'm still sippin' on my, I'm sippin' on my Costco Coca-Cola.

267
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,760
 I did get a hot Costco hot dog on the way out.

268
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
 We both, we both did.

269
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,760
 We had our dinner.

270
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,760
 Did you, you ate from one side, she ate from the other.

271
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,760
 Yeah.

272
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,760
 And you guys ate the hot dog until you got-

273
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,760
 Totally, totally.

274
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,760
 In the middle.

275
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
 The fuckin' lady in the tramptit.

276
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
 Who was who?

277
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:52,920
 And then you both tried the same with the Costco pizza, but you tapped out like halfway

278
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,800
 through because it's just the amount of dough in your bellies.

279
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
 We did.

280
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,960
 We did a Pete, we did a slice and a dog each, and we both tapped out.

281
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,760
 We were like, okay, this is too much food, but it was really good.

282
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:12,960
 It took me too, as someone with children, I've been a Costco member for some time, it

283
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,240
 took me too long to realize I should never order two slices of pizza from that place.

284
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,240
 Did Matt just freeze?

285
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,240
 He did just freeze.

286
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,400
 Matt has just, Matt just froze in the, in the, he's unfrozen now.

287
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,800
 We can see him again now, but he froze in the best pose that he could have possibly

288
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
 frozen.

289
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
 It was good pose.

290
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,800
 You looked, you looked striking.

291
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
 All right.

292
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
 Sorry, we lost you there for a second.

293
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,200
 You've been a Costco member for a long time.

294
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,200
 The audience heard it.

295
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
 They heard your recorder, but what we didn't hear it.

296
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
 Oh yeah.

297
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
 Uh, but I'll repeat it here.

298
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,000
 Uh, um, uh, it took me too long to realize that I shouldn't order two slices of pizza

299
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 from Costco.

300
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 God no.

301
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 Yeah.

302
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 God no.

303
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,480
 I'd be in the middle of that second slice and be like, what have I done?

304
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,480
 Just like the whole-

305
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,480
 Why do I do this?

306
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,480
 The whole world becomes slow motion.

307
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,320
 It's almost a quarter of a pizza.

308
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,320
 Yeah.

309
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,320
 It's a ridiculous thing.

310
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,680
 How are you guys at leaving food on your plate at a restaurant or something?

311
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,480
 I'm only just now in my life getting to where I'm able to really do it and be comfortable

312
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
 with.

313
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,480
 Yeah.

314
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,480
 I'm getting better at it, but I don't usually do it.

315
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,080
 Dick, if you're actually bringing up a big thing for me, to be honest with you.

316
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,080
 Oh yeah.

317
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,080
 Yeah.

318
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,080
 Yeah.

319
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,960
 As someone who's trying to be a recovery fatty, I'm going to tell you thin people leave stuff

320
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,360
 on their plates all the time.

321
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,360
 They do it left and right.

322
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,360
 They don't give a shit.

323
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,520
 They've never grown up with a clean plate club or whatever.

324
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,560
 The amount of people I know I go out to eat with a skinny person and they just know they're

325
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,400
 done and the fork's down and they're still half the way in the plate, and they're casual

326
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,760
 and confident about it.

327
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,320
 They just wait forever and finally the waiter comes over and goes, "Are you done?"

328
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,320
 They go, "Yes."

329
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,320
 It's been sitting there the whole time.

330
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,800
 They don't finish their fries.

331
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,680
 It's an amazing trait of a thin person.

332
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:56,200
 I have simply tried to imitate this to possibly become thinner by being like, "Can I do what

333
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
 it is?"

334
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,200
 Meanwhile, I'm secretly sweating because I'm just like, "When is that waiter coming?

335
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,440
 Take that fucking plate away from me.

336
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:08,160
 I still won't eat this entire thing, but I want to be like a thin person and I want to

337
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,160
 leave it."

338
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,440
 There's no like, "Oh my gosh, you're starving children in Africa," and all that stuff.

339
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,760
 None of that holds true for a thinny person.

340
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,560
 They don't care.

341
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,040
 They do it all the time.

342
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,680
 That starving child in Africa is not getting the food on this plate regardless of if I

343
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,680
 eat it or not.

344
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,680
 Yeah.

345
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:32,920
 Now, my wife is a skinny person who always insists on taking everything home, which all

346
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,240
 this does is light a fuse for three days later, "Why is there so much shit in our fucking

347
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,240
 fridge?"

348
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,240
 Right?

349
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,620
 It's like, "I think you need to go in the bathroom, look in the mirror, and ask that

350
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,240
 question to yourself."

351
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,120
 Which is always a safe answer to give when your wife asks a question that she's upset

352
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,120
 about.

353
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,120
 Oh, no.

354
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,240
 In the kitchen, I'm like, "Oh, I don't know.

355
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,240
 God.

356
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,920
 Goddamn."

357
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,920
 What could it be?

358
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,920
 Oh, man.

359
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
 I don't know.

360
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,120
 They're multiplying.

361
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,480
 We got to get to the bottom of this.

362
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,640
 I never got to eating all that leftover food I took home.

363
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,280
 I never got to do that.

364
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
 Hold on.

365
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,480
 I'll go beat the children.

366
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,600
 They must be putting stuff in the fridge again.

367
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,080
 That'd be a good habit to develop, but no.

368
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,960
 You have house guests, Jacob.

369
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,440
 Paul, you don't really get too many guests at the house.

370
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,480
 No, very rare.

371
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:31,480
 Jacob, do guests at your place take food home from restaurants and put it in your fridge?

372
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,080
 Wait.

373
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,960
 Do they bring-

374
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,960
 If everybody went out to eat together, and then they're coming to stay at your place.

375
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,760
 So you guys all go to a restaurant, and they go, "Oh, I can't finish that.

376
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,760
 I'll take a box."

377
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,760
 Do they take a box of food and put it in your fridge?

378
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,760
 Rarely.

379
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:58,080
 Okay, it's probably my biggest pet peeve of having a house guest.

380
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,040
 Because I'm like, "You're in Las Vegas.

381
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,680
 You're not going to go, 'We should eat leftovers' at any point during your vacation."

382
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,040
 You are never going to be like, "Never mind.

383
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,520
 Let's just bust out the leftovers and have a leftover festival at the table my last night

384
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,520
 in Las Vegas."

385
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,520
 That's a dumb thing.

386
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,160
 Now, what I will do- Yes, that is all correct.

387
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,720
 Also, what I will do is when the guests are in town, like if we go out somewhere and not

388
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,440
 nice, and they get a nice meal or something like that, and they're like, "Oh, I'm not

389
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,880
 going to finish this other piece here," I'll be like, "I'll take a box for that.

390
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,040
 I'll take that home, and I will eat your leftovers later on."

391
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,040
 Oh, sure.

392
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,040
 Yeah.

393
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,040
 Yeah.

394
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,040
 That's a pro-move.

395
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,920
 If it's something that I've had my eye on anyway, that steak looks good.

396
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,560
 My mother-in-law just ordered a 16-ounce steak.

397
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,800
 She's going to eat eight ounces tops.

398
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,520
 I'll just reach over and cut that thing in half right at the top of the dinner, and just

399
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,520
 slide one half over to her.

400
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,920
 The other half's right there if she wants to get to it, but if she doesn't, it's coming

401
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,920
 home.

402
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
 Smart.

403
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,920
 That's smart.

404
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:06,640
 Speaking of ordering steak and Las Vegas parking and weather-

405
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
 Hit it, Jacob.

406
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,640
 Yep.

407
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,040
 It's over here somewhere.

408
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,840
 All my buttons have moved around.

409
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,840
 God damn it.

410
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,840
 Oh, my buttons.

411
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,840
 My gumdrop buttons.

412
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,840
 My buttons.

413
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,840
 My page.

414
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,840
 That's why.

415
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,840
 My sweet candy buttons.

416
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:23,840
 Vegas, parking and weather, no one does it better than ICS.

417
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,840
 It wasn't my buttons.

418
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,840
 It was me.

419
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,840
 I was on the wrong page.

420
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:32,280
 To prove that Vegas is always on the innovation space of the world of entertainment, they

421
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,800
 figured out a way to close a show without closing a show over at the Bellagio.

422
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,040
 What happened?

423
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,440
 Oh, the poor Mayfair.

424
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,640
 I feel so bad for everybody over there.

425
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:49,960
 The Mayfair Summer Club is staying open at the Bellagio, they simply fired everyone.

426
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,000
 Their whole thing is dinner and a show.

427
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,080
 They have singers and dancers and performers, they have a stage in there, there's lighting

428
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:02,200
 and sound, and you sit around it, and it's a very nice restaurant on top of it.

429
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,880
 It's a Michelin star, I think, restaurant and all that kind of stuff.

430
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,440
 Yeah, they have fired the entire entertainment cast.

431
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,960
 So now it's dinner and a TBD over at the Mayfair Summer Club.

432
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,400
 Apparently someone is coming in to make up some kind of new entertainment, and that is

433
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,440
 the amount of news that has been released on that.

434
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,440
 Oh no.

435
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,600
 It's funny, I got a message from someone saying they're submitting an audition for the Mayfair

436
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,400
 Summer Club, and they're coming to check them out.

437
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,440
 They don't live in Vegas, they live in another city.

438
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,480
 I was like, in my head, I was like, "Huh, that's weird that they're auditioning someone

439
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,080
 to do a whole new thing."

440
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,560
 And then I got the news, and I was like, "Oh, it all adds up now."

441
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:49,400
 It's a shame because the Mayfair Summer Club hired locally.

442
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,440
 They hired a local talent.

443
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,440
 Man, that's a bitch.

444
00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:00,160
 That's 30 Las Vegas residents who had show business jobs that are gone, several friends

445
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,160
 of ours.

446
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,160
 That's killer, man.

447
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,240
 Yeah, several friends of ours.

448
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:11,320
 A lot of them, because they're Las Vegas performers, a lot of them have multiple gigs, but it just

449
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,320
 sucks.

450
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,560
 You lose that gig.

451
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,680
 You might lose a third of your weekly income or so.

452
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,200
 Well, I'll tell you another thing that happened while we were at the Costco.

453
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,680
 We had to get the membership, right?

454
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:28,840
 So went and got the membership, and the gentleman there, super friendly guy, we got to talking,

455
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:34,040
 and we were talking Vegas, and then we were talking improv.

456
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,280
 Believe it or not, he's an improviser over at the arcade space.

457
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,280
 Hilarious.

458
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,280
 I was like, "Holy shit."

459
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,880
 So we exchanged info.

460
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,720
 I got him a chip, because always.

461
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,020
 You're so good at it.

462
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,020
 Got to do it.

463
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,020
 Got to be on it.

464
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,020
 Okay.

465
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,020
 Yeah, so we'll talk.

466
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:59,320
 But in my heart, I felt some, I don't know, relief, kinship, because I, too, am a retail

467
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,360
 employee who moonlights as an improviser now.

468
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,120
 I'm just getting back into the teaching.

469
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,400
 By the way, I don't know if I've mentioned this.

470
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:13,120
 My level one class at Skit is going phenomenally well, and I love all those students.

471
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,120
 They're amazing.

472
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,120
 Oh, wonderful.

473
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,120
 That's good to hear.

474
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,120
 You have not said that.

475
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,120
 That's great.

476
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,120
 Fan-fucking-tastic.

477
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,080
 A couple of them are listening to the podcast now, and tell me that they know that I shit

478
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,120
 my pants, and stuff like that, which I'm just over the moon about.

479
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,400
 Which is great, because if you ever leave the classroom going, "It's happening," they'll

480
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
 know why.

481
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,040
 Yeah, if I leave the classroom squealing, "It's happening!

482
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,040
 Oh, no!

483
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
 Oh, no!"

484
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:41,560
 They'll figure it out real fucking fast.

485
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,280
 Maybe one of your students will kiss your ass and come up with a thermos, a freshly

486
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,680
 steamy microwave hot dog.

487
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,120
 It's like they'll open up a little plume of steam coming off the top of a thermos and

488
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,640
 just a nice dangly wiener for you to chomp down on.

489
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
 I saw the fuck.

490
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,640
 Somebody sent me the Pope-Peele one.

491
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,640
 Nice dangly wiener.

492
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,760
 Somebody sent me the Pope-Peele one.

493
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,560
 It's so nasty.

494
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,560
 The Pope-Peele one.

495
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,560
 Have you seen it?

496
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,760
 The Pope-Peele hot dog thing?

497
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,760
 No.

498
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,760
 Please stop saying Pope-Peele.

499
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,000
 It would slice the wiener when you put it in, and then you'd lay the bun on top of it,

500
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,840
 and there was a bun case, and you microwave it, bun it all, and I'm like, "Don't put bread

501
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,840
 in a microwave!

502
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,840
 That's sacrilege!"

503
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,840
 It's so gross.

504
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,920
 My anaconda don't want none unless your bun's got a case!

505
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,920
 That's right.

506
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,800
 You could do side bans or sit-ups.

507
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
 Sit it and forget it.

508
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:38,520
 You know who else wants a thermos of hot dogs delivered directly to them?

509
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,360
 And that is the following sponsor.

510
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:46,360
 Today's show is brought to you by The Internet, from Danny O-Wide in 2021.

511
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,560
 Today's show is brought to you by The Internet, with a capital "I."

512
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:56,880
 Hey, the end of democracy and your sister's fucking a dog.

513
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,880
 That's The Internet.

514
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,880
 Enter Hey Scoops at Checkout!

515
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,880
 Oh, yeah.

516
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,880
 I have a little update on that.

517
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,880
 Oh, yeah?

518
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,880
 Yeah, yeah.

519
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
 Please.

520
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:14,440
 So my buddy Sammy gets a call, and it's another, you know, you've been approved for some loan,

521
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,280
 or you want to do something in the medical care system or something.

522
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,280
 Oh, shit!

523
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,280
 Right?

524
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,280
 Another Indian call center thing?

525
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,460
 Yeah, another Indian call center with a scam.

526
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,000
 And Sammy goes, "Oh, yeah, no problem, yeah, sign me up, let's do it."

527
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 You know, whatever.

528
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 They go, "Your first name?"

529
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 He goes, "Ben."

530
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,440
 And he goes, "Sorry, what's your first name?"

531
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,440
 And he goes, "Ben."

532
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,440
 And he goes, "Oh, yeah.

533
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,760
 And I know what your last name is, too."

534
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,760
 And he hangs up.

535
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
 I got him!

536
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,760
 Oh, shit!

537
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,760
 Oh, shit!

538
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:51,200
 Before he can even— Got him!

539
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,000
 Oh, fuck!

540
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Fuck!

541
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,120
 For anybody who didn't hear that episode, my friend always says to a scam caller that

542
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,040
 his name is Ben Shod, which translates in Indian to "sister fucker."

543
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,040
 Right.

544
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:12,040
 And apparently, that's the worst thing you could say to someone in that country.

545
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,760
 But it's spreading.

546
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,240
 That means that that prank is spreading.

547
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,240
 Exactly.

548
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,240
 It is.

549
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,240
 I don't praise or condone.

550
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,320
 I simply report what's happening on the front lines.

551
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,320
 Uh-huh.

552
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,320
 That's right.

553
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,320
 You are Walter Cronkite.

554
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,200
 We go up with a current reference.

555
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,840
 I'm still shocked that Uncle Fucker never really caught on as hotly, but I guess it's

556
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,040
 'cause everybody likes uncles, and so nobody—it's not really derogatory.

557
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,680
 It's like, "Oh, well, yeah, I mean, you fucked your uncle.

558
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,680
 Great."

559
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,120
 Everybody has a good— He caught on for a slur for Canadians for

560
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,120
 a while.

561
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,120
 I guess.

562
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,120
 After the South Park movie.

563
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,120
 I guess.

564
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,120
 I love that.

565
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,200
 That's the whole thing.

566
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,840
 That song—god damn, I never laughed so hard in the theater.

567
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,280
 Still, to this day, that was the funniest moment.

568
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:02,000
 Was that the one that—was Uncle Fucker the one that Robin Williams sang on the Oscars?

569
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,400
 No, he sang "Blame Canada."

570
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,400
 That's right.

571
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,400
 That's right.

572
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,880
 Uncle—if he sang Uncle Fucker, that would have brought the house down.

573
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,080
 Well, 'cause I remember—'cause it had all of the terrible things that it—

574
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,080
 It still had some—

575
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,080
 I remember everybody was still terrified of what Robin Williams was going to do on the

576
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,800
 live broadcast for the Oscars.

577
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
 Right.

578
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,800
 How's that guy doing?

579
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
 Robin Williams—

580
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
 How's that guy doing?

581
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,800
 It's just a fucker.

582
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
 Yeah.

583
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,800
 Oh, shit.

584
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,800
 Bossy.

585
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,800
 Oh, man.

586
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:39,760
 Yeah, so we're walking through Costco for the first time, Anne and I, as husband and

587
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,120
 wife.

588
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,160
 She carried Paul over the threshold.

589
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,960
 We seriously just kept looking at each other in awe and amazement.

590
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,300
 We were really taken aback.

591
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:59,280
 We had a membership to Sam's Club back in Vegas for a little while.

592
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,520
 Nothing like this, this was just amazing.

593
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,520
 We got—

594
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,520
 Nothing compared to you.

595
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,520
 We got a bunch of stuff.

596
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,280
 We got mostly dog food.

597
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,280
 I don't know why.

598
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:13,280
 As someone who's been a lifelong Costco member, I don't know why I really condescendingly

599
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,920
 look when people bring up Sam's Club at the same time as Costco.

600
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,720
 I'm mostly like, "Sure.

601
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,720
 Okay."

602
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,280
 No, you're right, 'cause it's garbage trash, comparatively.

603
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,160
 We didn't know we were missing with the Costco thing.

604
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,000
 Jacob's a big Sam's Club guy.

605
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 I'm not.

606
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,720
 There's just—there's a closer Sam's to me than there is at Costco.

607
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,720
 Leon's asking if I—

608
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,000
 The Sam's Club that I go to is great.

609
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 If I saw—

610
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 I don't know.

611
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 I don't know.

612
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 Big justice at the Costco guys.

613
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:45,120
 Now, Rizzler was working the cash register when I came through, so we got a bunch of

614
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,120
 cool stuff.

615
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,000
 It was fun, 'cause we had—

616
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,480
 Yeah, scan and go at Sam's Club.

617
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,760
 Does Costco have the scan and go thing yet?

618
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,840
 Holy shit, this guy came up to the—no, we've got it.

619
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,260
 This guy came up to our cart.

620
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,260
 Oh, that's where Sam's Club's got it.

621
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,080
 This guy came up to our cart and was like, "You want me to scan you guys in?"

622
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,440
 We're like, "Yeah."

623
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:08,880
 He pre-scanned everything in the cart, sent it to our account, and then all we had to

624
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,600
 do was present our card at the register, and we're done.

625
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,600
 Yeah.

626
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
 That's good.

627
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,600
 Yeah.

628
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,960
 Sam's Club has—Sam's Club's scan and go with your phone, though, is superior.

629
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:25,800
 I would say it probably is superior, but it's also more open to fraudsters.

630
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
 Unfortunately.

631
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,000
 Or does that matter to me?

632
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,960
 It doesn't matter to you.

633
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,960
 I'm just saying—

634
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,960
 Yeah, there you go.

635
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,480
 No, 'cause the one in Vegas now, the one that I go to now, which I think is a really

636
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,520
 nice Sam's—I don't know why I'm defending Sam's Club, by the way.

637
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,520
 I'm just saying if you put—

638
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,520
 'Cause you love it, Jacob.

639
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,940
 Don't be ashamed of your love for Sam's Club.

640
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:50,320
 If you put being able to price items in the hands of the consumer, they will fuck with

641
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,320
 it.

642
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,320
 That's all I'm saying.

643
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,320
 I don't care about that.

644
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,320
 I know.

645
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,320
 And if Walmart loses money because people are gaming their system, that doesn't affect

646
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,320
 me at all.

647
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,320
 I'm fine with that, too.

648
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,320
 Okay.

649
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,960
 But yeah, the one that we have, they don't even have to check your shit at the door anymore

650
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,660
 like they used to with the scan and go stuff.

651
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,900
 It's all x-rayed in there.

652
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,280
 It's all like—yeah, there's a sensor thing and everything.

653
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,520
 It's so easy, and it's great now.

654
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:25,560
 And I think it's for anything under $700, like if you're spending less than $700.

655
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:31,200
 So when I check out for ScoopFest, I have to do it the old-fashioned way.

656
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,560
 We got a bunch of cool stuff, like I said, mostly for the dogs, but then it was really

657
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,720
 nice.

658
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,280
 We had watched a video or something.

659
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,200
 We saw this really nice collection of Jane Austen's books, right?

660
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,200
 Okay.

661
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,000
 Especially bound in these—it's a very nice thing.

662
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 And then we saw that it was—

663
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 She's the romance author, right?

664
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,640
 She's got like Fabio on the cover.

665
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,640
 Fabio always.

666
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,640
 And it was Costco only.

667
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,800
 And we were like, "Oh, no."

668
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,200
 But when we went today, we were really hoping to find those books, and we found them for

669
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,200
 Anne.

670
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,260
 So it was a good day.

671
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,440
 She got her special edition Jane Austen collection.

672
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,600
 It was really nice.

673
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,200
 It was very sweet.

674
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,480
 And they're really pretty, actually.

675
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,320
 They're like in a faux leather binding.

676
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,000
 They're really nice.

677
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,160
 So yeah, she's on the up and up with her little book collection.

678
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,860
 Yeah, Jane Austen wrote a special edition just for Costco.

679
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:27,140
 We got one of the signed, very limited signed copies from Jane Austen.

680
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:33,800
 She reached up with her dead hand, and she turned into the Joker.

681
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,360
 You don't know how I wrote these books.

682
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,400
 I saw it.

683
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,400
 It's all true.

684
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:44,520
 "Boss Grissom reached up with his dead hand, and he signed it over to me."

685
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,440
 Did you make Anne push you out of the giant cart?

686
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,320
 I pushed the cart.

687
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,560
 Anne pushed it at first.

688
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,800
 But then I pushed it most of the time, because she was like, "It's getting too heavy."

689
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,800
 So I pushed it.

690
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,800
 It was a bunch of ... I don't push carts like that.

691
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,720
 I don't push carts like that full of dog food.

692
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,680
 But man, the money we saved.

693
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,560
 Holy shit, the money we saved.

694
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,560
 The savings.

695
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,920
 The savings dude, seriously, we already paid for our membership.

696
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,320
 Just getting dog food, we already paid for our membership.

697
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,320
 It's ridiculous.

698
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,040
 Right now, any ... Some from Costco listening just was like, "Got 'em."

699
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,040
 Yes.

700
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,040
 They did.

701
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,040
 They got 'em.

702
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,320
 And the thing is, they got Anne.

703
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,040
 That's all that really matters.

704
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,560
 You can get me all day long.

705
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,560
 Oh yeah.

706
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,560
 They know that.

707
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,560
 Oh yeah.

708
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,560
 Big Bad Toy Store?

709
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,560
 Got 'em.

710
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,560
 Lego?

711
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,560
 Got 'em.

712
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,720
 This is the first for ... Since I was eight, six.

713
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,800
 Since I was six, got 'em.

714
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:46,040
 But if it's got Anne, oh, it's a whole 'nother thing.

715
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,440
 Do they have any sample people out there, buddy?

716
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,440
 Oh my gosh.

717
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,200
 She did almost ruin my day.

718
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,240
 She gave me this fucking falafel ball and this fucking dip.

719
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,960
 I was like, "I didn't really want it," but she was like, "Oh, I'll get 'em."

720
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,960
 And I ate this.

721
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,320
 I was like, "Oh."

722
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,320
 It was so gross.

723
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,880
 So many vegetables, wow.

724
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,880
 It was so gross.

725
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,480
 It was in this mint and cucumber dip or some shit.

726
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,640
 I was like, "Oh, God."

727
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,640
 But I ate it.

728
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,640
 It sounds delightful.

729
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,640
 Oh, it was awful.

730
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,480
 I ate the whole thing.

731
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,520
 It was full awful.

732
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,720
 Full awful.

733
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,520
 Full on full awful.

734
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,840
 Yeah, so that was my free sample.

735
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,840
 I was like, "Barf."

736
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,840
 It wasn't green.

737
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,840
 It was fried up.

738
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,840
 It was gross.

739
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,800
 Part of it was once green.

740
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:37,480
 Just a little fried up little ball of something.

741
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,080
 We finally did a little zhuzhing of our Patreon.

742
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,840
 We should talk about that a little bit.

743
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,840
 We did.

744
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,840
 Oh, yeah, we should.

745
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,840
 Production meeting.

746
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,840
 Again?

747
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,840
 Sure.

748
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
 Yeah.

749
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,840
 More production meetings.

750
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,840
 Twice in a row.

751
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,840
 Twice in one episode.

752
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,840
 Production meeting.

753
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,840
 When we talk about how sausage gets made.

754
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,840
 Blammo.

755
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,840
 Blammo.

756
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,840
 Oh, suck it.

757
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,840
 Oh, fuck you.

758
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,840
 Go fuck yourself.

759
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:09,080
 Fuck you in the face forever.

760
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,640
 We raised our lowest tier from $2 to $3.

761
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,640
 Let's just get that out of the way.

762
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,360
 Huge money grab on our parts.

763
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,840
 Talk about Costco.

764
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:25,840
 But if you ... If you get a Costco membership, though, you'll be able to afford it.

765
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,800
 If Disney+ wants to charge me $38 just to watch SportsCenter now because it's no longer

766
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:34,960
 on YouTube TV, I think we can go up to a dollar on that one.

767
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,960
 Yeah.

768
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,400
 That's the only tier we raised any price on.

769
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,920
 And as always, if you are a $2 member, we do not take that away.

770
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,920
 So you are-

771
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,920
 You're grandfathered in.

772
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,920
 Yes.

773
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,920
 Of course.

774
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,920
 So that still is unlisted.

775
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,560
 We actually still have like 28 people still at the dollar a month.

776
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,560
 I was like, "All right.

777
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,560
 Look at that."

778
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
 Hey.

779
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,560
 Look at us go.

780
00:31:55,560 --> 00:32:00,280
 By the way, if you're still at a dollar a month, A, congratulations, B, feel free to

781
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,760
 revisit your Patreon, and C, thank you.

782
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,760
 Absolutely.

783
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,760
 Thank you.

784
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,760
 Yeah.

785
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,760
 We make 12 of those.

786
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,760
 I mean-

787
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,660
 We make about 12 cents off of the dollar a month club.

788
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:16,240
 We make about $6 off of your $12, so thank you.

789
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:27,400
 So but we also took away, we're no longer delivering stickers, and then we are going

790
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,920
 to do any kind of like triple threats or any kind of songs from Paul.

791
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:35,280
 Those would be like off air deliveries.

792
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:40,360
 In return, Paul has organized a newsletter, he sent one out already.

793
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,360
 Yes.

794
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:47,240
 Paul will be organizing a monthly newsletter, and basically people seem to really enjoy

795
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,600
 these hangs on and off air where scoops get to interact with each other.

796
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,800
 Just like the strength of Scoop Fest is that scoops get to see each other and hang out

797
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,800
 with each other.

798
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,200
 Knowing that we're not really the big headliner sometimes for some people in this world that

799
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:06,560
 we've created, we're going to do Zoom hangs, off air Zoom hangs for everyone to hang out

800
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,840
 once a month as well.

801
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,800
 Yeah, so if you're a Patreon subscriber at any level, you will get the invites to the

802
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:19,000
 Zoom hangs, and then they're- what level is it?

803
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,520
 It's over a level.

804
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,880
 It's I think the $10 level.

805
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,800
 Yeah, $10 level and up, you get Zoom hangs once a month.

806
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,760
 This is all information we could have had in front of us.

807
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,880
 If only we had known we were going to talk about this.

808
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,880
 It's on the Patreon.

809
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,880
 It's the only thing we knew we were going to talk about.

810
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,080
 I gave you guys five minutes notice for the episode.

811
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,080
 It's true, you did.

812
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,440
 It is the only thing we knew we were going to talk about.

813
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:44,200
 Well, and we say we're not sending out stickers, we're not sending out physical stuff.

814
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,200
 That's all.

815
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,440
 We've just taken off the physical stuff.

816
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,160
 We're still sending you the digital files, or we're now sending you the digital files

817
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:57,000
 so that not only can you make stickers if you want, you can make fucking anything if

818
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 you want.

819
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,240
 You put that on any kind of product, you know, anywhere you want to put that.

820
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,720
 There are so many sites.

821
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,760
 Can you upload images into T Public and make stuff right in our store?

822
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
 Oh yeah.

823
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:16,240
 So, you know, you can even go through our store, use our T Public store to order custom

824
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:23,200
 stuff using custom art that we've just sent you for that month and double dip us a little

825
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,200
 bit.

826
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,200
 Oh, oh, they can't do it.

827
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
 Oh, no.

828
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,200
 Are you asking?

829
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,200
 No, I thought you were asking if I could do it.

830
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,200
 I was like, I can do it.

831
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,200
 Yeah.

832
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,200
 Oh, you could.

833
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,200
 But yeah.

834
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,200
 Okay.

835
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,440
 The newsletter came through Patreon.

836
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,400
 So if you're getting your Patreon emails, just check your Patreon emails for the newsletter.

837
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,400
 Yes.

838
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:45,440
 Coming in through the newsletters put out through Patreon added a newsletter feature

839
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,440
 to the.

840
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,440
 Well, I'm trying to learn the newsletter.

841
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,600
 I'm trying to learn the newsletter proper.

842
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,240
 It was just a post this time.

843
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,240
 Yeah.

844
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,060
 And oh, and the and the zoom hangs are different from the shows.

845
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:04,500
 So we have the we have the the patrons that are with us on this show recording right now.

846
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,880
 That stays for everyone.

847
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,880
 Yes.

848
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,880
 Everybody on Patreon.

849
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,880
 Every member gets access to our ice cream social recordings.

850
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,880
 Yes.

851
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,880
 Yeah.

852
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,880
 The zoom hangs are a different thing.

853
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,880
 Those are the all fair things.

854
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,920
 We did one this last month where we just had everybody on Patreon do it.

855
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,320
 We kind of did the beta test for it last month.

856
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,920
 But yeah, that'll normally be at the ten dollar level and higher.

857
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,640
 Leon, thank you for the reminder.

858
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:30,740
 Make sure you do your Patreon through the website, through a browser and not through

859
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:35,440
 the Patreon app, because the the Apple app takes a big cut.

860
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,440
 Yeah.

861
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,440
 Yeah.

862
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,440
 And then do it.

863
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,180
 And here live on this broadcast, I believe Meyer just post the link to the newsletter

864
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,680
 for anyone who might have missed it.

865
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,680
 Yeah.

866
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,680
 Oh, yeah, that's true.

867
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,680
 The Patreon post.

868
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,680
 So this is the Patreon post.

869
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,480
 Oh, Leon, if you can't read, that is a different Patreon level.

870
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,040
 There is a Patreon level, though, for you, if you can't read where I will just read the

871
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,560
 newsletter to you.

872
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,560
 Don't worry.

873
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,560
 We got you, Leon.

874
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,920
 But I'll still be sending out my original art piece, and then we're going to send out

875
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:11,960
 old school stickers, new stickers, new, you know, we still keep generating tons of artworks

876
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,760
 and people get access to that artwork.

877
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,160
 It's just the actual practice of printing and shipping stickers.

878
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,720
 And basically, people have like built dog houses out of the stickers we've sent over a decade.

879
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,720
 Yes.

880
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,720
 It's a diminishing returns.

881
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,720
 It's a lot.

882
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:31,640
 And also, if y'all haven't noticed, postal shit's getting weird.

883
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,640
 Yeah.

884
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:39,640
 If you feel like you're still owed stickers from the past, please send an email to jacob@hayscoops@med@hayscoops.com.

885
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,640
 Yes.

886
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,640
 Yeah.

887
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:48,280
 But yeah, moving forward, it's going to be digital rewards, but oh, man, Amy just wrote

888
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,080
 in chat that we'll read the newsletter as Dom DeLuise does the second time this week.

889
00:36:53,080 --> 00:37:00,400
 I've been compared to Dom DeLuise and as someone who's been slowly losing weight and trying

890
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,640
 to get their shit together, it's a real fucking kick in the balls to be compared to Dom DeLuise

891
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:14,480
 twice in a week, not to say I don't get it, not to say I totally don't get it.

892
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,880
 I get it.

893
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,080
 I love Dom DeLuise so much.

894
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:28,440
 You know who else loves me compared to Dom DeLuise all the time, and that is the following

895
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,440
 sponsor.

896
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:36,480
 All right, today's show is brought to you by 1-800-BITKILL.

897
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,000
 Are you stuck with someone doing a bit that's gone way too long?

898
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,040
 Call 1-800-BITKILL and our agents will come kill that bit.

899
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,760
 That's from Dungeon Scoop in 2024.

900
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,940
 Do you need a running joke kicked in the dick so hard it'll never recover?

901
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:59,280
 Call 1-800-BITKILL and we'll be there immediately to dick kick any running joke that has been

902
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:05,120
 going on in your household or family for any amount of time, as long as it's been more

903
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,880
 than five days.

904
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:13,760
 Any bit under five days still is in the incubation period and may or may not survive to day six.

905
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:21,440
 After day six, a bit is firmly and securely intertwined into the DNA of the host and then

906
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:28,480
 can only then be truly exterminated from said host.

907
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,200
 I mean, is that like a procedure or is that like something you just come out and do?

908
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,200
 What is that?

909
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,520
 Kick you in the dick until the bit is removed thoroughly.

910
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,440
 What, me or the person doing the bit?

911
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,840
 Your choice.

912
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,600
 Excellent.

913
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,820
 We're not that far off from prostitutes.

914
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,280
 Are we?

915
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,280
 That's right.

916
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:56,400
 None of us are that far off from prostitutes.

917
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,560
 Don't ever fucking forget it.

918
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,040
 Sex work is work.

919
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,040
 We just did a breakdown of our new patron levels.

920
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,040
 I agree.

921
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,040
 Yeah.

922
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,880
 Sex work is work, everybody.

923
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,720
 We're all of this whores in this economy.

924
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,080
 Enter Hays Groups to check out.

925
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,080
 Welcome to it.

926
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,080
 Yeah.

927
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:21,880
 I just sent you in the chat a very nice felt picture of Dom DeLuis from 1975.

928
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,080
 Everyone knows that's not what they're talking about, Jacob.

929
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:29,800
 No, I'm pretty sure that's a young Dom DeLuis in a very vibrant shirt.

930
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,280
 They're referring to his slim and trim days.

931
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,280
 That's right.

932
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,280
 No, one person said-

933
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,280
 The early years.

934
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,680
 An actual pic saying I had to do a double take and they were wearing a similar flat

935
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,680
 cap.

936
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,520
 He was wearing a similar flat cap to me.

937
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,600
 Was it Smokey and the Bandit 2?

938
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,600
 Is that where he's wearing?

939
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,520
 I think that is where he's wearing that one.

940
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:55,200
 I had to be like, I want to tell my friend, listen, if you ever think you should send

941
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,320
 a photo of Dom DeLuis to someone and be like, I had to do a double take, don't.

942
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,320
 Don't do it.

943
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,000
 Oh, no, you're safe.

944
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,320
 Smokey and the Bandit 2, isn't it?

945
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,320
 There it is.

946
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,520
 There's Leon helping you out, buddy.

947
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,520
 That's the one.

948
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,200
 Leon in the chat, helping out, but he looks so happy.

949
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,200
 Look at him.

950
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,200
 Jolly even.

951
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,200
 I'm a happy guy.

952
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,200
 Yeah.

953
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,400
 I don't understand the comparison.

954
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:26,360
 Oh, my God.

955
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:32,960
 I said this like great night, but one person on YouTube called the Orson Welles and I was

956
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,480
 like, actually, when you look at a picture of Orson Welles next to me, like that's actually

957
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,480
 who I look like the most.

958
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,920
 I'm like, I actually have to hand it to you.

959
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,480
 I really do look a lot like Orson Welles, late Orson Welles.

960
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:50,040
 Oh, I saw a great video the other day of Orson Welles' outtakes from a wine commercial that

961
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,040
 he was doing.

962
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,040
 Oh, that's a classic.

963
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,040
 Famous.

964
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,040
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

965
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,040
 Oh, it's so good.

966
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,040
 Because that was like the last thing he did, right?

967
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,040
 In one of them.

968
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,040
 It's definitely a later in life one.

969
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,040
 He was drunk.

970
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,040
 Where he's just drunk.

971
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,040
 Yeah.

972
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,040
 He is just like slurring speech drunk.

973
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,040
 The last thing he did was unicorn.

974
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,040
 That's true.

975
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,040
 Yeah.

976
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,040
 The reason you need to go look at this video again, though, if you haven't looked at it

977
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:14,280
 lately, or if you've ever seen it before, look up this video, Orson Welles outtakes

978
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,280
 wine commercial.

979
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:21,560
 The two extras that are standing next to him that are just doing take after take with him.

980
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,560
 Oh, yeah.

981
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,260
 They are heroes.

982
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,900
 They are amazing.

983
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,280
 They never comment.

984
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,160
 They never look at him sideways.

985
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,280
 They never do anything but exactly what they are there to do.

986
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,320
 Well, even then he was royalty, right?

987
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,320
 Oh, yeah.

988
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,320
 Yeah, yeah.

989
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,120
 I mean, you know, yeah, he's a legendary director.

990
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,280
 I mean, he'd already done Citizen Kane and yeah, like all that.

991
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,280
 Yeah.

992
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:49,040
 Brian Brushman sent me a clip of John Candy playing Orson Welles in a bit on like a late

993
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:54,360
 night talk show, and it's really, really funny.

994
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,720
 Latter-day Scoop goes with a thin picture of Orson Welles.

995
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,760
 That's not who we're talking about, Latter-day Scoop.

996
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,660
 Young Orson Welles.

997
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,840
 That's not who I'm being compared to on YouTube, I'll tell you that much right now.

998
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,160
 On my screen, that picture is next to Matt's face right now.

999
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:14,200
 Nobody's talking about that.

1000
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:20,320
 I found out something in the Zoom chat before we started today that has changed my world

1001
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,320
 forever.

1002
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,820
 Oh, God.

1003
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:29,280
 And that is, apparently, if you do a reverse image search of any house that was ever listed

1004
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,800
 on Zillow, that's enough to do a reverse image search of a house.

1005
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,800
 What?

1006
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,800
 Wait, what?

1007
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,800
 And like, and find out where that house is.

1008
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,920
 Wait, say that again.

1009
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:48,760
 So if you just have a picture of a house—oh, Scoop Jesus, there you are.

1010
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,200
 Can you unmute and come on?

1011
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,400
 Scoop Jesus was telling me about this before we started today.

1012
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,400
 Okay.

1013
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,560
 I'm actually in the house with that happened with.

1014
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,560
 Oh, great.

1015
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:04,000
 Yeah, so a friend, a name friend, posted a picture of their new house on Instagram that

1016
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,320
 didn't show the address number or anything, and my wife took the image, reversed image

1017
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:13,320
 search, and it popped up and showed the Zillow listing and got their address.

1018
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,940
 And I just drove down here with that address.

1019
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:21,000
 So you were able to find a house with just the picture of the house?

1020
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 Yep.

1021
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 I'm terrified.

1022
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:29,640
 I mean, there's, if we're doing that now, what do you think the government's been doing

1023
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,380
 for the last 15 years?

1024
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:36,120
 I mean, a lot more and a lot worse.

1025
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,120
 Yeah.

1026
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,120
 Yeah.

1027
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,120
 Yeah.

1028
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,120
 Just constantly checking the value of my house.

1029
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,120
 They've been reverse imaging.

1030
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,200
 They've been reverse image searching my colon, for God's sakes.

1031
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,820
 They know everything.

1032
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:50,580
 We got a note from our HOA about our basketball hoop being out, that we have to put our basketball

1033
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,580
 hoop away.

1034
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:52,580
 No.

1035
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:53,580
 No.

1036
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,560
 And their argument was that it could hurt the value of the homes around us.

1037
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:01,980
 And I just want to be like, you go ahead and Google the value of homes in this neighborhood.

1038
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:05,120
 You tell me where the dip happened the day I put up my fucking basketball.

1039
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,120
 Right.

1040
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,120
 Yeah.

1041
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,120
 No dips anywhere.

1042
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,840
 There are no dips yet.

1043
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,840
 Right back to him.

1044
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,440
 You know what lowers the property value in this goddamn neighborhood?

1045
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,480
 All these fucking kids running around.

1046
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,480
 You know what really lowers...

1047
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,800
 Get these fucking kids, and then I won't have a reason to put up a fucking basketball hoop.

1048
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,840
 You know what really lowers property values in Las Vegas?

1049
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,480
 What really lowers property values in Las Vegas is not being able to fly to fucking

1050
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,880
 Las Vegas.

1051
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:32,880
 That does hurt property values.

1052
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,880
 Yeah.

1053
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,880
 It puts a real dick in it.

1054
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,880
 It sure does.

1055
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,760
 A bunch of bullshit.

1056
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,760
 So what was your solution?

1057
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,040
 Have you put up the basketball goal, or are you going to fight them in City Hall?

1058
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,040
 I'm going to fight them in City Hall.

1059
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,240
 I'm actually waiting for the second note to come.

1060
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,240
 Good.

1061
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:52,520
 Because I feel like we definitely don't have the only basketball hoop out.

1062
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:58,160
 So I figured someone who's much more of an organized rage person than me is probably

1063
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,160
 answering them already.

1064
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,160
 There you go.

1065
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,160
 Yeah.

1066
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,160
 HOA's is the waste.

1067
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,160
 The waste.

1068
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,000
 I have a very reasonable HOA.

1069
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,720
 I'm actually not that upset.

1070
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,880
 We used to get a note about our leaves.

1071
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:10,880
 I know, Paul.

1072
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,880
 You're very well-known.

1073
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,200
 I just really, I hate the whole idea.

1074
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,200
 It makes me rage, rage, rage.

1075
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,920
 Paul, I'm around people in Las Vegas who definitely, with no HOA, would definitely lower the property

1076
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,560
 value of everyone around them.

1077
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,560
 Yes.

1078
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,560
 I get it.

1079
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,560
 Yeah.

1080
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,560
 But see, this is me.

1081
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,560
 I don't care.

1082
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,560
 I might go nuts.

1083
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,560
 I mean.

1084
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,560
 Do your thing.

1085
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,560
 I mean, here's the thing.

1086
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:36,400
 Unless you're burning the house, unless you're causing structural damage, or you're toxifying

1087
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,080
 my land, go nuts.

1088
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,080
 Here's the thing.

1089
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:48,840
 I have neighbors whose houses definitely are currently lowering my property value.

1090
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,200
 If they would spruce their houses up, I'd appreciate it.

1091
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:57,040
 But yeah, it's not worth being an HOA for me.

1092
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,040
 I'm with you, Matt.

1093
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,440
 Because I had a reasonable HOA before I lived here.

1094
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,440
 They were fine.

1095
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,440
 They didn't bother me.

1096
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,440
 It's a critical.

1097
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,960
 I like having a little bit of a nice sidewalk neighborhood, little gate area.

1098
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,520
 They can just get out of control so easily.

1099
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,520
 They really can't.

1100
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,520
 They can get out of hand.

1101
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,520
 Yes.

1102
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,520
 No, without a doubt.

1103
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,520
 Yeah.

1104
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,080
 I mean, you know, like all my friends in New York, what they have to go through.

1105
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,080
 Oh, God.

1106
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,080
 I can only imagine.

1107
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,080
 It's just like to own their home.

1108
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,080
 It's like, it's fucking nuts, man.

1109
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,080
 No, no.

1110
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,080
 Yeah.

1111
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,040
 There are, like this HOA is not that crazy, is what I'm saying.

1112
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,040
 We used to get notes.

1113
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,120
 A friend of mine just this week was talking to me about their HOA and they were like, "Oh,

1114
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,760
 our fees are so reasonable."

1115
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,320
 I said, "Oh, that's good.

1116
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,320
 What's your fees?"

1117
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,320
 They go, "500."

1118
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:40,520
 A year?

1119
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,520
 That's what I thought.

1120
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,520
 Uh-huh.

1121
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,600
 I genuinely was like, "Oh, 500 bucks a year, isn't bad."

1122
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,600
 Oh, no, no.

1123
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,600
 A month.

1124
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,600
 Oh.

1125
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,600
 Oh.

1126
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,600
 That is terrible.

1127
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,600
 Oh, eat shit.

1128
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,600
 Eat shit forever.

1129
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,600
 Oh, my God.

1130
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,600
 That is horrible.

1131
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,600
 That's ... no way.

1132
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,600
 We have a pool.

1133
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,600
 We have a gym.

1134
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,600
 That's cool.

1135
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,600
 A pool and a gym.

1136
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,600
 That's cool.

1137
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,600
 Yeah.

1138
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,600
 No, son.

1139
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,400
 But I bet that person also has a membership to a gym outside of their home.

1140
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,320
 I have a toy collection.

1141
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,320
 I would think so.

1142
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:12,600
 I could not keep my toy collection going with that kind of money going out.

1143
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,600
 That would end it.

1144
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,600
 Okay.

1145
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,600
 You're making a lot of arguments in favor of it now, Paul.

1146
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,600
 No, no.

1147
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,600
 Please.

1148
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:22,960
 This glorious basement of nerditude has increased the value of this home tenfold.

1149
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,840
 The moment a prospective buyer walks in, they're like, "Good God, may I keep the finished

1150
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,640
 basement and all the trimmings?"

1151
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,640
 I go, "No, sir.

1152
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,240
 No, sir, you may not.

1153
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,520
 That's a lifetime of collecting."

1154
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,920
 You can't, however, keep that squirrel.

1155
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,440
 Let me make an offer that you cannot refuse.

1156
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,900
 I need all of this bullshit.

1157
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,760
 Says no one ever.

1158
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,760
 Says me.

1159
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,760
 Says me.

1160
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,880
 Saving me an email.

1161
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,080
 Thank you, Steven Marson, who just became a year-long member of the $10 here.

1162
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,080
 Thank you, Steven.

1163
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,080
 Oh, nice.

1164
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,080
 Thank you so much.

1165
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,080
 Thank you.

1166
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,080
 Your thank you note right here, buddy.

1167
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,840
 Thanks for doing it.

1168
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:59,840
 That's incredible.

1169
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:00,840
 Much appreciated.

1170
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:01,840
 Yeah.

1171
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,640
 We've gotten a lot of great support.

1172
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:11,940
 As soon as I put up the post on the Patreon, we got some really nice supporting messages.

1173
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:17,440
 Thank you all for rolling with us and for moving forward into this new digital age.

1174
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,920
 It's going to be cool.

1175
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:24,240
 Yeah, I'm going to muddle my way through learning how to put this stuff together and get the

1176
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,720
 chats going and all these different things.

1177
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,720
 We're going to have a lot of fun.

1178
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:33,000
 We're going to put a period on it, the newsletter is at all levels, right?

1179
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 Yes.

1180
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,760
 Everybody on Patreon should be getting a newsletter, no matter what level you're at.

1181
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,640
 If you are not getting a newsletter, check your Patreon email, check your Patreon, do

1182
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,640
 all that kind of stuff.

1183
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,360
 Well, you're saying newsletter.

1184
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,940
 There's a new newsletter thing.

1185
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:48,680
 I haven't figured that out yet.

1186
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:51,320
 All I did was put up a post.

1187
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:56,660
 This first post went to everybody, so if you're on Patreon at all, you've got that post that

1188
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:57,660
 just went up.

1189
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,640
 So you're scheduling the posts, Paul?

1190
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,560
 The first one was just Patreon update.

1191
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,560
 Okay.

1192
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:07,840
 So that's probably why a lot of people might not, because when Patreon puts an update,

1193
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,680
 they also put Patreon update.

1194
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,680
 There you go.

1195
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,680
 See, I didn't know that either.

1196
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:12,680
 You should probably change the title of it.

1197
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:18,080
 So next time I'll say Ice Cream Social Newsletter for Blankety Month.

1198
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,080
 Yeah.

1199
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:23,160
 Well, I think you should put the name of the month.

1200
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,160
 I like Blankety Month.

1201
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,960
 I mean, you can figure it out.

1202
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:27,960
 I'm recording it.

1203
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:28,960
 You know what month it is.

1204
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,960
 You know what month it is.

1205
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:30,960
 I'm recording it into a blankety month.

1206
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,520
 Ice Cream Social Newsletter for Blankety Month.

1207
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,000
 Blankety Month on such and such date.

1208
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
 Can I make a suggestion?

1209
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 That's legally binding, isn't it?

1210
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
 What?

1211
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 Can you what?

1212
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,800
 Can I make a suggestion?

1213
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,800
 You can.

1214
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,360
 I don't know why that was so baffling to you.

1215
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,100
 I couldn't hear what you said.

1216
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,100
 Okay.

1217
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,440
 Hey, it's Paul.

1218
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,520
 I think you should write, and then that should be the title.

1219
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,520
 Here's the newsletter.

1220
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,520
 Oh, okay.

1221
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,520
 Hey, it's Paul.

1222
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,520
 Great.

1223
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,520
 Okay.

1224
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:01,520
 I'll start with Hey, it's Paul.

1225
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,520
 Hey, it's Blankety Month, everybody.

1226
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:11,920
 And it's definitely now called the Blankety Month newsletter.

1227
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,920
 It's Paul Mattingly.

1228
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,920
 Yeah.

1229
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,280
 Paul Mattingly's Blankety Month newsletter.

1230
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,120
 Hey, God, it's me, Paul.

1231
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,120
 Yes.

1232
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,120
 That'll work.

1233
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,440
 Because the more you try to make it sound official, the more it just sounds like a patron

1234
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,200
 email, which is what people, I think, delete all the time without reading.

1235
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,200
 That makes sense.

1236
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,200
 All right.

1237
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:36,800
 So I'll say, Hey, everybody, it's fucking Paul with the Blankety Month bullshit.

1238
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,680
 What the hell?

1239
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,680
 What is this?

1240
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,200
 Paul's character allotment was used up in the title again.

1241
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,200
 Exactly.

1242
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,200
 Exactly.

1243
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:50,360
 Well, that was the other thing, too, is we're also putting up candid photos as well as the

1244
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:55,200
 other digital images, and I put up the max images it would let me do.

1245
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:01,580
 And then I used the last image space for the header where I put my new artwork up.

1246
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,540
 And that was everything I could do.

1247
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,320
 So maybe they let you put more stuff in the newsletter.

1248
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,320
 I don't know.

1249
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,320
 We'll see.

1250
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,320
 I think they do.

1251
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,320
 Okay.

1252
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,320
 I think they do.

1253
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,320
 All right.

1254
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,320
 Yeah.

1255
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,320
 I'm still learning the ropes.

1256
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,320
 Still learning the ropes.

1257
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:19,300
 That is actually one of the more fun things, I think, for people who are already on Patreon

1258
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:24,760
 that are going to enjoy this new Patreon even more is you're going to have more direct

1259
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,960
 interaction with Paul via Patreon.

1260
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,960
 Well, that's for sure.

1261
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,480
 And that, I got news for you, is going to be fun.

1262
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,880
 Well, it's going to be a lot of fun.

1263
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:37,520
 It's going to be a lot of this, but it's also going to be a lot of fun.

1264
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,520
 Yeah.

1265
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,520
 Yeah.

1266
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,320
 And I'll take criticisms and tips all the time.

1267
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,320
 Oh, yeah.

1268
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,320
 Yeah.

1269
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,320
 No, Paul wants notes.

1270
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:49,160
 How the fuck to make this shit work right, because yeah, I got to learn the ropes.

1271
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:53,440
 So I got some off days coming up, and I'm going to try and spend some time learning that.

1272
00:51:53,440 --> 00:52:01,120
 And I will probably fire off a test Zoom chat again before too long just to figure that

1273
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,120
 out.

1274
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:05,720
 So it might only be 10 minutes, but keep your eyes peeled.

1275
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:10,800
 Well, I'll tell you what else Paul needs to learn, and that's the answers to Jock Versus

1276
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:39,480
 Nerd.

1277
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:43,920
 We got a scooperty coming to us today from Smitty Scoop Gentlemen.

1278
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,920
 I apologize.

1279
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,820
 I have not submitted a scooperty lately, but Jacob's plea on a recent episode motivated

1280
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,680
 me to prepare a scooperty.

1281
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:54,120
 Here are the updated Smitty Scooperty statistics.

1282
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:58,000
 All time victories, Matt has 13, Paul has three, I have eight.

1283
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:09,040
 All time points, Matt has 32,000, I have 12,400, Paul has negative 27,800.

1284
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,440
 I've got to keep it up.

1285
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:15,720
 Negative 27,800.

1286
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:22,040
 Combined accuracy in the last three Smitty Scooperties, 75.6% of questions answered correctly.

1287
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,600
 Good job everybody.

1288
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:29,520
 Combined accuracy on all previous Smitty Scooperties, 51.4% answered correctly.

1289
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,800
 So we've improved over the last three, so that's good for us.

1290
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,160
 Average combined score for the last three is 6,800.

1291
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:40,400
 Average combined score for all of them, negative 1,267.

1292
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,460
 So we are trending in the right directions.

1293
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:47,080
 Let's see if you can beat your all time high score of 12,800.

1294
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,080
 Good luck.

1295
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,280
 This is a Smitty Scooperty.

1296
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,280
 Let's go.

1297
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,880
 Oh, by the way, two shout outs.

1298
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:58,720
 One shout out to DJ Stormageddon in the Twitch chat right now.

1299
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,640
 Old friend of ours, DJ Stormageddon from back on the Scoop Cruise days.

1300
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,640
 Yes.

1301
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,640
 Oh yeah.

1302
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,800
 He's got his fucking honeymoon.

1303
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,800
 Got Obelisk on his honeymoon.

1304
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,800
 That's right.

1305
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,040
 Obelisk on his honeymoon.

1306
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:13,240
 And also, happy birthday OG Scoop.

1307
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,240
 Happy birthday, Andy.

1308
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,240
 Yeah.

1309
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,240
 Happy birthday, Andy.

1310
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:22,920
 Here we go with the Scooperty, the categories are the most, geography, initialism, and multiple

1311
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:23,920
 choice.

1312
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:24,920
 Okay.

1313
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:28,120
 Paul, you're up first.

1314
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,920
 I'll try multiple choice.

1315
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,840
 For 400.

1316
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:39,000
 Which of the following films was not directed by Amy Heckerling, Clueless, Fast Times at

1317
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:50,240
 Ridgemont High, Look Who's Talking, or Now and Then?

1318
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,240
 Fast Times.

1319
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,240
 B.

1320
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,880
 Fast Times is incorrect.

1321
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:56,880
 It's Now and Then.

1322
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:01,520
 That was directed by Leslie Lincoln Ladder.

1323
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:05,720
 Paul keeping up his negative score trend here on Smitty Scooperties.

1324
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,720
 Got something to prove.

1325
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,720
 Already.

1326
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:10,720
 Matt.

1327
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,040
 Geography please, 400.

1328
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:19,840
 Which state bordering Nevada is the largest in area, Alaska, Arizona, California, or Idaho?

1329
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:23,720
 Trying to get me in Alaska, bordering Nevada.

1330
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:24,720
 Nice try.

1331
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:30,120
 This is where we find out that Alaska somehow borders Nevada technically.

1332
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,120
 It could possibly.

1333
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,120
 Who knows?

1334
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,120
 California, see.

1335
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,800
 Got to be, right?

1336
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:42,400
 Yeah, California, 163,000 square miles, and Arizona and Idaho both have less, and Alaska

1337
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,600
 does not border Nevada.

1338
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,280
 It's a good call on all of that, Matt.

1339
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,800
 You got that entire question right.

1340
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,960
 I'll know what the most for 400.

1341
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:58,200
 Which of these NFL franchises has won the most Super Bowl titles, Bears, Colts, Seahawks,

1342
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,200
 or Vikings?

1343
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:03,840
 Is this going to bite me where it's like, oh, they won the NFL championship, but it

1344
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,000
 wasn't the Super Bowl yet?

1345
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
 I think it's the Bears.

1346
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,960
 I'll go A, Bears.

1347
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,600
 The Colts.

1348
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,600
 Colts two, Bears one, Seahawks one, Vikings nothing.

1349
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,600
 Wow.

1350
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,920
 Oh, all right then.

1351
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,920
 Paul.

1352
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,800
 I'll go initialism for 1200, because why not?

1353
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:28,800
 Oh, shit.

1354
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,800
 I gave you 400.

1355
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,800
 All right.

1356
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,940
 What is FYITF short for?

1357
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,680
 Fuck you in the face.

1358
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,680
 Nice job.

1359
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,720
 Or were you just talking to me?

1360
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:39,720
 No, both.

1361
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,720
 Were you answering?

1362
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,720
 Oh, OK.

1363
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,720
 Both.

1364
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,520
 Two birds, one stone.

1365
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:52,040
 I will take geography 800.

1366
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:59,720
 Galica is the name of the Northwest region of what country?

1367
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:04,960
 Austria, France, Italy, or Spain?

1368
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,920
 I'm sure I'm not saying that right.

1369
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:07,920
 G-A-L-I-C-I-A.

1370
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,920
 Galicia.

1371
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,920
 Galicia?

1372
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:10,920
 Galicia.

1373
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:11,920
 OK.

1374
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,920
 Galicia.

1375
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:18,400
 I'm just going off the correction of my around the chat.

1376
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,400
 Oh, great.

1377
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,400
 Galicia, Austria.

1378
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,400
 Galicia, France.

1379
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,400
 Galicia, Italy.

1380
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,400
 Galicia, Spain.

1381
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,400
 Pass.

1382
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,400
 Oh, no.

1383
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,400
 They can pass this to me.

1384
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,400
 Let's see.

1385
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,400
 I'll do the same thing that Matt was doing.

1386
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,400
 Galicia, Austria.

1387
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,400
 Galicia, France.

1388
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,400
 Galicia, Italy.

1389
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,400
 Galicia, Spain.

1390
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,400
 Galicia.

1391
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,400
 That's right.

1392
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,400
 It's definitely Italy.

1393
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,400
 I think it's Italy, too.

1394
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,400
 See, Italy.

1395
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,400
 Shit.

1396
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,400
 Spain.

1397
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,400
 That was my second guess.

1398
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,400
 Galicia.

1399
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,400
 Galicia.

1400
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,400
 Let's see.

1401
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,400
 I'll try geography for $1,200.

1402
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,400
 Why did I go back to geography?

1403
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,400
 I don't know.

1404
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,400
 Which U.S. state capital is located at the highest elevation, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada,

1405
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,400
 or New Mexico?

1406
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,400
 Oh, this is probably a trick question.

1407
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,400
 I'll say Colorado.

1408
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,400
 No, it's New Mexico.

1409
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,400
 6,900 feet for New Mexico, for Santa Fe, only 5,200 for Mexico.

1410
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,400
 Oh.

1411
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,400
 OK.

1412
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,400
 I'll try geography for $1,200.

1413
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,400
 I'll try geography for $1,200.

1414
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,400
 I'll try geography for $1,200.

1415
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,400
 I'll try geography for $1,200.

1416
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,400
 I'll try geography for $1,200.

1417
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,400
 I'll try geography for $1,200.

1418
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,400
 I'll try geography for $1,200.

1419
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:23,400
 I'll try geography for $1,200.

1420
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,400
 Oh, it's New Mexico.

1421
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,400
 6,900 feet for New Mexico, for Santa Fe, only 5,200 for Denver.

1422
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,400
 Wow.

1423
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,400
 There you go.

1424
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,400
 Who knew?

1425
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,400
 Paul.

1426
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,400
 Initialism for $1,200.

1427
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,400
 What is CPR short for?

1428
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,400
 Cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

1429
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:38,400
 Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is just correct.

1430
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,400
 Wow.

1431
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,400
 I was thinking compression.

1432
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,400
 Yeah.

1433
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,400
 No.

1434
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,400
 Matt, you're up.

1435
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,400
 I have a-- I think I have a CPR card right here.

1436
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,400
 Yeah?

1437
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,400
 And you didn't know?

1438
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,400
 And I don't know what it is.

1439
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,400
 Did you ever suck face with Recessa Annie?

1440
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,400
 Yeah.

1441
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,400
 Yeah.

1442
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,400
 She knows how to do it.

1443
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,400
 She does.

1444
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,400
 Matt, you're up.

1445
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,400
 Geography, $2,000.

1446
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:14,400
 What African country recently became the second least populous country to qualify for the FIFA

1447
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,400
 World Cup?

1448
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,400
 Cape Verde?

1449
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,400
 Djibouti?

1450
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,400
 Iceland?

1451
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,400
 Or Togo?

1452
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,400
 Oh, man.

1453
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,400
 Go with Djibouti.

1454
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,400
 Go with Djibouti.

1455
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,400
 I've been watching Djibouti bounce all day.

1456
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,400
 Yeah.

1457
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,400
 Yeah.

1458
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,400
 This is $2,000.

1459
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,400
 So I'm going to pass.

1460
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,400
 That passes to me.

1461
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,400
 Man, I want to go Djibouti so bad.

1462
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,400
 Do it.

1463
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,400
 I want that Djibouti.

1464
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,400
 I want that Djibouti.

1465
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:42,400
 I kind of think it's Togo.

1466
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,400
 Yo.

1467
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,400
 All right.

1468
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,400
 It's going to be Djibouti, but I'm going Togo.

1469
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,400
 OK.

1470
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,400
 Nope.

1471
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,400
 It's neither.

1472
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,400
 Cape Verde.

1473
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,400
 Cape Verde.

1474
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,400
 An island nation west of Senegal near the Canary Islands.

1475
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,400
 Iceland is the least populous country to qualify for the World Cup.

1476
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,400
 So there you go.

1477
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,400
 OK.

1478
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,400
 It's me.

1479
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,400
 Man, I'm terrible right now.

1480
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,400
 I'll do multiple choice for $2,000.

1481
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:17,400
 Daily Double.

1482
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:22,400
 Frequently hidden in nativity scenes in Catalina, children search for--

1483
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,400
 Catalonia.

1484
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,400
 Catalonia.

1485
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,400
 Oh, Catalonia.

1486
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:30,400
 Children search for L--

1487
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,400
 Cogener?

1488
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,400
 OK.

1489
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:39,400
 Who is generally depicted as a peasant in a Catilian red cap doing what?

1490
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:44,400
 Breastfeeding, drinking wine, pooping, or sleeping.

1491
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,400
 Pooping, Giggles.

1492
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,400
 I think it is pooping.

1493
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,400
 Is there just-- in nativity scenes?

1494
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,400
 Yes.

1495
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,400
 Is there just a guy pooping in the background?

1496
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,400
 In certain places, it's a traditional thing.

1497
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,400
 It's like a where's Waldo kind of thing, but it's a pooping guy.

1498
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,400
 I'll go with you because I don't have any other guess on this.

1499
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,400
 So I'll say pooping.

1500
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,400
 It is pooping.

1501
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,400
 Yeah, told you.

1502
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:13,400
 Picture Chef Boyardee popping a squat with a conical turd below him.

1503
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,400
 Yeah.

1504
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,400
 Well, there you go.

1505
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:16,400
 Yeah.

1506
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,400
 It's the most wonderful time of the year.

1507
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,400
 It's the most wonderful turd of the year.

1508
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,400
 Just goes to show that even people who believe don't really believe.

1509
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,400
 Paul.

1510
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,400
 Initialism.

1511
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,400
 2000.

1512
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,400
 2000.

1513
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,400
 What is HIV short for?

1514
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:41,400
 Ruining the good mood of a podcast, am I right?

1515
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:46,400
 Oh, I believe it's human immunovirus.

1516
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,400
 You going with that?

1517
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,400
 Yeah.

1518
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,400
 All right.

1519
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,400
 I think that's correct.

1520
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,400
 Yeah.

1521
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,400
 Human immunodeficiency virus.

1522
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,400
 Yeah.

1523
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,400
 Yeah.

1524
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,400
 I think you're close enough.

1525
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,400
 I would say so.

1526
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:02,400
 Yeah.

1527
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,400
 Matt.

1528
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:08,400
 I will go with the most for 800, please.

1529
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,400
 Which of these countries has the most people?

1530
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:15,400
 Egypt, Ethiopia, Nigeria, or Tanzania?

1531
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,400
 Let's see here.

1532
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,400
 I know the population of Tanzania.

1533
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:22,400
 I just don't know the other three.

1534
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,400
 Right.

1535
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:24,400
 Right.

1536
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,400
 Pass.

1537
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,400
 Okay.

1538
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,400
 That passes to me.

1539
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,400
 I'm going to do my math out loud.

1540
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:34,400
 Egypt has a lot of people in it.

1541
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,400
 Ethiopia has a lot of people in it.

1542
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,400
 Nigeria, they've got a lot of people there.

1543
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,400
 Tanzania, boy, do they have a lot of people.

1544
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:50,400
 Egypt, A. It's Nigeria.

1545
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,400
 213 million.

1546
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,400
 Ethiopia, 120 million.

1547
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,400
 Egypt, 109 million.

1548
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:58,400
 Tanzania, 64 million.

1549
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,400
 We're really throwing off the curve today.

1550
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,400
 I'm losing a lot of money.

1551
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:01,400
 Paul's making a lot of money.

1552
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,400
 Yeah, baby.

1553
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,400
 Yeah.

1554
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:06,400
 The world is upside down.

1555
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,400
 Yeah.

1556
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,400
 Oh, I need points back.

1557
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,400
 I'll do the most for 2,000.

1558
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,400
 Which of these NHL franchises has won the most Stanley Cup titles?

1559
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:21,400
 The Bruins, the Maple Leaves, the Penguins, or the Red Wings.

1560
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,400
 Hmm.

1561
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:26,400
 I would like to use my 50/50.

1562
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,400
 Paul, which two answers are definitely not correct?

1563
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:32,400
 I would say Penguin.

1564
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,400
 Wait.

1565
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,400
 Is the one the most Stanley Cup titles?

1566
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,400
 Yeah.

1567
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,400
 Penguins are on my short list.

1568
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:41,400
 Penguins have like four.

1569
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,400
 The leaves, the most.

1570
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,400
 You think the leaves have the most?

1571
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,400
 I think it's either the leaves or the wings.

1572
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,400
 Yeah.

1573
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,400
 I'll say the Red Wings.

1574
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,400
 I'll say Detroit.

1575
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,400
 Nope.

1576
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,400
 It's the Maple Leaves.

1577
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,400
 It was the Leaves.

1578
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,400
 13.

1579
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,400
 Red Wings are 11.

1580
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,400
 It was the Maple Leaves.

1581
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,400
 Jacob continues losing points.

1582
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,400
 Paul.

1583
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,400
 I'll go with Initialism.

1584
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,400
 For 800.

1585
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,400
 What is IQ short for?

1586
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,400
 Intelligence Quotient.

1587
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,400
 Intelligence Quotient is correct.

1588
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,400
 Paul must have a very high IQ to know that indeed.

1589
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:22,400
 Yes, clearly very IQ-y.

1590
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,400
 Matt Donnelly, you got the most or multiple choice.

1591
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,400
 You have 400 points, by the way.

1592
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,400
 You're well ahead of me.

1593
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,400
 I have 5200 points in the negative.

1594
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,400
 And Paul has 4000 points.

1595
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,400
 So Paul is one order of magnitude ahead of you.

1596
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,400
 There is one daily double left.

1597
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,400
 Your only hope is that Paul gets it and loses.

1598
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,400
 Right.

1599
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,400
 A man can hope.

1600
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:46,400
 I will do multiple choice 1200, please.

1601
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,400
 Daily double!

1602
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:52,400
 Right off the bat!

1603
01:04:52,400 --> 01:05:03,400
 In the 2024 U.S. presidential election, what is the one state that Donald Trump won that he previously lost in both the 2016 and 2020 elections?

1604
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,400
 Arizona, Nevada, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.

1605
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,400
 Nevada, Tom.

1606
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:12,400
 My name is Jacob, but it is Nevada.

1607
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,400
 Nevada, Tom.

1608
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,400
 And Paul and Brett Mukai have been blamed for this.

1609
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,400
 For moving out of Nevada.

1610
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,400
 Two votes.

1611
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,400
 Slow down.

1612
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,400
 You don't know who they were voting for.

1613
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:28,400
 I'll go with multiple choice for 800.

1614
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:37,400
 The San Marzino tomato originated in the small town of San Marzino del Surro, which is located in which Italian region?

1615
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,400
 Calabria.

1616
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,400
 Campagna.

1617
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,400
 Sardina.

1618
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,400
 Or Sicily.

1619
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:47,400
 This, I talk about this all the time.

1620
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,400
 I talk about Italian tomatoes.

1621
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,400
 All types of Italian tomatoes.

1622
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:56,400
 Nobody loves Italian tomatoes more than I do.

1623
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:02,400
 And that is why I will go with A.

1624
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,400
 Which is incorrect.

1625
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,400
 It was B.

1626
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,400
 What is that?

1627
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:13,400
 Oh, the province of Salerno and the region of Campagna.

1628
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,400
 Oh, it was the region that threw me off.

1629
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,400
 That's what got me.

1630
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,400
 That's what got me.

1631
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,400
 I was in the wrong region.

1632
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,400
 Paul closing out the category and the game that he's already won the most.

1633
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:31,400
 For 1200, which of these major league baseball franchises has won the most World Series titles?

1634
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:35,400
 The Athletics, the Cardinals, the Phillies, the Pirates.

1635
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:43,400
 And I believe the answer was given in the question here when Smitty typed out this stupidity.

1636
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:50,400
 Because below that, it says Cardinals 11, Athletics 9, Pirates 5, and Phillies 2.

1637
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:58,400
 So, Paul, with all of that in mind, which of these MLB franchises won the most World Series titles?

1638
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:01,400
 Athletics, Cardinals, Phillies, or Pirates?

1639
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:06,400
 I'm going to have to go out on a wing and say Cardinals.

1640
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,400
 Oh man, I hope that those are just incorrect stats there.

1641
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,400
 That'd be funny.

1642
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:15,400
 They're not. It's the Cardinals. Paul gets more points.

1643
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:19,400
 That's the game. Thank you, Smitty Scoop.

1644
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,400
 I won one. I won one, Smitty.

1645
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:25,400
 Paul crushed it with 5200 points. Matt's in second with 1600.

1646
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,400
 I am in third with negative 6000. Jesus fuck.

1647
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,400
 I'm creeping towards the positive.

1648
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,400
 Now you know how I feel on most of those.

1649
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,400
 You are. Look at you go.

1650
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:39,400
 If you want to sit in the scooperty just like Smitty did there, head over to HeyScoops.com.

1651
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:42,400
 HeyScoops.com. You can head over there.

1652
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,400
 Make us a scooperty. Make us a Price of Skrite Jock vs. Nerd.

1653
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,400
 Make us an Obelisk Jock vs. Nerd.

1654
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:51,400
 All those things right over there at HeyScoops.com. Do it now. It'd be great.

1655
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:55,400
 All right. I want to thank all the people who support us over on our Patreon page.

1656
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,400
 We don't have a new list just yet.

1657
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:02,400
 But it's one of the things we're working on by streamlining some of the processes here.

1658
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,400
 We'll get our thank yous earlier in the month.

1659
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:10,400

 Or if you kind of look like Orson Welles, head over to fartsinabag.biz.

1664
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:56,400
 That's fartsinabag.biz that along with PreachingFun.com, it takes you over to our Patreon page,

 where for as little as $3 a month, you can help keep this show on the air.

1666
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,400
 We can't do this show without our Patreon subscribers.

1667
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:08,400
 So please, if you think this show is worth more than $0, PreachingFun.com, fartsinabag.biz.

1668
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:11,400
 You can go to both of them. Make two different accounts. We're fine with that.

1669
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:14,400
 Hey, don't forget, we're creeping up on the holidays.

1670
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:19,400
 What better gift than the gift of an ice cream social Patreon subscription?

1671
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,400
 You can give a yearly gift. Boom!

1672
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:26,400
 That loved one will receive our update emails every month.

1673
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:32,400
 They'll be getting the sticker digital art. They'll be getting my digital art.

1674
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:37,400
 They'll be getting candid shots of us, possibly, depending on what levels you join on to.

1675
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:41,400
 They can come in for the chats if you'll join in at a high enough tier.

1676
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:45,400
 There's all kinds of rewards and fun shit to get in on.

1677
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:51,400
 So give the gift to someone you love or treat yourself.

1678
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,400
 Yeah, treat yourself.

1679
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:56,400
 Treat yourself. I want to thank Penn for creating this podcast.

1680
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,400
 Thanks, Penn.

1681
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:00,400
 I want to thank all the scoops who could join us for today's broadcast here in our Zoom.

1682
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,400
 Yes. Lovely to see everyone.

1683
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:05,400
 Absolutely. And everybody over on Twitch as well.

1684
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:10,400
 That's right. And take care of yourselves. We love you and we'll see you soon.

1685
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,400
