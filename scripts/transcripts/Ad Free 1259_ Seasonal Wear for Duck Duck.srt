9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:01:02,080
 Yeah, I'd love to! Great, let's go! Woohoo! I'm down to the bone in San Antonio. Oh! Make

10
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:09,720
 the sound more fun than they are. I don't know if that's an expression or not. It's

11
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,200
 time for Matt Madley's Ice Cream Social, sitting in San Antonio, that's Matt Madley, sitting

12
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,440
 in Pittsburgh, that's Paul Madley, and in Las Vegas, it's me, Jacob the Audio Guy. We're

13
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:27,480
 pre-preachingfun. Paul, you get a lot of action on the World Series. Yeah, I made all my money

14
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:33,680
 back by betting on the team that spent umpteen bajillion dollars to get a Japanese man who

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:41,560
 is an unparalleled phenomenon to just stand up there and do everything for them. That was

16
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,560
 a surprisingly knowledgeable breakdown of the World Series, Paul. I mean, you can't

17
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:54,160
 deny Shohei Atani. That guy is a once in a generation talent. I know, but now you blew

18
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:02,120
 it because it was Yamamoto who was the hero of the World Series. Who? Different Japanese

19
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,400
 player. We are back in the correct universe on the right podcast. Hey Johnny, do you want

20
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,280
 to go to an ice cream social? We'll just start it over, here we go. Paul, you know who you're

21
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:16,160
 talking about, right? All right, great. Back to one, everyone. Shohei Atani was amazing,

22
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,720
 but in game seven, he really couldn't hold up on short rest and he was taking that again.

23
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:28,480
 He had two hits, I think. I think so, something like that. He only won them four out of the

24
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,360
 five games they needed. He's an incredible player, but they gave the MVP to Yamamoto.

25
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:41,160
 Oh really? Yes. Different pitcher, he came in and played really well. They were all on

26
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:48,520
 short rest. Like the Super Bowl, I made a lot of bets on the World Series this year.

27
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:57,520
 I think I had 12 different bets going. Like the Super Bowl, I somehow lost all of them.

28
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:06,440
 I didn't win a single bet out of all of my bets. Not one. And I had a range of bets,

29
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,640
 but not a single one. I had weird bets, I had normal bets. Yeah, I had everything. I

30
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:22,640
 had parlays, I had singles. Not a one. I'm bad at that. Well, you should know that I

31
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,160
 was talking to my friend Ryre about making different Marvel character cards for me as

32
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:34,240
 a magician because increasingly, I literally am going to stop doing this intro of my trick

33
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:40,240
 with baseball cards, saying who likes baseball? Because the answer increasingly is no one.

34
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:47,080
 There's very few people. No one. Nothing like starting a trick off with a light smattering

35
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,560
 of applause. I just heard the latest episode of Player One just dropped and Phil was remarking

36
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,680
 how his son came to him, his 13-year-old son, just the other day and said, "Dad, what's

37
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,240
 the World Series?" Oh, man. Also, my kids came home, right? I got them psyched up in

38
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,120
 the morning. You know what tonight is? Game seven. All teams of one, three games each,

39
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,560
 blah, blah. And my youngest, as fancy as himself, a Dodgers fan out of nowhere. I think his

40
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,320
 probably his friend in school likes the Dodgers. We've watched zero games. Yeah, yeah. They're

41
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,960
 close to us. They're fine. When I was at game seven of the World Series, this is the time

42
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,400
 to watch, right? Yeah. So they're playing with their friends. They're not home in time.

43
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,400
 I'm watching the game by myself. Finally, they're ready to come home. I picked them

44
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,560
 up from their friend's house. It is like the ninth inning and I go like, "It's the ninth

45
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,720
 inning of game seven and the Dodgers have come back." They were down four to one. Now

46
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,200
 it's four to three. And they go like, "Cool." And they watch for like five minutes and then

47
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,600
 one says to the other, "Do you want to play basketball?" And they go, "Yeah." And they

48
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,920
 get up and they go outside in the middle of the ninth inning and go play basketball. And

49
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,720
 I was like, "Mother." And then I just started making them dinner or whatever. And then it

50
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:06,360
 goes into extra innings. So then I'm now serving them dinner during the extra innings and now

51
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,360
 they're interested because we're sitting and eating. Right. And now they're all in. And

52
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:16,040
 then it ends up being a very exciting finish and they were like amazed. And to them, they

53
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,600
 had an amazing game seven memory with dad of watching the end of the World Series. And

54
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:27,400
 to me, I was just like... They started watching it around like the eleventh inning. Exactly.

55
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:34,720
 I watched 10 innings without them. And then they came in, just top roped it at the end

56
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,640
 there. I like that your memory of watching this World Series and their memory of watching

57
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:48,320
 this World Series are going to be very different, but involve each other. Yeah. But yeah, so

58
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,200
 I literally last night, I do this thing where I put baseball cards in a bucket and I have

59
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,920
 this pole and I bring it out to the people. And I just had like five people shake their

60
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:05,160
 head no with me. I didn't want anything to do with the baseball cards. Yeah. And I was

61
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,600
 like, you know, it's the first and the last name, right? Like we're not, it's not like...

62
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,060
 You don't have to be a baseball fan to participate in this trick. You're not going to be called

63
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:19,840
 into the baseball fan's court tomorrow to sign an affidavit about your ability to love

64
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:26,720
 and admire every baseball player. So annoying. Baseball fan's court. I was doing a show last

65
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,900
 night, it was Tuesday and saw a smaller crowd, which is fine. I'm out in San Antonio, seven

66
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:45,480
 nights a week for the old Magic Saloon out here. And so I'm doing the show, it's a light

67
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,840
 energy, it's like a weird energy, right? Cause it's not that full. It's a big space. And

68
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:57,800
 so... Oh yeah. And I'm experiencing what we're talking about here. And I finally was like,

69
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,400
 I literally was like, "Hey, I'm sorry. You're at a magic show. You're going to need to like,

70
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,240
 I don't know, do stuff. Like you might have to read a thing or pick a card or like get

71
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,800
 up and touch a thing or say a thing. And I know that this is a burden. I know that this

72
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,800
 is outside your comfort zone. I know you all came in here expecting to be comfortable jurists

73
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:24,800
 sitting in the back and mildly observing magic from afar. And I apologize that only 20 some

74
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,040
 out of you have showed up. I'm going to need you to get outside your comfort zone and maybe

75
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:37,800
 do a thing." Yeah. And I get this big laugh. And then I mess with a kid with my rope routine.

76
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,120
 And then I feel like, "Oh good." Even though it's a small crowd, they're eating out of

77
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:50,040
 my hands. I got them. And then I finished arm chopper routine. I go into looking for

78
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:55,960
 a couple and as I asked for a couple, six people get up and just leave. Oh. Walk out.

79
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:03,160
 Okay. Shit. I wasn't ready for that part of the story. Neither was I, Jacob. Cause I felt

80
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,440
 like I had won the crowd back. Right? Like if I lose, if I don't have an audience with

81
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,280
 me and something, and then someone I was like, okay, I'm having that bad night. When you

82
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,720
 feel like you've done the right thing. Right. And then they're still like, nevermind. And

83
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,240
 when it goes from 26 people, they all looked at each other and said, "Hey, you want to

84
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:29,280
 go outside and play basketball?" Yeah. They go from 26 people down to 20 people. It hurts

85
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,620
 the energy of the room, so to speak. It's a notable percentage. I was really in my head

86
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:43,320
 finishing my show. Oh no. And afterwards, someone goes, "Oh no. Those six people are

87
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:49,400
 friends with one of the women who work here." And they came by to visit because they had

88
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,680
 dinner reservations and she invited them to watch the show and they said yes, but then

89
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:00,040
 they had to leave because they had dinner reservations at eight o'clock. There you go.

90
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,040
 Wish you could have made that clearer to the magician on stage. I was like, do you understand?

91
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,540
 That I met all the reasons of the world. I was like, oh, they did say this, but then

92
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:14,600
 you said that. And so I figured, do you understand the difference between people leaving because

93
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,920
 they had an obligation versus people leaving because they were upset with the show matters

94
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:26,080
 tremendously to the performer? The only thing I want is for the audience to not actively

95
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,600
 hate me and leave. It's really at the top of my list. And possibly leave a negative

96
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,480
 social media review that reflects on the theater that I'm playing and all this other stuff.

97
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,440
 Was there a moment before they left that you thought could have triggered them? No. Just

98
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,160
 so that the energy was, it was a low energy room, right? It was simply that. Like I was

99
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,280
 just saying, well, you did have the new, you had the new bit in the baseball card thing,

100
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:54,280
 right? Where you pulled out your own bat. Yeah. I just, I just showed it off. I did

101
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:00,360
 helicopter it around a little bit. I did tap my penis on Mickey Mantle like I do. And then

102
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:10,840
 boom, it becomes Ichiro Suzuki. The most magic one. Ladies and gentlemen, foreskin Joe Jackson.

103
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:20,120
 Yes, I did put as many baseballs as possible into my foreskin. Oh God. It turns out the

104
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:28,700
 answer is six, six baseballs into his foreskin. This is a, this is a, an old baseball folk

105
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:37,000
 song that I play being Crosby. And I say, this is my sack of oranges. Jokes on them

106
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,840
 cause they're red when they come out because of the blood. I actually had like one of my

107
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,680
 quickest jokes ever. I tried to say one was named. She was like, you're wrong. You're

108
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,480
 completely wrong. And I said, I'm giving me your name. She was foreign. I said, well

109
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:55,560
 then break it down for me. And then she goes pre and I go pre and she goes, oh, I go pre

110
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:01,080
 ush and she goes, yeah. I go, oh, that's like Sean Connery driving electric car. Yeah,

111
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,520
 that's a good one. Yeah. That's right. That's real good. I was like, no one can walk out

112
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,920
 on that. You can't walk out on that show on a Prish. It turns out that was incorrect.

113
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:19,500
 Prish. No, some of that leaf. What the fuck you, what the room manager was like, Hey,

114
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,320
 I know the energy was weird tonight. I'm going to fill a show report. Is there anything you

115
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:31,880
 want in the show report? I said, maybe if we're welcoming guests via staff, they should

116
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:38,600
 stay for the whole show. Right. Maybe that should be a policy or sit inconspicuously

117
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,680
 in the back where it is a place where they could sneak out easily or something at the

118
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:48,360
 very least. Yeah. Or just give me a really big heads up about it. Yeah. Maybe a whiteboard

119
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,920
 in the back that you can see where if anybody leaves, they write down the reason that they're

120
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,960
 leaving on their way out. I would have wrote it into the show. I would have found a gag.

121
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:03,720
 Yeah. You know, like I'm not going to work with a couple. If anyone feels like that,

122
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,480
 that marriage is rigged and for the government, please leave now. Well, that was a combo of

123
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,840
 situations, right? I mean, that's, you know, when it rains, it pours. You get weird energy

124
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:18,400
 lighthouse, a couple of people bail in the middle. It's like, what the fuck? Yeah. Yeah.

125
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:24,240
 I mean, you could look at it and say these people are leaving because they have dinner

126
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,240
 reservations. Uh, and so it's really not that bad of a thing. Uh, you could also look at

127
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,600
 it and say this magic show could have been so good that they could have decided to not

128
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:40,640
 go to dinner, but they didn't. Right. It'd be amazing if they hard sold it and got to

129
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:47,800
 be like, honestly, that is enough magic. Like that was incredible. That was plenty. I don't

130
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:54,160
 want to taint it with another trick. I saw perfection. Jacob, I'm afraid that the only

131
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,480
 thing that I can do now is like magic less, so I should leave. I'm speaking purely for

132
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:09,120
 myself here, but a free magic show would have to be nigh miraculous for me to not want to

133
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:16,360
 go get food instead. It would have to be, it would have to be something on the level

134
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:22,880
 of like, Oh, that lady just apparated through a wall and, and ate her own shit and threw

135
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:29,960
 a monkey 50,000 feet in the air. And, and, and then a bomb went off, you know, if I cannot

136
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:37,280
 find your food, I will hand you a one foot roast beef. So then you hang in the balance.

137
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:44,580
 Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Are we talking like a subway sandwich? What would be the

138
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:48,280
 meal of dangle for you, Paul? What would be the meal that I'd have to hold back as a magician

139
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:53,520
 to make you stick around, make me stick around? Oh, you might win this meal. Oh, a Bobby.

140
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,080
 What about a Bobby? Bobby would, would probably work. I mean, there's a lot of stuff that

141
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:04,640
 would work. Uh, like a fresh, a fresh bowl of chicken and dumplings. Oh Lord. Let's go.

142
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:14,400
 Oh, I went to a place last night. Yeah. It had a South West chicken and dumpling soup.

143
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:21,600
 So it had like corn and beans in it. Yeah. Yeah. I'm in, I'm in, in, in the most delicious

144
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,240
 soups I've ever had. That sounds really good. The found the Foundry San Antonio's oldest

145
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:36,000
 bar Oscar who works here. Yeah. Yeah. I, uh, had the day open yesterday. So I got me a

146
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,960
 rental car and I bolted down to our friend, Brian brushwoods compound over in Austin. Oh

147
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:47,160
 yes. Yeah. And I was like, I can't wait to sit in on great night with my pals, Justin

148
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:53,800
 and Brian and Justin Robert Young was occupied. He decided that he needed to be in Washington,

149
00:14:53,800 --> 00:15:00,720
 DC or something on election day and couldn't be dinner reservations. It was an event. It

150
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:07,560
 was an event with six friends, six friends in San Antonio. It was an eventful day. You

151
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:14,200
 passed him on the freeway. Uh, uh, so, uh, Brian's like, yeah, no, I just couldn't make

152
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,760
 it. This is perfect. So you can do great. And I was like, okay, well good. You could

153
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:22,080
 have told me ahead of time. I thought it was just going to be the two of us. But I, if

154
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,200
 you listen to this episode of great night, it's just me once again, trying to keep up

155
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:32,840
 with Brian brushwood. Uh, uh, he is a very intellectual and, uh, and, and, and smart person.

156
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:40,720
 And so it's me doing my best to keep up with him. Uh, we're doing it. I am, uh, it's going

157
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:50,360
 from covert to overt, but I am trying to coax Brian out of retirement as a magic performer.

158
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:58,000
 Ah, I, I, his kids are starting to grow up. All the reasons why he stayed home are starting,

159
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,920
 you know, it's trying to go away and he, his stuff is so original and different and is

160
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:12,760
 not performed by anybody else. No. And, uh, I, I'm, I am slowly trying to coax him into

161
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:18,760
 just to maybe doing a live event or two. Maybe we can get a, a straight magic performance

162
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:24,320
 from him at scoop fest next year or two years. He did. Right. Uh, how many years ago? A long

163
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:32,400
 time ago. Yeah. Um, and, uh, yeah, I'm trying to, I'm trying to figure it out. I think we

164
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,640
 should try to play comedy clubs. I don't think it's trying to play theaters. That's my, this

165
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:41,640
 is my pitch to him. Are you, you're, so you're pitching a duo thing? I think so. Yeah. You're

166
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,760
 not just pitching that he should go out on tour, uh, separate from you. Oh, no, no, no.

167
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:51,240
 Yeah. No. Self-interest involved completely. Yeah. Yeah. Great. Yeah. Cause as you know,

168
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,920
 I discussed this, uh, you know, I talked to a friend who's a manager and said, you know,

169
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,080
 what does it take to play comedy clubs? And they're like, well, if you have 500,000 YouTube

170
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,040
 subscribers or stuff like that, that helps and blah, blah, blah, blah. And so I'm trying

171
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,440
 to build up all my stuff with social media. And then I looked and I was like, wait, Brian

172
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,360
 Burschman has two channels that are over a million subscribers. Yeah. Also, I feel like

173
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:19,160
 he's very funny and we haven't seen him do his thing in a while. So I was like, I dunno.

174
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:25,720
 So, uh, I've, I've got him. He's, he's, he's harrumping about it. I believe I left him

175
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:34,080
 going like, oh, that would be a life change kind of thing. We'll see. We'll see. We'll

176
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,940
 see. But I had a really bad, Brian, I think you should do it. I think it'd be great. One

177
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:47,620
 vote for yes. Yep. Brian, I talked to your kids. They want you to do it too. Uh, Rodimus

178
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,480
 scoop is already saying that Josie and the beta cucks could be the live touring band

179
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:59,280
 with your act. That works. All right. That'd be work. That would work. Yep. No, but we

180
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,960
 need to do it. I would love to do it as a one-off as an experiment. And if it could

181
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,120
 grow into something that happened more often than, you know, do all kinds of things like

182
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,840
 add, do you add Paul to the mix for an improv set? All kinds of stuff. I'd love it. I'd

183
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,640
 love it. Do you think that, um, that Bonnie is the, is the big tripping point because

184
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,080
 of, uh, Bonnie's hatred for you? Do you think that could be a part of it? She just doesn't

185
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,280
 want me in charge of the meals. Uh, she just wants to make sure that Brian's eating salads

186
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:34,960
 and stuff like that. Sarah's married to that guy. Jesus. She basically said, don't eat

187
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:45,320
 all of Brian's food. If I go, she said, don't. Now, Matt, Brian needs to eat too. You take

188
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:58,160
 care of him on the road. Food for Brian. Hashtag Brian eats first. You know who else eats first

189
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,880
 before Brian brushwood. And that is the following sponsor. Today's show, man, man is ice cream

190
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:10,480
 social is brought to you by, Oh man. I just got a text as I went to look for the commercial

191
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:18,800
 thing and distracting. Nope. I'm back on board. This is from chasing the dragon in 2025 rim

192
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:25,160
 Tobin's three day course on infinite wealth, extreme health and super sexiness. That's

193
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:32,680
 rim Tobin's three day course on infinite wealth, extreme health and super sexiness. I feel

194
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:41,840
 like this is a bit on Jim Jobin. Oh, it must be. It's a rim Tobin here. I'd like to advise

195
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,900
 you on how you can make your life better, faster and stronger in every single way. Are

196
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:53,560
 you looking for that perfect sexual partner? Are you hunting for that great job that will

197
00:19:53,560 --> 00:20:01,200
 bring you wealth, but also give you time for a life work balance? Hmm. Are you also looking

198
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:08,040
 to get a 90 foot penis? Hmm. I can do all of these things. Yes. The 90 foot penis is

199
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:13,300
 the number one thing. First get the 90 foot penis. Everything else falls into place. If

200
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:18,740
 you get a 90 foot penis, then you will get a job. Someone will hire you to be the guy

201
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:23,960
 with the 90 foot penis. You can stand at the top of a mountain and drop the 90 foot penis

202
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,520
 down and people will just watch it. Right. And people will pay you. And that will be

203
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:34,600
 your job. Now, as far as sexual gratification, the 90 foot penis is very difficult to actually

204
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,600
 get erect. That's what people won't tell you about the 90 foot penis. It's really hard

205
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:47,640
 to get enough blood into a 90 foot penis to get it erect. It's not impossible though.

206
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:53,280
 It's not impossible. What we've figured out is that I don't fuck people. I repel them.

207
00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:01,080
 No, we can use. Like, you know, we talked about slap cooking a chicken. Well, this could

208
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:10,040
 be used for that. You can just whip that clip. Boom. 90 foot. Oops. Oops. How did you cook

209
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:16,320
 this chicken via mushroom stamp? Two problems. Two problems with the 90 foot penis. First

210
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:25,900
 of all, it is nearly needle thick. So girth, girth is gone. Girth is completely gone. It's

211
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:33,880
 been straight to those taffy strings. Yes. It looks like, it looks like basically somebody

212
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:41,600
 pulled out hair gel and just kept going. I knew when the genie winked, I would regret

213
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:50,440
 my decision. That's it. So it's, it's, there is no girth at all. It's sort of like one

214
00:21:50,440 --> 00:22:04,800
 of those filaments that they use for optic cable. So that's problem number one. The problem

215
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,880
 number two, of course, if you do get hard, it will exsanguinate your entire body. If

216
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,240
 you're not here, buckle up. Cause we know there are 11 problems. That's the things we

217
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:19,440
 have to explain away. 11 problems with this. There are only two, only two problems. Only

218
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:26,840
 two. They didn't pay for enough ad space for a left fiber optic thickness and exsanguination.

219
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:38,760
 That's it. Rim Tobin. It's a checkout. That made me think of, of the mummy and the skexies.

220
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,600
 And I guess there's going to be another mummy movie, which is exciting to me. Oh, starring

221
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,200
 Brendan Fraser, Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz. Oh, they're bringing back the original

222
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,400
 team. They're both on, they're both on board. I was definitely being sarcastic. They're

223
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,300
 actually bringing it back though. They're bringing them back. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. They're

224
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:01,100
 not going to continue that, uh, that Tom Cruise mummy, uh, movie thing that they tried that

225
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,600
 one time that whole thing, Tom Cruise, like rewrote the whole thing in editing and that

226
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,920
 it was just really not understandable at all. Dark universe did not take off. What were

227
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:16,000
 the three movies in that dark universe that just all fell to shit? We don't know what

228
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,280
 you're talking about. I have no idea what you're talking about. That was their whole

229
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,080
 plan. Uh, it was a universal monster reboot. They were trying to do a Marvel superheroes

230
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,360
 thing. They called it dark universe. Oh, that's right. And so we're going to do all of the

231
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:33,080
 classic universal stuff. So it was mummy. I forgot about that. It was mummy and Wolfman,

232
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:40,920
 which was Benicio del Toro. And then what was the one with, uh, fighting round the world?

233
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:49,600
 What's his fucking name? Oh, uh, Russell Crowe, Guy Ritchie. No, Russell Crowe, Guy Ritchie.

234
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,280
 Russell Crowe fighting around the world. I'm Russell Crowe. I was like, I thought it was

235
00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:00,160
 Piff the Magic Dragon for a second. No, it was Russell Crowe. Russell Crowe did, which

236
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:08,800
 one did he do? I don't know, but you just keep laying these out. We're not in this part

237
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,640
 of the cinematic world. Anyway, it might, he might've also been in the Wolfman thing.

238
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,800
 I don't fucking know. But anyway, they only got two or three of them down. Um, oh, he

239
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,280
 was hide in the mummy. That's it. Okay. So he was going to be a Jekyll and Hyde, but

240
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:27,920
 it never happened. Anyway. Yeah. It all just shit. They'd all fell apart real fast. These

241
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:33,980
 people trying to make these big, you know, cinematic universes. It's lightning in a bottle.

242
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,360
 We talked about it before. You're never going to get the same thing that Marvel got, which

243
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:44,000
 is not going to happen. Well, I, this, you know, uh, people complain about superheroes

244
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,240
 and blah, blah, blah, blah. The bottom line is that like what, like years from now we're

245
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:55,280
 studying films from Iron Man to end game will be one of the greatest achievements of a movie

246
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:01,640
 studio ever. Oh, it's incredible. But they, they did more and more success with that run

247
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:07,340
 of films than most movie studios ever have. Yeah. And they were the first thing of like,

248
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,180
 Oh, would it be cool if all these movies built up to one big movie with all of the stars

249
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:14,640
 and stuff? And it just, it just never was able to be pulled off. But you're seeing a

250
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,840
 lot of different types of movies come out now, you know? So, you know, even with your

251
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,840
 horrors on from your centers to your weapons, at first we thought horror movies were done

252
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,080
 because no one was going to see them. But now they seem to be punching up. And now you're

253
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,680
 just seeing, you know, weird movies, like a one battle after another. And then, you

254
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,440
 know, whatever the Channing Tatum with a guy had stuck inside the store movies coming out.

255
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:42,120
 Like we're seeing like real swings for like different types of movies. Well, man, see

256
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:49,860
 the Aziz and Zari Keanu Reeves movie. Oh yeah. I did see something. Oh, and what's his name's

257
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:58,560
 in that too, right? Seth Rogen. Seth Rogen. Yeah. I am, I'm sorry to say, Matt, that first

258
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:05,680
 movie I've seen in forever in the theaters I saw with you. And unfortunately our contribution

259
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:11,200
 to that film's box office numbers did not, did not move the needle. Well, fortunately

260
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,400
 our contribution to that film's box office is measurable. Yeah, I guess that's true.

261
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,160
 They can count our dollars. The math is easy to do. They can absolutely count our dollars.

262
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:26,600
 We know how much we contributed to that box office. Good Lord. On a percentage level we

263
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,720
 can measure what we did. That movie lost so much fucking money. Well, it came out on the

264
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,760
 month where everyone dumps movies. Right. But like this is the worst October in recorded

265
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:42,520
 history or something like that. Yeah. So yeah. If you look at what it takes to make people

266
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,840
 go to the movie theaters. Oh yeah. That's what I'm saying. Like I don't ever go anywhere.

267
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,840
 I haven't seen none of the boxes. I haven't gone in front. Holy shit. I'm looking up the

268
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:58,360
 numbers on Springs. They deliver me from nowhere right now. Uh huh. Yeah. It's a bad one. The

269
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:09,400
 latest dailies, the, the opening day was $8.8 million. Yeah. That's a lot of money, not

270
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:15,320
 for a major film. What did it cost, Jacob? That was $8.8 million over almost 3,500 theaters.

271
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,400
 You know, they should have done, you know, like, like Kevin Smith did with Red State.

272
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:24,200
 I can't find budget yet. I'm looking for budget. Yes. You know, Kevin Smith at first just went

273
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,880
 out and did screenings and Q&A and sold tickets that were higher than movie price tickets to go

274
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,520
 just to kind of check that out. And then once it made. He did a big podcast junket on that

275
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,880
 one. He was on like a Corolla's podcast when it was brand new back in the day promoting that. Yeah,

276
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,920
 you're right. Like Springsteen, if you noticed, he showed up everywhere to promote this movie.

277
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,480
 Every event that they had, he should have played a few songs and people went nuts and all that

278
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:57,880
 stuff. They should have done like a marquee theater tour of the, of the, of the movie.

279
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:04,200
 And then you have Springsteen there. He gets to talk with more humor and three-dimensionality

280
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,520
 about his battles with oppression. And then we don't feel like we just watched one giant downer.

281
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,640
 You know what I think? I think they should have made a different movie.

282
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,560
 I, you already know I would have rewrote the movie.

283
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:21,560
 I mean, it was shit compared to, compared to what you've told me about him. Even just like,

284
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:28,280
 Matt has told better stories about Bruce Springsteen. As soon as, as soon as

285
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:33,560
 he told me that that lady was an amalgamation, I'm like, get the fuck out of here.

286
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:38,200
 That's it. I don't understand. I don't understand at all. Like, oh, I'm going to make up this lady

287
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:44,200
 that I had a relationship with and I'm going to come out looking like a fucking bag of dicks.

288
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:50,280
 I'm going to look worse than almost anyone in filmic history. That relationship, he just looks

289
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:56,280
 like garbage. There's a legendary story of Jersey boys when they're trying to get it made, right?

290
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:03,240
 And they sent a script over to Frankie Valley and didn't hear from him for a while. And then finally

291
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,520
 they tracked him down and were like, Frankie, we were trying to get you, you know, we're trying to

292
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,360
 get the final sign off on this version, you know, the script for the, for the musical.

293
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:16,920
 And he goes, uh, you can't do it. And they said, what? And he goes, you can't, you can't,

294
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:21,960
 you can't make this musical. And they said, why? And he goes, cause some of the stuff in it,

295
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,280
 I don't, I don't, I don't like. And they go, what don't you like? We'll change it. And he goes,

296
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:32,120
 I don't know. And they're like, what do you mean? You don't know. And they go, you guys faxed it

297
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:38,200
 over. My wife read it first. She saw stuff in there she didn't like, and she shredded it and

298
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:47,080
 put it in the garbage. Oh boy. Do you think that's what happened? Frankie Valley's wife

299
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,960
 shredded this script before Bruce could read it. I'm saying someone should have said that movie

300
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:58,680
 script to Patty Ski Alpha before Bruce got to read it is what I'm saying. Well, uh, Philip,

301
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:04,200
 the SC scoop is saying they should have Muppets in it. I think if you went back and reshot the

302
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:11,400
 Bruce elements or just did away, found a way to CG Kermit in for Bruce, man, it could be really,

303
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:17,960
 really funny. That would be a knock down hilarious movie. If it's just Kermit being Bruce. Yeah.

304
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:23,640
 Just Kermit the frog going through all that shit. Oh my dad hit me. Oh God. The managers,

305
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:32,440
 both Bunsen and Beaker. Oh boy. No, it has to be from this eight track cassette. You don't

306
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:41,000
 understand the sound just isn't there. It just isn't there. Oh, I'm sorry. Piggy. I have to leave

307
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:48,920
 you here next to the dishwasher and move to California. There's no way. Oh, ow. You bitch.

308
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,760
 I'm leaving this one. Dishwasher crumples billows with smoke. Gonzo pops out of the top

309
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:00,760
 with a chicken. You guys don't understand that the artistic force behind Nebraska.

310
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:06,760
 Uh, so far all of the electric mayhem is basically out of focus in the studio.

311
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:11,400
 Yeah, nobody would care. No,

312
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:18,680
 doesn't seem to bother anyone at all. Listen to someone who's still down about $25 million right

313
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:23,640
 now with the worldwide gross, uh, not counting advertising budget. So far they've lost about

314
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,400
 $25 million and flying in, putting a Bruce for all these public appearances. Probably doesn't cost

315
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:34,920
 that much. That's probably very inexpensive, but, uh, as someone who is this huge Springsteen fan,

316
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:45,080
 I, uh, it did cause the release of this Nebraska 82 album, which is great. It is awesome. It's a four

317
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:52,280
 disc album. And one of them is just him re-recording the entire thing with his voice as it is now as an

318
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:57,000
 old man. Yeah. Hey, little pig, is your daddy home? Did he go and leave you all alone? It's my favorite

319
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:04,120
 thing that I've listened to in a while. Is the current- I got a bad desire. Oh, Fuzzy's fired.

320
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:11,720
 Sorry, Fuzzy. Hey there, Scooter. Is it time for work? You better tell us on time, you jerk. Oh,

321
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:20,600
 yeah. I got a bad desire. What do you call the East Street band selling Christmas decorations around

322
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:28,040
 the holidays? I don't know. Tell me, big man. Bruce Springsteen. Waka, waka, waka. That's pretty good.

323
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:36,360
 That's, that's, that joke alone is better than the movie. Matt Donnelly has a better Fozzie the Bear

324
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:42,120
 impression than I would have guessed. It's really good. It's very solid. Very solid Fozzie. Yeah.

325
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:46,360
 Well, it would make sense that he would have a good Fozzie to my Kermit. That's right. That's true.

326
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,640
 There you go. That's right. Now we, now we have another bit we can do in our shows.

327
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:55,400
 Now if we play Pollywood Squares, I'll pop over into one of those squares.

328
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:01,640
 No, Miss Piggy wouldn't have put up with Bruce's shit. That's right. Oh, yeah. First time he's like,

329
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:06,360
 I'm depressing not answering the calls. Miss Piggy be kicking in that door and karate chopping a four

330
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:18,920
 track slayer. I'm out of here, frog. I have things to do. This is bullshit. I mean, as we listen,

331
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:24,520
 I don't know how many more people tuned into this, this, this, uh, this zoom. I'm much more famous

332
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:33,160
 than I was, uh, yesterday. What happened? I went on San Antonio live and performed a magic trick

333
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:38,280
 for the morning host. Oh, that's nice. How did it go? You did the, you did the whole, uh, this was

334
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:43,800
 like a, uh, like a morning, uh, you know, good morning, whatever town show type thing. Good morning

335
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:49,320
 San Antonio. It's San Antonio live is a good morning San Antonio show. And, uh, it's my second

336
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,920
 time doing it. The first time I didn't talk about on there cause I basically almost fucked up both

337
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:57,400
 tricks I did. And, uh, it just was like, it just was pretty, pretty mediocre appearance, except that

338
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:04,680
 I was funny and did help sell out the rest of the week cause I was funny. Um, uh, uh, this time,

339
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:09,160
 is this your card? You're doing the cups and balls, sir. So what they do is they have you come on and

340
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:13,400
 do like the, Hey, if you have like a quick teaser trick and do a quick trick and then go to commercial

341
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:19,080
 break and then do a real trick with you when you come back. Right. Okay. And so, uh, last time,

342
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,560
 uh, I was there, I had like, uh, what I thought was a quick trick and they were going to like a

343
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:29,960
 mega tease and they were going to do like me plus someone there for a dog shelter, plus someone there

344
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:36,520
 advertising their new store or something like that in town. Right. And so we're all lined up and I'm

345
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:42,040
 doing this card trick as fast as I can. And, uh, suddenly I'm taking up all the time and, uh, they

346
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,560
 have to, I get, I get, I get the punch line of the trick in just the last second. They cut the

347
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,280
 commercial and I just stare at the person who's been just holding this giant dog in their arms.

348
00:34:50,280 --> 00:35:03,560
 So sorry. And so Matt adopted that dog out of guilt. So now Matt has a Mr. Piffles.

349
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,560
 So this time I'm there and I have this like pencil, I can put a pencil through a bill and

350
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,560
 it looks like I rip it and put a hole in it and boom, boom, boom. It's all, it's all, it's the,

351
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:16,440
 the dollar is fine. Right. But I literally was like, uh, uh,

352
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:22,760
 turned to my friend Mia, who drove me down to the route, the manager here, uh, I said, time me on

353
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,720
 this. And, and I did it as fast as I could. And she's like 28 seconds. And I was like, well, I

354
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:36,040
 won't do it that fast on air. Cause I'll try to talk. So that one's out. Ah, the time for the old

355
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:45,720
 miracle third harmonica sound. Perfect. I just grabbed her little index card. She's reading her

356
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,120
 facts off me and I made it magically sound like harmonica. I handed it back to her. We went to

357
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:56,600
 commercial break. No problem. This is a nice and easy. I get down there, Brian, I, it turns out

358
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:01,800
 Brian brushwood is about to start selling the harmonica trick, the invisible harmonica trick

359
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:10,040
 on, and I, and I literally, cause I, cause I need one of these. He was like, uh, and so I, I just

360
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,120
 talked to him today and he's like, he's like, Hey, are you willing to film a testimonial? I was like,

361
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,320
 am I? I've just been doing, I've been doing a testimonial for some magic trick for months.

362
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:25,960
 The fact that you could profit from it's even better. Yeah. Um, I think it's funny because the

363
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,480
 reason why Brian might be selling this probably because it's growing popularity. And I really

364
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:35,320
 think I am instrumental in the popularity of this magic trick. You were definitely,

365
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:42,760
 you have created a cult following for this magic trick for sure. Like I don't often take credit

366
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,520
 for things, but this one is like, I definitely blew it up at magic live and sold it out at magic

367
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:51,240
 live. And that's got to have created a wave of people using it or talking about it in magic

368
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:56,520
 circles that something they're using, looking for more, uh, places to sell it. And they approached

369
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:05,160
 Brian. So, uh, new business idea, every magic live, Matt decides what new trick is going to

370
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:12,280
 be the huge new seller. And we then sell said trip at Donnelly, the king maker. Yeah.

371
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:17,560
 This one looks like your nose is made out of rubber and it stretches out and snaps back.

372
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:24,520
 All right. Like a rubber booger. You pull a stretchy booger out of your nose. Stretchy

373
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:39,560
 booger is the worst clown I ever hired. Oh, stretchy booger. That was out of your pants.

374
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:47,800
 I know I'm working on a new material. Oh, what? I'm afraid that you've moved on from snot to some

375
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:55,000
 other kind of material for skin for skin. Oh, yours is more like five skin. Did you have some

376
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,640
 kind of 90 foot penis going on in there? Good Lord. Yes, but it's very thin. Oh yes. I see.

377
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:06,680
 Oh, oh, I have to make a long distance phone call. Can I use some of your fiber optic cock?

378
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:17,080
 Don't get roaming charges. Oh, that's the least of my worries with your wiener.

379
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:24,440
 Uh, you know, who else thinks I have a dirty wiener? That's the following sponsor.

380
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:30,360
 Today's show, Matt and Manny's ice cream social is brought to you by big Jerry's house of hoarding.

381
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:36,920
 That's right. Store all your collectibles with me, big Jerry. That's from dead Laszlo in 2022.

382
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:48,200
 Hey everybody, this is big Jerry. How's it going? Somebody bring me some more, more cake. Hey, anyway.

383
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:58,600
 Come on over to my house of hoarding. I've got nothing but places to put stuff and places to

384
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:03,960
 leave it. If you got something you don't want anymore in your house, come on and bring it to

385
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:13,080
 by. It'll be fine. Oh, I just had a bunch of magazines fall over and kill another cat.

386
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:19,800
 And her hay scoops to check out. That was my cat.

387
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:35,320
 Big Jerry. It's big guy. Big Jerry. So I, uh, did, uh, a bit I did, but I do close up, which is, uh,

388
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:40,040
 look for, it's one of those, one of my favorite kinds of tricks for you. Look at an envelope.

389
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:44,440
 I put it in my pocket. They pick a card to do. Suddenly I'm not holding cards in my hand. I'm

390
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:48,760
 holding the envelope and in my pocket is all the cards. Then boom, inside the envelope is their

391
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:56,120
 card. It's a miracle. Um, something goes wrong with TV magic no matter what. Right. So I described,

392
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,760
 uh, uh, almost messing up the last time I was on, even when I did the arm chopper,

393
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:05,080
 it like got caught for a second and then went through and it was like a moment of panic.

394
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:10,600
 And I was trying to, I'm trying to troubleshoot. I'm trying to brace them, all the little things

395
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,840
 that go wrong with this, like this little, there's a lot of little touches to this trick. Right. And,

396
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:20,760
 uh, uh, anything that happens in plain sight, so to speak. And, um, I'm anticipating all of it.

397
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:27,560
 Um, and, uh, and I just go to get the card out of the pocket and I just can't get the card out of

398
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:33,880
 the envelope. I'm just sitting there like, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, just jammed in there. I

399
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,600
 just can't, and I was like a little. It's, it's, it's an envelope. There's like the size of a

400
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:44,120
 playing card. Yeah, exact, exact size of playing card. Yeah. So, uh, uh, and so I'm trying to slide

401
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:49,160
 it out. I'm just like, oh, all the days. It's just like, so the only thing that's going wrong

402
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:54,760
 is the actual punchline of the trick. The only, the actual payoff. That's the only thing delayed

403
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,000
 here. You know, I'm picturing like dropping all the cards on the ground by accident. I'm trying

404
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,240
 to picture like accidentally, uh, I've done this thing where I've accidentally pocketed the whole

405
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:07,800
 thing where I have to keep a gimmick in my hand from like, oh, I put everything like in my pocket,

406
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:14,360
 like a fool, uh, all kinds of things. And, uh, just, and then it was like, oh, it's going good.

407
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,840
 It's going good. You forgot to grease up your card. I forgot to grease up my card. Yeah. I got,

408
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:23,880
 I got a butter. I got a butter at my envelope. Well, everybody forgets something once in a while.

409
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:32,120
 That's a, I, I, uh, had a little bit of time off after our trip to decompress.

410
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:36,520
 And so I've been trying to, you know, just kind of straighten up the house a little bit here and

411
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:42,040
 there. Got some stuff done. You do look very decompressed. I feel decompressed. Um, yeah,

412
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:51,880
 but, um, I went out and cleaned up the Halloween decorations. Nice. And I was like, you know what?

413
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:57,560
 I better put the Christmas decorations out or they're not going out. And I did it. I got the

414
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:03,160
 Christmas decorations out same day. Whoa. You've decorated for Christmas. We are, we are already

415
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:08,280
 decorated for Christmas. We've got our five illuminated corgis that it's not crazy. It's

416
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:13,800
 not a big thing. It's just five illuminated corgis and, uh, a little strobe laser that shoots on the

417
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:22,280
 house and makes sparkly, uh, Christmas colors. And that's all right. Yeah. Done. But it's,

418
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:28,920
 and it's running. It's, it's all like lit up and everything. Our neighbors, uh, across the street

419
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:33,800
 still have all their Halloween shit up. And I was like, I did it. I beat them to the punch.

420
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:40,280
 And what's cool is now driving through the neighborhood, this is four days later, three

421
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:46,280
 days later, since I got my stuff set up, I'm starting to see other trees. I'm starting to see

422
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:51,880
 wreaths on doors. Oh, you started it. You started the domino holiday. I put the word out. Yeah. I

423
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:59,480
 was like, it's, it's on this year. Y'all let's go. Let's put it up. And I also, uh, did I tell you

424
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,280
 guys about you to have influence over magic tricks and Christmas decorations? I'll tell you guys

425
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:11,000
 about the goose that Ann got last year. So, you know, uh, she refurbished it, right? No, this is

426
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:17,800
 not the, that was the, that was the gnome. So this was a goose and it always wanted a big old concrete

427
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:22,520
 goose. Cause it's just one of those things, right? Oh, thank God it's concrete. But what can you do

428
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,760
 with a concrete goose, except dress it up, right? That's the whole thing is you have a goose. What

429
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:33,480
 can you do with a concrete goose? What can you do with a concrete goose? I can put a hat on it.

430
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:40,520
 That's right. Well, I finally got the, uh, set of costumes for the goose.

431
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:50,440
 So now how does one shop for goose costumes? Go online and type in costumes for goose,

432
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:57,000
 and you will get unlimited replies because people dress up their goose all the time.

433
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:04,520
 It comes up quick and easy. Jacob's going to the internet. It's up. Yeah. Yeah. It's a lot of

434
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:11,480
 costumes for goose. And so I looked and found a reasonably priced set and I went for it.

435
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:17,160
 And it's, it, it has not let me down. Yeah. Uh, as a matter of fact, I believe,

436
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:25,560
 yeah, I purchased one. Uh, no, I didn't go there. That's just one. That's just one costume. That's

437
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,400
 high end right there. That's a Piff the Magic Dragon goose. Yeah, that's pretty great. It's a

438
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:38,840
 Goose the Magic Dragon. Well, uh, our goose now has full, uh, different stuff for every holiday.

439
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:44,760
 So I already did the pumpkin on it, did a jack-o-lantern. Now it is outfitted with a turkey.

440
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:51,160
 Now it's a goose that looks like a turkey. Also the goose is named Duck Duck. That's the goose's

441
00:44:51,160 --> 00:45:00,120
 name. Duck Duck the goose. So Duck Duck was actually, he is our memento from the Michael's

442
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:07,000
 craft store where we bought it. And it's just one more sort of emblem of the fall of capitalism and

443
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:13,560
 the end of all, the end of all brick and mortar mom and pop shops. So yeah. Uh,

444
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:19,320
 what, so it's a turkey now. Do you know what you're going to do for Christmas?

445
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:24,840
 Oh yeah, it's got a Christmas. He's got a Santa outfit. Okay. He's got a Santa outfit. Then he's

446
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:31,080
 got like a winter snowflake for February, for January. Then he's got a big heart for February.

447
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:41,560
 Then he's got a, uh, leprechaun suit for March. Oh God, there we go. And then April, I don't think

448
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:47,640
 there's anything like April, May. I think it kind of gets sparse. July. He's got a, I'm telling you,

449
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:55,080
 it's only so many costumes. Easter bunny. Oh, I'm sorry. There is an Easter bunny. There's an

450
00:45:55,080 --> 00:46:03,480
 Easter bunny. There's a, um, a 4th of July uncle Sam. And for me, for me, you should dress it up

451
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:09,000
 either as a, uh, a stormtrooper for may the fourth be with you. Yeah. Oh, that's good.

452
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,480
 Or may dress it up like Justin Timberlake. It's gonna be to its head.

453
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:21,880
 God, that guy fell off so hard. Nice. Great. What a chump. No, he's a chump. He's a chump.

454
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:27,080
 He's the definition of chump. Come at me, Timberlake, you chump.

455
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:33,480
 We actually didn't talk about Halloween yet, did we? I guess we did. I was about to ask you about,

456
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:40,600
 uh, uh, trunk or treat, trunk or treat and, um, trick and or treat. Oh man. Uh, I had talked

457
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:45,560
 about trunk or treat already. I talked about it. Yeah. I had an awesome Halloween. So my sister-in-law

458
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:50,840
 came up, she brought a big old bunch of dumb, dumb, uh, suckers and we had a lot, enough candy.

459
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:55,560
 We only had about a hundred. No, I'm already here. We only had about a hundred trick or treaters,

460
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:59,800
 which was down from previous years, but it's still a lot. Oh, you know, tariffs.

461
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:07,480
 Dude. And then we surprised her and we went right after the trick or treaters were done. We put

462
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:14,040
 everything away and we jumped in the car and ran to the Pittsburgh zoo, which was having their

463
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:21,800
 Halloween jack-o'-lantern festival. Uh, jack jack-o'-lantern extravaganza. I believe this is

464
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:28,120
 like the third annual one that they did. And it's like a giant oaky cookie, but with pumpkins,

465
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:36,280
 it was remarkable. This thing was incredible. They had thousands and thousands of jack-o'-lanterns

466
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:42,040
 throughout the, throughout the zoo. It was wild. Okay. Uh, you could get pictures taken

467
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,520
 Paul, various jack-o'-lanterns.

468
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:52,120
 I'm going, there's my spooky picture of our house. It turned out really good.

469
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:57,960
 Going the wrong way here, but, uh, yeah, there's me doing the classic with a skeleton doing the

470
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:06,280
 classic. Okay. They did these really ornate jack-o'-lanterns sculpted by hand. And it turns

471
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:13,160
 out they had like, uh, 30. What you're showing me is not sculpted by hand. It is. Nope.

472
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:21,400
 It is. I'm telling you. It was sculpted, dude, these are cut out by artisans. It's like carved

473
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:27,640
 into a pumpkin. Yes. This is a, it looks like somebody just put a picture on top of a pumpkin

474
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,880
 and it's lit up, but it's like carved into it. It is carved into it. They do use a stencil,

475
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:36,040
 but then they carve. But yeah, there's like a marker for some of the darker stuff on it

476
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:42,760
 to make it really, but there are like 30 artisans carving these fucking pumpkins every day.

477
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:51,160
 And because it's the zoo, there's a lot of animals, but it is wild. It is fucking wild.

478
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:56,920
 It's really, I'm just wondering how much more care the animals could have gotten

479
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:01,160
 instead of taking all this time to carve these fucking pumpkins. The animals are all away. There

480
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:06,280
 were no animals out. The only animals we saw were some flamingos that were sleeping in their own

481
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:15,160
 little thing, but then Jules, worst zoo ever. Jules and Vincent, pulp fiction, pulp fiction.

482
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:25,800
 Yeah. It was really cool. It was amazing. And I didn't even get the, any images of the grand

483
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:34,680
 finale. It was too overwhelming. There had to have been, I don't know, 10,000 fucking LED filled

484
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:40,760
 jack-o-lanterns that were timed out to music and they were playing shit like renegade and stuff.

485
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:46,840
 And it was all timed out to the music. I'm telling you, it was out of hand. They were playing

486
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:52,920
 renegade and it was timed out to the music. Yeah. Renegade by sticks. Yeah. I believe that's right

487
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:59,800
 with the, the word is out. Is that how that would go? Yeah. Yeah. They finally found me. Yeah.

488
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:09,720
 I'm a wanted pumpkin. Yeah. It was out of hand. And it was just this huge wall that stretched for

489
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:16,840
 like a half a mile. It was nuts. It was extremely cool. That was pumpkins. It was pumpkins.

490
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:23,000
 The kinds of things, if you get a chance to look up the Pittsburgh pumpkin extravaganza,

491
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,880
 just go ahead and look it up anywhere. But the Pittsburgh zoo pumpkin extravaganza,

492
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:33,880
 there are, do not look it up at work. It is much dirtier than you think it is. There is some NSFW

493
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:40,680
 stuff in there. No, it was really, really cool. It was good. It was, I mean, like really, really fun.

494
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:45,800
 We went just at the last two hours of the, of the show and it was nice and dark. And so everything

495
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:51,160
 was super shiny in the light. It was beautiful. And then Anne kept telling me, no, these are,

496
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:55,480
 these are real pumpkins. I was like, nah, these are plastic because a lot of them were plastic.

497
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,600
 But then she was like, no, these are real. These are real. And I was like, bullshit.

498
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:05,240
 Turns out every three days they have to reshave those pumpkins cause they go, they go south of

499
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:10,920
 cheese. And so they got artisans in there just cranking out pumpkins all the time.

500
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:19,640
 And I am so far out on that gig and they have a huge, a huge crew of artists going and sculpting

501
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:25,160
 these pumpkins every fucking year, every fucking couple of days. It was wild. It was wild.

502
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:32,520
 Yeah. Oh, that is, that is painful. And just like you, Matt, the, the guy who is the head

503
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:40,200
 gourd carver made an appearance on Pittsburgh today live or whatever it is. And he was on there

504
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:46,680
 showing off his, his pumpkins carving skills. So yeah, it was really something. So I had a really

505
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:53,400
 fun Halloween. Oh, great. Yeah. That's awesome. Also like Matt, there was a guy trying to have a

506
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:59,240
 dog get adopted, uh, just off camera while the guy was carving the pumpkin. They ran out of time.

507
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:05,080
 That's so much good shit at this, at this pumpkin fair. They had a, uh, a big s'mores

508
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:11,720
 spot where the fire and six people from my show showed up at the pumpkin patch. Just the,

509
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:17,160
 they left my show and went over there. Well, they were excited. They had s'mores to eat.

510
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:27,480
 Holy shit. But no, we have reservations for s'mores in Pittsburgh. It's only about a 25 minute

511
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:33,160
 drive from my house to get to the zoo. So that was really great and really fun. Are you going to

512
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:38,520
 start frequenting the zoo more often? We've gone for a couple of special events now. And so I think

513
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:46,440
 we'll continue to do so. They, they put on a real fun show. Yeah. All right. I was overwhelmed by

514
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:51,960
 the, uh, the amount of work and detail and fun that went into that pumpkin display. I thought

515
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:56,680
 it was going to be ho hum, but it was really, I mean, I'm overwhelmed by your description of it.

516
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:02,440
 So I, I can just imagine how you feel. I just, I w I wish I had it handy, but if you get a chance,

517
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:10,200
 please look up, uh, Pittsburgh, uh, Pittsburgh zoo pump, uh, Jack O'Lantern extravaganza.

518
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:17,400
 Easy to not look it up at work and, and just look up that, that finale. Yeah. That's it's,

519
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:23,400

521
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,960
 but it was amazing. Just amazing. It's one of those things that when you're there,

522
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:47,160
 like I, I, I purposely was like, I'm not recording this. I'm not taking pictures of this part.

523
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:50,600
 I'm just going to experience this. And it was really, really cool.

524
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:55,560
 Rich scoop and chat says, do not go to Pittsburgh Blumpkins.com.

525
00:53:55,560 --> 00:54:03,880
 Oh, that's, that's our new Patriot site. Oh shit. Speaking of Pittsburgh Blumpkins.com,

526
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:11,720
 you remember we gave away with our, uh, prizes galore. We had some dude wipes

00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:36,760
 What? Dingleberry dude wipes are the holiday version.

532
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:49,000

537
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,760
 Matt, you had a fuck ton of kids at your house the other day. I also, there was Halloween.

538
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:30,360
 You came during a rush. Jacob actually came by the place and we were running, I ran by on my way to

539
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:36,120
 work. Jacob came by right when I had about like nine kids line up for levitation videos. Oh wow.

540
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:40,680
 Not happening throughout the whole night, but I, I did have, I did more levitation videos this

541
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:45,320
 year than last year. I think last year me dressed like Satan really discouraged some people from

542
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:51,240
 stepping up and doing it. And so this year I was dressed like Elvis and a bunch of parents got

543
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:56,920
 videos of their kids floating in the, in the air with me running a hoop over their bodies and stuff.

544
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:03,160
 That's cute. I hung out with Matt's neighbor and we watched Matt doing the levitation videos.

545
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:13,000
 Matt around kids and their parents doing these videos, you can tell that Matt deals with school

546
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:21,960
 children on a regular basis. It is spectacular to watch. Yeah. Uh, one is I don't touch them.

547
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:26,440
 No, you don't touch. I noticed that you don't touch the kids at all, which, um,

548
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:31,880
 you know, uh, not how Paul would do it, but still fine. Uh, well, I wouldn't talk to him.

549
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:37,480
 I get the fuck out of here. Uh, get out of my yard motherfucker.

550
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:44,360
 And then my, my buddy Tony was drunk with power running the clown jump scare. He was.

551
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:48,920
 So I think we lost the thought. It was broken. My, my neighbor Gary and I, uh,

552
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:53,960
 helped help Gary who abbreviated my car together. He helped fix my, he helped fix my clown,

553
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:59,240
 my clown illusion. Um, and we discovered what happened of course was my fault. Uh,

554
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:05,880
 there you, so there you go. Um, but, uh, so my buddy Tony's running the jump scare of my

555
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,800
 kids trick-or-treating. My kids like running the clown jump scare when they got back from

556
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:14,440
 trick-or-treating. Sure. I don't think Jacob, you were here. You weren't there when my oldest got

557
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:19,320
 back from trick-or-treating, right? No, I was not. I didn't see your kids. So the rule was basically

558
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:26,280
 don't jump scare little kids, jump scare teens. And even that backfired. I tried to one kid,

559
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,760
 I thought was older than he was. I made a kid cry. I gave him all of the candy. I just said here,

560
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:37,640
 take any and all. Uh, one was a group of teenage girls. They came up. We jumped scared them with

561
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:43,880
 the clown and she literally just looked down and hugged herself. And then four friends said,

562
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:49,800
 okay, we're going. And the four friends just marched her off. It was the weirdest. What?

563
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:57,400
 Dramatic. I am done. I'm done. I don't give a fuck. I sit out in my yard. I sit out in my,

564
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:03,080
 my place dressed up like a creepy fucking skeleton. I was going to say, Paul does get mad that people

565
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:09,560
 aren't scared at Halloween all the time. It's a fucking scary holiday. It's supposed to be scary.

566
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:16,360
 That's it's about the dead. It's about the horrors. Oh, I get so mad. It's not Christmas.

567
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:22,280
 A couple of times we were going to go take, take a video of them levitating and also the jump scare

568
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:27,640
 happened with the clown and they went like, Oh wait, this is rigged. I'm, I'm leaving. Right.

569
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:33,320
 Pass on the levitation thing. And I, and I'd be like, no, no, no. So at one point we were,

570
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:38,360
 I was levitating people and then a kid, uh, uh, jump scared. And then all of a sudden my,

571
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:42,360
 my kid goes back to Katrina at the same time. It's like a big, big hub up in my driveway.

572
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:48,360
 Okay. And suddenly a little three year old starts walking towards the candy, which is right next to

573
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:53,080
 the jump scare. Yep. That's next to the jump scare. Yeah. So, uh, and the parents go, whoa, whoa. And

574
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:58,120
 I go, no, no, we will not jump scare the little kid. Right. Yeah. Like, no, no, no. And then Tony,

575
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:02,600
 my buddy Tony was also going like, no, no, we won't. We're good. Come have her come get candy.

576
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:07,880
 Yeah. My son was drunk with power on the jump scare, but he w I was watching. He was doing,

577
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:11,320
 yeah. He was getting the big kids. Yeah. We were just doing the big kid. Yeah. No,

578
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:19,480
 he was doing it perfect. So he, uh, and so we do that, but my, uh, son doesn't see the little kid.

579
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:25,560
 He only sees the teenagers behind the little kid and he wasn't paying attention. So he slides over.

580
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:30,840
 So in front of a giant crap of which we, me and Tony, both were going like, don't, no, no, no,

581
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:39,880
 you'll be fine. You'll be fine. Jump scare. You'll be fine. You like sexist clown horn blasts and like

582
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:46,680
 three-year-old kids to which we all just turned the key and we're like, yeah. It just screaming at

583
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:56,600
 him. Your poor son. I'm sure it was just mortified. He was like, what are you like really putting?

584
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:00,520
 He's like, Oh, I didn't see them. The table was above. I couldn't see the kid below the table.

585
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:07,880
 And I was like, it was all we were talking about. Uh, so that was maybe the low point of the clown

586
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:13,800
 jump scare. Uh, there. Oh, disagree. Disagree. Did you get, do you see your giant skeleton?

587
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:21,480
 Do you see your 12 foot skeleton? You have, uh, on your property, something that you now own

588
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:27,800
 is a giant skeleton. Wow. My sons are begging me to just put a Santa Claus hat on it and leave it

589
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:32,200
 up through the holidays. It's the way to go, man. It's the right move. They're right. It really,

590
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:40,760
 it's gotta be a three 65 skeleton. You do, you do, you make him a letter. Oh, you got the HOA.

591
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:46,200
 That's going to be trouble. Yeah. Yeah. I know. Unless there's, unless there's a bylaw in there

592
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:50,200
 that says what kind of decorations you can have out for holidays. I think you're safe.

593
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:56,680
 So at the end of the day, uh, this is the first Halloween where I were, I pro decided to calculate

594
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:01,560
 how many pounds of candy I bought. I used to just measure in bags and then like cost code myself.

595
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:07,880
 And it turns out I bought 50 pounds of candy. Oh yeah. There was a question in the chat earlier

596
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:12,120
 about how much of, of your giant hall of candy do you still have remaining? I was able to unload

597
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:16,440
 between truck and treat, which turned out truck and treat. They actually offered candy to for,

598
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:20,200
 for you to give out, which I was like, that's, that's something I should know ahead of time.

599
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:25,080
 Instead I just wish that I'd been in the email instead. I refused to be subsidized by the

600
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:29,880
 government for my candy supply. I decided to thank you lift my own trunk up by the boot straps and

601
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:39,000
 provide my own candy. Um, and, uh, it, uh, uh, I was able to unload 30 pounds of candy. Whoa,

602
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,280
 that is no small amount of candy. That was like, you know, normally you start off with a candy,

603
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:46,840
 you go like, Oh, just take one. And the most numerous, how much candy you have, you're like,

604
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:52,040
 go ahead, take more. I had a time all all from the, from, from the beginning of Halloween to

605
01:01:52,040 --> 01:02:00,920
 the end. I was like, grab a handful more, go for it. Be selfish, be a jerk. Um, and, uh, still I

606
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:14,200
 turned out 50 pounds of candy. Uh, so you're ready for, uh, for how much was left over? Uh,

607
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:17,560
 20 pounds, 20 pounds of, all right. Are you going to take it to the food bank?

608
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:29,000
 Yeah. Food bank, meaning my mouth. Yeah, that's right. That's right. Go, go, go. Yes. So, uh, uh,

609
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,320
 yes, I'm going to find a place to donate it. I'm, I obviously go right up to San Antonio,

610
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:36,920
 but I will, I will find a place to donate, uh, candy when I get back. Nice. Yeah.

611
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:41,640
 Funny thing is that as running bit, anything that came by my house, I held up a bucket of candy,

612
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:46,600
 said trick or treat just to keep giving it away. And, uh, that was successful. People,

613
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:51,960
 people still take candy when you offer it to them. Oh, yeah, they will. I saw candy the next day.

614
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:58,520
 I saw one of the best little tick tocks I've seen in a long time was, uh, uh, black barbershop

615
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:05,080
 and the barber would get done with the haircut. And then right before he takes the bib off,

616
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:09,480
 he'd grab a bucket of dumb, dumb suckers and offer a sucker to the client. And the client would

617
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:14,920
 inevitably just crack up, but then they'd take a sucker and they were loving it. It was just the

618
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:19,240
 sweetest thing. It was the nicest thing. That's like, we should offer each other candy in social

619
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:23,960
 situations, much more often. I remember, you know, when you went to your grandma's house,

620
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:29,480
 you got candy. Okay. It wasn't a special day. Exactly. There's, there's just such a dish.

621
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:33,480
 We don't have such a dish for a reason. Exactly. Right. I think I need to keep

622
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:40,280
 a more active candy dish in my home that I specifically think about for, for guests,

623
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:48,840
 not just for me. Yeah. A guest dish, a guest dish of candy, but you know, not with the nasties,

624
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:54,680
 but he started his hero's journey. I have, I have, you know, I do this for the biography.

625
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:59,320
 We'll look back at this betterment of the world. Yeah. Starting to give me a good idea. I should

626
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:02,920
 get in a white panel van, drive around and find kids who maybe don't have candy and offer them

627
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:11,720
 candy from my van. Oh, that is, it's like a traveling food bank. You don't ruin the candy

628
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:17,160
 dish. Biddle honey. Biddle honey ruined the candy dish. That and that hard shit that just melds

629
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:23,960
 together into one candy glob. Yeah. That shit was nasty. What my grandma had, which was great

630
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:32,360
 was she had the little craft butterscotch squares. Oh yeah. Those are good. Holy shit. I used to eat

631
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:40,200
 those by the pound. I know you can't tell, but I did fucking love those things. Yeah. My, my

632
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:45,240
 grandmother's a Werther's original person. I love, love me some butterscotch. These were, these were

633
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:52,040
 basically like Werther's original, but you didn't have to work for it. This was like, you just

634
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:55,880
 unwrapped. They were the kind that you would use in baking if you needed to, right? You just unwrapped

635
01:04:55,880 --> 01:05:04,520
 a little square and oh, oh my God. I love those things. Excuse me. You guys want to do a little

636
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:08,680
 Jack versus nerd? More than anything in the world. Let's do some Jack versus nerd.

637
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:37,720
 Explosion of butterscotch candy. No, not bitto honey.

638
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:48,360
 We got a scooper coming down to us today from Hoopy Fruit Scoop. Hoopy Fruit Scoop. You don't

639
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:53,880
 know what I got. That's vaguely familiar. What is that? What's that referencing?

640
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:59,880
 Little Dooscoop. Anybody know Hoopy Fruit? I don't know. Hoopy Fruit. I don't know. Hitchhikers,

641
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:08,040
 I guess. Scoop Jesus is saying Hoopy Fruit. Oh, okay. After 12 years and 1800 performances,

642
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:13,640
 Rating the Rock Vault will close in Las Vegas at the end of this year. Less than 10 shows remain

643
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:17,960
 at the Hard Rock Cafe at the Las Vegas Strip. Dicks is available at ratingtherockvault.com.

644
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:23,960
 To herald the end of the show, here's a scooperty. So it is a scooperty, I guess about the show,

645
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:31,640
 Rating the Rock Vault. Let's see. The categories are Rating the Rock Vault. All right. Paul,

646
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:38,040
 you're up first. What you want? I'll go with Rating for 1200, please. All right. Rating

647
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:46,440
 the Country Vault ran for six years in what city? Vegas. Rating the Country Vault.

648
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:54,520
 Yeah, I think it happened in Vegas. Okay. Branson, Missouri. Oh, okay. Well, it didn't

649
01:06:54,520 --> 01:07:01,160
 happen in Vegas. Las Vegas of Missouri. It ran in Vegas, though. I think it's showcased here,

650
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:07,720
 yeah, a little bit. Let's see. I'll try Vault for 400. If you jump to the end of the show,

651
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:14,760
 what Van Halen song closes the show? That would be Panama. If you jump to the end of the show,

652
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:20,600
 the Van Halen song at the end of it is Panama. I don't jump. There you go.

653
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:26,360
 It's possible that I have a bit of an unfair advantage on this scooperty. I might have seen

654
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:32,600
 Rating the Rock Vault more than you two gentlemen have seen it. Well, yes. I've seen it like three

655
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:39,160
 times. No, you've seen it a handful of times. Maybe four. Yeah. I will do The for 400, please.

656
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:46,440
 Name any two Las Vegas properties that have hosted Rating the Rock Vault. The Rio and the

657
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:53,640
 Hard Rock. I love it. Yeah, Rio and the Hard Rock. LVH Westgate, Tropicana, Hard Rock Hotel,

659
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:09,000
 2000. I got to get back on the board. What is the maximum capacity of Allegiant Stadium for a

660
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:19,400
 concert plus or minus 10,000? 35,000, isn't it? I think you're low. Oh, God. All right. Well,

661
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:26,600
 I'm going 35,000. All right. 72,000. Shit, my butt. Okay. I would have been low too. I was

662
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:34,680
 going to get 60,000. 72,000 people? Yeah. It's very big. I guess. I'll be the first to tell you.

663
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:43,960
 It's very big. That's me. I'll try Rating for 400. Raiders of the Lost Ark came out in what year?

664
01:08:43,960 --> 01:09:00,840
 Plus or minus two years. Let's see. That would be 1980s, right? 1984. You think it's 80? Yeah.

665
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:08,600
 All right. I'll back it up. I'll go 82. I'll get the plus or minus for two years. 81, right in the

666
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:18,120
 middle. There you go. Matt. The for 800, because I crushed the first one. What year did Rating the

667
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:29,160
 Rock Vault start in Las Vegas? Pass. It passes to Paul. Also, we couldn't get a window on this one.

668
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:38,760
 2011. 2013. Poop, poop, poop. Oh, you were close. You were close. I was close, but not close enough.

669
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:44,360
 Wrong, but close. Paul. Rating. Why don't I keep killing myself on Rating?

670
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:50,920
 Which year did the Raiders start playing in Las Vegas? Plus or minus one year? 2020.

671
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:57,320
 2020 is absolutely correct. We know that one. Yeah. That was the year everything went to shit.

672
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:05,480
 Well, how so? The Raiders. The Raiders moved to Las Vegas. Raiders moved to Las Vegas. It's all took.

673
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:15,160
 Let's see. I'll try Vault for 800. Who originally wrote and recorded My Generation?

674
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:27,240
 Linda Ronstadt. Linda Ronstadt. Linda L.O.D. You want the name or just the band?

675
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:31,400
 Like the name of the person or the band? Because I don't know who wrote it. Gloria Estefan.

676
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:38,120
 Oh, I'm sorry. It's Gloria Estefan. I guess I'll just say The Who.

677
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:44,760
 Oh yeah, it's The Who. The Who? Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam.

678
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:51,480
 Just Cult Jam. Matt, you're up. Let's do The for 1200.

679
01:10:53,560 --> 01:11:00,760
 And which city did Rating the Rock Vault first perform? City of the Mind. The City of the Mind.

680
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:05,720
 Pass. Paul, does that mean it has to start with T-H-E?

681
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:13,240
 I don't think so. Oh, somewhere in England.

682
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:17,960
 Okay. I'll say Liverpool. Show me somewhere in England. Liverpool.

683
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:21,240
 I think it's actually somewhere in Mexico. Okay.

684
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:26,200
 Los Angeles. We're both wrong. The Mexico of America.

685
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:32,760
 Oh, Los Angeles. The Angels. So it was The. Oh, yep. Paul got it right.

686
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:37,160
 I mean, I got it. Oh, great. I got one right. I'll go with The again.

687
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:43,640
 For 2000. Daily Double. Oh, here we go. I'm coming out of the hole, mama.

688
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:50,200
 Lead singers Todd Currens, who's been on this show, and Travis Cormier are natives of which country?

689
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:59,800
 That would be Canada. Oh, Canada. That's true. And Paul is back to zero. He's still in third

690
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:05,320
 place, but he is back to zero. That's all I asked for. I'll try Vault for 1200.

691
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:14,280
 What song is originally by a Beatle and covered by G&R by Guns N' Roses?

692
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:22,680
 Oh, oh, fuck. It's "Live and Let Die." Damn it. Paul McCartney, "Live and Let Die."

693
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:25,880
 I knew that one. I just saw him at concert. I should have known that.

694
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:30,280
 You just saw that. Yeah. I do love that cover of it, too. Matt.

695
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:38,200
 I will. I got to catch up here. Oh, yeah. Score check. I'm winning 2800.

696
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:41,400
 Matt is in second with 400. Paul is in third with zero.

697
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:48,920
 I will do Rock for 2000. All right. Daily Double!

698
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:57,400
 Drummer Blas Ellis of Rock Vault Tours with this holiday-themed rock show.

699
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:03,000
 Oh, oh, oh. Come on. You can get this one. I know, I know. I just have instant

700
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:08,920
 cognitive dissonance on it. Yep. Nicholas Newman, his wife drags him to it every year

701
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:16,520
 when they play in Jersey. You know, this started in the really cold areas of Russia.

702
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:21,320
 Manheim Steamroller. Siberian Orchestra, Trans-Siberian Orchestra.

703
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:29,480
 The Manheim Steamroller, the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. Blas drives a steamroller in Siberia.

704
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:32,600
 Paul. Vault for 2000, please.

705
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:38,600
 Name the other Deep Purple song in the show besides "Smoke on the Water."

706
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:45,800
 You know that other Deep Purple song. Oh, it's "In a Gotta Davida."

707
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:52,120
 "In a Gotta Davida," the famous Deep Purple song. I don't know. Is it not?

708
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:57,000
 I don't know. Is that your guess? Yeah, that's my guess.

709
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,680
 Okay. No, it's "Space Trucking." What the fuck?

710
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:11,240
 I've been spacing. I'm trucking, baby. Don't you know that I...

711
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:17,480
 You remember when we used to make out to this hymn?

712
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:26,440
 Name a song that S.J. sings in "Rock and Roll." Oh, come on.

713
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:27,640
 "Your Mama Don't Dance."

714
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:35,160
 Oh, what does she sing? She sings... I don't know.

715
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:38,360
 She sings, "Here I Go Again." Is Barracuda in there?

716
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,760
 My white snake. Barracuda.

717
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:41,960
 She sings some white snake. Yeah.

718
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:49,800
 Let's see. Oh, she sings some Rolling Stones. What's that song called? "Gimme Shelter."

719
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:53,320
 "Start Me Up." She does "Start Me Up."

720
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,640
 She sings "Brown Sugar." She does "Gimme Shelter."

721
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:59,800
 "Dreams" by Fleetwood Mac, "Gimme Shelter" by The Rolling Stones,

722
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:02,600
 "Heartbreaker" by Pat Benatar, and "Alone" by Heart.

723
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,000
 Nice. What a comprehensive list.

724
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:05,800
 Yes. Yeah.

725
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:10,600
 It did take me longer to figure out one of the songs that she sings in that show that it should have.

726
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:13,080
 That did seal the game for you, Jacob.

727
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:15,560
 Oh, how nice for me.

728
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:18,520
 Matt, you got rock for four or 800.

729
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,360
 Well, it's tough. Fighting for second place.

730
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:24,120
 Yeah, if I get it right, then I'm in second. If I get it wrong, I'm in second. It's tough.

731
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:26,600
 That's right. So I'll go for 800.

732
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:30,600
 You could get the third Daily Double. It's the third Daily Double!

733
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,960
 It's not.

734
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:38,680
 Todd Kearns of Rockvault regularly performs with this top hat-wearing member of Guns N' Roses.

735
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:39,400
 Buckethead.

736
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:49,720
 A young person brought up Buckethead to me a few weeks ago, and I said, I was like,

737
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:55,000
 how do you know who Buckethead is? Like somebody in their 20s brought up Buckethead to me.

738
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,480
 I was like, how do you know who Buckethead is?

739
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,720
 They're like, oh, he plays all this great guitar stuff and everything.

740
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:01,560
 He's really good. He's a great performer and everything.

741
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:01,960
 Yeah.

742
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:05,400
 And I said, did you know that he was in Guns N' Roses for a while?

743
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:09,960
 And the look on this guy's face got hilariously huge.

744
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:14,360
 I guess he was the guitar player in Guns N' Roses.

745
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:14,520
 Yeah.

746
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,760
 This would be not back, but forward slash.

747
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:19,720
 Forward slash, of course, is correct.

748
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:25,320
 And Paul closing out the category, end of game, Rock for 400.

749
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:31,480
 Former ICS guest and Rockvault guitarist Rowan Robertson was a member of this metal band.

750
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:36,840
 Oh god. In excess.

751
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:37,720
 Was he with Dio?

752
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:40,920
 That's literally what the question is.

753
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:41,960
 I think he was with Dio.

754
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:44,120
 He was with Dio.

755
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:46,840
 Yeah, I got it. Oh, I'm so proud of myself.

756
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:52,360
 And Paul got the secret $8,000 question correct, so that means...

757
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:55,000
 Oh shit, that wasn't the $8,000 question.

758
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,800
 No, I still win. I win with 4,000 points.

759
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:03,160
 Matt wins with a max integral $3,200 and Paul has negative $1,600.

760
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,400
 That's from a HoopyFruitsScoop.

761
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:06,360
 Thank you, HoopyFruitsScoop.

762
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:07,240
 Yeah, that was great.

763
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:11,560
 If you want to make us a Scooperty or any other kind of jock versus nerd,

764
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:15,480
 or just send us in some email, heyscoops.com is where you can go, heyscoops.com.

765
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:19,720
 Head over there, make us a scoop mail, make us a jock versus nerd,

766
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:22,280
 do a Scooperty, do a Price is Stripe, do an Obelisk.

767
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:25,640
 You do all those things right over there at heyscoops.com.

768
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:28,200
 We are running low on the jock versus nerds.

769
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:30,200
 So go over there, make us one.

770
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:33,240
 Yeah. In fact, pick a different Vegas show that just closed

771
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:34,520
 and write a whole one about that one too.

772
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:39,720
 There's a lot more to choose from, keep more every day.

773
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:44,120
 We could just do a string of Las Vegas shows closing.

774
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:47,320
 We can do a Las Vegas shows close that we've been part of.

775
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:48,760
 That's right.

776
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:51,240
 Good Lord, that'd be like two weeks of material.

777
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:56,040
 Or some would say maybe 1,260 episodes.

778
01:17:56,040 --> 01:18:02,600
 It is the true story of this show, Vegas shows closing.

779
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:06,600
 I want to thank all the people who support us over on our Patreon page.

780
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:07,880

786
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,200
 Was that web address too hard to pronounce?

787
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,600
 That was a very long web address, Matt.

788
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:30,600
 Just Google Pittsburgh Extravaganza Lantern Zoo animal.

789
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:35,480
 Pumpkin Jack-o'-lantern zoo pumpkin.

790
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:36,920
 No, go to preachingfund.com.

791
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,440
 Sticks, sticks.

792
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:59,480
 Or if you've already applied to be the new pumpkin mold scraper at the Pittsburgh

793
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:06,440
 Pumpkin Zoo Extravaganza doohickeything.org next year, head on over to fartsinabag.biz.

794
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:18,440
 That's fartsinabag.biz that along with preachingfund.com.

795
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:21,880
 It does take you over to our Patreon site where for as little as $3,

796
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:23,480
 you can help keep the show on the air.

797
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:27,400
 If you think the show is worth more than $3 a month, you can do that too.

798
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:30,440
 It would really help us out over there at preachingfund.com.

799
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,600
 And of course, fartsinabag.biz.

800
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:35,800
 Thanks, Penn, Jeff, for creating this podcast.

801
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,400

807

 [LAUGHTER]

808
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:21,180
 See ya.

809
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:22,780
 Bye.

810
01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:27,080
 It's the bonus material for being a Patreon.
