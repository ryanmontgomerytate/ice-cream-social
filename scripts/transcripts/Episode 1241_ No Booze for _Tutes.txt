 the bad guys how's the weather in Texas Matt Donnelly it is a humid it's humid
 and kind of rainy oh perfect and I'm back at the magic saloon here in San
 Antonio and last time I was here scoops gave us Bucky's shot glasses and there's
 one for each of you that forgot to bring home oh wow bring you some Bucky's
 adorable glasses thank you yeah I what do you think of Bucky's do you do you go
 to Bucky's while you're in Texas um I've been I haven't been I know it's like a
 statewide treasure I know people yeah been to Bucky's love of Bucky's and it's
 it's I think it's expanding or has expanded to Louisiana as well all I know
 is that when I was performing as hillbill I put my baseball cards into a
 Bucky's bag and put that out with a fishing pole and people really laughed at
 the Bucky's people love the Bucky's bag yeah that makes sense that makes sense
 Bucky's for people who don't know is the biggest truck stop you've ever seen in
 your life but it's not for truckers it's just for you know regular Joe's driving
 their little Toyota Corollas up and down the street yeah so it's ridiculous yeah
 they've got smokers they've got smoke shops you can go in there yeah it's all
 crazy I think there's one supposed to open up near Las Vegas or like on the
 way to Las Vegas or something like that it was a latter-day scoop in the chat
 right now is saying supposed to be getting a Bucky's in Utah yeah maybe
 maybe that's it yeah can't believe Utah's ahead of Nevada on the Bucky's
 list man but that hurts that hurts my feelings I feel like you know we don't
 we don't have the the lottery we don't have Bucky's I feel like 20 years from
 now we're gonna be dealing with Bucky's like the Walmart situation like how
 there are no more gas stations there's just Bucky's it's just Bucky's yeah yeah
 oh yeah no yeah for sure oh and Leon Kasab is pointing out in the chat too
 that they're they're big Christian no big Christian activists as well and yeah
 it's it's tough it's tough no I guess we'll just go to In-N-Out or Domino's
 instead yeah you'll be fine we got we got a Sheetz slash Wawa locked down out
 here in PA so ain't nobody coming for Sheetz and Wawa I don't think holy
 Sheetz oh why the why the Sheetz not that's their current catchphrase stop it
 no why why the Sheetz not that's hey hey you want to get ten tacos for $6.99 why
 the Sheetz not that's terrible that's what they say oh and they're in their
 chicken nuggets are called nuggets chicken nuggets are called schnuggets
 cuz that's fine but yeah everything's why the schnuggets makes more sense than
 why the Sheetz not schnuggets approved it's approved no problem I'm fine with
 schnuggets you got to explain why the Sheetz not because they didn't want to
 go with eat my sheets I sheets you not I sheets you not guaranteed to give you
 the sheets no bullshit yeah that'd be good Laszlo I could give two sheets these
 are all better than why the Sheetz not why does he's not because she's isn't
 substitute for the word fuck now it's yeah why is it why the shit not it is
 not us is not a phrase oh well I don't know maybe you don't know look if you
 talk to my bundled up GI that's every day it's a sheets not it's like it's
 like a Rubik's Cube no I'm never I've never wanted to talk to your bowels I
 will tell you this one thing I do not suffer from is constipation that has
 never been an issue in my life ever ever Paul's Native American name is flowing
 river it's absolutely it is mud creek unstoppable maybe it's cuz you're
 getting too many schnuggets I haven't eaten a long time haven't eaten it
 sheets in a long time but I will tell you this I was betrayed by value
 gentlemen oh yes so we went we went last week to to Aldi do you guys have Aldi now
 in Vegas we just got it yeah right I haven't been yet but we and I grew up I
 grew up with an Aldi around me in Jersey okay so I really like Aldi our Aldi is
 good it's got some really great stuff and brother the value just stacks so we're
 going long and I'm grabbing some grub here and there picking out a few things
 and all these one of these places where you can put in a quarter into the bass
 cart and get a bass cart and rent the bass cart what it you just said bass
 cart three times what the fuck is a bass cart so I grew up calling them carts yeah
 Buggies I see I never call them Buggies they're called no I called them Buggies
 they call them Buggies out here okay I always called them carts or baskets yeah
 that's fine no they people out here don't know what the hell you're saying
 when you say when you say bass cart no one people like I think I only have that
 with the sheets that was a snuggies independent film that came out in the
 90s about that artist who drew with like maple syrup on his placemat you know
 what he was great my dad was a my dad was a grocery man I'm gonna say bass cart
 is probably insider terminology that I inherited oh I bet you it is yeah gotta
 be I bet you anything because he would you know I just I always called it a
 bass cart anyway so I actually when I go shopping I don't deal with any of that
 okay I get on like a mechanic sled and I lie on my back and I walk around with
 like an Easter basket on my belly and I just shopped that way I just reach I
 back around I move around the store that's like that old Richard Simmons
 thing right of like only search shop in certain spots in the grocery store and
 this is the way to do it you get on your belly on the bound oh yeah only stuff
 you can reach from your from laying down that's the only stuff that's safe to eat
 anymore yeah so anyway I don't think I've ever heard the term bass cart
 before well but yet regional term particularly used in the Pacific
 Northwest and other areas for shopping cart or grocery cart I but you for the
 smaller one right you're talking about no this is just saying the the big one
 the regular size was bass cart because I was accepting the notion that it was an
 insider for a different kind of cart right so you get the regular shopping
 carts and you get together get the bass carts - I know it's talking about say in
 my brain I always just conflated it to being it's a cart that has a wire basket
 on it mm-hmm right that was what that was why it was a bass cart that's that's
 what it looks like here on the of the old Google yeah so anyway nobody out here
 stealing carts or but what about what about what about tiscots or tascots is
 anyone stealing those out there yes the blue and yellow ones specifically are
 gone you cannot what about my virtue someone stole it a long time ago and I've
 been looking for it ever since you're not gonna find it you're not gonna find
 it at Aldi pal what about my my pearls has anyone stolen my pearls god damn you
 know I think I'm gonna try and incorporate that bit but I think it's
 gonna become more common because our power grid is gonna start failing a lot
 more often so anyway you don't have to take a cart at Aldi ah bass cart
 latter-day scoop we have a picture of a shopping cart filled with bass well done
 that's a bass cart for sure good job so well done well you know you don't have
 to bring a cart you can just bring your bag okay reusable bag and stick it in
 there and then take that to the checkout line and stick it back in the bag which
 what I usually do is I don't shop a ton of stuff very rarely do I use a cart you
 can also just grab they leave boxes in the front so you just grab a box oh yeah
 yeah from the product and throw stuff in a box check out and you're you know kind
 of eco-friendly save some time it's nice I like it and also people forget their
 quarter sometime and can't rent a cart so they just need to carry a box anyway
 we're shopping around and I'm like ooh it's hot dog time there's hot dogs so I
 grabbed some hot dogs and I'm looking at the hot dogs and they're like you know
 what time it is it's hot dog time hot dogs are maybe maybe three bucks maybe
 all right great good and then I look a fair price for a hot dog and right neck
 well for eight hot dogs I look right next to these hot dogs and there's
 another pack of hot dogs that are an all the in-house brand what how much how low
 would you go on a packet you've already gone below the number that I would
 once I see three dollar hot dogs I go nope I'm done these these I believe the
 I believe the all the hot dogs I believe they were priced at a point where if you
 took those up to the cashier the cashier would turn around and give you three
 dollars along with the pack of hot well they should have these these boys were
 paper these boys were 89 cents wow so I was like Mike Neal said in the chat you
 guessed 99 cents you went over my friend I was like you're out according to
 price is right rule I gotta try this I gotta see what's up 89 cents let's go
 for how many any cheap any cheap yum eight wieners 89 cents so a dime and
 change per hot dog yeah I swear to God I'm gonna get diarrhea listening to this
 Leon is sending the right gift so uh poor Lindsey so he said sexy Barry
 White don't don't come in with 11 cents like my 10 cents and change wasn't good
 enough math 10 cents and change so I or 11 cents I had those in the fridge for
 a while we hadn't I hadn't gotten to crack them open yet and today yesterday
 it's the first of the month time time for the doggies to get their medicine
 great and the doggies like their medicine for the most part but one Billy
 Bones does not like his heart tick flea worm combo and he only loves his heart
 tickin fleas he only takes it with hot dogs so we're like okay well I got these
 hot dogs what better way to test them than with the doggies so I crack them
 open I put a couple in the microwave and I sent vomit on comes walking a smell
 like we have never experienced comes filling filling dog that cost exactly 10
 cents and change yeah and you put it in the microwave oh that's the only way I
 cook my wieners that's so gross you are a monster you are a monster
 person only way I cook my hot dogs is microwave so the smell has infiltrated
 the home it's really it's really rough scooper Nova girl and say you are eight
 years old scooper Nova girl you are overestimate you're guessing hi so when
 you when you bought those hot dogs they're like the savings come with their
 own cost there was a monkey's paw yeah storm clouds rolled in as you got into
 your car well when I did it and gave me a look was like okay and I found this
 pack of hot dogs there were three dollars and something hot dogs like oh my god
 what are we gonna do the two dollars and eleven cents we saved from buying
 regular hot dogs well and I'd say well about part of a comic book that's
 basically it next to these three dollar packs of hot dogs though there was a man
 he was his hair was all slicked back and he had on a beautiful black silk suit
 and he said Paul he knew my name he said Paul wouldn't you like to save two
 dollars and something since he was right and this is where we got old Tom
 Jacoby's hot dogs did you say Tom Jacoby oh he died Tom Jacoby died ten years ago
 Tom no I just saw him today Matt you'll be happy to know that I did have my dogs
 I did hedge my bets and on the way out I also picked up a pack of five straight
 up fatty big old what do you call the broth grill dogs big broths you're on
 you don't do those in the microwave do you oh yeah what the fuck they're cheese
 infused brats Maddie cheese infused brats oh you are cheese infused brats I
 passed on a chili infused ones it is like how did you how did you pass on the
 chill if you're getting the cheese infused brats and putting them in the
 microwave Paul don't pass on the chili infused ones I did I passed on two
 pieces anyway we start cutting up these wieners and I'm I have to get pieces
 between Bill and Ted basically where they call me when Paul's done I'm gonna
 go hey I bought it yeah I start I start pushing I have to push ah push the pill
 into the wiener meat to try and disguise it and then I give I give one piece with
 pill into the dog's mouth and quickly offer him a second piece no pill so that
 he'll wolf it all down cuz half the time Bill is smart he will eat the wiener
 around the pill and spit out the pill he's such a little fucker so I get him
 face Paul look at his face and I've had Botox this is all right fighting through
 let me tell you so much emotion coming through Matt Donnelly's face here's the
 problem through a chemical that numbs skin Bill spit out so many pieces that I
 had to go in for more hot dogs I had to renew a couple more hot dogs is it
 possible that Bill also hates your fucking new the second the sec now he
 loves them this is the thing I was like and these things think so bad that the
 dogs are gonna go crazy hot dogs it makes me fart like makes that already
 gets it going yeah Matt Matt Matt microwave hot dogs I mean do you boil
 water and boil them on the stove is that your move grill them like a human being
 grill them where am I gonna grill a hot oh like on a pan that's a lot of stuff
 barbecue grill man that's a lot of work no thank you nothing easier than
 grilling a barbecue I would argue putting a putting a hot dog into the microwave
 for a minute is far easy Paul Paul let me let me help you out here buddy let me
 help you out go to Walmart today get you a George Foreman grill and just be done
 with life no these are gross I would accept the George Foreman grill from you
 right now I'm not I'm not gonna accept the hot dog in the microwave it's a meat
 skin issue okay yes what's it what you don't like what happens on the tech
 thing should be crispy well it gets crispy sometimes no that's impossible in
 the microwave no you're lying to yourself but you're talking to a guy who
 loves the texture of pudding skin so that's kind of what I've got with the
 microwave wiener if that's your level crunch from a hot dog I'm gonna bite
 into a hot dog with crunch gross you're a Nathan's guy huh yeah yeah no fuck that
 shit I don't like me yeah I pay a whole 389 at Aldi's for a Nathan's hot dog you
 like you like you like a natural casing do you also use lambskin condoms is that
 how you roll I only I only eat lambskin condoms yeah but off you go grill you go
 to go to Aldi buy some lambskin condoms go to IKEA and fill it with a bunch of
 meatballs and my empty could you eat all the meatballs full of IKEA meatball I
 stuff stuff a brat into a lambskin condom and I double grill it's like that's how
 you get that extra crisp it's like a twice baked potato yeah that'd be more
 like a jacketed potato right so so I get this wiener and I'm breaking up the
 pieces of it and this is the second time it's been in the microwave a sec in the
 chat is asking for a scoop fest refund because of the store and is like and is
 like dear God we had to turn the fan on on the window to blow air out of the
 house because it was so stank it was awful and then so oh I've been I've been
 cutting up and squishing all these wieners and this is this is how you know
 it's bad waiters again this is how you know it's bad I threw away what was left
 I threw away the other four wieners you threw away you threw a 44 cents worth of
 wieners never throw away food I don't throw away stuff I don't I rarely do
 these were so bad I was like fuck this I can't I can't possibly but finally got
 microwave his winners maddingly found the bridge too far
 Leon said that fucking gift from I think you should leave is so good so I finally
 got bill to take all his pill finally got all of it done everybody ate meat
 torturing your dog I'll tell you I'll tell you what the cost was the cost was
 the unmistakable stench of a dead cow's penis on my hands after four washings it
 was still there it smelled like from under cheese at the circus it was so
 bad anymore fucking bad I don't like the stink on my fingers would not I put dawn
 soap on it I put all kinds of soft soap on it I I contemplated giving my fingers
 an Epsom salt bath because it was that how it permeated my flesh look Paul do
 you guys buy sponges you have sponges in your kitchen I do have sponges yeah you
 get the sponges with the rough side on the back of it mm-hmm get those put a
 little bit of dish soap on it and use that scrubby side to scrub your hands I
 mean and you have to like you have to really scrub into it but that's that's
 all I get like it would sit on your hands did you let the dawn liquid sit on
 your hands did I let it sit on my hand or did you soak your hands and like
 dish one oh remember remember the palm olive when you would soak your hands in
 it remember that yeah who yeah that's that was a thing that ladies did Paul I
 figured out who made your hot dogs who Al Qaeda Al Qaeda made your hot dogs
 Al Qaeda Al Qaeda hot dogs everybody loves I'll have Al Qaeda Al Qaeda hot
 dogs this is this movie up a wiener from somewhere in a cave there are people
 celebrating the victory of selling those hot dogs and getting the permeate an
 American household here's the thing and my investigative journalist wife we're
 going to collapse them from within she quickly she quickly while she sat on the
 couch many feet away from the kitchen smelling the death and trails she went
 ahead and jumped online to find out what is going on with these wieners she found
 a reddit a reddit thread apparently they changed the recipe on these just like
 two months ago all right everybody is like dear God what is this this is not a
 hot dog this is the phallus smelling things it is the nastiest thing people
 were like I've been buying these for a long time now they're really disgusting
 we looked on the ingredients there were all these weird our hot dogs will fly a
 plane right into your taste buds they really did the secret ingredient is cat
 shit says fro yag and he's right it was nasty there's all like cumin and lots of
 powders and I don't I don't know like for a while it was like chicken and beef
 for the top ingredients they're not anymore
 yeah never forget the flavors right oh god yes he looked at the ingredients
 after he was done yeah well I didn't eat any well and dared me to eat a little
 bite and I ate a little bite and it was so nasty when was the last time you
 purchased something from a grocery store that your wife then had to dare you to
 eat or cause her to me they get on reddit to figure out what was going on
 when I've been into it I chewed up a little bit it was like it was like kind
 of like a falafel meat if it had been on a New York sidewalk for a couple days
 like a gyro you mean yeah like a gyro but like really like I'm like somebody
 stepped on this here gyro this big cut like the gyros that would come with it
 would just be like the weird gray meat you never you never quite knew where it
 came from yes yes yeah yeah yeah just a rotating pile of something yeah so it
 was it was bad and and she was looking up all these different people saying oh
 god these these hot dogs just are are the nastiest thing I've ever eaten this
 is gross I don't know what's going on with this and then the kicker was she
 looked on the on the bag to find out what the branding and everything it's an
 all-the-in-house thing but she saw on the packaging it says explicitly do not
 recycle this plastic
 labels that says hey this plastic is not recyclable no but this one was like
 warning what did it say why I can tell you my theory okay it's contaminated
 there's something horribly wrong with it oh anyway it was really gross it was
 really really bad oh I just did a search on our new Aldi hot dogs good is oh yeah
 search that okay yeah one of the lines is people have had experience with bad
 experiences with recent quality issues like the hot dogs being too greasy okay
 too small okay or leaking yeah what a horrible adjective leaking the hot dogs
 are leaking people hot dogs our kind of hot dogs the leaky is tweener you can
 buy mom call the cops the hot dogs are leaking the hot dogs are leaking put
 your thumb in it I mean this is sort of canary in the coal mine times though
 guys we're on the front we're on the front lines of do not give those hot dogs
 any canaries very relaxed very oh there's there they're probably 10% canary
 very relaxed FDA guidelines at this point you know our food safety is gonna
 go we're getting rid of red dye number five or whatever sure we are sure we are
 and replacing it with important important asbestos from Russia pureed
 sea turtle yeah huh you know who else is eating the leaky hot dog lately that's
 the following sponsor today's show Matt and Madeline's ice cream social is
 brought to you by Jacob's guide to taking notes on how things are sexy but
 not sexual how young is too young and to make this distinction this is Jacob's
 number one fan scoop submitting this in 2024 once again that product is so the
 the name is Jacob's number one fan scoop that's who submitted this okay
 November of 2024 good it's Jacob's guides to taking notes on how things are
 sexy but not sexual how young is too young to make this distinction I don't
 know the last I don't the tagline to at all hey listen no hundred percent this
 is what it is what it is is bananas I'm talking about bananas now they're sexy
 right they're not sexual I mean you can use them but I wouldn't but they're kind
 of sexy right but how young is too young green green means too young if there's
 green on the matter don't play ball that's all you gotta do that's that's
 simple rule just stay away from green manners also leaky wieners stay away
 from green manners and leaky winners mean too young too young I mean I'm an
 old grandpappy pappy van Winkleman so give me my old man on drinks I want my
 old all my drinks should be named after a very old gentleman all I want in my
 mouth is elderly men that's it I don't know I'm gonna drink any young people
 elderly men slurp gulp let's go papa van Winkle gentleman Jack dusty old
 granddad's hat box fart McGee and terrible terrible uncle Arthur those are
 my favorite one terrible uncle Arthur's tantrums is the most fierce whiskey I've
 ever had terrible uncle Arthur's tantrums I guess I got a case of that
 shit oh they bottle it in Lithuania I found out and they only sell it after
 it's been aged for 40 months in the open air they don't have any they just leave
 it out in a bucket in a very thin very shallow bucket terrible uncle Arthur's
 awful tantrums or something like that it's called I can't remember exactly how
 I phrased it uncle Arthur's terrible tantrum whiskey go ahead and get some of
 that what it's basically they put it on I get you some they they age it in a bed
 pan open open face bed pan 100% it check out you put those bananas and lambskin
 condoms crispy I went and saw the Wizard of Oz at the sphere last night we
 should have been sled with that we shouldn't talked about hot dogs for the
 a block you know what you know what I just gave you 20 minutes of gold from a
 fucking rotten pigs asshole shut up liquid fire shit gold is what you gave
 me my also make Wizard of Oz the a block but then we fell into this pile of gold
 and I can tell you this Judy Garland doesn't microwave up half as nice as an
 Aldi wiener that is true that is true you take that she's real sticky you take
 that back you don't disparage my Judy
 holy shit the sphere is still amazing yeah the sphere remains amazing they I
 I think they might have found their thing I think they might have found
 their thing that's gonna make money every day when they don't have concerts
 in that building just reboot movies I specifically this one this is okay so
 that it's so weird so it's not the whole movie they have taken the movie they
 have edited out big chunks of it so the whole thing is only like 70 minutes I
 think huh I think I think the whole movie about 70 minutes they've used you
 know there's a ton of AI there's a ton of processing there's all these things
 because basically they're taking all the scenes that are zoomed in so like if
 you're if you're zoomed in on Annie M for instance in one scene where she's
 standing in a room talking to people you don't just see her zoomed in you see the
 whole room of filled with filled with like whoever's in the room that she's
 talking to you got it so they they took things from the movie they took
 implications from the movie and expanded those out and fleshed those out it was
 really neat a lot of AI stuff a lot of a fit not a lot but a fair amount of
 background characters I don't know how you guys are watching movie and TV
 scenes with big groups of people I find myself always watching the extras I
 think we've talked about this before oh no I don't they're little people I only
 look at the stars
 little people is the right thing to say yeah yeah guys eat all the hot dogs you
 fuckers oh no no eat shit it's better for you that's it that's the new curse
 all the hot dogs upon your house oh god the worst thing your house will be
 uninhabitable it'll smell too bad yeah no I look at background characters in
 fact that's actually my kids will do that too and they actually discovered
 their own grandmother and numerous scenes because they realized that back
 when my my mother-in-law was doing a bunch of background work all the time
 right up in the background of some of their favorite shows and she'd forgotten
 she'd done that show or something it's very yeah she had forgotten that she had
 animated herself into spongebob squarepants she was an extra on it so
 this is where they're using you know whatever AI technology CGI technology to
 create you know larger groups that fill the whole screen and stuff like that
 right that's right and they're making a whole new scenes and intro scenes like
 when the when the house lands in Oz instead of just opening like like in the
 in the movie Dorothy opens the door to the to the house that just landed and she
 walks out into Oz she walks out into munchkin land in this there's the whole
 storm scene and by the way they've got you know huge wind machines and snow and
 all kinds of shit falls on you and the chairs vibrate and it's a whole 4d
 experience but on a 20,000 seat scale instead of 100 seat scale at the at the
 fair or whatever so it's really all this stuff they they start the movie after
 Dorothy has already interacted with mrs. Gulch with the witch so like they start
 the movie a good 15 minutes in basically they start the movie about two minutes
 before she's seeing somewhere over the rainbow mm-hmm so I mean they just skip
 through a lot of stuff but I mean it is it is neat and there it was full you
 know 20,000 people in there or however many people they have is their occupancy
 for the for the movie stuff well it's already it was like you know it's it's
 doing the number one tourism thing which is people plan trips around coming out
 to see it right and apparently we were talking to a buddy of mine who's one of
 the people who run the show over there he was saying they've already sold over
 400,000 tickets jeez Lord yeah so like they're just you know I mean because we
 went to the show last night that was their second show of the nighters
 that's every Raiders game for the season for the thousand yeah close yeah close
 to right right that ballpark yeah for sure well I'll tell you what's
 encouraging to me is seeing is seeing so many of my local friends getting acting
 work inside the theater as extras and sort of like guests and hosts and all
 that kind of thing yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah a bunch of people a bunch of
 people I know are working yeah I was like wow like Marcus is there and yeah
 I saw a picture I was like this is just like a who's who of people I've worked
 with in the past this is cool yeah yeah so well it eliminates all these other
 shows and jobs it's nice that they picked up our friends on the way which
 is good that's right well I mean we didn't talk about that last night we
 talked about that with with a friend of ours James last night he was like oh no
 one of the guys running the show he was like all these great shows in town and
 we're just selling fuck tons of tickets I know it's hurting the other shows in
 town yeah yeah I was like yeah it's true but I mean it's also part of it you know
 it's biggest goes through changes and that's the song we all think of when we
 hear changes and you know like every show you have every every casino you
 have a production show right right like used to have some kind of big big show
 that song song and dance and you'd have five every song every casino hired 50
 dancers and sure just went away they dance on the Decca Lee Titanic watt-sank
 that's right that's what it lasted longest Jubilee right yeah but but
 everybody you know even the Penn and Teller theater the Rio used to have a
 production show in there and that's why it's like such a big backstage area for
 Penn and Teller it's because it always used to be also they used to also split
 it with dance with a dance team yeah so it's you know it is interesting that
 like you know Cirque du Soleil has been open for you know 30 40 years right in
 this town right and and so you know it's interesting that like a literal death
 star got built in the middle of the strip and you're like oh no but that's a
 license they still haven't gotten they still haven't been able to just make
 themselves into the Death Star this is when you're talking about the way you're
 talking about this very experience this this was Star Trek this is Star Trek the
 experience oh yeah yeah especially I mean the dome was what they built you in the
 I don't know you went to that listen motherfucker they built the dome for the
 original Klingon encounter which worked with the the actual motion ride carts
 all right the vehicles and then when they put in 4d only the ending of that
 was a theatrical 4d experience but it had seats that would poke you in the
 ass and squirt you with water and shoot you with air and stuff oh dude I mean it
 didn't have the dick sucking alien like I would propose we're getting there
 we're getting there eventually it'll every day we're a little bit closer to
 that dick-sucking alien did you see it happened at the corn concert did you see
 it see what specifically there was a guy at a corn concert up in the up in the
 nosebleeds jacking it during going at it during this is going whole hogs her in
 the show and a bunch of people like hey dude knock it off and he's like no I'm
 getting there like he went he went to completion on him he didn't give a damn
 yeah so like the last corn that sir is the second nastiest thing that's been
 discussed on this show today that is horrible so I don't know I didn't know
 Lucy Kate likes corn everybody likes corn Matt all right they're hard to
 digest though okay so all right Vegas politics and entertainment see change
 and all that stuff aside yes let's get it what's getting the actual experience
 of going to see Wizard of Oz we get that they open the doors I think 45 minutes
 early so we get there they have decked out they've added a whole bunch of stuff
 to the lobby so there's all new LEDs and all there's a mini sphere in the lobby
 that people in the zoom chat just saw a minute ago so that they do all kinds of
 Wizard of Oz scenes on that after the movie is over that's when they do a live
 performance they do they do live performance afterwards you get to like
 interact with the wizard they've got a huge hologram an interactive hologram of
 the wizard that appears out in the lobby and sorry Jacob breaking news we're
 getting updates in the chat about the guy jerking off with the corn concert
 turns out people were punching him in the back of the head and trying to try
 to basically stop him they were trying to stop him he did I don't think they
 stopped him what they didn't realize was featuring out a bug to the guy Jack
 like he's like he loves a good donkey punch he's like oh yeah no don't hit me
 no please oh I hate that you're hitting me so much human contact certainly won't
 put me over the edge no definitely not with strangers so was Darren the the
 wizard when you were there Darren was not the wizard when I was there but our
 friend James Simpson was he was the the guard the you know you can't see the
 wizard nobody sees the wizard not nobody not know how that James is the used to
 work at 50 shades right yes yeah yeah yeah you know James yeah he's good guy
 very good yeah we even got we even got a special little just us picture with with
 James and the wizard and in their costumes oh that's awesome yeah it's on
 SJ's phone or I'd show it to you James James knows everyone everyone knows yes
 yes he is one of those workhorses for Vegas that's right like every show yes
 that's right so we were there it is so what I want to talk about it's so weird
 to watch a movie that assumes that everyone is not only already seen that
 movie but that everyone is very familiar with it yeah yeah yeah so like like I
 said earlier like the movie doesn't start with all of the setup that the
 real movie starts with it doesn't start with you're getting to know the
 characters it doesn't it they're like you know these characters we all know
 that you know these characters we're gonna skip over this part we're not
 gonna have this 20 minutes in the movie where we get to know Dorothy and Annie
 M and uncle Henry and all these people like you don't need to know that you
 know who these people are we're going straight over the rainbow she's gonna do
 the over the rainbow then pretty quickly after that we're gonna see Gulch she's
 gonna be there trying to take the dog dogs gonna get away and we're going to
 Oz so like 10 minutes in their defense we're there you have done you have like
 80 years to see the original version you know I'm not really I'm not criticizing
 it but it is the first time I've ever seen something that assumes that you
 already know the full story of the thing that you're watching well the ruby
 slippers are still the number one most valuable movie prop in existence oh they
 have to be they are I'd be I'd be surprised if anything else was close to
 it well I think they might get usurped soon possibly depends on what I just saw
 that by what Jacob what do you think is gonna get you serpent go ahead oh okay I
 think it'll be the giant robot from Pacific Rim Luke Skywalker's lightsaber
 handle yeah you're closer there Matt yeah it's an original screen used Vader
 lightsaber that is going up for sale oh Leon Kassab says that Rosebud is the
 number two most expensive prop yes found in the trash that that makes sense too
 yeah it was we don't want to any spoilers for citizen Kane to anyone has
 not yet seen citizen Kane go ahead fast forward about 15 seconds while we do all
 the spoilers for citizen Kane yeah I think the the next sphere show so make
 sure you vote up on it I think absolutely no kidding around go to the
 sphere to watch this again oh that'd be amazing actually I do that today that'd
 be great I maybe don't get that that'd be really cool it would be really good
 they could do a lot of crazy shit with citizen Kane so watching this movie with
 the assumption watching a watching a movie play that is assuming that I don't
 need to get any information from the movie is a weird experience already and
 then watching a movie that I have seen I mean who knows how many times I've seen
 the Wizard of Oz in my life I mean probably hundreds if not thousands of
 times back when we were kids it was on TV at least once a year of course yeah
 and I would watch it all yeah it was a big man TV yeah I've embarrassed my mom
 by saying this before but my mom did famously asked me one time a few years
 ago when they colorized the the middle part of Wizard of Oz oh my and I had to
 break it to her that they had not colorized it they that's how the movie
 had been made it was the first part in sepia and second part in color she said
 oh no no no when I was a little girl it was all in black and white mmm I said
 mom no no no when she was watching it she was watching it at her home on a
 black and white television me exactly so it was all black and white just only for
 her oh people who watched it on black and white TVs I was like now you were
 watching in the black just you just be the family be carving up the recently
 microwaved hot dog and they'd watch it watch it over at the old black and white
 TV Thanksgiving math they never had the luxury of microwaved hot dogs in the
 50s I didn't know the joys of the pudding just good a metal spirit through
 it and put two lighters on both ends they did do that shit they fucking would
 fork it and cook it like that all crazy that crazy remember do you ever see that
 walk and cooked hot dog over a fire still sounds better than microwaved hot
 dog sure did you ever see that hot dog cooker that you could put in your car
 yes see that shit yeah it plugged into the fucking lighter and you could cook
 hot dogs in your car like a monster now that's as good as the booze fridges
 though the booze fridges that were built into the car well boy those were the
 days you get like the the refrigerator built into the glove compartment and
 shit yeah oh so good this is where you keep your martini shaker while you're in
 the car they had that they had booze fridges hot dog cookers yeah places
 where you could shit and smoke prostitute prostitute dumpers old cars
 had it all man I was just the trunk yeah well I mean but it was sold as a
 prostitute dumper nobody nobody carried their trunks back then yeah they didn't
 call it the trunk they called it the prostitute dumper yeah we call it the
 truck before I take it for a test drive how many gallons is this prostitute
 dumper oh this is an 80 gallon prostitute dumper all right there's a lot
 of prostitute dumper in there so I can get probably what three prostitutes in
 there oh four four petite ones four petite prostitutes before I have to take
 her in for servicing absolutely sir all right all right I'll take it good sir
 you won't be you won't be disappointed and because you got it today just after
 Labor Day I'm gonna throw in two prostitutes in the prostitute dumper free
 of charge Wow prostitutes get the dumper start the hot dog machine and grab
 yourself a cold seltzer oh I love seltzer well I have some cold seltzer in
 my booze cabinet but only the seltzer is for the prostitutes toots don't get
 booze no booze for toots no booze for toots no booze for toots
 toots in the boot that's what the UK's called the boots called the toot boot oh
 I'll tell you who else has put prostitutes in the boot of the car not
 in the trunk just in the prostitute dump today's show is brought to you by hey

 of my trainers reaching in feet deep with their gloved arms and grabbing at
 whatever remains inside my digestive tract I've had full full bales of hay

 oh I took a double dose and I've prolapsed oh no help me I'm inside sir you
 have to leave the studio now well come on let me stay my anus is hanging out

 you smell almost as bad as a microwaved Aldi hot dog look I've got a bag for it
 oh oh that's fine I bring this I bring this bag and bass cart to tote around my
 prolapsed anus you know people come to me after listening to this show they say how do you guys
 come up with all this material writing meetings and sit around and really really
 come up with different ideas and really workshop them and everything I go no we
 actually come up with everything right there on the fly we just we just go
 through and we talk about stuff and we have conversations and sometimes it
 takes us to fun places like a horse a talking horse with us we don't we don't
 think about that at all before the show starts that's just what comes up but
 it's all we'll think about after no no still the second most disgusting things
 that on this show basically got a radio flyer wagon designed specifically to
 carry what's there - how do you carry your - I carry mine in a flyer way thank
 you radio flyer what I like about the radio flyer it's the color match the
 color matches pretty good it's fairly it's fairly unobtrusive and people who
 don't know wouldn't wouldn't even know it's like I'm not wearing anything at
 all it's very inconspicuous Wizard of Oz thumbs up worth going very expensive
 expensive but but a fun ticket and definitely a different experience than
 anything I've seen I think anywhere before right yeah yeah it's a crazy
 thing it's a crazy thing for sure so you thought you think they're just gonna
 like well I mean I guess they're gonna keep cranking that one is there is it an
 indefinite run I think so yeah yeah I think it'll run until people stop buying
 thousands of tickets for it I actually know it's not even fully finished that's
 true they're still adding they're still gonna be adding more things to it yeah
 and they're selling stuff is there a merch thing associated oh definitely oh I
 got a shirt I got a Wizard of Oz shirt for sure yeah you know me and my merch
 laughs at me every time we go to a concert or something Jacob will go buy
 the merch is it a is it specifically sphere themed there's one t-shirt where
 you it says you putting a pill into a hot dog meat for Toto mm-hmm they got
 that in there Oh Oh if you don't eat this pill you'll get fleas and ticks I
 know it makes my hands smell like the underside of a hobo's rectum but please
 just have it just the underside yes the underside of the uncovered underside of
 the whole underside of a hobo's rectum yes it smells like Binda leavings
 enter a scoop to check out yeah yeah not totally finished with your scoop is it's
 what they're calling it's in its edging phase it's in its right phase the
 Wizard of Oz I also ran into a friend of mine we went to the sphere with our
 cousins who were in town and they were laughing at us actually the same thing
 that we were talking about with James earlier they were like holy shit is it
 fun going out to entertainment things with Jacob and SJ because we just see
 people that we know the entire time of course so one of the people that we ran
 into was the artistic director from over at the new area 15 universal horror
 nights and yeah so she like they've just gotten opened over there they're
 cranking it out I think they're still gonna make some changes over there I
 don't think they're done just like the sphere so I mean it is that that gives me
 a little bit of hope when we're talking about the the entertainment jobs going
 away and yeah oh yeah there's all there's old stuff that's getting hurt
 but there's always new stuff coming in as well so it's always a fun it's funny
 that you mentioned that getting going around getting recognized and being the
 gad about that she is and working in all these coffee shops she is also
 becoming like well-renowned we went sure we went to the Thai place for lunch
 yesterday she goes in the first time my name's Anne the first person to see this
 is a former employee of hers and they're having a nice sweet conversation the
 whole time and then as she's walking we're walking us to a table a long-time
 customer says oh hey I thought that was you and so she's just she's getting know
 everybody in this Berg it's amazing so it's really lovely it's really lovely
 somebody should know everybody in Pittsburgh she's very popular she's very
 popular well she's in the Autobot Society she is brother a member in good
 standing how much more popular do you want to be can't be much more popular
 I'll tell you what's gonna make you very unpopular how badly you're gonna do with
 this Jack versus nerd suck eggs how long till I'll take the OZ I'll take the egg
 smell I'll take the sucking egg smell over the explosion of nuked meats I'm
 gonna tell you right now I had a whole other jock versus nerd picked out today
 I changed it over to this one once we start talking about the hot dogs okay
 this is from Leon Kasab good afternoon gentlemen here is my brand new Mikey style quiz
 oh that I am titled real or fake food brands okay I was inspired by another
 podcast I listen to that will occasionally cover press releases for
 new products from food change chains it is an endless well of what the fuck I
 think it could be nicely modified into a Mikey style quiz rules are simple is
 this food item real or fake I will provide a description that has come
 directly out of a press release or news story on the product or description that
 I made up you know how it works I'm pretty proud of this one enjoy so is
 Leon and Leon is happy with this one so I'm gonna give you a food description
 you're gonna tell me if it's real or fake okay Pizza Hut the world's largest
 pizza company is bringing together two of America's most popular treats Paul
 pizza and hot dogs in the form of its all-new hot dog bites pizza the American
 rendition of the popular global pie features 28 premium mini hot dog bites
 baked into the crust and is served with a side of French's mustard is this real
 or fake it goes to me sure yeah it's real Paul says real Matt I agree it's
 real we are committed to bringing more flavor and fun to the pizza category
 than anyone else and our new hot dog bites pizza is an absolutely epic flavor
 mashup inspired by two of America's favorite foods says Jared drink water
 vice president of marketing at Pizza Hut last year Americans ate an estimated
 150 million hot dogs over the July 4th holiday we've taken the appropriate
 steps to notify the National Sausage and Hot Dog Council that they will need to
 adjust their statistics for 2015 thanks to Pizza Hut's induction into hot dog
 bites pizza that's horrible someone in the chats as they ate it and did not
 enjoy it really interesting that's the person who didn't enjoy that first thing
 I think of when I think of pizza is hot dog all right we got a one-to-one tie
 right now Matt you're up first on this one and oh good news Matt it's Starbucks
 somebody says hot dog I say so as you saw from the first one these are from all
 they're not necessarily present so the the hot dog pizza I guess it was on 15
 hot dogs on a pizza hey you got it possible he got a pretty good idea Jimmy
 why don't we try to Jimmy Matt is Starbucks gravy latte real or fake
 description this holiday season Starbucks is introducing the Thanksgiving
 latte a savory beverage combining rich turkey breast broth with steam milk top
 sage infused foam pair it with your favorite pie slice for the ultimate
 festive indulgence pie slice as you know I get the fuck out of here as we know
 Starbucks sits around and just daydreams about women in giant SUVs sitting at a
 drive-thru for 20 minutes and that's right and pulling out something that has
 a specific color and so this fits none of those categories and so I'm going to
 say false false fake any fake I will say they do some stupid shit in the name of
 capitalist chicanery that fucking CEO that came in a while back and he knew a
 guy who knew a guy who had a fuck ton of olive oil they started putting olive oil
 in some of the lattes like that was a thing like anybody ever put a fucking stupid
 not a thing but they actually played nationally rolled that out sold lattes
 with olive oil in it get the fuck out of here but no there's no way there's
 gravy fucking coffee no they are doing protein foam which is close to gravy I
 make some of that at home I make my home protein foam double crisp double crisp
 the protein foam that means that is fake it is still tied two to two the holiday
 special number three for you Paul okay scoffee cup from KFC scoffee cup scoffee
 scoffee cup from KFC okay have you ever desired a sweet snack while you're
 drowning that morning coffee on the run but really can't afford to use your other
 hand to hold it well Kentucky Fried Chicken has a game-changer for you and
 the fast food chain is pushing the limits of what we consider a beverage
 container with its latest announcement it's called the scoffee cup an edible
 cup made out of a wafer biscuit wrapped in sugar paper and lined with a heat
 resistant white chocolate no phony baloney Paul says phony baloney Matt I
 sure baloney phony let's go for it I would drink this the answer it's real
 shut the fuck up what if our customers occasionally like to have their cake and
 eat it why wouldn't we want them to have their cup and eat it instead that's from
 KFC spokeswoman Jocelyn boney maybe told the USA Today the cups also feature
 aromas and come with the scents coconut suncream and freshly cut grass the those
 last few descriptions are disgusting but that is a lawsuit waiting to happen I
 don't think rolled it out nationally though I don't feel like I think it's not
 I've never seen that in my neighborhood yeah I don't know I don't know if that's
 a current thing or a past thing I think that thing failed miserably well it's so
 Leon Casaba saying it's British he wrote this thing so there you go but that
 makes sense now thinking about it as it's a scone cup it's not scoffee that
 does make sense right it's pot scone pot cup in it it allot me a cup a lot me a
 scone why not we do both for the same thing governor give me a scoff a scoffee
 it's probably pronounced scoffee oh I messed you up Paul I'm sorry tonight yes
 when you said they scoffee I was like scoffing at their customers no I don't
 Paul will continue this game of jock versus nerd under protest I don't give
 up number four the nightmare King sandwich from Burger King math is for
 you Burger King says its new sandwich is clinically proven to induce nightmares
 in time for Halloween the fast foods change chains Nightmare King is
 available through November 1st at participating locations nationwide this
 spooky sandwich features a quarter pound of flame grilled meat a white meat
 crispy chicken fillet melted American cheese thick cut bacon creamy mayonnaise
 and onions on a glazed green sesame seed bun true Matt says true Paul what he's
 saying true it is true according to previous studies 4% of the population
 experiences nightmares on any given night says dr. lead say Bob and oh I
 guess they really did a study after eating the Nightmare King the data
 obtained from the study indicated that the incidence of nightmares increased by
 3.5 times after eating that sandwich I believe you is the nightmare diarrhea
 Latter-day scoop yes is this always the nightmare is this some fucking CIA shit
 what is going on here this is CIA shit yeah MK ultra yeah yeah no I checked it
 out it's MK ultra CIA shit okay that's what I did in president galactic
 superstar Paul peanut butter infused water from a combination of Reese's and
 Dasani two of America's favorite brands have combined combined to provide the
 new peanut butter infused water a first-of-its-kind hydration experience
 combining the crisp purity of Dasani spring water with subtle creamy peanut
 butter undertones of Reese's cups peanut butter designed to provide flavor
 protein and hydration for your next workout well Dasani is the worst water

 all has a stand and he will take it I will say this is a legit thing I'll say

 their red blend well I will say my last shift at the old Tarjay we just
 unloaded a big old bunch of a new cheese it that's being unleashed
 baconator flavor it's a Wendy's combo baconator cheese it so cheese it is not
 above this I will say yes they are doing this this is real all right showed his

 selling that on the princess cruises it's a real deal I don't see why let's
 do one more here cat and crunch delights from Taco Bell this item is Taco Bell's
 first variation on Cinnabon delights a cream filled donut hole reminiscent of
 Cinnabon's cinnamon rolls the new cat and crunch delights are a donut hole
 version of a bowl of cat and crunch berries cereal with milk the pastry
 evokes a giant crunch berry with the familiar flaming pink color not found in
 nature the cream filling represents sweet cereal milk and the pastry is
 rolled in a coating of crushed cat and crunch cereal yeah I know whatever it is
 it sounds super healthy well I don't if this is this supposed to be ad copy or
 just yeah that would be their ad copy or their their press release but they
 wouldn't say they wouldn't say not found in nature I don't think oh
 interesting that's my and the my other thought is Cinnabon having the the name
 of that stuff like they're not gonna share that with another company unless
 they're owned by the same parent company which I don't know they could be because
 there's only like four companies but I'm good is it my guess no it's Matt's guess
 okay but you're doing great yeah Paul give me a lot of help there I'm gonna
 guess fake yeah Paul I too say fake Matt you got you got Paul the answer is real
 oh shit I should have called it say real with Paul the rest of the way yeah the
 new breakfast item went into test Tuesday at units in Bakersfield
 California names to bring back sugary childhood memories of cat crunches
 crunch berry cereal it's a nostalgic throwback brand from when you were a
 kid said Amanda Clark Taco Bell's senior director of marketing we feel like it
 will appeal to what we call kiddults or the kid adults out there about what the
 hell what the hell kind of person would that be what do they mean what could
 they possibly be talking about kiddult that whatever whatever that sounds like
 some made-up bullshit that sounds like some kiddult get the fuck it fuck you
 talking about that's that's bullshit craziness we got two more to do here
 let's let's wrap them up Gatorade pickle punch Paul oh god
 description hydration meets brine with pickle punch a new limited edition
 Gatorade flavor formulated for athletes who swear by pickle juice for cramps
 electrolytes combined with zesty dill in this bold refreshment man Gatorade
 pickle punch being out here in the Berg everything gets pickled up okay they
 have a fucking pickle festival pickles Berg they call it pickles Berg sure
 everybody puts pickle on everything everything is pickle nobody puts pickle
 in the corner limited edition Gatorade pickle I must say I know I bet that's
 gonna be nasty tasting I'm gonna say no just cuz I think it's nasty and Paul
 thinks it's nasty so he thinks it doesn't exist Matt true it is false now
 got exciting now we're back down to a nail biter going only up by one right
 the last question last question this one goes to Matt first
 Tostino's salsa cereal there is no better snack duo on game day Tostino's
 chips and salsa appearing so beloved that even die-hard football fans are
 willing to take their eyes off the game to get the perfect bite but this season
 Tostino's and legendary wide receiver Julian Edelman are changing the game
 and introducing the most creative way to snack Tostino's salsa cereal for those
 asking themselves what salsa cereal is it's exactly what it sounds like eating
 chips and salsa with a bowl and a spoon it's a clever twist on the classic chips
 and salsa pairing that has been a game day staple for decades but makes it
 easier than ever for football fans to enjoy the game without ever needing to
 miss a second of the action plus milk plus milk what the fuck
 Matt you're up first false Tostino's salsa cereal false in Matt's opinion Paul
 I'll tell you what gamesmanship and the only other thing is they included the
 name of a player that could just do nobody could have included the name of
 an NFL player without it being real no I got a gamesmanship I gotta I gotta true
 it are you going true I have to to games true on the salsa cereal because this is
 me and Matt oh I guess you're right I guess that is the right games play - yeah
 I have to he guessed false I gotta guess true that's true yeah yeah so it is it
 is the right gameplay move to make and and honestly the use of the name of a
 player they don't you know there you go yeah they don't just throw names you don't have players
 around like that like there's nothing that's true that is true it's real Paul
 is right oh my god disgusting horrific as game day staples Tostino's chips and
 salsa have always gone hand-in-hand with watching football said Leslie Vesper
 vice president of marketing Pepsi Co Foods North America salsa cereal is the
 latest way we're bringing fans new experiences to enjoy the game and snacks
 to go with it no nope god damn it no not interested
 Leslie Vesper not interested in that's horrific that is horrific but I knew it
 as soon as they grabbed a player name bar doesn't make sense that that logic
 doesn't make sense I mean you were correct and I'm wrong but it's very easy
 to write a player's name into a fake thing but Matt we have discussed this
 many many times I get to the right answer the wrong way all the time oh
 Jesus there it is look see it's got his face on the chat Julian Edelman's salsa
 cereal oh my gross that's gross how turned on I am by it yeah we'll see if
 the corn concert don't hit me in the back of the head but that's the big
 thing right now is having these players and people you know do these big
 collabos yeah there was some person I was it's happening now to me to the
 point where because I'm unloading all these boxes of shit and there's a some
 cereal that's coming out with some music person I'm like I have never heard of
 this person I am a thousand years old I discovered something this week
 completely unrelated to anything else I've discovered the thing that I think
 makes me feel the oldest what is it you guys have anything that when you see it
 it just it just immediately makes you feel old young people working me working
 these for me I believe it is the genre k-pop oh if I see or hear a k-pop music
 I just got fuck I'm old yeah yeah cuz I'll tell you cuz I'm so stupid I'm so
 old and it still makes me feel old I like more j-pop I don't really know
 anything about k-pop I know some j-pop k-pop besides black pink I'm at a loss I
 like icy pops icy pops are delicious what's your favorite flavor cherry for
