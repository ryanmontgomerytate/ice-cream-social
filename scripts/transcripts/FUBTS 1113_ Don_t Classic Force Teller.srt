00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:52,480
 Hey, I'm Matt. I'm R.J. That's Ready Rich. Hello. And this is Fool Us! Behind the Scenes Season 11

9
00:00:52,480 --> 00:01:07,440
 Episode 13. Brought to you by Gershman's Magic Shop and Deli. I just figured out Zoom.

10
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:17,280
 I'm in San Antonio. R.J.'s in Las Vegas. I ended up hitting a bizarre traffic thing as someone who's

11
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,640
 out of town. It took me 12 minutes to leave downtown San Antonio and 42 minutes to get back.

12
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,440
 So, R.J. stepped up and was hosting the Zoom. R.J.? They were doing you a favor.

13
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:34,800
 Keep me out of town. Keep me out of downtown. Give you some time to think about it. Reconsider.

14
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:41,760
 Don't ever leave here ever again. All right. So, we're going to get off right here. And I wrote a

15
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,200
 special intro for Brooke that was meant to be Barbara Walters' nightmare. A lot of waskily wabbit

16
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:56,000
 words in that. And she crushed it. She nailed it. Moving on. All right. Our first magician is

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,160
 Michael Farrow from Canada. Candice on Michael Farrow. I love his shuffle.

18
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:08,960
 Ready Rich, take us through Michael's routine. Michael the refrigerator Farrow.

19
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,120
 It's called the stack time prediction. Penn and Teller each select several items out of a fridge.

20
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,520
 Teller picks a color from the rainbow and Penn spells a word on the fridge with magnets.

21
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,320
 Michael has the crew roll video to reveal his prediction in it. He pulls the same items out

22
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,360
 of his home refrigerator, puts them on a tablecloth with Teller's color and reveals Penn's word on his

23
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:41,360
 fridge. Yeah. Now, there is a trope that says that all Canadians are just super sweet and nice and

24
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,240
 you know, and he proves it. He's just such, it's him and the other Canadian guy.

25
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:57,520
 They're just, they're so nice that you kind of have to like them, you know. When this trick was

26
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,840
 pulled off and Penn and Teller went back to their seats, the first thing Penn said to us,

27
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:09,440
 well, there's only one way to do that. Yep. There's only one way to do that. And sadly,

28
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:16,880
 the thing that gave it away was not Penn's bust was when he sat down. Had he not sat down at the

29
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:22,560
 table, no one would have been the wiser. You think so? When he sat down at the table, he was in a

30
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,880
 trailer. Yes. And you're like that you're not at your home, right? Unless you live in a trailer

31
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,400
 and not many people live in trailers in Canada because they have free healthcare.

32
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,360
 The trailer, I think I can talk about this. I mean, I don't know. It feels silly to talk

33
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,360
 about this, not talking about the method openly, but. Well, I can say it and you can read that.

34
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,480
 All right. Yeah. You don't know the method. So you can, you can tell. He's got a twin brother.

35
00:03:52,480 --> 00:04:01,280
 Without confirming or denying RJ's speculation. Yes. It was a prediction sealed inside of Winnebago.

36
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:09,040
 Yes. But just what the title of the trick should have been. Yeah. That Winnebago was on, was near

37
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:16,400
 Fool Us. And so we had to worry about where Ben and Teller were coming to work and leaving work

38
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,640
 and if they were leaving for lunch and all this other stuff because they weren't able to notice

39
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:29,680
 what weird as Winnebago next to the production truck. If the real all suites hotel only had RV

40
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,120
 parking. If only. If only. We should have, we move it to Circus Circus next season. We'll be,

41
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,240
 we'll be good to go. There we go. It's a fun trick. It's a really fun thing to pull off.

42
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:50,240
 It kind of is, it's interesting because like from the time we, what's fascinating is from the time

43
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:57,520
 we taped this to the time it aired, how far AI has come. Oh yeah. You know, and like, you know,

44
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:07,120
 there were some pretty cool AI apps sold to magicians out there where you could live predict

45
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,960
 stuff on a pre-recorded piece of video and that kind of things like that. They were getting pretty

46
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:20,160
 sophisticated and now AI has gotten much more sophisticated than those apps and those tricks.

47
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,000
 And so what was curious about this airing was simply that like, I believe a lay person could

48
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:35,040
 just be watch this and just think AI and be bored. Yeah. But it was not the case. But it just goes to

49
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:42,880
 show you like, I think like a little bit of the impossibility. We've reached, we've reached a weird,

50
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:49,360
 a weird, maybe uncounted values, the wrong term here. We've reached a weird spot in lay person's

51
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,360
 brains for watching predictions that like at some point really know. Like I was just talking to

52
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:02,080
 another magician who's doing a variation on West Isley's coin flip. And so he found that with the

53
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,600
 coin flip, this magician's opinion was simply that like having someone picked out of the audience

54
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,120
 and things like that, and having so many details at the end of West Isley's coin flip, if anyone's

55
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:17,440
 familiar, you flip a coin heads and tails, the audience chooses it and the audience slowly

56
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,200
 self-selects down to one person. And one person is one, the coin toss competition and lo and behold,

57
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,920
 there's a prediction with what that person is wearing or even a drawing of them or something

58
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:36,960
 on those lines where they're selected. And I have a friend who decided to hand out a deck of cards

59
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:44,800
 to everybody in the room. And then the coin flip went down to a particular card. There's one person

60
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,800
 left. That person took their card out of their pocket and it was the card was accurate. Yeah.

61
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,360
 I was saying that like, I love it, even though it makes it slightly less impossible than having a

62
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,400
 person completely dead to rights. It is actually much cooler to me that the trick happens just

63
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,200
 simply in the room. Yeah. And I was like saying how much I really liked that adjustment because

64
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,640
 I really liked the idea that it just happened to be a, you're forcing a coincidence and not

65
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,760
 something totally impossible, which is knowing exactly who the exact person was. Right. I would

66
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,680
 have liked to have seen a miss in this. There's a lot of things that I, the two E's I should have

67
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,240
 been swapped. Oh yeah. Yeah. Or just simply have all capital E's or something like that. Yeah.

68
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,120
 Yeah. But he couldn't do all capital E's because there's only uppercase and lowercase. Yeah. But

69
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:39,440
 then also there were too many items that just went on and on and on. Yes. You know, if it's three

70
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:46,000
 items, because the items were just like logically pursued, they didn't build an impossibility,

71
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,520
 right? They just, they just kind of like, and what else is in the fridge, you know?

72
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:56,080
 Right. Yeah. Yeah. On the AI thing, there was that video with the infinite stairs,

73
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:03,200
 like not even 10 years ago, right? There was a viral video with the stairs at the university.

74
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,000
 You remember what I'm talking about? I don't. With the people going up the stairs and they

75
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,080
 were on the same floor. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I remember that. Yeah. It's the same method as

76
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,960
 this trick. Right. Right. Right. But it really fooled people, even a lot of magicians. That's

77
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,880
 true. It wasn't set up as a magic trick. It was set up as like a magic spot. Yeah. Right. Time warp.

78
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:32,080
 I do know what you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah. And that would just not register as anything

79
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,080
 with anybody. Right. Yeah. I mean, that's, that's, that's the, that's the difficult thing.

80
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,840
 Proprietary knowledge is certainly a magician's friend, right? And in this case, you know,

81
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:50,160
 very proprietary. And, you know, there's only so many ways you can take advantage of it where the

82
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,400
 audience just isn't going to catch up eventually. Right. And this is, you know, I think when you

83
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,600
 try to come up with magic tricks, you're like, what's impossible, right? So you're always trying

84
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,080
 to come up with the most impossible thing. And then the only guiding principles you have are like,

85
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,280
 don't run when you're not being chased. And the two perfect principle. Right. And the other one,

86
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,280
 packs flat plays big, which is completely broken.

87
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:24,320
 Does pack though. It does pack. Hard to ship that Winnebago.

88
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:32,400
 That's not a portable refrigerator. I guess technically it was a portable refrigerator.

89
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:40,080
 I've said before, my mother in law was, her mother was in a vaudeville trio. She has a 66 key piano

90
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,960
 on iron castor wheels in her living room. And that was considered a portable piano in vaudeville days.

91
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,120
 So yes, that is a portable refrigerator.

92
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:58,000
 Havin B3 was commonly chopped to be portable, but still at 418 pounds.

93
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,960
 They just took the legs and the pedals off.

94
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:08,000
 All right. We've had our people on Patreon join us today.

95
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,800
 Does anybody have any thoughts on Michael Farah?

96
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
 I felt that there was too much clue.

97
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,880
 Too much clue in the trick itself and the performance itself?

98
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,200
 No, too much clue from Penn. Oh, yeah, yeah.

99
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,440
 He did two digs at the clue and only needed the first one.

100
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,400
 Interesting. Okay. That's fair. I think that is fair

101
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,640
 because even as someone here in the chat, Ron says he understood.

102
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,080
 He had a different theory and then Penn's bust made him go like, ah, so there you go.

103
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,160
 And if Ron got it, then everyone gets it because Ron's dumb.

104
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,800
 Is that what I just sounded like? Thanks, man.

105
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:54,960
 That was not what I was going for, but I thought that's what I sounded like.

106
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,400
 So I had to call myself out.

107
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:07,360
 All right. Moving on, we have Julio Moreno.

108
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:14,480
 Julio, a former fooler and on Wikipedia, described as a fooler in this episode, but not a fooler.

109
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,760
 But take us to Julio's trick. He was a fooler in the past.

110
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,680
 That's probably the mistake there. Yeah.

111
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,320
 This is Spongeball Synchronicity. Teller picks a card.

112
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,760
 Julio puts it in the deck.

113
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,440
 On fanning the deck, a Spongeball rises and pushes out Teller's card.

114
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,360
 Julio repeats this several times before ditching the deck and moving to phase two,

115
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,480
 where the Spongeball multiplies and invisibly transposes between his hands,

116
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,280
 following the action of Teller's now-torn card.

117
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,640
 In the final phase, the four Spongeballs heal into one large ball as the card is reassembled.

118
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,040
 Then the healed Spongeball restores the torn card.

119
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:58,400
 I am impressed by Julio's ability to do what he does with those little tiny sausage fingers that he has.

120
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:04,640
 They got one overhead shot of the table in his hands, and I'm like,

121
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,480
 he's got snossages for fingers. How is he hiding anything?

122
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,600
 And they did them dirty, real dirty, at one of the angles.

123
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,080
 They did, yeah.

124
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,440
 Yeah, the first transposition.

125
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,520
 Yeah, the first transposition of the Spongeball when the torn card was in four pieces on the table.

126
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:25,760
 Really shot to some bizarre angle that I've never seen, just to expose the transfer

127
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,040
 and then go back to the scene. I was like, did he piss off Dennis in rehearsal?

128
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:36,480
 That's got to be, that's got to be, I didn't even think of that,

129
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,320
 that if you piss off Dennis in rehearsal, he could do anything he wants to your edit.

130
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,600
 Yeah, no, exactly.

131
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,720
 Oh shit.

132
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:50,400
 No, no, and Dennis really takes a lot of shit, so you can, you could conceivably convince yourself

133
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,440
 that you could say whatever you want to Dennis and it won't affect him, but who knows?

134
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,560
 No.

135
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,920
 The ease of which he does Spongeball routines, I know everybody else that rolls up the sleeves

136
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:08,400
 and does everything else, but the light touch as he packs four balls into Penn's hands and lets go.

137
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,040
 Right.

138
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,360
 Like he, like he barely touches the hand. It is so effortless.

139
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:22,720
 But also his, his retention and swapping of the balls is imperceptible on video watching it.

140
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:22,960
 Yes.

141
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,760
 I mean, he's just, it's, and when he's, when he's doing the false transfer, not false transfer,

142
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,120
 I guess it is the reverse false transfer where he, where he's, he's keep pulling a ball back,

143
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,400
 but popping one out of the other hand to make it look like that's the ball he just set down.

144
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:36,640
 Yeah.

145
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,640
 Is so perfect, just perfect.

146
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:46,080
 And this routine name, the, the writing of this routine is so strong.

147
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,560
 It is like, it is everything you want in it. It is built in a proper order.

148
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,080
 You know, there's a couple of just really nice writing moments where,

149
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,320
 where you just, you know, burn, burn an idea before moving on.

150
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,040
 Right.

151
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,440
 Like I really, if you're, if you're, if you're going to sit down and be like,

152
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,600
 I do sponge balls, but the guy wants me to card tricks, you have like, watch this.

153
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,920
 This guy wrote a perfect routine of transferring.

154
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,720
 Right. Exactly.

155
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,800
 Card tricks. It's really playful, really fun.

156
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,720
 He's so charming.

157
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,600
 Yeah. Yeah. And it just was, it was a really fun routine.

158
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,320
 I was thinking you were probably going to tell the story on the classic force on Teller.

159
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,360
 Oh, I, I, I didn't note it. So he did, he did a classic force on Teller.

160
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,040
 Yeah. And his response to it is like, what the fuck are you doing, man?

161
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:43,760
 Can you believe the balls on this motherfucker? That's the face that he makes.

162
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,280
 The spud balls on this motherfucker.

163
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,360
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty great.

164
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,440
 I thought it probably would have been better to have a

165
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,560
 volunteer from the audience just for that moment.

166
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
 Right. Yeah.

167
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,280
 Or even Brooke.

168
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,680
 To have somebody to go to. I don't know that I even do it on

169
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,960
 Brooke at this point, because this is second or third season, right?

170
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,840
 Yeah. Yeah. The first time he fooled, I remember the first time he was just doing

171
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,680
 sponge ball stuff. And it's funny what he wrote in his routine being like, you know,

172
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,800
 sponge balls are children, you know, starter magic or whatever.

173
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,680
 I remember watching him go like, I guess that's pretty cool or whatever.

174
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,600
 And close turning to me and being like, he's going to fool them.

175
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,360
 Then I was like, what? With sponge ball?

176
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:32,320
 So he is, I enjoyed his comfort and improvement and confidence and performance in his second.

177
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,040
 Yeah.

178
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,200
 I think he came back a much more stronger, charming, polished performer.

179
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,320
 Absolutely.

180
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:44,080
 I really liked the line in the package. I want to be the best Julio of Julio's.

181
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:51,360
 Anyone in the gallery here? I have any thoughts on Julio?

182
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,400
 You don't have to flip me the bird, Fred King. You can just say no comment.

183
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,480
 You don't have to give me the middle finger to your camera.

184
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,200
 He didn't, he didn't. I'm just

185
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,840
 Fred King, Fred King.

186
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:13,040
 I'm driving down from Reno on that lovely stretch of 395 between Bishop and Mojave.

187
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,960
 And I was so afraid I was going to keep dropping out. Can you hear me okay?

188
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,480
 We can. 10-4, good buddy.

189
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,200
 I'm to drop a few names. I'm going to spend the night at your friend,

190
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,800
 Sean McMaster's house.

191
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,520
 I love Sean's.

192
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:33,120
 We all do. And he's having George Tovar and Jonathan Lovett and Tony Clark over.

193
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,480
 And we're going to talk magic all night. So I'm very excited about that.

194
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,920
 Listen, wear a wire and we'll put the conversation up on the abracadabra feed. All right?

195
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,240
 And watch your water on Tony Clark.

196
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,720
 Very funny. I'll see what I can do.

197
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,960
 I heard you want to be careful for bears in the air. Come on.

198
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,640
 Hey, good buddy.

199
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:05,120
 I've never seen more CHP cars on this stretch south from Reno than I have today.

200
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,120
 So I'm being very careful.

201
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,400
 You're on the meth super highway.

202
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,480
 Yeah. They're just going to be checking your colon for combos filled with drugs.

203
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,040
 So you're fine.

204
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,440
 Or are you, Fred?

205
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,200
 Look at me. Do I look like a drug runner?

206
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,360
 They all say when they get pulled over.

207
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,840
 No, Fred. No, you don't.

208
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,920
 Just to finish out the bit.

209
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,080
 All right. Safe driving, pal. And thanks for checking in.

210
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,200
 Good buddy.

211
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,480
 All right. Next up, we have Topaz.

212
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:43,840
 Ready, Rich. Take us through Topaz's routine.

213
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,920
 Called this the backstage prediction. I don't remember why.

214
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,240
 Penn names a musician. Topaz pulls a lanyard cord from his pocket.

215
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,320
 He keeps pulling several feet until it stops.

216
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,240
 He reaches into his opposite pant cuff to free the other end

217
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,000
 and pulls from there until the first end is gone and catches elsewhere.

218
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,040
 He reaches into his sleeve to free that end from there.

219
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,320
 Quickly releases it, whereupon it snaps to the opposite sleeve.

220
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,880
 After pulling it all the way from this location,

221
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,880
 the other end finally clears, revealing the backstage pass sleeve.

222
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,640
 The pass bears the name that Penn said.

223
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,440
 I will say that it was great to see Professor Cheers.

224
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,840
 I still have my rig that I built for it.

225
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,200
 Because one of the biggest issues with that is that if you do it with rope,

226
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,360
 like it's supposed to be done, your rope gets tangled

227
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,640
 and you end up with a wad of knots stuck usually in your crotch.

228
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,360
 And it's awful.

229
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,720
 That was awful.

230
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,760
 It was nice to see it done.

231
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,000
 That's you.

232
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,440
 That's you.

233
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,520
 It was nice to see it done differently and with the lanyard ribbon was great.

234
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,040
 I just, I want Topaz to be genuine and real just once on stage.

235
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,200
 Oh, no.

236
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,720
 I'm just sick and tired of happy, goofy, go lucky magician guy.

237
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,600
 It's just like, come on, just be real out there.

238
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,880
 Nobody's that happy.

239
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,400
 Not even the fucking Canadians.

240
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,000
 Well, yeah, I mean, I totally, I mean, I respectfully disagree on a big time.

241
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,880
 I, you know, I think this is Topaz's third appearance on the show.

242
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:24,000
 The other two times were via, you know, basically remote video, right?

243
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,080
 First time was our first COVID season.

244
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,200
 Does a drink prediction.

245
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:34,640
 That was when we're like language barriers and first time doing, you know, remote feedback.

246
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:41,120
 Topaz pushed back and then Penn laid out the exact product that Topaz used and edited that out.

247
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,600
 Second time he did like a really cool illusion with like a treadmill and weights.

248
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,640
 The one in the gym, yeah.

249
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:58,880
 And between that time and this appearance, I did the Foolers Tour.

250
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,440
 And on the Foolers Tour, Alex Ramon loves Topaz.

251
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,840
 And on the Foolers Tour, we did what you think we did,

252
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,200
 which is stay up to three o'clock in the morning playing YouTube clips of magicians we liked.

253
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,840
 In the bus.

254
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,400
 In the bus.

255
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,000
 Nerds.

256
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,400
 Exactly.

257
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,360
 I'm sorry.

258
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:19,840
 Exactly.

259
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,720
 The crew smoked weed and played video games and the magician stayed sober

260
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,600
 and stayed up to three o'clock in the morning playing magic clips for each other.

261
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,720
 Hilarious.

262
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,000
 And we did a deep dive on Topaz and I just loved so much of his stuff.

263
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,120
 I just loved it.

264
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,000
 And then I looked back and I was like, oh,

265
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,200
 I think we've been unfair to him on this podcast a little bit.

266
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,840
 Now, you've I've instigated the unfairness.

267
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,280
 I just and I'll stand by what I say.

268
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,240
 So that's fine.

269
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,000
 It's totally fine.

270
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,360
 I don't think we have to be in agreement.

271
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,280
 It's like Yellow Suit Magician Guy.

272
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,880
 Remember Yellow Suit Magician Guy?

273
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,520
 The maniac?

274
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,720
 You guess.

275
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,600
 I don't know.

276
00:20:59,600 --> 00:20:59,840
 Yeah.

277
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,960
 Yeah.

278
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,560
 It's just he's in the same.

279
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,320
 Nobody's that happy.

280
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:10,000
 I love his like, you know, making blank your own.

281
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,920
 Like, this is a very much a great example of making a rope magic routine.

282
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,560
 And adding something to it.

283
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,680
 And not to mention the prediction at the end was pretty, pretty goddamn stunning.

284
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,360
 This is where, again, I know the work on this.

285
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,560
 And I'm not going to say it, obviously.

286
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,520
 I'm telling you, I could tell you all right now and none of you will do it.

287
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,640
 Well, you get that from from Penn's bus when he said

288
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,280
 when they told us how it was done, we were like, you motherfucker.

289
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,080
 You know?

290
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,040
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

291
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,720
 I mean, you know, this season, one subplot of this season

292
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,480
 is that he works with Yana Felicitas and Nicolás Trebel.

293
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,720
 They call him a mentor.

294
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,920
 When you talk to him, he says he is not a mentor, that they are a three person team.

295
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,960
 He's very humble about it.

296
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,400
 There's an interview on this feed of me interviewing Topaz shortly after this appearance

297
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,160
 where we hint at the fooling, but don't don't say it, but get into stuff.

298
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:08,480
 And then, you know, for him to have done very

299
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,480
 like kind of more classically impossible tricks,

300
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,040
 but maybe something that wouldn't necessarily fool Penn and Teller

301
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,480
 to come in and do something really for Topaz to really play the game.

302
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,320
 Yeah, and that's what it was.

303
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,920
 And he was so psyched to finally be there in person.

304
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,040
 They really he went over the brainstorming process for the trick

305
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,760
 and it was really fun and fascinating.

306
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,400
 And when he finished, I stayed with him.

307
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,080
 And, you know, the subplot of this is always that I piss off the crew

308
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,480
 when I stay with the magician because they know if I'm hanging out there,

309
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,240
 it's because I know that Penn or Teller want to meet him, right?

310
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,720
 Right.

311
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,920
 So I'm going like there's no way Teller is going to not

312
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,840
 want to come right out and talk to Topaz.

313
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,960
 Yeah, because they're the same height.

314
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,360
 And Teller loves people the same size as him.

315
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,240
 That in costumes, that in costumes.

316
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,120
 Give him something funny to wear and give him a midget next to him, he's perfect.

317
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,480
 So they are getting wise to me,

318
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,600
 ushered Topaz into the basement again, into the waiting area again,

319
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
 to not slow down recording.

320
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,280
 That's funny.

321
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,520
 And so I go like, well, I'm coming with you.

322
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,800
 And I'm basically like, I'm like, let me give you your schedule.

323
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,720
 There's no way Teller is not going to want to meet you.

324
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,160
 So we got to figure out how to make this happen.

325
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,200
 I'm going to try to do it.

326
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,360
 And in it, Topaz was so emotional.

327
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,400
 He was really, really overwhelmed with emotion

328
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,960
 from the whole experience of being on the stage and fooling the guys.

329
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,760
 And he just had this beautiful speech to just me

330
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,880
 about how important Penn and Teller are.

331
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,160
 And he just was like, you don't understand.

332
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,160
 Those guys are artists.

333
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,600
 They're not just magicians.

334
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,920
 He's like, people care what they think.

335
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,760
 Even when you're not talking about magic,

336
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,640
 people want to know what Penn and Teller think about things.

337
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,720
 They want the right things about the world.

338
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,560
 It's like, those are true artists up there,

339
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,600
 not just magicians and to have that moment with them.

340
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,160
 And he just was so emotional and it was so beautiful.

341
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,720
 And I was like, oh, my God, I got to get you to Teller or whatever.

342
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,940
 Right.

343
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,800
 But I couldn't believe I shared that moment with him.

344
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,760
 And so that was a really cool moment for me.

345
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,440
 And then I did help facilitate Topaz and Teller getting together later on.

346
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,600
 And then totally used that chip to interview him on the podcast,

347
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,080
 which I did.

348
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:32,720
 So please enjoy the interview I did with Topaz on our feed.

349
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,920
 It's fun to go back and let's do it again.

350
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,840
 Just knowing I was interviewing him like a week after he fooled the boys.

351
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,720
 That's great.

352
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:45,680
 But I, on that nerdy deep dive on the bus, I just love his originality, man.

353
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,320
 He is definitely original.

354
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,880
 He just really comes up with different original stuff, you know.

355
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:57,040
 And I know he did recently like a one that was all like on headphones thing.

356
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,040
 So that was the thing about Live is that we had a guy had everything on headphones

357
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,240
 and then Topaz had a show and everyone had headphones.

358
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,800
 And there's a third person who had a headphone,

359
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,080
 everything on the headphones, you know, show.

360
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,600
 I heard mixed reviews of all of them.

361
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,880
 So I couldn't hear anything.

362
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,840
 But but but just another sign of like his ambition.

363
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,520
 Yeah.

364
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,020
 Yeah.

365
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,520
 All right.

366
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,200
 Jim, is that your hand raised?

367
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,700
 Yes.

368
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,440
 Go for it.

369
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,280
 OK, just want to say, you know, give credit to Topaz.

370
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,920
 The prediction was pretty brilliant.

371
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,520
 Having it folded up, having it in the protector, you know,

372
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,720
 that just adds so many levels that make it seem impossible.

373
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,480
 So brilliant payoff.

374
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:48,240
 But I felt the setup just he dragged it out for way, way too long.

375
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,000
 And it ended up killing the impact.

376
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,720
 I mean, I'm assuming that had something to do with the method he needed that time.

377
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,000
 And I get how a fool, but for me, if he was doing that in like a live stage show,

378
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,880
 I definitely think he'd want to find some method to speed it up a bit

379
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,040
 so the audience doesn't lose interest.

380
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,000
 Well, in a stage show, I mean, like I said,

381
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,440
 I think he's doing this to play the game.

382
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,440
 I think he's doing this to play the foolish game properly and to go for foolish trophy.

383
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,240
 Because there are so many ways where you don't need that kind of timing,

384
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,240
 that kind of dancing, that kind of misdirection to get it right to a thing.

385
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:24,740
 Right.

386
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,720
 I think in this case specifically, it's just about fooling the guys

387
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,080
 and the guys know methods A through E, right?

388
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,160
 But methods A through E will work in a stage show in a way that would fool most people.

389
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,600
 Yeah.

390
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,560
 And I do give him credit for coming up with such a clever method.

391
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,880
 Just I don't see it having much applicability outside of the show.

392
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,320
 I don't think he does either.

393
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,880
 Look, look, Topaz is not short on material.

394
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,320
 He's just short in real life.

395
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:02,160
 Well, you don't want to insult him, you might make him a sauerkraut.

396
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:08,880
 I had him on this feed.

397
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,380
 We can't.

398
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,080
 What's up, RJ?

399
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,960
 You're 6'5".

400
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,240
 Everyone's short to you.

401
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,120
 I know.

402
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,480
 You should see me in heels and hair.

403
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,480
 Oh, please.

404
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,200
 Let's do that.

405
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,120
 Thank you, Jim.

406
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,240
 Sauerkraut joke and all.

407
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,640
 Thank you.

408
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,560
 Thank you for having me on.

409
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,880
 Anybody else have thoughts on Topaz?

410
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,400
 Anyone besides me want to defend him from this mockery?

411
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:36,800
 Okay, let me just try to explain my mockery.

412
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:45,280
 I find that his use of clowning, which he uses a lot in his stage show, is off-putting.

413
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,520
 Okay.

414
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,680
 It's a little juvenile.

415
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,800
 Like anything with style, it's a style with good points.

416
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,760
 It's a choice.

417
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,080
 Right.

418
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,240
 So I'm not going to argue that his style shouldn't turn you off, right?

419
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,760
 Thank God.

420
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,520
 And when you talk to him, he's actually quite humble about who he is in his career

421
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,480
 and everything like that.

422
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:11,840
 And so I think he is the artist he's going to be, and that's part of who it is.

423
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,560
 All right.

424
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,080
 Look, I love the looks on Pentel's faces when it started.

425
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,960
 I like the looks on the faces in the middle, and I like the looks on the faces at the end.

426
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,320
 Yeah.

427
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,360
 There are certain foolish tricks that it's fun when Pentanteller kind of let their guard down,

428
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,960
 to be like, "What is this?"

429
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,760
 And then all of a sudden, the end makes them go like, "Damn it."

430
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,720
 I also, I thought, "Ready, would you point this out?"

431
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,640
 I think there's a red herring on the handling of the prediction at the very end.

432
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,520
 The flip?

433
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:39,760
 Yeah.

434
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,520
 Yeah, I think it was too.

435
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,160
 He does a full hand up to the faces at one point.

436
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:51,440
 At one point, the whole prediction is hidden behind his hand,

437
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,880
 and it's held flat like a card trick.

438
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,120
 And that's a red herring.

439
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,400
 Yeah, absolutely.

440
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,000
 Yeah, that's not the method.

441
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,720
 So I was like, "Oh, I thought it hurt it a little bit."

442
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,560
 But in the vein of playing the game, he played it well.

443
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:08,880
 That's it.

444
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,560
 I think this whole trick was simply playing the game.

445
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,560
 I don't think Tobias is trying to take this as a building block for something down the road.

446
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,520
 Right.

447
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,160
 Although it might.

448
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,480
 I'll just say, it's only a method that maybe I would do.

449
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,560
 No other magician would do it.

450
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,560
 Okay, I'm interested now.

451
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,560
 All right, let's see.

452
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,240
 Next up, we have Toby Rudolph.

453
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:41,840
 I feel like we have to score the fourth acts in their own category.

454
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,520
 You mean filler?

455
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:50,320
 Yeah, I find Toby Rudolph to be a higher ranking among the fourth acts on this show.

456
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,640
 Okay, I'll give you that.

457
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,160
 But still...

458
00:29:54,160 --> 00:30:00,720
 Yes, when watching it, I thought, "We'll see him fourth in an episode."

459
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:10,880
 He breaks one of my cardinal rules, which is telling the audience,

460
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,440
 "And what I'm going to do next is, and what I'm going to do next is,

461
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,320
 and then I'm going to do this."

462
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,520
 And just fucking do it.

463
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,520
 We don't need that explanation.

464
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,320
 Oh, I forgot with Michael Farrow.

465
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,840
 He broke my rule, which we talked about in the previous episode,

466
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,760
 where he is struck by the writing on the pizza box.

467
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,720
 Like, "Oh, the video."

468
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,440
 Like, "You're the one who brought all the props, Michael."

469
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,440
 Yeah, you put it in the freezer, fuckface.

470
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,200
 Reddy, tell us about this trick.

471
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,080
 This is the classic Bill to Tomato.

472
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,880
 A volunteer brings up a bill.

473
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,520
 Toby tears off a quarter, gives it to her as a receipt.

474
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,040
 Penn writes down the serial number.

475
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,920
 Toby has a volunteer select a fruit from several.

476
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,360
 He burns the bill to ash, then slices the selected fruit to reveal

477
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,960
 the bill rolled up inside.

478
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,720
 The serial number and receipt match.

479
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,640
 All right.

480
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,640
 Classic Bill to Lemon.

481
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,760
 His handling was adequate, a little fumble at the beginning.

482
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,760
 I found him to have American-like charm for a foreign performer.

483
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,440
 So no charm whatsoever.

484
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:23,040
 And I was curious how everybody think

485
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:27,680
 you felt about the snip instead of the tear.

486
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:35,680
 For me, it provides a cleaner transition when he restores it,

487
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,160
 because you can add a sharpie line to it and make it look like

488
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,200
 it's an actual, you know, it actually healed itself.

489
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,880
 That's the only thing that was there for it.

490
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,680
 Yeah.

491
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,040
 And who knows, maybe he is, where is he from?

492
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,720
 I don't remember.

493
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,240
 I mean, he didn't sound like he could tear a paper.

494
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,240
 So maybe he couldn't tear the bill.

495
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,400
 Right.

496
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,560
 I think, yes, I think it's common.

497
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,280
 Other currencies are harder to tear.

498
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,320
 Correct.

499
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,640
 Some of them are impossible to tear.

500
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,140
 Yeah.

501
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,640
 So this might come from that.

502
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,000
 I was just like, oh, we do the tear because it makes the matchup look impossible.

503
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,720
 But the cleanness, the cleanness is also pretty hard to.

504
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,960
 And I think at the end, when you've got that sharpie line.

505
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,460
 Yeah.

506
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,320
 There that shows a healing point.

507
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:22,820
 Yeah.

508
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,040
 It's kind of a convincer for me.

509
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,720
 It's kind of like, oh, that's that that actually works.

510
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,600
 Yeah, I was like, I was surprised when I saw the snip.

511
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,720
 I was like, oh, not a tear.

512
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,920
 And I was like, oh, the snip is actually kind of beautiful.

513
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,480
 It's like it's right from a distance, right?

514
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,600
 Let's just see a clean snip than a sloppy tear.

515
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,100
 Right.

516
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,000
 I hope I remember to call this episode Clean Snip Versus Sloppy Tear.

517
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,320
 Which is how I describe sex.

518
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,920
 And Matt's out of frame.

519
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,680
 Anything else on Toby?

520
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:08,720
 Was there an edit between I don't want to touch it and immediately touching it?

521
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,840
 Probably, yeah.

522
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
 Or was that in the script that way?

523
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,080
 No, it wasn't in the script that way.

524
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,600
 But yeah, tomatoes are gross.

525
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,800
 Yeah, they're the devil's fruit.

526
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,300
 Yeah.

527
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:28,160
 No, there was I don't want to touch it for a convincer.

528
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:28,660
 Oh, yes.

529
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,960
 You're handling this, I'm not.

530
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,720
 And then he immediately handles it.

531
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,040
 Oh, right, right, right, right.

532
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,080
 I think there was an edit.

533
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,840
 Yes, I think there's an edit there.

534
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,340
 Yeah.

535
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,760
 Yeah, and I'll agree.

536
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,640
 I'll agree with Penn and Teller.

537
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,640
 She was one of the best audience participants they've had in a long time.

538
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,000
 Yeah, she was great.

539
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,880
 I bet you they kind of wanted her for if this was shot in chronological order.

540
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,280
 Right.

541
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,600
 And that was she would have been the perfect person for that final trick.

542
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:05,760
 Yeah, I like the one that Matt had and the one that they had for red darning needle.

543
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,480
 Yes.

544
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:08,980
 Yeah.

545
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,800
 It's really just a fruit choice that got him on air, right?

546
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,640
 It's the fact that he gave her a round of things that could be loaded into.

547
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,600
 I think it was a suit.

548
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:23,360
 Next up, we have Penn and Teller performing an eye chart routine.

549
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,920
 Ready, Rich?

550
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,560
 Take us-- Volunteer takes an eye test to prove she has good eyesight.

551
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,120
 They bring out a EULA for her to pick a word from.

552
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,320
 It's too small to read, so she uses Teller's eye loop.

553
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,640
 The word she picked is rolled out behind her on all over a giant poster.

554
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,000
 They go back to the eye chart.

555
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,760
 It's doped up with nothing but her word.

556
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,280
 Yeah.

557
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,680
 I call this views la force, Christy.

558
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:49,840
 RJ, have your hand raised?

559
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,040
 I do have a question.

560
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,760
 Yes.

561
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,000
 Was Vinnie Grasso involved in any part of this?

562
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,400
 [LAUGHTER]

563
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:56,900
 Yes.

564
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,100
 OK.

565
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,000
 [LAUGHTER]

566
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,800
 Duh.

567
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,560
 Some listeners at Penn Sunday School might listen to Penn Revel the fact that they

568
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,040
 ripped Vinnie apart on his last fullest appearance and then used his method in a trick.

569
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,100
 Yep.

570
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:14,800
 I saw it coming, literally.

571
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,720
 And then I was like, but I-- who's their prop builder again?

572
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,600
 Nate.

573
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:21,920
 Nate.

574
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,120
 Boy, Nate.

575
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,760
 Yes.

576
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,440
 You should sell that one.

577
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,480
 It's beautiful.

578
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,200
 It's beautiful.

579
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,560
 That's a good one.

580
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,440
 I mean, I've used that method in the wedding band one.

581
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:33,680
 Yeah.

582
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,440
 Where you pop off your ring and then use that.

583
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,040
 Yeah, exactly.

584
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,120
 The LED light's inside, so it's brighter.

585
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,760
 So you read it.

586
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:48,080
 That is such a clean gimmick that if Nate was able to--

587
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,860
 Yeah.

588
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,280
 That's a good prop.

589
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,320
 Yeah.

590
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,280
 Not that Vinnie's isn't.

591
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,960
 That is a good prop.

592
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,400
 Yeah.

593
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,000
 Well, both serve great purposes.

594
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,840
 I think the catch on the Penn and Teller one, which is funny because at rehearsals,

595
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,040
 is that Penn and Teller both have terrible eyesight.

596
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,640
 Yes.

597
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,880
 So we kept getting approved.

598
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,760
 They kept getting the terms and conditions approved and then we'd run a rehearsal

599
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,160
 and everyone who came up on stage could read without the eyepiece.

600
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,280
 Oh, God.

601
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,120
 That's not how it should be.

602
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:26,160
 So there are several rehearsals where we're like, even smaller, Nate.

603
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,120
 Even smaller, Nate.

604
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,040
 He can.

605
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:37,120
 It also said authenticate all over that eye chart, like up and down.

606
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,440
 Yeah.

607
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,440
 And I saw the Trower runs and Penn pointed out a lot.

608
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,000
 He pointed out less in this one, but there's a couple other fun spots on the eye chart

609
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,760
 that were pretty cool that it was all over there.

610
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,560
 The authentically sneaking in a giant billboard behind someone is pretty great.

611
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,600
 Yeah, that was a fun one.

612
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,360
 That's the kind of thing that feels like it'd be good for a late night

613
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,840
 host to do like Jimmy Fallon or something like that.

614
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,560
 Yeah, yeah.

615
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,440
 Oh, totally.

616
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,240
 Absolutely.

617
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:02,800
 Yeah.

618
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,760
 And the fact that Jimmy Fallon's not too bright, he wouldn't get it.

619
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,400
 It'd be perfect.

620
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,480
 Authentic something or other, I don't know.

621
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:10,980
 Yeah.

622
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,280
 But yeah, this is not in their show now.

623
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:21,360
 This was definitely a Fool Us trick and it's a giant billboard.

624
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:30,720
 I remember in rehearsals, so there's a really big dust up heading into Fool Us

625
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,240
 with the Piko the second gorilla trick.

626
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:34,740
 Yeah.

627
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:39,280
 And I don't think we've done Piko yet on Fool Us, right?

628
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,240
 No, it's an old, old.

629
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,040
 Yeah, so I won't burn all of the background on that trick right now,

630
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,280
 but I'll just say at one point it got pretty heated.

631
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,320
 And at one point we were all just sitting around with Hondro and I staring at each other

632
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:59,760
 wondering who's supposed to talk because Penn Teller and Andrew all looked content

633
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,560
 and not speaking at all after the awkward exchange.

634
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:07,840
 And in the middle of that, Nate comes in and we're dead quiet,

635
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:13,600
 so there's no problem interrupting rehearsal, saying, "I have the giant Authenticate board

636
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,600
 up on stage and they're about to load out everything to bring in the set for Fool Us.

637
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,600
 Do you guys want to come out and approve?"

638
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:25,040
 And Hondro and I were just so happy to be like, "Leave the room?

639
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,840
 Yeah, let's set that up.

640
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,720
 Absolutely.

641
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,760
 Let's go look at that."

642
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:36,880
 And then Penn stayed behind, kind of still in a little bit of a sour mood.

643
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,720
 And he goes like, "Well, I don't see any good reason I need to go out there."

644
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,360
 And I said, "I mean, I think you're one of the people that has to approve of it, no?"

645
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,960
 And this is why I love our competitor, Teller.

646
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,320
 He literally was still in a bad mood.

647
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,160
 He was like, "You're right."

648
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,360
 And he got up and just walked out and said, "Yup, looks great," and approved it.

649
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,040
 And then went back to being in a sour mood for the rest of the meeting.

650
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,400
 But I'll reveal much more to that story when they do "Pycho, the Psychic Gorilla."

651
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,320
 Yeah, so it airs.

652
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,200
 We're in episode 13, and I guess it has aired because we're up through 16 right now on the CW

653
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:17,600
 right now.

654
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,800
 So it has aired.

655
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,640
 Thank you, John, for noting that.

656
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,880
 So I'll get into all of that on that episode.

657
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
 Awesome.

658
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,040
 All right.

659
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,600
 Any closing questions, remarks from the babblers?

660
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,760
 Today, I learned that other people don't read their ULAs.

661
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,400
 Their ULAs?

662
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,640
 The terms and conditions.

663
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,760
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

664
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,400
 You read yours?

665
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,480
 End-user licensing agreement.

666
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,480
 I don't read mine ever.

667
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,320
 I had a quick question.

668
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,200
 Yeah, go for it.

669
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,680
 Going back to the original refrigerator trick,

670
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,920
 Penn says something like, "This is the greatest trick ever," or something.

671
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,320
 He says it twice, something like that.

672
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,840
 And I don't understand if that's maybe the name of the actual trick,

673
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:03,840
 or why he says that, unless I'm missing something.

674
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,640
 I think he was being genuine.

675
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:06,880
 Okay.

676
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,920
 Matt doesn't?

677
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,400
 No, I do.

678
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,480
 I think he was genuinely like, because of the method he loves,

679
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,640
 when people use a crazy-ass method for something.

680
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:18,800
 Yeah.

681
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,200
 So when people go out of their way to do something really hard to pull off,

682
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,200
 just for the sake of a magic trick, I think it really tickles him.

683
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,840
 And so I think he is really struck by that.

684
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,960
 And also, like I told you, we're riding the wave of him sitting down,

685
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,840
 turning to Teller, and be like, "Well, there's only one way to do that,"

686
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,840
 and just kind of riding the wave of both his joy and satisfaction

687
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,360
 with what he saw as happening the whole time, I think.

688
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:47,440
 Am I misremembering the language?

689
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,880
 Because my recollection is he said, "Almost nobody else could do this."

690
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,480
 He says that too, yes.

691
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,360
 He says, "Almost nobody else could do this with ready-found satisfactory."

692
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,920
 And later in the bus, Penn says, "I hope you and your whole family enjoy this."

693
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,120
 You and your family, yeah.

694
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,400
 The first one was fine.

695
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,640
 Second one was okay.

696
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,240
 A little on the edge, yeah.

697
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:10,960
 Yeah.

698
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:17,120
 For the listeners, I want to mention that Steve-O is in the Burt Reynolds Playgirl pose.

699
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:22,480
 Steve-O's always in the Burt Reynolds Playgirl pose.

700
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,440
 He is the most relaxed person in every one of these.

701
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,040
 I mean, I've taken mushrooms today, and I'm not as relaxed as Steve-O is right now.

702
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:38,160
 Oh, I made you tackle Zoom strategies with mushrooms?

703
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,040
 Yeah.

704
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,000
 All right.

705
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,880
 Well, then there we go.

706
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,520
 Thank you, Ready Rich.

707
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,960
 Thank you, RJ, for stepping up.

708
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,520
 You're welcome.

709
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:50,160
 Learning the Zoom protocols, and we'll be back with more Fool Us.

710
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,760
 I think we should do another maybe one of these for Africa Babble as well.

711
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:54,880
 All right.

712
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,680
 Not today.

713
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,640
 Not today, I don't think.

714
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,400
 I had a video.

715
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,280
 It's getting a lot of play.

716
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,040
 I've aired basically me.

717
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,600
 I have a clip of me saying, "Hey, this guy literally is trying to interrupt my show.

718
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,880
 I'm doing it, Mystique Dining."

719
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,080
 I say, "Hey, no one cares."

720
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,720
 I'd say, "You know what?

721
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,560
 I only have 45 minutes to do the show, and we're behind."

722
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,040
 That's the sting, right?

723
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,640
 So, of course, I put up on YouTube.

724
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,080
 Everyone on YouTube says, "I'm an asshole.

725
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:24,720
 That guy's right.

726
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,200
 I'm wrong.

727
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,200
 I should never free in show business."

728
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,720
 All that other stuff, because that's all that happens on YouTube.

729
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,200
 No one on YouTube is ever on my side of the perspective of the clip.

730
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,240
 They think, "Oh, a magician posting his own clip.

731
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,880
 He must be an arrogant prick, and we need to take him down to Peg."

732
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,040
 Is all of YouTube as far as I understand it.

733
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,640
 My clips do better on Facebook and Instagram.

734
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,440
 But this guy Marco goes, "That spectator is not wrong.

735
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:56,400
 I find lots of clients saying, 'Glad you are not doing only card tricks.'

736
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,200
 And I find the problem is when every magician I know are doing card magic,

737
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,560
 even on stage when it's hardly visible for the audience.

738
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,800
 Let's work a bit harder and offer variety."

739
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,840
 None of that's happening in the clip.

740
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,320
 None of that.

741
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:14,720
 I am doing a card trick in a parlor environment where everything can be seen.

742
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,000
 And also, that is the only card trick in my show.

743
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,040
 And the spectator is not saying, "Hey, you're doing too many card tricks."

744
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,600
 The spectator is literally interrupting me so they can tell me

745
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,440
 that he saw another magician do a card trick,

746
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,440
 and he stayed up at night and figured out how to do it.

747
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,720
 And the reason why I know all the beats of that is because before I went out to Mystique,

748
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,960
 he told the server that same story.

749
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,040
 He told the table that same story.

750
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,400
 He told Steve that same story.

751
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,760
 So I was the fourth round of that story for everyone in the room

752
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:47,760
 when he was interrupting my card trick in my parlor set at Mystique Dining.

753
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,560
 So Marco is piping in to both tell me that I do too many card tricks

754
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,200
 and the spectator is championing variety.

755
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,200
 And ending with this grandiose,

756
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,840
 "Let's all work a bit harder and offer variety,"

757
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:05,120
 as if he's doing us a service when he's completely interpreting the clip for himself.

758
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,880
 When you click on his profile picture, it's him holding a fucking card.

759
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,240
 Yeah, of course it is.

760
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:17,440
 "Hey Marco, let's all work on minding our own fucking business and shutting the fuck up."

761
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,320
 How's that, Marco?

762
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,960
 I take down the stuff that's directly insulting.

763
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,560
 But I don't take down the dumb shit like this because my social media people encourage me

764
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,920
 that there's engagement happening on it to let it happen.

765
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,200
 And other people are taking on Marco, so I'm letting it happen.

766
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,760
 But I'm not chiming in because I don't want to debate anyone.

767
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,280
 I don't want to debate a stranger on the internet.

768
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,760
 Because that can only lead to victory.

769
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:47,200
 Yeah, surely at the end of this road is a sense of satisfaction.

770
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,640
 I have done it, Eureka!

771
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,640
 A remorseful person concedes.

772
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:57,040
 Oh, you know what, Matt? You were right.

773
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,800
 That's remorse, sorry. You can't even do remorse.

774
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:07,520
 I'm going to guess that Marco didn't read Matt's EULA before watching his viral video.

775
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:12,480
 All right. Well, thanks for this, everybody.

776
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,600
 That was Foolish By the Scenes African Babble.

777
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,640
 Bye, kids.

778
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,200
 Bye, dude.

779
00:45:46,720 --> 00:46:06,400
