1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
 I'm the guy at the Olive Garden. I'm the old man at the Olive Garden family thing

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,500
 You remember that commercial I do when the grandpa always go

00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:14,040
 Everybody's like what does he have? What's the condition of the it's only because of my tight frame

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,040
 You can't see me applauding your impression of the guy

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:25,640
 You the ice cream truck drivers, thank you so much ice cream truck drivers

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,980
 I don't have a new list yet

7
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,380
 But we will thank each and every ice cream truck driver by name before this month is over

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,400
 If you want to be an ice cream truck driver help deliver that ice cream straight to people's ear holes

 head over to preaching fun comm preaching fun comm is where you go to sign up to be an ice cream truck driver and

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,120

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,420
 May be your own. Oh

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,200
 Yeah

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,720
 Here's a show

15
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,160
 Hey, Johnny. Do you want to go to an ice cream social?

16
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,460
 Yeah, I'd love to great. Let's go

17
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,560
 Guys it's my little season

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:15,960
 Are you using proper math this time?

19
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,520
 Oh

20
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,160
 Boy have you started walking already? I have and I'm trying to keep up the thing where I run a little bit

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:42,780
 Okay, I'm gonna start running again, and I'm embarrassingly sore from very little running again

22
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,180
 Running's not good for you Matt

23
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:51,200
 It's definitely not good for me. I think it's good for other people, but it's not good for me. I don't know

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,160
 It's probably good for someone. It's hard on the joints, especially men of size

25
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,320
 Not that you're a man of my size, but still I'm I don't know. I'm certainly in the plus category

26
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:07,560
 Yeah, but I don't know but still yeah, I can't I I would die if I tried to run at this point

27
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,840
 I think well

28
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:15,680
 I was walking the other day and I saw someone running and they were like barely moving like they just simply have their elbows up

29
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,720
 And it was like this very it was almost like they were more like tiptoeing than running

30
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,520
 Do you know I mean where they just holding their elbows up? No, no, no like

31
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,640
 You know, you know, like when you when you know, I don't know I know I'm trying to describe it for the audience

32
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,800
 It doesn't help our listeners. It's like this

33
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,160
 It's like that ball

34
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:43,340
 Paul is doing me like lazy deep masseuse right now. Just the two sharp elbows. Just I'm very lazy deep masseuse

35
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:49,440
 Lazy deep masseuse. Let me elbow your caboose

36
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,720
 Yeah, I do like a nice elbow in my caboose

37
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,960
 My elbow slipped in your crack oops

38
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:08,120
 Feet you're not above right? I mean that's what it's all about. Really? That's why I go to the massage parlor

39
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,620
 For the possibility of something inadvertently slipping into my crack

40
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,200
 It just comes close to cracking use your paw whisper, please

41
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:25,060
 Well, it's it's like a prehensile tail back there. It's just it grabs it whatever might come near. It's like an antlion

42
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,640
 Sir let go of my elbow

43
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,880
 I can't I can't control it. It has a mind of its own

44
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:38,380
 It's like quado from its prehensile, but I can't control it. That's right

45
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:46,240
 Like moving their arms back and forth like almost like a dance move and they were kind of just shuffling their feet along and

46
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,160
 I thought to myself. Well if that counts as running I

47
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,800
 Can start running more power walking?

48
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,560
 Yeah, yeah

49
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:02,040
 Yeah, if that counts if that counts then I should start going from walking to lazy

50
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,360
 lazy running or

51
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,320
 Lazy, I can do that power walking is fine

52
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,360
 I think the run it's it's the it's the coming down hard and putting the bumps on the joints kind of thing

53
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,640
 Well, I was because I was reading an article and they were like, oh, you know like a specific style of power

54
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:23,060
 Walking is in vogue right now out of Japan, which means of course, it's book. Nothing is happening

55
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,880
 and

56
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,560
 But I simply referenced a mile time of like, you know power walking and like doing a 15-minute mile and I went like gulp

57
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,880
 I don't want a mile in 15 minutes the power walked it for 50

58
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,680
 15 minute mile per walking walking

59
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,880
 Huh, they just pop that out in the area like it was nothing and I was like wait

60
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:54,000
 I'm at like an 18 19 minute mile when I walk I don't walk a 15 minute. So the best is like three minutes, right?

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,640
 running

62
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,720
 Just just the best like nobody's gone faster than like a three minute mile. That's correct

63
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,720
 I don't even know if anyone's done a three minute mile

64
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,360
 Okay. Yeah, I don't think so. Yeah

65
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:15,600
 If only there was a way I could find out no 3 4 3 13 pondering. What is it three three? What three?

66
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,160
 343 point 13 seconds challenge accepted Jacob. Okay

67
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:27,040
 Was that that guy was that Pretoria's with the spring legs was he able is that how he got it?

68
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,240
 No, no, they don't set the records with with that. Yeah. Yeah, and then he accidentally trampled his ex-wife

69
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:43,360
 It is a man whose name I'm not going to try to say it starts with a G but he's he's from

70
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,920
 Morocco give it a shot Jacob. Give it your best shot

71
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,600
 Girl

72
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:58,080
 First of all the barge first syllable Jacob had to take a timeout

73
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,140
 G you e rr. Oh you jay el garage

74
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,280
 El garage, I think is that it's pronounced Baton Rouge

75
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:22,120
 His Moroccan name means the red stick I actually got a good laugh

76
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,160
 I was doing a card trick, you know the Spanish Spanish poetry card trick in San Antonio

77
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,880
 I said it San Antonio, of course is French for the red stick

78
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,320
 And then I said, oh wait, that's Baton Rouge. It's Spanish for the good land

79
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:43,280
 Nope, that's Milwaukee and I need more of us. I need more of the I need all the translations. Yeah

80
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,280
 Oh, yeah, what does that mean? What does the main mean?

81
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:52,320
 The moine it's Spanish for the boy. No, it's it's it's a it's Italian gangster for the moine

82
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:58,040
 Hey, you've got the moine what's a boy, huh?

83
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,320
 You don't got mine answering if French is still fine

84
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,640
 I'm playing an ignorant. I'm playing an ignorant jerk

85
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:13,200
 All languages are up for grabs right da moine da bears

86
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:19,960
 Well, I just had another zoom meeting with the skit crew

87
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:27,160
 Mm-hmm. I don't know if I said already but steel city improv theater still city improv theater. We are starting a

88
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,560
 new

89
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,560
 class session

90
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,760
 Sadly, I did not get enough registrants in my class for my class session to move forward for the first four weeks

91
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,240
 Seems to be a continuing theme in the

92
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,520
 Aegis

93
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,800
 We gotta get we gotta get you out there doing shows buddy, it's not a just it's not a just it's just a matter of

94
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,840
 I'm teaching level one and then we got to get some level ones to get the further thing, you know, so hopefully

95
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,800
 In October, we'll get things leveled out

96
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:09,680
 Rich Tellurico is coming out to do a workshop in October. So that'll hopefully help too. We'll see how that all goes

97
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,320
 Yeah, but we're just discussing

98
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,720
 Getting to know the faculty and yeah, we're gonna hopefully start doing some performances

99
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,440
 For the student body and building up something of a community again, you know

100
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,800
 Yeah, I don't think you should ever try to start anything. I just happen with the foolers tour

101
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,640
 I don't like anything on the East Coast during the first weeks of September is a good idea

102
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,520
 I think well transitioning from August

103
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:40,960
 I need I need you and a time machine to come back and have a nice long conversation with Justin a few months ago

104
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:47,280
 I can provide one of those two things you need. Okay, one of the two things great. Okay, it's a time machine

105
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:55,720
 First time foolers tour we were dragging ass and then by October picked up I agree and that's that's seems to be what happened

106
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,720
 With my last free class too as I went down to six students from 12 the previous time

107
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,000
 Yeah, so it's just it is it's a busy time and it's just a weird time

108
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,720
 And August and September is a nasty transition from people doing the summertime things to whatever their fall is gonna be I guess that's true

109
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,760
 Whether you do or don't have kids, I think it's just a big transition time

110
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,560
 well, hopefully

111
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,960
 That'll change up. We'll see speaking of transition

112
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,640
 Yesterday and had a little bit of time I

113
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,000
 was off and so

114
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,560
 She has been desperate to convert a corner of the bedroom

115
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,280
 the big the big

116
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,040
 bedroom

117
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,040
 into a reading nook

118
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:51,400
 Okay, is this for you is she is she trying to encourage you to read she's like my husband can't read no

119
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:57,540
 I'm going to teach him. No, she sees me in bed with a comic every night. I am I am reading

120
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:02,920
 I'm not reading, you know, anything's too profound, but I'm reading a shitload of comic books now

121
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,260
 I read almost every night. I read some more Fantastic Four again last night

122
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,400
 No, she's uh

123
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,220
 What do you think would be the recipes required for a reading nook?

124
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:24,240
 What's the the recipes what do you what do you put in a reading nook? Oh, oh what a chair

125
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,000
 Aha

126
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,800
 Jacob gets the gold star. That's the big requirement a chair

127
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,120
 I play my zoom delay for not tying Jacob. I said what did you say chair as well?

128
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,960
 I said come back here specific Matt Matt also said comfy chair. I'll give you a star to Matt comfy chair

129
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,320
 Anyway

130
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,200
 We went to the one and only value city furniture

131
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,000
 down in cranberry

132
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,340
 Nothing better for the for the spine than the tailbone like value city furniture. Well

133
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,140
 You'd be surprised this chair

134
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,040
 you found is

135
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,080
 D-lux so she found one that was pretty nice has some you know power

136
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:12,200
 Let go primarily for you or for Anne. This is for Anne, but this is the funny fans look

137
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,560
 This is Anne's look, but this is the funny. Okay. She got this one

138
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,520
 It's just I all this will do can I get it in this color and they're like, no

139
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:27,680
 Can you not get it in this color you can go fuck yourself now well

140
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,920
 Well, it was gonna be like months you specifically know we save this color for special children, right?

141
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:40,280
 Don't you have a lot of this color though? We do we have we so much of you can't get this you can't have this color

142
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:45,580
 This is only for people who have the higher rankings of the Autobot Society and I know that you

143
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:52,640
 Just short of the highest ranking and McPheeters underachiever

144
00:11:52,640 --> 00:12:00,120
 Clipboard do not sell to and McPheeters

145
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,160
 They got a Polaroid up a man

146
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:11,200
 So she quickly set that chair on fire just to teach them a lesson good about not selling her the chair

147
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,800
 No, then the sales lady goes well

148
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:23,460
 Very almost exactly the same price we have the prime model up front. Oh

149
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:27,960
 And I'm like, oh shit and we go up there and

150
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:36,960
 This thing this fucking chair. It's got this thing called. It's the same thing as the other chair had they call it zero

 Gravity if you heard about this. Oh, yeah. Yeah gravity get your legs up above your heart

 Makes you feel like you're gonna fall the hell down, but they don't but it's all automatic and this fucking chair

153
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:57,440

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,920
 Massage in the

 It has heated seat

158
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:14,720
 It has neck support up be downy. I don't need a heated seat in the house

159
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:22,480
 No, and does and always is she is forever cold. Oh, she's always caught. She's one of those always cold. She's it's got a hidden

160
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,800
 drink holder in one arm

161
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,640
 the other arm

162
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,440
 Holds the master controls

163
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,880
 Forget this

164
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,040
 the

165
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,720
 integrated Bluetooth sound system

166
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:46,160
 This chair is basically a high-fives terrier and

167
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:54,800
 She would never have have gone for this but as soon as she got in it felt how comfy it was

168
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,360
 Realized she could get the color she wanted and then started thinking about it

169
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,120
 She was actually she said

170
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,740
 We were going to buy the thing she said

171
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,880
 You know, I was thinking about getting a little

172
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,760
 Radio or something to put in the room so that I could do like

173
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:24,320
 Bluetooth stuff to listen to listen to music and stuff and and I was like well now you can just hook it to your

174
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,980
 Your chair your chair is basically your

175
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,840
 Your stereo your radio. It's all you need

176
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,680
 Yeah, and and it can just play stuff even when you're in bed

177
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:39,320
 You can just be listening to your chair and I was like that that radio was gonna cost you probably upwards of $50

178
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,520
 This is you're getting this thing for free at this point

179
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:49,680
 So yeah, it was funny but but she gives me guff because I don't know if any of you have experienced this

180
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,680
 but going shopping with me I

181
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:58,220
 Will just be like yeah get that. I'll get the better one get the really nice one. Go for that. Oh, yeah, you need that I

182
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:05,980
 I am similar. Yeah, except when it comes to basic technology being included like I don't need my free

183
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,920
 Yeah, yeah, I don't get the things like that. I don't have the things like the speakers

184
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,760
 I don't like the idea that a program of a washer and dryer for my phone. I don't find them more convenient in any way. I

185
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:19,720
 I would normally agree 100% but the speaker in the chair

186
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,160
 Think about this. This is your reading nook

187
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,440
 You can just do audiobooks

188
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:35,320
 Right and that's part of it or you can have just soothing music while you're reading and with all the neck paint

189
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,320
 I have for putting on headphones and

190
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,280
 That's right. I given myself

191
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,900
 Well wearing goes that for me

192
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,680
 That's true

193
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,840
 Like how much nicer would it be to just turn on your side and fall asleep without having to have headphones in or anything?

194
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,400
 Now we're getting now we're getting to what you actually want out of this chair

195
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,840
 I'm not getting anything out of this chair. Although she was like don't you think something out of this chair?

196
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,200
 Don't you think you'll ever fall asleep in this chair? I'm like, yeah, I might fall asleep in this chair someday

197
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:06,160
 But the other thing yeah, she was really concerned about was

198
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,060
 She wants it very close to the wall because she got specific measurements for the room, you know

199
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,320
 You pardon me I am fighting a terrible cold

200
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:25,200
 She says, you know, I I I want it to kind of hug the wall and the sales lady is like four inches clearance

201
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,760
 And she's like what it's like

202
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,320
 Four inches away from the wall. It can fully recline

203
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,860
 That's it. Oh, yes. Oh, that's that's amazing. Yes. That's yes

204
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:43,840
 Are you think so? But what it does is it like it moves the butt part forward as it does. Yeah

205
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,880
 It's incredible. It's an incredible chair

206
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:54,760
 So this is the part of the show that you want to be on zoom or on twitch to see because now you can see the hand

207
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:00,120
 You sit in the chair and just slides down. It just slides. It doesn't recline

208
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:09,140
 Look at Paul and Jacob look like bad breakdancers from the 1980s with their slides

209
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:18,200
 Bad breakdancers, we're as good as that crazy bitch from Australia. Yeah

210
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:35,520
 Is breaking out yeah, oh

211
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,440
 I had no idea

212
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,240
 Well, each she was so bad. They eliminated breakdancing, huh?

213
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:48,040
 Each host nation can eliminate games and add games

214
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,920
 Well, they did it

215
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:58,080
 Well, that doesn't make any sense though cuz the next one's gonna be in LA supposedly right correct

216
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,380
 Why in the hell wouldn't you do breaking in LA?

217
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,960
 Because no one does that

218
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:13,320
 We don't have competitive breakdancing in this country doesn't bug a little fish still live out there. How about how about who else is out there?

219
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:20,600
 The decision for the 2028 sports that would be at the Los Angeles Olympics was made before

220
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,800
 breaking debuted in Paris

221
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:28,480
 So it was not our friend ray gun

222
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,160
 Who who got rid of breaking it was already before ray gun dance

223
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,000
 So I last got access to the time machine Paul requested earlier. Ah, that's true

224
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,520
 You know

225
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:45,120
 it's possible that someone has now invented a time machine because a couple of people have said things to me in the last couple of

226
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,840
 Days about going back in time machines to do just silly little tasks like this

227
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,760
 So I think I think we're living in the timeline now

228
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:59,800
 Is around and we're just gonna use it for a little for tedious little tasks like this. They're like boogaloo shrimp

229
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,080
 Mr. No bones who are some of the other ones turbo? Oh

230
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:10,960
 There were great names. Yeah, the names were amazing. The next there should have been a medal ceremony

231
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:19,400
 Just for the just for breaking names. Yeah. Nah, I'm just I'm sad to break it isn't there. But anyway and getting a

232
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,520
 Wonderful chair soon for her reading nook. And so that's coming to fruition

233
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:30,360
 Which I'm super happy for her this nook. What makes it a nook your house already has a nook

234
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,400
 It's just a corner of the bedroom that we've we've cleared out

235
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:40,000
 So it used to hold the TV in the bedroom and never watches TV in the bedroom

236
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,080
 okay, so we took the TV and the TV stand out to her in-laws and

237
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:51,820
 That's where that lives now, where do you watch TV on your phone? I have it on my phone

238
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:57,160
 Well, I'm usually sleeping in a separate room most of the time

239
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,720
 Because my crazy 2 a.m. Wake-up call is a little jarring

240
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,240
 so yeah, a little jarring so yeah, so we're switching stuff up with

241
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,040
 all that stuff and

242
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,960
 Sleep I

243
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,080
 Sleep in the guest room right next to her in the reading nook

244
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:24,240
 Okay. Okay. Yeah, and you know, he's gonna be sleeping reading nook in there. I have I've it is the whole thing's a reading

245
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,960
 No, you should demand a reading nook in the guest. No, no, no, no, no

246
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,440
 Don't even say that no and would be like one two for one climbers

247
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:40,240
 It's it's two twin beds in this guest room and the one twin bread twin twin bed

248
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,520
 I sleep in it's made of bread. You told us

249
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:48,800
 It's all bread I do I lay in bed just whoops all bread

250
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:54,200
 Little snack little snack before bed. Oh crusty

251
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,440
 Just like pudding skin I've got a I've got a

252
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,760
 little side table stacked high with trade paperbacks and comics and

253
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:10,480
 The second twin bed is equally stacked high with trade paper back

254
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:19,720
 Where do you sleep in the bed without the comic books on it? But I also I also it serves another purpose. I

255
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,640
 take

256
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,680
 giz

257
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,680
 To bed with me. Yeah, little lady Elizabeth who is the troublemaker?

258
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,440
 She's the old queen who always likes to start shit with the other dogs

259
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,740
 So I take her to bed with me so and can get some decent sleep

260
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,760
 Some of the time. Yeah

261
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,280
 Some of the time

262
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:47,880
 Dog could use a recliner. Yeah, well, that's that's the other thing. That's the other reason that that dog read

263
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,080
 She reads at the foot of the bed

264
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,560
 With her little with her little she does get a little snacky cake every time she comes to bed

265
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,800
 Well, she's got me trained forget about it

266
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,180
 I take I get a little biscuit for her if I don't drop a biscuit on the end of that

267
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:14,560
 Biscuits oh man, you joke night biscuits is where it's at and in the morning night biscuits night biscuits

268
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,660
 This morning, this is my routine I get up I let giz out

269
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,040
 Ted wakes up in her bedroom and he wants out too

270
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,320
 So I get everything squared away

271
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:33,360
 I bring giz back into Anne's room and let her snuggle with Anne because she has to keep them separate and

272
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,600
 then

273
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:41,640
 After Ted and sometimes Adora goes out Bill hardly ever goes out at 2 in the morning

274
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,760
 He's just sleep in the bed. But when they come back, I have to have I get four doggy biscuits

275
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,680
 Get everybody back in the room close off the little gate and that's my ritual in the morning and in the more

276
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,980
 It's it's it's 2 in the morning and all you hear is

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,480

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,960
 Kept singing about masturbatory membranes and

318
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,160
 The night biscuits were done

319
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,040
 next on VH - in front of the music I

320
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:49,640
 Got really really drunk off of

321
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,920
 Hefeweizen and

322
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,720
 Put the tour bus in a tree

323
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:02,360
 And three three of the night biscuits died on impact I

324
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:07,840
 The other eight just left voluntarily that's right

325
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,240
 There were 11 night biscuits

326
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,360
 I told you

327
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,480
 The show I did where I handed someone my knife for the rope trick and said you believe in the power of the magic wand

328
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,200
 And she said I believe in the power of the Lord Jesus Christ, right?

329
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,400
 Right a follow-up here. Yeah, I didn't realize I say do you believe in the power and twice in my show?

330
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,960
 so oh I

331
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:35,060
 Was doing a show in San Antonio and I had some up to the signature. I believe you believe in the power of your your own signature

332
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,840
 And I forgot that I say it the same exact way

333
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,120
 And a woman goes why believe in the power of the Lord Jesus Christ for a while?

334
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,960
 Wow

335
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,200
 Polite applause yeah

336
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,280
 Wow

337
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,880
 And I said, okay, and then we did the whole trick and it worked and everything went great

338
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:59,880
 And then I said really sarcastically well of course every magic I pull off of course is also because of Jesus Christ

339
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,960
 and I got a

340
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,360
 rousing round of applause

341
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,640
 amount of applause

342
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,960
 That I like froze like as if I didn't want to be seen by a reptile

343
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:19,740
 Like sure clapping and I literally was like you melted into the background. Don't don't make a move

344
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:26,120
 You can just like buddy. I made a small joke and you reacted like it was a large joke and now you've startled me

345
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,600
 No, it wasn't a joke at all. No, and that I was actually giving

346
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:37,060
 Credit for my entire show to the Lord are my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. They were just they were genuinely applauding

347
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:42,120
 Yeah, yes, they were given credit to Jesus. Yeah. Yes, and then I was fascinated

348
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:46,620
 So awkward that I froze because I was like if I make a move, they'll know

349
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:50,080
 That I I don't that I was being smart. Yeah

350
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:56,700
 The Lord and then they're gonna turn on you like wolves. I was like and if they Google me I'm dead. Oh, yeah

351
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:06,040
 It's good that we don't say godless in the first two words of our podcast description. Yeah, right. Oh shit, we do

352
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:15,800
 You know what's funny Matt are you considering changing your wording now I am

353
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:22,920
 Are you considering changing your religion now both? Yeah, okay good. I mean, I just want to go wherever the money is

354
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:28,280
 Boy, it's the same thing that happens. We're gonna go religion. That's where the money is

355
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,320
 It's the same thing that happens with Star Wars fans

356
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,200
 when you say may the force be with you and

357
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:40,280
 Then and also with you exactly that becomes the response. It's just turn a phrase

358
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,520
 It's just clocked. Yeah, you know, yeah. Yeah, I

359
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:50,160
 Mean that's just dead. Laszlo in the chat says preaching whatever you believe in is the ICS moniker

360
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,680
 Which I think is just true

361
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,240
 Yeah

362
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,840
 Moniker is basically do what you want. I wasn't like angry that it happened

363
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,160
 I wasn't like you all just confused you idiots you shape

364
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:09,180
 Good job sheeple and not do that

365
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:18,960
 Are you guys didn't think that trick was too bad

366
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,680
 That's right, you're a bunch of sheep let's get him booked in next week

367
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,240
 But yeah

368
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:34,420
 But back home from here now through scoop fest, which is exciting good

369
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:38,440
 My dude, I was thinking about leaving right before scoop fest

370
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,720
 Carton of milk or a pack of smokes

371
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,080
 Yeah, that's it

372
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:51,120
 Hey, I've got a I've got a conundrum. I want to run by you guys. What is that? Oh good

373
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,120
 That is conundrums are a specialty

374
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,760
 okay, so

375
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,640
 I'm scheduled to do my shift tomorrow at the old Tarja and

376
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,720
 Then after that I'm not scheduled at all next week. Ah

377
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,440
 But I am scheduled the two days before I leave for scoop fest

378
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,880
 Okay, so I think they just

379
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:22,240
 Forgot to schedule me for next week. Oh jeez. Now. Here's the thing. You're scheduled in the future past that exactly

380
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:29,780
 Now I asked Dan about this because I did want her opinion and I came back from a managerial standpoint saying

381
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:35,640
 She she schedules people all the time. She said I would probably like someone to bring that to my attention

382
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:42,640
 Just to you know, cuz people make mistakes things happen. Yeah, and it has happened before where I haven't been scheduled and

383
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:48,320
 The bosses are like why isn't Paul here and they're like he's not scheduled

384
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:56,140
 That's kind of like but they discover it on the day right it's like dummies they discover it at 4 a.m

385
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,280
 Yeah, when they'd love to have things going their way, right?

386
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,600
 so

387
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,120
 but I

388
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,840
 personally am

389
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,840
 cool with just

390
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,240
 taking this week as a

391
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,360
 zilcher

392
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,760
 counting on

393
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,080
 the little bit of funds that will probably come in through our

394
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:24,400
 Bucket show right I will I will almost guaranteed make as much at Bucket show as I would

395
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,640
 For whatever a couple of days. I'd be doing at the old Tarjay. Oh

396
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,720
 You think so do you I guarantee? Yeah, so we already spent your thousand dollars, Paul

397
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,420
 You think I make close to a thousand dollars

398
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:47,860
 Anywhere between 15 and 20

399
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,080
 Basically a week give or take

400
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,640
 There you go. Yeah, good. How many how many days is this gonna be?

401
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:00,040
 It's usually a three or four usually usually three or four

402
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,720
 so three and or four

403
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,840
 three and or four

404
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,640
 You know doesn't like this bit my cat, but let's keep going

405
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:17,640
 Shmoopy hates this and then multiply those hours by diddly and squat as far as my payments

406
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:23,120
 Again, you should be on zoom and twitch Matt. Just showed his very annoying cat camera

407
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,600
 He showed the cat annoying annoyed annoyed her head shut up. She was napping. It was like the fuck

408
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,800
 Yeah, no, that's straight up. No fun annoying at all annoyed. That's so funny

409
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:38,520
 Okay, go ahead that that sounds like my paycheck right there

410
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,440
 But two bucket shows

411
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,300
 See that's why I can't that's what I'm counting on I'm counting on that double dip bonus

412
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,560
 That and some other little

413
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:04,800
 Things coming in there you always get HJ's out front of it McMullin's so you always got that going for you, right?

414
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,800
 Right little walking around money

415
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,340
 Yeah. Yeah, my portable

416
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,280
 privacy tube

417
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:19,160
 But I take with me officer this is happening with the privacy of this too

418
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:27,400
 Hey, hey buddy, hey, hey come over here. Yeah, what's up? You wanna you want standing a tube and and have me jack you off?

419
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:33,740
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, get my get my tube here. Come on. Come on over here. Great. Let me just

420
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:38,520
 Is this is this marked privacy tube? It is. It's a privacy tube. Yeah

421
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,600
 I wrote on the side with a marker. It says

422
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,000
 not allowed for search and seizure

423
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,720
 Except from the government's that yeah, that makes it legal

424
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:56,720
 In fact, have you see my license plate? It just says I'm not traveling in a work vehicle

425
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:02,480
 Yeah, half of the tube is a modified Gaston flag and instead of a snake. It's a curled penis

426
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,760
 Good good. So don't jack on me. Don't bite on me. Don't

427
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,600
 What

428
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:17,920
 What's this empty bag of economy 12 pairs of socks? What's this? What's this wrapper from?

429
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,360
 That is my XL

430
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:26,200
 Improvised condom that I have to use. I can't magnums don't even work for me

431
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:32,160
 I have to use so much worse than where Matt was going with these old. I have to use old sock bags

432
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,160
 You know you think I could use like

433
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,920
 Grocery bags, I can't

434
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:45,160
 The grocery bags don't have the plastic doesn't have enough rigidity to maintain

435
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,880
 But yeah, I always complain about my condoms. It's not enough rigidity old

436
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:55,840
 12 to 14 pack sock bags are my condom of choice and honestly

437
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:00,400
 They only cover about half of what I got going on down there. Yeah

438
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,160
 girth and

439
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,840
 Circumference wise both

440
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:13,160
 Deal yeah deal is right. Yeah, no search and seizure

441
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:20,760
 So for Canadian scoops out there in October, yeah land in st. John twice

442
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,920
 Once with princess and once with Virgin

443
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,800
 Okay, and I'm also gonna go to

444
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,640
 Boston and

445
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,700
 Charleston, South Carolina on Virgin

446
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,500
 And so maybe we can do some kind of scoop meetup situation there

447
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:44,240
 Interestingly enough. I'm going to like Eastport, Maine is a big cruise stop on the Canadian circuit. Huh? I was like, oh cool

448
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,160
 I have a bunch of old friends. I haven't talked to in Portland, Maine in a long time, man

449
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,240
 Large state turns out pretty big. Yeah. Yeah

450
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:59,680
 That's the same thing with the Pennsylvania. It's crazy. Like you can't really it's four hours from Portland, Maine. Yeah

451
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,240
 It's not a lunch

452
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,440
 It's not a meetup for coffee kind of situate. Yeah, so

453
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,880
 I'm actually closer to most it's like that's only two hours from Boston

454
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:17,120
 But even that's like not please don't travel two hours to have a cup of coffee with me. I don't think that's worth it. Yeah

455
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,800
 Yeah, although any excuse to get out of Boston

456
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,280
 I should go there. You're right. I should get out and go there. Oh

457
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,880
 No, I meant the people who are in Boston probably want to get out for an hour or two

458
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,780
 Just give them the excuse. Let's get away from that smell of beans

459
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:42,720
 Oh so many beans. It's all baked beans out there. That's what crack the Liberty Bell. I went to

460
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,280
 all them beans

461
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,760
 They're beans though

462
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:55,240
 My my scoop fantasy football name is I say horse you say beans and

463
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,760
 I'm not happy with any part of that

464
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:09,200
 Start we've already lost our first game that would be an amazing chant to get going at Churchill Downs

465
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:24,320
 Magic I'm in a magic magicians fantasy football league and

466
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,320

501
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,280

00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:33,160

507
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,400
 I

508
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:09,220
 Went to the the Westgate this week, they had the big blues bender. Oh the Westgate resort this week

509
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:12,320
 You know that used to be the Hilton where they use to have

510
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:16,360
 The what did you ever see that? Oh

511
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:22,520
 God, I just got a flurry of stuff in my messages because

512
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,240
 September 8th is the anniversary of the closing

513
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,880
 So a lot I thought I felt just good that day. Oh

514
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,360
 Just woke up feeling happy

515
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:37,360
 No

516
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:42,800
 Star Trek the experience around him sort of a bitch. So what was that the Westgate this time?

517
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:49,640
 The big blues bender the the big blues festival that happens in Vegas every year. It's happened at the Westgate for a few years

518
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,360
 But it's a it's a huge blues festival

519
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:57,720
 They do I think it's either three or four days and it's like noon to 3 a.m

520
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:03,320
 Every day. Well, it is this all held in that of Elvis theater. Is that where it all is?

521
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:10,780
 Well, that's one of the rooms so it they've got the Elvis theater. They've got another huge theater set up in the convention area

522
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:19,240
 They've got an outdoor stage. They use the the lobby stage and they have the the shimmer cabaret

523
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:24,480
 Or I don't know if it might be called something different now, but that that theater that's in there as well

524
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,440
 So they have five different spaces. Oh, yeah, the shimmer cabaret former home of menopause the musical

525
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:35,280
 Quite a few different things have been in the shipper. Yeah, I saw

526
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:42,880
 Sacred halls sacred hall. I saw Gilbert Gottfried performed several times in the shipper cabaret. I thought Gilbert the shimmer and it was awesome

527
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,040
 It was Gilbert in that room was so good. That is that such a good room

528
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,800
 It's a nice intimate space stand up is great. Oh, it's so good

529
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:56,280
 I saw I was in the I was in the Westgate for this this big blues festival

530
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:00,280
 We were we were outside some friends came in town in conjunction with this

531
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:06,040
 And they were getting married in Las Vegas. So we were we were hanging out with some friends that had just gotten married

532
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:10,200
 We had some family in town. They were they were hanging out the blues bender. So we were we were there

533
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,520
 we're watching music and I say I

534
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:19,960
 Need to go to the restroom. So I excused myself and go to the restroom there in the Westgate Resort and

535
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,960
 I'm standing there at the urinal guy comes up to me at the urinal

536
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:28,760
 Oh, he starts peeing old older guy old guy at the urinal. He comes up and

537
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,320
 Just lets out the biggest fart

538
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:38,440
 You have ever heard in your life

539
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:46,840
 In a pseudo public space, do you think it was prehensile back there was he trying to grab it was

540
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:51,820
 I don't think I don't think there was any control happening back there at all that explains the symbol crashes

541
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:55,440
 That's the loose caboose the symbol crash

542
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,520
 I was out there rocking a zildjian with his hinder

543
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:09,860
 He almost fucking got it too because I was real close

544
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,360
 Turning and vomiting right?

545
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:20,520
 This guy is gonna make me fucking yeah, what is she's yelled you got a bell? Oh, no, it's smelled

546
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:24,760
 It was the worst thing that's happened to me in a month

547
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:32,400
 Bad bathroom luck the scoops are commenting you have this is my second

548
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:39,000
 This is my second urinal story on this podcast 12 years. Come on, but but still no no

549
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,600
 I was jacking it was yeah

550
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:46,640
 Yeah, that was more than weeks ago

551
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:53,460
 I just thought you were you weren't counting that as a bad story

552
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:58,720
 I've had one bad bathroom experience

553
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:04,920
 The other one I took as a compliment

554
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,480
 I was like this is I just looked at him. I was like what the

555
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:18,480
 What are you doing? And he just oblivious of course fucking oblivion of course

556
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,000
 I mean, I really thought I was gonna yak on him, but that is it was that is the really hard do it

557
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:29,400
 Sure, no, no if you're gonna rip one the bathroom is the is the most appropriate place

558
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,880
 But it is tough here in that close of proximity

559
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:39,120
 Also the Westgate bathroom that I was in I didn't I didn't properly explain the layout of the restroom

560
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:43,080
 What is the Westgate to you? Was this the one inside the old space quest?

561
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:47,760
 It's the one next to it. It's one right next to the old space quest

562
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:53,120
 It was not the one inside space quest not the one inside now the futuristic urinals. No, no, not all that

563
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,120
 Do they still talk? I?

564
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:59,160
 Don't know when you used to ask Jacob when he definitely specified

565
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,900
 He did not go into the bathroom you just described just ask him facts about the bathroom

566
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:07,040
 We didn't go I sure did I sure did Matt because it's me precisely what happened

567
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,480
 I'm going I'm going into the space bathroom

568
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,480
 Even if I don't have to go space bathroom space bathroom

569
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:17,800
 I'm gonna go revisit it that guy was trying to get there, but as he was jet propelled in

570
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:26,840
 You know if he'd done that in the void of space that could have propelled him infinitely towards the outer rims. Oh, yeah

571
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:32,220
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah. No, he's basically warp speeding right through that bathroom

572
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,960
 Oh, but the but the urinals you would piss in them and

573
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:41,560
 It was dumb because we were right next to the Star Trek experience, and it wasn't it wasn't you know

574
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,560
 They were like, let's spacey theme it

575
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,960
 But when you pissed in it, it would go

576
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,600
 detecting luck levels

577
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:54,800
 And it was like yeah, it would go detecting levels. Yeah

578
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:02,120
 L-U-C-K luck levels and now it's very similar now. It just says detecting hepatitis is what it says. Yes. Yeah

579
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:07,520
 We are so sorry. You got you got hep C. Oh

580
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,040
 bad luck

581
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:16,720
 And then then when you when you left when you were giving it the old the old shake

582
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:21,120
 It would go may the look be with you

583
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:26,640
 It's better way the fuck is the lock exactly may the force be with you was may the luck be with you

584
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,640
 And I was like first of all

585
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,640
 wrong space thing

586
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:36,960
 Yeah, it should have done, you know should have done other stuff should have been like luck long and prosper

587
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:44,580
 The only difference now Paul is Las Vegas offers that urinal, but it says would you like an enhanced urinal experience pay six dollars?

588
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:49,920
 Oh, oh and then does the Borg head come out

589
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,000
 Jake you were there does the Borg head come in?

590
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,960
 After I ate one of the hot dogs I worked there

591
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,880
 started peeking out I

592
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,320
 Would pay six dollars to have the 4d Borg head pop out

593
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:09,040
 Give me

594
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:21,960
 Just so our listeners are clear because some people some people you know, some people watch us on zoom

595
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:28,200
 Some people watch us on twitch some people watch us on YouTube some people just listen to this as an audio experience

596
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:34,120
 It's for those people. I want to make it very clear that what Paul wants specifically is he wants to stand

597
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:40,760
 urinating at a urinal and then have the head of a Borg alien come out and

598
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:45,080
 Felaciate him felicitate urinal felaciate

599
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:03,280
 They will blast you with the felicitate or resistance is futile we're getting through the shields captain

600
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,280
 We're almost to the balls

601
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:14,240
 Think about space baseball think about space baseball think about space baseball. Oh, no

602
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,680
 There is such a thing on DS 9 the Niners

603
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:24,200
 Cisco was a baseball fan and he would play games of baseball in the holiday

604
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,720
 I thought you meant there was a toilet that would suck you off as you were peeing

605
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,760
 what I

606
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:37,060
 Thought that was really weird thing to have on this Star Trek show, but there is one in Japan

607
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:42,320
 That's true standards and practices fell asleep at the wheel does

608
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:47,440
 Does the thing in the in the space shuttle can't you know what this is on me guys?

609
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,540
 I I was the one in charge of checking this episode

610
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,720
 That we were what if we were in the in the guardrails, I mean

611
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:00,940
 I I fucked this up you'd be pretty close if you put if you if you tape some googly eyes to that space shuttle one

612
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:03,320
 You'd be pretty close

613
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,960
 right

614
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,440
 Yes, sorry

615
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:15,300
 I know just getting off just just laying out the argument. Go ahead. Keep going

616
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:20,520
 Okay, it's gonna take a lot to craft

617
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,800
 Molded pork head and then incorporate it with a sucky offy thing

618
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:31,420
 Sure, but if you've already got the space shuttle one that goes on your Hoover to our English listeners

619
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:38,020
 The philatator is a real thing in the space shuttle, right?

620
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:41,480
 What do you mean Destro you've lost

621
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:44,280
 I

622
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:49,580
 Tried to tell you Cobra commander someone came in the middle of the night and stole the philatator

623
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,440
 Snake eyes

624
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:57,880
 It could have been I doubt it though. He's a ninja. He doesn't have a need for a philatator

625
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:04,960
 It was probably no. No, it was it was me. Actually. I I definitely had that need for the philatator

626
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:11,360
 That's that's it's me. Oh snake eyes. I got it. It's fine. Now you talk now. I do. Yes

627
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:18,160
 This is this is the reason I haven't talked up until now is this is what I sound you were blocked up. I see, okay

628
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:23,020
 Yeah, I'm just a little stopped up. I am so glad that we could help you out. Mr. Snake eyes

629
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:25,920
 Thank you. Thank you. Oh

630
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,120
 Cobra commander you are an ignorant poppin. J

631
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:32,160
 What you heard me?

632
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:45,640
 However, my what still stands you my one is not because the words themselves

633
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,680
 You ignorant poppin J

634
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:56,520
 That was popular TV writers didn't have the internet so they had a that was back when every TV writer was still 70

635
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,600
 That's what's going on and and had a thesaurus. Yes

636
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:03,640
 Yep, the source from 1962

637
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:12,320
 Yeah, I believe it means like someone just obsessed with their appearance and very preening and prissy

638
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:22,480
 That's what a poppin J is. Well, thank you. I appreciate that Paul. Yep night biscuits of the philatator says scooper Nova girl

639
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:29,360
 I think you have a philatator on the night biscuits. Oh

640
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:34,840
 Yeah to lady 80 are on the night biscuits not too it's not too late

641
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:41,040
 It's not too late to get your scoop costume to get there to be a urinal sprung boar head

642
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:49,160
 If somebody comes to the fucking costume ball as a urinal with a boar head on it

643
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,160
 my fucking shit, I

644
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,160
 mean

645
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,360
 That's a contender right there. I've had a few scoops write me to be like, hey, is anyone ever dressed like this?

646
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,360
 And I'm just laughing. I'm like, nope

647
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:08,200
 We got some wild shit coming this time it's been a pretty it's been a pretty rich meaty vein of

648
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,000
 ridiculous characters

649
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,960
 I

650
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,480
 I'm dressing up. This is the fart that Jacob described. That's what I'm dressing

651
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,560
 I will vomit on you. I

652
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:29,480
 Will just vomit on you. I think I need to be the Borg head urinal equip

653
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,200
 That's crazy. I don't know

654
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:39,560
 All right, Jacob do you have a scoop mail? Yeah, we do let's do some scoop mail

655
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,400
 Message for you

656
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:51,760
 We got a scoop mail from monod knock scoop in episode 1240 Paul talked about anime and manga and

657
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:56,480
 Referenced go which he claimed is what we would call Othello

658
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,060
 Go is not Othello

659
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:07,440
 Othello and reverse II are similar but go is completely different go is said to have been created at least two

660
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:13,160
 Hundred years ago and we have evidence of it from around 500 BC

661
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:18,040
 Reverse II was only invented in 1883 and Othello was in 1971

662
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:23,940
 I could go on but I'll just stop here and say that Paul was wrong on this one. That's what not not scoop

663
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:28,120
 I was close. You can look it up. It's close. I

664
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:33,800
 Agree Paul that you were close. I won't take the I won't take the full L

665
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:39,440
 Thank you rain. We're in chance that you were for me in the comment. You were really edging on that one. No, it's not that far off

666
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,560
 It's not I mean, there's a I think there's a difference in size of the board and that kind of thing

667
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:48,340
 But it's not right size of the board. Yeah. Yeah

668
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:53,120
 Motion of the ocean and whatnot. Oh, no ranch has not sticking up for me. No, it's not

669
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:59,680
 You walk alone I

670
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:05,040
 Do walk I walk alone full journey walk alone into the urinal with the Borg head on it

671
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,940
 Paul just took a full journey there

672
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:13,720
 Me I don't have people supporting. I have no one no one in my corner on this one

673
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:19,040
 But it's better because I'm alone with my Borg head. So that's what we got one for mom and a scoop

674
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:26,000
 It finally happened. Oh, it has been a few years of trying to obelisk my fiance

675
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:30,380
 But it was Paul's hot dog story in

676
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:34,720
 1241 which did the trip. I did it. Yes

677
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,520
 conversion hey, hey

678
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:44,560
 My hubby my hubby to be looked right at me straight-faced and said if you can

679
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:48,060
 Microwave it then that's what I'll do. I

680
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:53,360
 Naively thought about listening to the podcast together was the new part of our love story

681
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:57,240
 But now I only see it as grounds for canceling the wedding

682
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:01,160
 My future ex-husband then told me that during his bachelor days

683
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:06,320
 He would microwave three hot dogs and eat them with bread as a special treat

684
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:09,800
 His favorite though was to microwave the raw

685
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:15,480
 Crumbed chicken patties and then put them in between two pieces of buttered white

686
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:19,680
 home brand bread the super cheap stuff and

687
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:25,240
 Would put some shredded lettuce in if he was feeling fancy

688
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:30,400
 Now now I can recreate that fart for Jacob I

689
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:36,440
 Would like to add here that this time he was having his

690
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:43,160
 Delicacy he was making very good money. So this was a choice. Yes

691
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:47,760
 It's a choice. It's a great choice before wrapping the hot dog

692
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,400
 You would dip the bread in the Lord and let it absorb it like a fun. Oh

693
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:59,360
 I am 150% on this guy's side. I

694
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:03,540
 Read this out to the visionary chef to make sure that he was

695
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:09,520
 Comfortable with me sharing this and he wanted me to add that if he was feeling ultra fancy

696
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:16,040
 He would add in some shredded cheese some pre shredded cheese specifically when question about the kind of cheese

697
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,160
 He said I don't know the cheapest one

698
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:25,400
 Fuck you all in the faces, but only after I've heavily disinfected it. That's the ominous scoop. Boom ominous scoop

699
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,920
 I'm so happy for you. You have found a keeper

700
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:35,160
 This man knows what's up on the culinary tip for real for real

701
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:41,840
 Oh, I like that. That's fantastic. I love me a breaded chicken patty

702
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:46,880
 To this date to this day Mike, but a microwave of course

703
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:53,520
 No, I don't want crisp I want I want it to be rubbery

704
00:58:53,520 --> 00:59:00,000
 You are a monster, no, I'm not I just was raised on garbage food

705
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:07,320
 Climbing you guys gonna have a microwave built into the right by the right by the thigh that new recliner

706
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:15,680
 I'm gonna hook up into the Bluetooth. It's gonna go get out of the chair you chicken brisket filled bitch

707
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:24,120
 You if you bring one more hot dog to this chair, I'm gonna come alive and eat you

708
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:28,520
 No, I'm not gonna use that chair very often

709
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:36,120
 Dedicated games and twitch says that they don't care if they're not married yet. It's time for a divorce

710
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:43,120
 I agree. No, I agree. You have found the one

711
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:51,560
 You have found the one that's it now. I had three microwave hot dogs for lunch today. I'll have you know, what that's what I had

712
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:59,060
 Chaotic don't sometimes the universe sends you signs before you marry a person and this scoop has smashed their face on this sign and

713
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:04,160
 Still didn't notice it. Let me tell you. Yeah. Yeah. No the signs. They're the right signs

714
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:08,020
 The signs are go move forward and enjoy

715
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,800
 That's not a science

716
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:15,280
 Versus right now. I microwave three hot dogs today and

717
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:25,240
 The one in the center was the only one that still retained its hot dog essence the other two

718
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,560
 Became very much

719
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,840
 You know

720
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:35,280
 Burn unit victims, but but there was still fine. So fine. Well, how long do you microwave a hot dog for?

721
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:42,520
 I usually go for about 45 seconds per dog. I'm a minute a minute for two and

722
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:45,400
 It was three. So I went 130

723
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,920
 Okay, it was a little too long

724
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,360
 But and you say the the side ones the two on the outside on the outside

725
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:57,700
 They came a little well done. They came in a little hot at the center one was pretty much perfect

726
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:02,600
 So your microwave three hot dogs you had one that was better than the other two, but you still ate all three

727
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,200
 Do you own a toaster oven?

728
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,800
 don't

729
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,800
 Okay

730
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,800
 patreon.com/a scoops

731
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:20,660
 Honestly, the problem is we don't have any space in our fucking kitchen our kitchen is so small. It's like a Nats

732
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:25,680
 It's like a Nats ass so it is so small

733
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:33,960
 It's so small that when I'm in it and can't be in it and vice versa and we often get angry at each other if we're

734
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,960
 Both trying to be in the kitchen at the same time

735
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:43,560
 It's so small if you have one of the utensil drawers open you can't open the refrigerator

736
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:51,440
 That's the fucking truth one more one more. It's so small that it's so small that

737
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:57,500
 If it's a cold night, you can just go ahead and turn on the oven and that's gonna heat the whole kitchen

738
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:04,760
 Not a joke just a fact, you know, what happens is the same company that makes that recliner it makes refrigerators

739
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:10,320
 So when you only need four inches from the wall and the whole fridge is true lay out on the bottom for you

740
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,880
 You could recline on the refrigerator

741
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:18,080
 My kitchen is so small that Bilbo Baggins was like the fuck am I supposed to do to cook in here?

742
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:27,960
 My kitchen is so small that a Smurf came up in that bitch and was like this some fucking bullshit

743
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,480
 I need room. I

744
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:37,320
 Mean I really don't know I'm back to the I'm back to the chicken patty

745
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:41,560
 I'm back to the breaded chicken patty. What what's the problem with the breaded chicken patty getting microwaved?

746
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:45,560
 It's just gonna be mushy. It's gonna be it's gonna have a little mush to it

747
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,720
 But the trick is you do it half and half

748
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:54,440
 Do it you flip it half and half you do it with 30 and you flip it for 30 flip it and then it's okay

749
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:57,640
 But it's not gonna be crispy or anything

750
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:03,160
 Well, if you do that, it's still gonna be mushy if you do it one side full-on. It's gonna be runny

751
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:11,420
 Do one side full-on, okay, but if you do that, you'll be all right. Yeah. Yeah. I

752
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:21,580
 Grew up on that shit, man. That was the I have not seen a single person in either chat defend

753
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:25,520
 Microwave chicken patties. Look, I'm not looking for defenders

754
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:29,920
 I'm just looking for like-minded individuals who are into freedom and taste

755
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:36,320
 You have another ranch and just points out the oven yeah

756
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:45,440
 Winter scoop winter scoop defends you quiet winter scoop. Thank you. I'll tell you the oven like I said, it's a it's a damn

757
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:55,100
 Gas oven so it takes forever in a day to heat up and then once it's hot it's hot and our house

758
01:03:55,680 --> 01:04:01,360
 It just heats up the upstairs really bad on a hot day. Yeah, so it's not something we want to use

759
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:05,560
 Wrap the hot dog in a paper towel. What are you talking about ranch slunk?

760
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:08,800
 You're gonna get all kind of fibers in it

761
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:12,400
 Yeah, that's the problem. That's

762
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:17,440
 That's my bits of paper towel my concern is bits of paper towel

763
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:24,320
 I know what kind of paper towels you buy that are just disintegrating in microwaves. I'm gonna get you a brulee target brand

764
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:28,520
 That's what I get you for your birthday Paul. What are you gonna get a brulee torch?

765
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:35,720
 So I could just like brulee my my hot dogs over the torch a hot dog over the sink

766
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:37,720
 you just put it on a stick and just

767
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:46,840
 You know what? I would actually really love but I I think it would just I know it would go on it would end my marriage I

768
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:50,720
 Would love to have a 7-eleven roller

769
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:59,520
 So I just life any time like that that has respect for the the cooking the outside in

770
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:06,440
 But nature of how how but can you imagine designed for but it would end my marriage?

771
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,740
 The house would always smell of hot dog

772
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:16,360
 No, I don't know what in your marriage ball or the yeah, the glass dome will do it. That'll keep it the smell contained

773
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:21,480
 But but also I now see I'm sitting here thinking of mine nook

774
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:25,200
 I can get those planner you can't get a hot dog. I could get those I think

775
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:30,160
 Time Paul, this is this is the time in in a married couples life

776
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:36,120
 We're one of the one of the couple wants a thing and this is your opportunity to be like look

777
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:40,200
 I have always hated reading nooks, but I'm letting you have a reading no

778
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:43,260
 You have always hated 7-eleven hot dog rollers

779
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:48,560
 But you could let me have my 7-eleven hot dog roller honestly little of the living room in the house honestly

780
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:54,040
 I'm the one who would not like the 7-eleven hot dog roller in the house because it would be too much of a headache to clean

781
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,040
 Up. I'm gonna get you one of those

782
01:05:56,040 --> 01:06:03,120
 Trask areas all those beat skewers spears for outside. Yeah, the giant meat rack for outside

783
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:06,040
 Oh god, I want to track any animals at all

784
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:11,720
 And Teddy Teddy is on rabbit number five this season

785
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:14,480
 He ate a bird the other day

786
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:20,280
 It just doesn't end with that guy and heaven forbid. I have hot dog rollers going out there

787
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:24,120
 The animal kingdom would come for me at some point

788
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:29,040
 That's not like I like the idea of you outside defending your meat skewers

789
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:36,060
 Like a night like a gladiator there is no defending those meat skewers

790
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:42,860
 And you're not supposed to clean the hot dog rollers it ruins the flavor says Scoob Jesus

791
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:47,300
 I think you're probably right now. I don't I don't want anything to do with that device

792
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:49,840
 Honestly, yeah, cuz you just want to keep on

793
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:54,720
 Microwaving your hot dogs. The reason I microwave is for ease and

794
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:58,440
 Convenience the hot dog roller is not easy or convenient

795
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:03,540
 Listen unless I go to the convenience store where someone else's trick is getting your own bacho cheese

796
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:06,480
 I

797
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:11,180
 Is I know you don't have room for toaster oven, but I'm just saying in the event that maybe you you find one

798
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:17,760
 Okay, we used to have one at the old place finishing a microwaved item in the toaster

799
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:23,800
 Gets back the crisp. Yeah. Yeah, if that's if that's what you're looking for

800
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,960
 You have to be looking for that Paul

801
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,760
 Paul I need you to look for that

802
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:41,640
 As a friend as a friend no, thanks

803
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:47,740
 Come to scoop fest. It'll be at the end of September

804
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:54,040
 Come watch Matt and Paul finally settle this grudge match style

805
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:59,760
 We're gonna have a taste test contest of chicken patties. We both have five minutes to cook it. Oh

806
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:03,800
 I got you licked man

807
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:09,280
 Done in 250. I I get things done just as bad. I cook for children all the time

808
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:14,240
 Okay, so I can cook for you because I cook for my kids. You do the air fryer thing

809
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:18,500
 Yeah, exactly. I have an air fryer air fryer solid and we used to have an air fryer, too

810
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:24,600
 Yeah, yeah air fryer. She took a lot of room. It's an awkward. That's true. That's the only that's it, man

811
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:28,480
 We got a spot for our dishes. I wash the dishes in the sink. Ah

812
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:32,400
 Do you have

813
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,480
 ambitious

814
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:41,000
 My brother my brother. Could you do a top mounted toaster oven hanging hanging right below a cabinet?

815
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:46,240
 No, we have that with the microwave. It's about it's above the oven already and there's no there's no other space

816
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:49,560
 You don't have any other can you in the kitchen because you're not turning on the oven

817
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:53,560
 Could you put the toaster oven in the case you put it inside the oven?

818
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:58,880
 Listen think my it'd be so well insulated. I think I've told you guys

819
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:05,640
 Just yeah, just let it melt into the oven that'd be fine

820
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:10,300
 You never turn it on that oven let's just call that a loss

821
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:13,640
 No, we use the oven

822
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:19,480
 Okay, ah and we we the royals we uses the oven. I use the oven

823
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:22,660
 To hold things. No, I use it to cook

824
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:26,040
 Fair enough

825
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:31,560
 We forgot about the frozen pizza. Oh, I you know what I did. You know what I did. This is my this is on me

826
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,560
 I take full responsibility on this one

827
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:36,000
 that makes one I

828
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,160
 got a

829
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,160
 fresh

830
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,160
 Pizza from Walmart the other day

831
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,840
 Okay, not throw

832
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:48,840
 Okay, so they they they put it like like Papa Murphy's they prepare a

833
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:57,320
 A pizza doughed thing that you just buy and put in the oven put in the oven for a few less minutes and good to go

834
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:59,920
 Right. It was so nasty

835
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:09,960
 Whole thing the Walmart ready to bake pizza. Yep was not the best pizza you've had I

836
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:15,920
 Didn't say it was not the best pizza. I had it might have been one of the worst pizzas

837
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:20,720
 I've ever had like this podcast. We have a history of very terrible pizza. Are you sure that's right?

838
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,920
 It really reminded me of that trunk pizza vibe

839
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:33,800
 Especially especially with the the herbs whatever herbs they put on that shit. I heard herbs, you know

840
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:42,800
 Aromatics, you know, they're covering up. They're covering up bullshit is what's going on. Yeah, Paul likes the aromatics of a nice sausage

841
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:51,040
 I like the aromatics of Chuckie fucking cheese pizza. Like I don't give a damn. Give me cheese plain simple

842
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:57,240
 Yeah, he says over he says this podcast in quotes you Matt. It was you, right?

843
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:00,700
 But if Paul can say we use the oven then I can say this podcast

844
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:06,400
 I use the oven for french fries. I make french fries in there sometimes. Oh

845
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:11,240
 Do you have

846
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:17,800
 Stone or pizza or like one of those special pans? No. Oh, I have a guess I go right on the rack

847
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:24,400
 Haven't got some Paul has a pizza stone. This is not look. I'm not a Walmart defender

848
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:27,160
 But the pizza stone makes a difference

849
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:30,820
 Definitely you can get this pans. Do you put it on top of it?

850
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:35,920
 No, what happens is so that so that you get because the truth is if you're to make pizza at home

851
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:41,720
 They say the key is to just bake the dough first and then add the pizza toppings in the second phase and put it back

852
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,240
 In the oven, right?

853
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:47,400
 Interesting you get that that gives you the best pizza crust quality for an at-home pizza

854
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:53,520
 But if you're talking to make your own crust, no, no, I'm saying I'm just letting you know the logic here

855
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:59,080
 I'm asking how do I get this crust that is separate from ingredients that I then cook first

856
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:04,120
 You can buy like a pizza dough. You can buy like a like a like a Bertolli that's already cooked up

857
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:09,440
 No, no, no, no, not one of those like like a canned pizza dough a

858
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:15,320
 Canned pizza dough or like a but like I could preformed but a raw pizza dough raw pizza dough

859
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:21,120
 Yeah, you need to be raw. It can't be the pre the pre-cooked Bertolli or however you say that one. All right

860
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:24,840
 And then at home if some people want to make their own pizza dough, which you're not gonna do

861
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:25,640
 But we don't have to worry about that

862
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:30,000
 But then you you you you basically do around where you cook in the oven on its own as if it's a loaf of bread

863
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,680
 Like a fright of a bread you just bake it and then you go ahead and add and add it before it's fully

864
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:38,240
 With you you add your okay. I'll just put it back in and that's what gives you the best

865
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:42,000
 Pizza now to circumvent that there's this pan

866
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:47,800
 That has like almost like a screen on top of it's like a metal on the bottom and like a metal screen on the top

867
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,800
 it's like a two layered pan and

868
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:53,000
 You can buy that and you put that pizza that you bought

869
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:58,940
 On there and that screen allows the oven to cook the bottom of the pizza crust really well

870
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:04,820
 While you I could show it to you, but it doesn't help our list. Well, I mean I put it right on the rack

871
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:07,900
 I don't I don't put anything in between it. We should

872
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:10,380
 Okay, you should all right cool

873
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:17,120
 Just think about it. Yeah. Yeah, no the pizzas the pizza stone just helps like it distributes the heat and all like no

874
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:20,520
 I'm sure I'm sure it's better. I'm sure it's better. But honestly, it was just

875
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:24,700
 The toppings it was a pepperoni pie and it was just not good

876
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:32,400
 Yeah, I mean I'm definitely like clocking out I'm done defending Walmart pizza right now you

877
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:41,560
 Know that maybe was an upset that could help you but I'm also fine with you calling it a loss for the rest. Yeah, I'm yeah, I'm out

878
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:44,120
 I'm out. I'm out. I'm gone. I'm gone

879
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:49,880
 Yeah. All right. There's a pizza buddy. I see. Okay pizza dough. All right. Okay got it

880
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:53,120
 Sorry, I'm sending an email here

881
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:07,440
 Oh

882
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:23,800
 Hot dogs and microwaves. Yeah

883
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:30,280
 Hello Jim Cruz and scoop here from Delaware. I feel the need to apologize

884
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:37,120
 publicly to Matt Donnelly for wreaking havoc by passing along rumors that

885
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:43,880
 Spellbound on Princess Cruises was shutting down as it turns out princess is simply revamping the experience

886
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:49,280
 So is not to include dinner and will now be a cocktail speakeasy experience with a magic headliner act Matt

887
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:52,260
 Matt, do you know anything about this or do you know anything about the apology?

888
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:55,320
 I brought this up on Africa babble and not here

889
01:14:55,320 --> 01:15:00,080
 But Chris is a listener of both and he wrote me saying I don't know what the hell this is about and I panicked and wrote

890
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:01,720
 My agent being like hey

891
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:05,560
 Fuck and spread my availability out if this is gonna fuck up my dates that I have in princess

892
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:09,320
 Like let's look around and my agent basically wrote me back being like

893
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:12,160
 Chill out chill

894
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:22,640
 Like no when they say they're revamping it's the experience of September it's because they're revamping the experience of September

895
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,320
 Everything's fine, buddy

896
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:37,040
 Everything's fine. Andy cheek just put a picture in the chat Paul the pan I'm talking about. Oh, okay. Oh, I see now

897
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:40,040
 Okay, cool. All right. I'll look about getting one of those

898
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:45,860
 Yeah, my wife and I will be on board the brand new star princess on February the 14th

899
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:50,120
 2025 this is I guess from the past

900
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:56,480
 And I will be checking out the spellbound venue that if any scoops would want to go with us, but there's all the stuff

901
01:15:56,480 --> 01:16:00,160
 Yeah, oh, they have a web. They have a website though. We've talked about this before go with Lisa

902
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:04,240
 Comm my wife owns the travel agency and as a bonus for any scoops

903
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:09,280
 We will happily provide you with some onboard credit to defray a pretty potentially our right cover

904
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:12,940
 The cost of checking out spellbound as a consolation to the boys

905
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:18,760
 I humbly offer you a price is scryte that I created three years ago and never made it to air

906
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:24,680
 I'm excited to hear the questions since I have no idea what they are cruise and scoop. That's aka Chris

907
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:29,560
 So just real quick over here. Just just to people if people want to go through that website, I'll be on the brilliant lady

908
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:32,860

912
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:52,440
 And then I'll be doing more dates and the following year, but those are those are the big cruises

913
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,440
 I'm doing for the end of the year

914
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:59,360
 Very cool. Let's do a little price of scribe from cruise and scoop here question one in

01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:41,400
 All right

936
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,400
 So where's my phone?

937
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:50,500
 You can't use your phone. I can use a calculator. No, you can't use a calculator. I said no calculators. Where did it say?

938
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:53,500
 We said no calculators years ago. Oh

939
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:59,360
 Right. It's the right next to the air fryer. It says no calculators. That's right. Look at the air fryer Paul

940
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,360
 It's right there. Okay

941
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,440
 Let's see. So

942
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,840
 48 50 60

943
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:14,960
 72 let's let's go an even hundred. I'll go an even hundred inches. That's a guess. I will go

944
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:21,360
 130 130 map

945
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:24,160
 one

946
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:26,920
 Wow, yeah, I think you're both over

947
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:33,400
 Jacob gets a point a hundred nineteen. Wow. Nice one Jacob a hundred nineteen inches

948
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:37,640
 Paul got bit by the Price is Right rules, buddy. I did good. That's fair

949
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:41,760
 Question three every time you shuffle a deck of cards

950
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:46,280
 Chances are that you have put them in an order that has never been seen in the history of the universe

951
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:50,360
 The total number of possible ways the deck could be arranged

952
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:55,340
 Ends up being eight followed by how many more digits?

953
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:59,000
 Paul you're up first

954
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,200
 Is it

955
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,600
 Quatrillion

956
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:10,080
 Something like that. Yeah, I believe it is something like that. Yes

957
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:16,880
 Uh, I will go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 30 40 15 6 and 18 18

958
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:19,680
 18 Matt

959
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:21,640
 19

960
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:23,120
 19

961
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:25,280
 You know where I'm doing 20

962
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:29,040
 20

963
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:39,200
 Jacob gets a point 67. Oh come on boogaloo boogaloo 67 we were off by an order of magnitude

964
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,400
 And then some

965
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:48,560
 67 maybe 40 40 magnitudes. Yeah. Wow

966
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:54,360
 Let's see Las Vegas is known for taking the essence of other destinations

967
01:20:54,360 --> 01:21:01,160
 Reproducing it and making it as spectacular as the original with its own unique Las Vegas spin how?

968
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:06,000
 How tall in feet is the Las Vegas Eiffel Tower? I?

969
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,160
 Don't know how many feet I got into her

970
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:12,360
 Your honor

971
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:17,040
 Matt you're up first

972
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:27,640
 1400 1400 I

973
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:37,680
 Mean that seems I don't know it seems believable. It seems like a perfectly good amount of feet. Oh, that's the tower could be we know feet

974
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:42,680
 That seems like a lot of feet though. I'm gonna say a thousand feet

975
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:45,640
 1400 is way too many feet Paul

976
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:49,360
 420 represent both would it be?

977
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:58,220
 Paul gets a point. Yeah, I didn't want to go too high for 20 represent

978
01:21:58,220 --> 01:22:06,280
 Glad we've got Paul Mattingly here representing drug culture, right?

979
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:15,120
 What he told me in u.s. Dollars of a Taylor ham sandwich from Tierney's Tavern in Montclair

980
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:19,600
 New Jersey menu accessed on July 18th 2022. Oh Matt

981
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:24,600
 This is way up from when you were a young lad servant. Oh inflation inflation. Yeah

982
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:29,720
 Yeah, I should on salted weird pork product that you slide. I have deli meat

983
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:33,840
 On a cooking show the other day they were making a

984
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:39,720
 Taylor ham sandwich, they were doing a good Jersey bit making a Taylor ham sandwich. Yeah. Oh my god

985
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:42,800
 It looked horrible and I still wanted it

986
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:50,880
 It looked salty on as they were slicing it and putting it in the pan it looked salty somehow

987
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:56,240
 These are all designed to get people to drink right everything served in these certainly. Yeah, certainly

988
01:22:56,240 --> 01:23:03,320
 I mean, I think it was designed to survive the Great Depression as well. Well that too. Well, yeah. Well, it's coming back, baby. Let's go

989
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:05,760
 Let's go

990
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,760
 Let's see. So I think the price is

991
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:15,480
 This is Tierney's in 2022. I think the price is six dollars and 38 cents

992
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:18,560
 Paul

993
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:23,960
 Jersey money doesn't go as far

994
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:26,880
 That is true

995
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:30,000
 And plus not compared to the metropolis of

996
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,080
 Pittsburgh they're not gonna have a lot of change on the in this cuz it gets thrown at him

997
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:37,600
 Overgoes guessing 1399. What do you get like a party sub?

998
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:41,240
 I'm gonna go

999
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:45,800
 Five eighty six

1000
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:48,240
 five eighty six

1001
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:52,760
 I was going to say six dollars, but then you guys are right in that range

1002
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:58,720
 Well, but there's there's room. There's you can squeeze right in there. It's dollars. Yep. Yeah

1003
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:01,400
 Here's the things we really get a Taylor ham sandwich

1004
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:06,160
 He's gonna tell her him and cheese sandwich, but he's this Taylor ham sandwich, which means you ah, you'd add whatever

1005
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:08,720
 50 cents for cheese

1006
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:12,800
 Don't remember those days when it was just 50 cents for added cheese

1007
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:18,960
 Here's the really hard part attorneys we just charged whatever we never got corrected and so

1008
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:23,560
 It was like once a year I'd look at the menu bag. Oh really

1009
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:27,400
 Possible that Matt has never known what this cost

1010
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:33,920
 the Taylor Swift ham sandwich it speeds right through you

1011
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:40,800
 I'll split the difference. I'll go six bucks six bucks

1012
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:48,960
 Matt was exactly right look at you Matt and you know what? That's how it should have been

1013
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:53,560
 That's that's how that question the man the man worked there. He should get it exactly right

1014
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:57,080
 That's I'm actually impressed that Paul and I were as close as we were well

1015
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:02,000
 You know what though? I should have trusted my gut and I should have said six because I was right

1016
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,040
 They don't want to put any change in it cuz they don't want to get that fucking shit

1017
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:13,200
 What change thrown at him they got to make everything even dollars

1018
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:19,960
 Yeah, just doing it for their own safety. Yeah, I mean they could still get pelted by some sack of joe is but ain't nobody

1019
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:22,480
 don't knows

1020
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:29,800
 Steven Spielberg once stated in an interview that ET was a plant like creature and neither male nor female

1021
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:36,980
 According to the film's novelization ET is over. How many million years old Paul 40?

1022
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:41,160
 40 Matt 40 million

1023
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:44,640
 Sure, no, I don't fucking know

1024
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:49,600
 Matt you were just talking about the 18

1025
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:56,460
 Civilization the other day. What did it say that? Oh, yeah. Yeah, two two million two million

1026
01:25:56,460 --> 01:26:01,240
 Three million look at this

1027
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:06,320
 Jacob gets a point ten million damn had million years old

1028
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:13,200
 Over the course of her nearly 70 year reign Queen Elizabeth has seen more thing. Oh, this is before she died

1029
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:18,280
 Queen Elizabeth has seen more than a few regime changes in American politics

1030
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:23,640
 How many u.s. Presidents has the Queen met in person during her reign?

1031
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:26,640
 Matt you're up first. Oh

1032
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:36,120
 For nearly 70 year reign how many presidents has she met

1033
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:40,520
 I'm gonna go with

1034
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:43,760
 Five

1035
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,000
 Five

1036
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:48,760
 Let's see I

1037
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:51,800
 She met Kennedy

1038
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:55,520
 She met Trump so that's two

1039
01:26:55,520 --> 01:27:02,040
 Boy Matt thinks five, I mean he must be able to count more than just Kennedy and Trump then

1040
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:07,760
 How much five presidents are you saying she met Matt? I don't know. I'm just guessing

1041
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:10,680
 There's there's Grover Cleveland. There's Taft

1042
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:18,720
 I think she met FDR. I bet you me. Yeah, I was wondering about so yeah, I would think she I would think she must have over

1043
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:25,800
 She became years of being very early in her life. Oh, sure. I would say Obama and Reagan. I think so

1044
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:33,060
 Yeah, I can see George W getting a visit. I just average it out to two presidents per decade

1045
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:35,800
 All right

1046
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:40,760
 Yeah, I don't know let's say seven Paul eight

1047
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:43,680
 Oh

1048
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:49,080
 Paul gets a point 13. That's what's gonna be my guess but I didn't want to go too high

1049
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:57,560
 Represents too many presidents too many presidents. Yeah, it is Matt. How many presidents have you met me one, unfortunately?

1050
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:04,200
 Was in the room with Clinton

1051
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:07,800
 Yeah, I think it's a meet him. Yeah, he Parliament. I

1052
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:13,880
 Mean, I'm a parliament funkadelic. I'm at Bootsy Collins. Mm-hmm. Good. That's all that's all I'd care about

1053
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:16,600
 hospitality to very private

1054
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:24,320
 He didn't want to go in the tube when I met him, you know, that was that was when Clinton was touring with the night biscuits

1055
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:27,440
 That's right. Good good old days. Okay

1056
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:33,780
 I lost three three two. So I well officially so far we haven't gotten to the bonus round yet

1057
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:40,200
 How many points would you like to wager out of your two points? I like to wager two of my points and I'd like to

1058
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:44,440
 Go at a medium pace at a medium pace. Here it goes

1059
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:53,600
 Wheel of morality turn turn turn. Tell us the lesson that we should learn and Matt gets an extra four points Wow

1060
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,160
 Matt is crushing it

1061
01:28:56,160 --> 01:29:01,440
 Matt leaps into the lead with six points. I have to bet all three of my points now

1062
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:06,520
 I'm a low-power kind of spin guy. Just the just the casual

1063
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:09,800
 just just give it a little spin a little spin a roo and

1064
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,840
 I

1065
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,840
 Got a point. Oh

1066
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:19,120
 I'm currently in second place Paul. I must wager it all dick

1067
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:24,280
 Wager it all. Hi Jacob. Oh, here we go. I

1068
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:27,400
 Think he was just commenting on my attitude

1069
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,660
 No, no, no, you don't you son of a fuck

1070
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:44,920
 My cruise and scoop Matt wins with six points Jacob is in second place with four points

1071
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:47,160
 Paul is in third place with three points

1072
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:52,200
 Those are the official scores and the scores before the bonus round don't matter at all

1073
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,040
 That's from cruise and scoop

1074
01:29:54,040 --> 01:30:00,440

1081
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:47,240
 I heard the rooms going away

1082
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:51,760
 No more boats I

1083
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:53,880
 Heard boats don't float anymore

1084
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,080
 Stop floating. Oh, no

1085
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:59,400
 Say it ain't so submarines

1086
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:02,680
 They're poorly designed submarines. These are

1087

 It kind of set my week where I would I do miss the churn driving to the churn and going home

1092
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:31,680
 Kind of yeah, help me really keep like a mental calendar in my head. Yeah of like what's going on Paul

1093
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:37,560
 You moved to Pittsburgh. You can't meh me you know, I said I said no I said yeah, I was agree

1094
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:40,040
 I was a yeah, not a man. Yeah

1095
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:47,640
 No, I was nodding my head. Yes, uh, let the record show I agree I

1096
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:53,600
 Know I'm ending the record to a decide that Paul was nodding his head

1097
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:58,920
 Thank you. No, I got down here to my little uh, my little mini churn and it's very

1098
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:05,120
 It's very reminiscent of the churn honestly with all the tchotchkes that I have around here, right? Oh, yeah everywhere

1099
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:11,000
 You look there's there's stuff scattered everywhere. So it I've recreated the churn to the best of my ability

1100
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:17,480
 Yeah, that's what I need. I need a better physical churn space, but we don't have any so that'll be well

1101
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:22,840
 You've got two kids that makes it hard. That's it. That's it. And the answer is move out

1102
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:25,600
 But I could do it very easily, but then that means my life is sad

1103
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:33,420
 No life's gonna be so much fun when the kids are gone and this is all you have left in your life

1104
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:38,360
 All right, Matt. We're gonna do a test right now. Yeah, and everybody at home with kids

1105
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:41,440
 You can play along with this test. I want you to think right now

1106
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:45,840
 It's right if you have young young children that still live with you. You can play along with this test Matt

1107
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:48,800
 I want you to think about these two scenarios

1108
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:54,760
 The first scenario is the one that you just mentioned your children have left home. They have they have gone

1109
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:59,520
 They have spread their wings. They no longer live with you now, then here's a second scenario

1110
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,760
 They're both 34 years old and still live with you

1111
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:07,680
 I bet I bet it'd be one of those really like delightful like dysfunctional parents for like I don't want to talk about it

1112
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:10,660
 Like like other parents are back your kids still at home, and I think

1113
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:20,040
 I think you're gonna be okay cuz I think that's gonna happen to a lot more people as time goes forward here

1114
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:21,480
 I do the show

1115
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:24,800
 Said I said we do for living. She goes arm retired. I said, oh

1116
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:27,600
 Millennials put your fingers in your ears. Don't listen

1117
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:41,960
 No, and so yeah anyhow we get all that because people find it find the time to head on over to preaching fun comm

1118
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:45,360
 It's like a tear that works for them today. Yes

1119
01:33:45,360 --> 01:34:05,400

 And of course, you know, we converted our

1128
01:34:55,200 --> 01:35:00,960
 Our our scoop fest to robe time, right our scoop fest. Yeah, it's a robe time

1129
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:06,560
 And that's because some people buy different really cool shirts of ours to wear during the scoop events

1130
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:09,760
 and so if you want to wear a really cool shirt underneath your

1139
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:01,640
 Kudos to Matt and Jacob for all the legwork

1143
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:22,520
 But it's gonna be magic for you. I reach out to perform for the variety show. Yeah

1144
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:28,380
 Some we haven't noticed that I'm just like there's some of we've we have you and I have brought up Paul that we've forgotten to

1145
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:32,960
 Include in the past. I was like, I'm not gonna forget this year wrote it down wrote the person saying do you want to do?

1146
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:39,280
 A bit in our variety show. Yeah, and he wrote. Oh, I don't I don't do my act for that kind of money, but thank you

1147
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:45,800
 And I was like I respect it. I respect. Yeah. Yeah sure. I'm always fine with a no I know I'm relieved

1148
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:51,480
 That I no longer feel guilt for having not included this person in the past and yeah

1149
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:56,280
 Now also go like I respect you just saying straight up like oh, no, I promise

 That's totally fine. Yeah, that's totally fine. Now. I will I would are coming to see Chris angel perform

1151
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:09,460
 He won't be performing who will not I I would argue but you're gonna tell me that he invented scoop fest before we did

1152
01:37:09,460 --> 01:37:10,960
 hilarious

1153
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:15,440
 Clearly, which is true. Whoever this is and I'm not clear on that, but whoever this is

1154
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:21,560
 Is not aware of the community and is not aware of what scoop fest really is

1155
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:26,940
 Well, that's that's I've made this mistake before with reaching out to people who I thought I was closer to than I was and then

1156
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:29,560
 Understanding our podcast and going like what?

1157
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:36,200

1158
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:39,840
 I don't know what this is gonna be no one has ever no one has ever regretted doing scoop

1159
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:47,200
 No, I was gonna say to to a to a man everyone that has performed and come to our our spot has been

1160
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:52,200

1162
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:07,560
 Yeah, like they didn't get to perform for whatever reason and then they have been mad for years

1163
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:14,020
 Always they're like hey, when are you doing that scoop fest again? We got it. We got a set of times. Yeah
