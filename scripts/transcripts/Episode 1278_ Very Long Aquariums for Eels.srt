 Who are the ice cream truck drivers? Those are the folks that deliver that fucking ice cream straight to your fucking ear holes

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,440

00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,440
 But we will thank each and every ice cream truck driver before this show and a future episode this month

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,560

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,640

 Do you want to go to an ice cream social? Yeah, I'd love to great. Let's go

16
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:08,440
 Shout out to win Matt Donnelly discovered the best

17
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:14,200
 Manual nose hair trimmer that I've still ever used the eagle

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:24,520
 It's time for Matt Maddenly's ice cream social sitting in Las Vegas. It's Matt Donnelly also sick in Las Vegas

19
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,680
 It's me Jacob the audio guy sitting somewhere. We'll figure it out later. It's Paul. We're preaching fun. Yeah

20
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,120
 Paul's not here

21
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,120
 You know, it's funny. We got a couple of

22
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,960
 Compliments recently this thing our recent episodes have just been have been on a good in a good spot

23
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,280
 We've been out there

24
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,680
 What better way to bring it to a screeching halt than simply not knowing where Paul Mattingly is on this earth?

25
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,520
 I think it's maybe a good way to just slow it down

26
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:58,040
 We'll show you but the chat is continuing to find different ways to portray boobs in emoji form in the chat

27
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,360
 It's very exciting

28
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,160
 Lori else off the two sunny side eggs. Very nice. Very nice

29
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,600
 Everyone so creative. Oh, it's got text from Paul breaking news. Oh, hey

30
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,920
 Be home soon, so it wasn't sleeping. Oh

31
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:23,240
 Well, we don't know that you might have been like on a park bench somewhere just just dozing

32
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,920
 Just feeding the birds and just

33
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:32,280
 Fetch in the middle of January in Pittsburgh, no

34
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:40,680
 It's so nice out it is freezing for Las Vegas, right? It's 44 degrees

35
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,560
 40 degrees

36
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,440
 It's got down to 38 which is Celsius for our foreign listeners. So I don't know five

37
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,960
 I've were terrible at converting Fahrenheit Celsius. I have no idea

38
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,080
 But it's negative 30. I don't know. Yeah

39
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,060
 But I go to the gym and I'm my gym right now

40
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,800
 It's just like our little community center because my actual gym gym closed my gym gym closed

41
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,240
 Oh, oh Jim Jim top of the morning to you my Jim Jim closed

42
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,660
 So my my regular gym closed it's gonna be taken over by a crunch Jim eventually

43
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,600
 It's a coming soon what thing which is also funny, right? Like pizza places just become other pizza places

44
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,800
 Right like Jim's like what else you're gonna do that space it has like it has a pool and workout equipment

45
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,440
 Are you just gonna so it's gonna be another gym? Oh, yeah, I forget about the pool. Sure. That makes sense

46
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,180
 Yeah, it's why I had joined that particular gym is because all right

47
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:40,080
 Cuz you could go in there and and and and stare at the young ladies who were swimming exactly

48
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,140
 You can go swim exactly but I have those glasses that look like eyeballs that are looking up

49
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,720
 And so therefore you can't tell that I'm staring at the spring ones

50
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,240
 Yeah, but I taped them so they just look like they're looking up good smart. So that way that way I'm not creepy

51
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:02,440
 That's why he's the best and I

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,580
 Go, so what I do is I go to the community centers called the multi multi multi Jen multi Jen center multi generational center, right?

53
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:17,880
 Okay, so they have you know kids camps. They got swimming lessons. They have like classrooms for to teach classes for adults

54
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:24,600
 it's a big it's a big big outfit over there and one of the has is a gym in a walking track and a pool but

55
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,960
 A big like okay. It's like where the where the competitions are where the swimming competitions are

56
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,680
 locally for for the schools

57
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,040
 Gotcha, and so I go to the gym in the evening around like 530

58
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:44,640
 Which means the Sun has just gone down and spit was super windy yesterday like really windy crazy breezy yesterday

59
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,920
 And I look out the window and there's a fucking swim meet happening

60
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:57,900
 Was like what fucking hell on earth

61
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,120
 Where why it's it's still January. I know we live in the desert

62
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,160
 But it's still January

63
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,180
 Why on earth is an outdoor swimming meet happening?

64
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:18,800
 I mean best case scenario in the pool and I assume an unheated pool in the desert in January. It's not pleasant

65
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,600
 It's not nice

66
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,360
 No, like without a breeze. It's just it still was a cold day

67
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,440
 But it was like that means like, you know, like oh man when you get wet and then there's a breeze

68
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,200
 I mean, that's all right. Yeah, I couldn't believe I just all these kids

69
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,320
 It's honestly the reason that I don't swim half the time. I don't swim

70
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,080
 It's cuz right now I'm just not swimming in case a breeze comes up. I

71
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,240
 Mean it's been a minute, but I that story where I was hired to be a

72
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,120
 Bathing suit model by accident. I think I told the story on there

73
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,520
 It's been a while. It's been a while though

74
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,840
 But yeah, so so they'd cast just off of headshots and then it was me three male models and four

75
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,480
 gorgeous women models and then a bunch of bathing suits that didn't fit on my fat body and then

76
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,800
 Right. I forgot they had the bathing suits

77
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,000
 So I stuffed into one of them like a sausage and then yep

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,240
 Good

79
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,480
 We had it to go do like a pool shoot and there's literally like two pools like a giant lap pool and this beautiful kind of

80
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,800
 circular fountain pool for like

81
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,400
 Hanging out and renting cabanas, right?

82
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:33,240
 Mm-hmm. So they set this really fancy camera and they art directed me to the furthest place away from the camera

83
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,120
 They put a fake that

84
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,120
 That is good art direction

85
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,040
 They put a fake drink in my hand and put me literally 200 yards away from the camera

86
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,280
 All right, so they had the hotter people closer to the first pool

87
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,940
 I was just supposed to be decorative like background and the second pole

88
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:56,360
 Here's what they did. They put all the they put all the super hot people in the close-up pool and they put me behind

89
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,480
 the camera with a jib

90
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:04,760
 Can you you hold this this bounce this light bouncer this reflector? Can you hold it?

91
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,960
 I don't think I'm even on camera over here. No, you are you are don't worry about it. You're fine

92
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:16,680
 The look I remember still the art dressers face when I was trying to squeeze into a bathing suit and him just going like why

93
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,400
 Why are you here?

94
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,160
 What have I done to deserve this hanging out in the tent and listen to all the hot people talk about all the different

95
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,320
 Things they have for their veggies and vegetable smoothies and which blenders they use and stuff

96
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,360
 I was like I know what a blender is

97
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,560
 I

98
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,360
 Just put snakes in mine

99
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,960
 But it was freezing cold. It was like a freak. It was it was like it wasn't as cold as today

100
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,000
 But it was it was probably like 50 degrees still very cold to be in a pool. And so I

101
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,280
 Being the only person in pool B

102
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,360
 Really took my time getting in try to not even let it ripple

103
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,920
 He's like even if I just got up on my on my stomach like the wind was blowing and it would just freeze, right?

104
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:05,600
 So I was saying like perfectly still in the water to like not like to establish a level and not change it, right?

105
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,760
 That was yeah, that's what I was doing. And then at one point they want to shake things up

106
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,760
 I'm gonna shake things up and said I move people around

107
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,760
 Except me. They said to keep me right where I was

108
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,480
 I

109
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,480
 Had taken the first shoot to a build a wall

110
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:30,120
 They set the wall up between me and the camera. It's all one of the hot guys pretending your friends with fat

111
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,120
 So back there, right? So they sent him back there

112
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,680
 And you said that's not how you pronounce my name

113
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,480
 And

114
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:46,760
 And he was a big old beautiful dummy. So he ran great and just jumped in the pool

115
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,800
 Yes ran and just left into the pool and I was like, no I've established

116
00:08:51,800 --> 00:09:02,680
 You're rooting for both of us

117
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:13,560
 He gets up he's wet and then we start saying still pretending to talk and gesture one another while they do this right and

118
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,720
 And he is like man. It sucks. It's cold

119
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:24,040
 Sure does buddy

120
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,000
 He's like cuz the winds blowing I was like, oh no one of us has already figured that out

121
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,760
 Yeah, the other of us knows which blender to have to make the best vegetable smoothies and the other knows how wind works

122
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,800
 on cold skin

123
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
 But we both got this game

124
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,840
 We're both getting the same check buddy

125
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,280
 I

126
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:53,800
 So remember that shoot came out it was it was it was not I was not in the pool stuff

127
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,960
 I was in the at one point they like decided like

128
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,240
 Set her attention on me and like do things with like they were pushing me in the pool, right?

129
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,200
 And that was oh, okay. Those were the those are the final shots. The pool was me getting pushed in the pool

130
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,240
 while girls with their dad showed up

131
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,040
 Give us money and let us gamble go away

132
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,040
 The those those didn't make it because they probably looked over things like it just looks like we're picking on someone

133
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,440
 Now I was just fat this time I was still young so I didn't come off as their dad

134
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,320
 I just came off as like I don't know their gay best friend or

135
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,040
 You know someone they went to high school with you know that kind of a thing

136
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,240
 Who's with us for the day

137
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,960
 This is a make-a-wish guy that said he wanted to hang out at the Caesars pool before he died. I

138
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,120
 Didn't know they did exchange students to the Caesars pool, but I guess they do. That'd be great

139
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,820
 Like you're dying like you want I want to you want to hang out with famous magicians

140
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:56,760
 No, I want to know what it's like to get bottle servers and have bottles hang out. That's my I

141
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,640
 Want you to just buy me a table at Omni

142
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:09,040
 Craziest nightclub make-a-wish is like we can't afford this. I want a poolside cabana at towel

143
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,280
 Right give it could we just buy you a pool just buy you a pool

144
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:22,960
 Someone in chat saying they're trying to distract me with their zoom background their zoom background is the crucifixion

145
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:29,120
 It's just it's it's three people on crosses on a hillside, but I'm not sure if that's the real one

146
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,480
 Cameras back then I mean

147
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,000
 You know not to put the car before the horse here, but that's a beautiful sunset. I mean, it's perfect

148
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:47,920
 Perfect sense. How could you see that sunset behind three people hanging on crosses and not believe in God?

149
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:55,200
 Wait, someone said do you see the letters the letters on there? Oh, it just says it says titties or tits. Oh good. Oh

150
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,540
 The cross of the crosses spell titties now I get it

151
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,520
 Great boy. Did that take me too long and

152
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,360
 Not help the audio version of this podcast at all

153
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,600
 All right, but yeah, I think we're doing great

154
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:23,480
 Hey when you were growing up Jacob did saying the word it sucks like that sucks was that considered like extreme oh

155
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:30,680
 That was definitely considered that was a that was a word we could get in trouble for yeah me too

156
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,200
 Yeah, my kids throw that like it's nothing all the time

157
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,200
 Really? Yeah

158
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,280
 Do you smack him just give him a taste of the back of the hand at one point?

159
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,240
 I was like, you know, I offered to make a breakfast whatever they're like

160
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,480
 Oh, do we have it? You know, do we have waffles? I look I was like, no, we're out of waffles and my youngest goes

161
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,480
 Well, that sucks

162
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,480
 and I

163
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,480
 Didn't go like hey timeout

164
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:05,520
 Was an extreme thing to say when I was a kid you guys start out like it's nothing and when you directed at me

165
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,280
 It's very jarring and it makes me really angry

166
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:14,960
 Sorry, I'm making you breakfast are you spoiled asses don't have waffles today mother

167
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:23,060
 But yeah, so my kids say sucks like no problem to hear other kids say it so I guess it's okay to say sucks

168
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,560
 maybe maybe um, I

169
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:33,440
 Definitely have a memory of me saying something sucks to my dad and him stopping and just just looking at me and saying something along

170
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
 the lines of sucks what?

171
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
 Go ahead

172
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,440
 What does it suck?

173
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:46,120
 You're like it was definitely something along those lines was like I put point-taken titties dad titty

174
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,640
 Yeah socks

175
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:58,000
 Saying something blows definitely couldn't say shut up. Although you can't you still can't say shut up. My kids know just say shut up

176
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,360
 We got in trouble when we were little for stupid if we if we called somebody stupid

177
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
 We got in trouble for that. I

178
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,400
 Remember really getting in trouble

179
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:13,540
 The first the first time I thought I had to like get caught cursing and had to confess to my dad

180
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,960
 I said up yours

181
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,320
 Which I don't even think

182
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,800
 I don't even think that's like even on the radar as an insult anymore

183
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,660
 That was huge. I I said up your nose with a rubber hose

184
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,980
 Mattingly is here Paul Mattingly everybody everybody everyone Paul Mattingly. Hey guys

185
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:41,560
 Well Paul, you're late. So up yours, buddy. Oh boy. Now I'm getting it now

186
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:49,480
 You know what it's absolutely fair the boys told me we adjusted for the time I wrote it on my calendar

187
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,960
 For some reason this morning I woke up and I go. Oh, yeah two o'clock podcast

188
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:00,600
 Do do do do do fart fart fart just tootling around that was part of it

189
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,800
 Okay

190
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,200
 The other part was I'm doing my morning business

191
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,120
 Getting ready to take a shower

192
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,980
 uh-huh, and I'm scrolling on my phone and

193
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:22,040
 What to my wondering eyes should appear but the local toy shop going business sale

194
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,840
 Oh, we never have everything we never

195
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,280
 Everything must go

196
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,560
 the fact that he came back is just

197
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:43,940
 It's only ten minutes away from my house, so I was down there is basically the bad signal went to the sky

198
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,400
 Yeah, I had no choice

199
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:54,080
 They entered the siren call and went to the toy store and just was zombieing out for an hour. Just oh

200
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:01,480
 What can I get? You know, I got I got a couple good little little trinkets. Nothing too crazy and go too crazy

201
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,480
 Local toy stores also go get a business. So pour one out. Yeah

202
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,200
 No

203
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
 this was a

204
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,520
 This place called Toyland

205
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:20,720
 Anyone has ever thought Paul isn't that selective with his rage? Okay. No, I this place is

206
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,340
 Okay, you guys have you guys don't have you guys don't have ollie's on that side of the world

207
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:34,240
 No, I don't always so ollie's for the East Coasters is this discount chain?

208
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,880
 That's sort of like big lots was in its heyday

209
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,880
 I'm from the East Coast. Okay, like a newer East Coast thing. I think so. Yeah, okay, so

210
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:49,760
 You remember big lots when it first popped off yeah get some really

211
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,680
 May as a kid you could get some amazing deals

212
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,520
 You could take five bucks down there and come home with something significant. Yeah, you know, oh, yeah. Yeah, so

213
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:09,880
 Ollie's does this they get warehouses full of old toys and things and put them at pretty deep discount and sometimes they

214
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,880
 You know clearance them out even there

215
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:18,440
 What this toy store Toyland was doing was clearing out the best of Ollie's sales

216
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:26,240
 Bringing them to their store and repricing them above and right at MSRP or higher

217
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,200
 So I was kind of like well, this isn't a business

218
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,680
 I mean

219
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:38,520
 So their business plan was take things out of the bargain bin mark them up and then try to resell them. Yes

220
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,920
 That's already called eBay. I know

221
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,400
 It's basically like an eBay but but not as many

222
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,360
 good

223
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:54,840
 Items now occasionally I found some deals at the win stores start doing corporate dumpster diving

224
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:01,280
 Things are bad all over things are bad all over and I hate to see a small business go under but I also know

225
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:09,480
 That they are straight-up just resellers and they put everything at a price that no one could deal with and they were doing big-time

226
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,080
 Pokemon scalping as well. So I'm just like man

227
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,280
 Do you think it's possible that they're just faking the out-of-business sale and they're just gonna be one of those stores

228
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,020
 That's perpetually going out of business. That's just their new thing

229
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:26,540
 No, I the owner was there and I heard you guys are listening to the last episode of Matt Madley's. Oh

230
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:34,800
 Now the owners the owners were there and they were talking about

231
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:42,660
 The next chapter or whatever. So clearly they've got some other scheme up there 11 is the next chapter

232
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,360
 11 you're right. You're right. That's yeah, there's two locations in the Pittsburgh area that are going under

233
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,100
 Again, it it makes me sad but you know

234
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:59,280
 Not that sad because it was a dumb model and I would go like I'd been there like four or five times

235
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,600
 They'd only been open about a year and I'd been there a couple times to try and support them and the last time I went

236
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,160
 I just walked right out with nothing because I was like there ain't shit here

237
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:15,580
 You know, it's just sad did you ever talk to him? Like did they properly nerd out about toy products where they know?

238
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:20,860
 It's not like that. They're not in it for the love. He's not in it for the love. He's just a scalpy. He's a scalpy scalp

239
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,000
 This is it Paul need some heart in there. I

240
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,020
 Imagine he has I imagine he has probably one

241
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,440
 Fixation. I don't know what that might be

242
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,040
 You come back to Vegas you always go to the same toy spot around the corner from my house

243
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,880
 Yeah, Ralph's his name, right? Well Ralph's is the comic book shop. Okay. Oh, right

244
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,460
 And then and then Ralph's just happened to have a new toy store rogue toys built

245
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:55,040
 Place right in that same slot. That's a total nerd cave now, man. It's got rogue toys. It's got that

246
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:00,600
 Smashing ground rogue toys has always been in that in that ballpark though

247
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,280
 They've always like when they were downtown and everything they were always that like real nerdy spot

248
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,240
 Like yeah, no rogue toys is great. I had wonderful

249
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:15,120
 I always I always knew that if Paul got a divorce and then got remarried I could go get his remarried gift at that rogue toys

250
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:21,640
 You could you could buy half my collection. I sold nearly four thousand dollars worth of toys to them and

251
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,920
 And that was at a loss for me

252
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,360
 You know when I was moving I had to get rid of so much stuff

253
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,500
 But they were cool about it. The only thing that really bugged me is I went back in and I'd sold them some of my

254
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,200
 Mega blocks turtle stuff and I I let go of a piece that I came back and I was like

255
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,440
 What are you charging for that that I gave you for ten dollars?

256
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,080
 So, yeah there were there one or two go back and look again

257
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,480
 Well, I mean well that was the thing I went back and I was like, oh look, it's my entire collection on display

258
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,000
 That's what SJ will do SJ will do that when we go to concerts

259
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,960
 She'll be like we'll be in our spot and then she'll I'll see her on her phone and then she'll be like hey

260
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,200
 What what did we pay for these tickets again?

261
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:14,880
 No, I mean hey look no regrets you gotta if you're a collector, you know collections come and go

262
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,240
 That's what it is, you know

263
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:22,680
 It's it's just and I've I've been so fortunate to build back so much cool stuff here in the new space

264
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,240
 And I don't know. I showed you guys last week last time the amazing

265
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:33,720
 Enterprise that I just got which was you know a lazlo I showed them the video

266
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,800
 Of the enterprise that I've set up. It's just it's a gorgeous

267
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:44,560
 So I've got I've got more collectibles and I know what to do with it's lovely, you know, it's just fun spending time

268
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,560
 so I apologize that

269
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:52,580
 My forgetful brain and my blindness in toys led me to be a half hour late. So

270
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,160
 we all assumed you were dead and

271
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,800
 That's the right assumption to make you know, and we started a podcast anyway

272
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,420
 A wellness check at your door. Just the

273
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:10,920
 Matt text to me is like I can't knock on your door. So good luck. Hope you're not dead

274
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:21,000
 Yeah, I'll stop Paul might be dead they would add into the podcast anyway, that's the following sponsor today's show

275

 I'm sure no off for breeze flavored vodka presents booze cruise on the trash barge

279
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:45,280
 That's from Nathan's hot dog scoop in 2021 Paul I'm sure I

280
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:52,480
 Shouldn't speak for Nathan here, but I think Smirnoff for breeze as his practice is also good enough to be its own commercial

281
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,880
 But if you want to also just commit to the booze on the track, I agree

282
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,440
 I think we're good with Smirnoff for breeze. Yeah for breeze is our sponsor

 He was so pleased with himself

344
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:43,800
 I don't they call me Paul duo lingo Mattingly. Okay, they do call you that

 Thank you, you've got that Benjamin button shit

358
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,840
 so one of the things they ask you is they say, you know, can you want us to

359
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,160
 Download your contacts to see who else is doing this. Oh

360
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:51,920
 And they could partner you up do that and normally I say no to all of those. Yeah things

361
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:58,580
 But they're gonna barge your friends with shit. I was like, oh, let's give it a shot. No

362
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:02,200
 And I haven't heard from anyone else yelling at me yet

363
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,280
 But I woke up to my first kind of social aspect to text from Duolingo. Oh

 I couldn't write back to do a lingo to be like Rick's been dead for six years, but sure

367
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:26,360
 Like oh my god, if you can connect me to my dead friend Rick like yeah

368
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,480
 Wait a minute. It's like a fucking Ouija board kind of feature the dual

 Bullshit to make your friends talk back to you from the grave. It's not as scary as it sounds

379
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:33,840
 Except when the AI takes over and starts talking all kinds of racist trash because that's what they do

380
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,160
 All of your dead family members will be racist

381
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:45,080
 They're all racist now. Oh my god. It's what happens when you die you become racist. I guess so

382

 What the fuck is happening

397
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,400
 Can't row my brain our brains not working well today

398
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:05,320
 Well, maybe one of us cause this first had to be a little late in the program. Oh, oh now we're shifting blame around

399
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,320
 Well, okay

400
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,000
 We're not shifting it around. I think it's been the same place the whole time. Oh, really?

401
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:20,680
 All right, Matt. All right, Matt, let's let's let's shift some other things around. How about this one? How about this one?

402
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,560
 Don't they a style of Bibliotheca?

403
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:30,760
 See one as Bibliotheca sure great

404
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,800
 One as Bibliotheca

405
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:39,460
 In the chat look at motherfucker

406
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:44,720
 Take a look at

407
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,760
 You stack of books. I'm not you over like a stack of books. I take you out like a stack of books

408
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,720
 Fucking why I'm always looking like a bibliotheca new fucking and rice collection looking son of a bitch

409
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:00,280
 Stephen King novels

410
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:07,300
 Section and then in the Bibliotheca looking so do we decimal have an asshole?

411
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:14,220
 You card catalog located motherfucker

412
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:24,000
 Do they even have card catalogs at the library more good. Yes, I don't know sure because we've all been to the library recently

413
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,860
 Yeah, I have why I was late to the podcast. I have

414
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:31,620
 50% off I take I take I take my kids at the library

415
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,720
 But we rarely we don't usually use the Dewey decimal system over there

416
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,600
 No, I guess most of its all been transferred to computer

417
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:44,160
 But I wonder if they ever I guess did they I know there's no reason to keep all that data. I guess on cards. I

418
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,260
 Wonder what the I should look online. I'm just asking questions into the fucking void, but

419
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:57,400
 What can you consider a good repurposing of those Dewey decimal card holders?

420
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,760
 Oh those huge those huge very specifically sized drawers

421
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,040
 well, what would you imagine would be a good second use for those spice rack comes to mind a

422
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,780
 Very large spice rack. I mean for a for like a for like an industrial kitchen. I

423
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:18,240
 Mean that's a lot of spice. It would take a lot. It does take up a lot of space gun rack

424
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,520
 Could you fit a rifle in some of those long boxes?

425
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:29,720
 Probably oh be kind of cool to just pull out a shelf of guns. I've got it. I've got it. What do you got?

426
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,240
 Don't even move them out of the library

427
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,400
 Turn them into beehives

428
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,400
 In the library just in the library

429
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:44,120
 Beehives an apiary. I mean they would work as hives. I

430
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:48,200
 Suppose. Yep. No, no, I think that's figured it out

431
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,700
 Can I bring crystal saying business cards?

432
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:59,840
 Ravi's a storage of Chinese medicine. Yeah, that's how yeah, I think rhino penises would slide in there pretty good

433
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,080
 Mm-hmm

434
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,080
 Well, once you dehydrate them

435
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:10,920
 Of course, I wasn't talking about non dehydrated rhino penises

436
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,040
 Those are what you're always talking about hydrated rhino penises, Paul

437
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:23,180
 You won't shut up about hydrated rhino penis just because it was my band in college

438
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:30,600
 You'll add that one single we did have that one single there's good the shirt was the thing that kept us going

439
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,080
 We had a really cool shirt for hydrated rhino penis. Oh, yeah. Yeah

440
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:39,480
 Oh, there's a three-dimensional aspect of it that I think people really appreciate it people liked it

441
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,240
 It was made of that pup. Remember that puffy paint. That was such a rage back in the late 80s

442
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,640
 It was all puffy paint

443
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:54,000
 Puffy paint dehydrate or hydrated rhino penis shirts were all the rage at my school

444
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:01,580
 Modern-day apothecary tables. Yeah, that could be cool. Oh my god that could store

445
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:08,000
 Pokemon and magic cards. Holy shit that'd be an awesome way to store your Pokemon and magic

446
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:16,040
 I like all these suggestions like we have a giant card catalog. What could we repurpose this as Oh a card holder?

447
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:25,540
 Okay, all right. Yeah, you're right. All right. What else what other thing could you do?

448
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:32,920
 But I already said beehive already got the right answer. What about a bunch of weird long ways aquariums?

449
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:40,080
 But that would have to be just fish that like living in the dark most of the time or

450
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,700
 Oh eels

451
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:46,400
 You don't want to turn around drawers of eels and snakes

452
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,200
 That don't want to turn around

453
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,760
 Eels that hate turning around

454
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,600
 Oh

455
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:03,940
 My god, oh it would be great for organizing Lego. Yes

456
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:10,720
 Would be awesome for that I keep waiting for Paul to move on to anything else

457
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,740
 But he just keeps listing off things that people are saying that you can do with a card catalog

458
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,680
 It's a great topic

459
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:23,880
 We're not talking about enough because think about the thousands of libraries that are out in the country right now and think about the disused

460
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:30,520
 Uh-huh. Dewey decimal card catalog holders. I mean your universities those probably took up a room

461
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:35,720
 Sure, right. Oh, and did those this is the problem we need to be

462
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,980
 Destroying this furniture. Are we just throwing these out? Is that what's happening?

463
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:46,280
 Repurposed at a very long aquarium repurpose recycle reuse

464
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,500
 Very long aquariums for eels that don't need to turn

465
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:59,160
 Right. Yeah, we could you need directional eels. We could put beta fish. They don't move around very much

466
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:05,400
 Or is that cool to them the who kind of fish the alpha fish

467
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:12,300
 Alpha fish don't don't aren't that's not real that the guy who wrote about the alpha fish regrets his paper about the alpha

468
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:21,060
 Teaching alpha fish how to talk to people I did I did

469
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,340
 But I misconstrued it and I thought it was part of the whole alphabet

470
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:29,140
 I thought it was alphabet fish, but you do love a bit. I do

471
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:35,020
 Yeah, don't get me started omega fish the alpha fish

472
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:43,260
 Omega me. Oh, I can't believe I'm gonna move on from this, but let's do some

473
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:49,160
 You you can move on all you want

474
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:53,920
 I am continuing to come up with repurposing ideas for disused card catalogs

475
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,660
 Continuing to use Greek letters with aquatic animals

476
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:02,240
 Next up zy dolphins

477
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:08,640
 Zy dolphin sounds like a fucking new medicine for Edie

478
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:14,880
 Like introduce everyone to this my epsilon seahorse

479
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,640
 I was like I get targeted on Instagram for

480
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:28,180
 Like basically like don't get the wrong Edie meds if you have to pee urgently after you have an orgasm

481
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:32,400
 Do you like do you sprint to the toilet after after you have an orgasm?

482
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,960
 There must be there's a greater. There's a greater scientific

483
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,040
 Area of concern

484
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:48,320
 Going on and I was like wait wait isn't that isn't that the whole thing you orgasm and then pee like that's the whole thing

485
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:53,720
 It's like it's your doctor Paul. It's your doctor. It's just one continuous stream, right?

486
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,820
 You don't wait for you for you guys orgasm begin peeing is different

487
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:12,600
 Why is the world spinning do you think you're into golden showers? You're not you have a scientific health issue

488
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,280
 Boy oh boy that the the amount of

489
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:29,480
 Treatment for that shit. I mean I guess it's whatever well. I know it doesn't for me. I was like wait

490
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,800
 I'm not I'm not even a step one of this medical thing yet

491
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,880
 So like why are we how did I end up how'd you get on that targeting on the long end of the arc of that?

492
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,880
 Yeah, that is very specific like yeah, do you find?

493
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,800
 Yeah

494
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:51,040
 Have you experienced slight green discoloration and your balls after ejaculating using this?

495
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,840
 Medication you might be using the wrong stuff

496
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,920
 You have food coloring

497
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,960
 You've been eating green eggs and ham

498
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,480
 We got an email from scoopy Ramon

499
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,320
 Hey gentleman of the churn and possible guest nope

500
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:12,320
 There was series of random middle connections not worth detailing here

501
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:18,740
 I recently found myself regaling someone with a story of enthusiasm over experience from my past

502
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:23,960
 It made me think that one or all of you might have a story that fits this category

503
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:29,180
 My stories are enthusiasm over experience

504
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:33,400
 Are we are we insinuating that our enthusiasm?

505
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:41,160
 Outpaces our experience well when we say I love boobies. What does that sound like it sound like we have experience or does it sound like?

506
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,640
 Yeah

507
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,480
 In that respect my

508
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,440
 Base is my experience

509
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:55,320
 So here's my example of enthusiasm versus experience in high school

510
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:59,200
 I first caught the acting bug by doing the school plays a friend of mine

511
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:06,020
 I'll call him Chuck because that was his name had played an extra as a freshman and had told me repeatedly about how much fun

512
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:11,000
 It was and how many girls were in the school plays one of those two things convinced me to audition

513
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:17,540
 Fast-forward a bit and Chuck and I are now both extras in the next school play the play was the crucible

514
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,640
 Oh as freshmen

515
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:24,120
 We were both relegated to extras in a scene where two or three other characters are talking Chuck

516
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:30,720
 And I were to play jail guards or something, but they were of course non-speaking parts, but shouldn't we do be doing something?

517
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,880
 Dumbass attention starve sixteen-year-old me asked that exact question

518
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,040
 Fine, just don't steal focus was the reply

519
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:46,900
 In the production of the crucible in my high school there were two

520
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:54,000
 Puritanical jail guards who so fervently believed that the rest of the world was too chill about

521
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,480
 Armageddon and stuff to stay in England

522
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:02,160
 Did their best to not make any noise as they shot dice in the background of the Salem witch trials?

523
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,360
 also, I

524
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:08,720
 Can't tell if it makes it better or worse that we all my cause

525
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,520
 I

526
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,160
 Can't tell if it makes it better or worse

527
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:20,840
 then we fashion our own dice out of clay from the art room so that they would be period in hopes that the director would

528
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,840
 Let us do more and that is

529
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,720
 way worse

530
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,560
 Definitely worse

531
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,240
 Hilarious that is how lair period dice

532
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:37,900
 No way those dice rolled true right so they could have rigged some kind of gambling scheme

533
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:44,680
 Because they certainly always rolled, you know six or something like, you know, right? There's no way they built a great

534
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,400
 evenly weight distributed clay dice

535
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,640
 Probably you are you guys want to get into my dice game here. I got a I got a dice game going on over here

536
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,200
 I got a special homemade dice. I just got to sell them hard

537
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:02,160
 Gonna sell them hard on the crucible thing and that these are, you know era appropriate gambling

538
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,880
 That's right

539
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:11,120
 What's that? What's a priest me for craftsmen? We could take him for all the money we have you remember how back in back in the day

540
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,740
 It was all

541
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:15,740
 Dice in the alleys down those puritan streets

542
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:22,840
 Anyway ever get it over your head on something with enthusiasm

543
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:31,520
 For something that now you have some more experience than it was an obvious rookie mistake much love FYI t f y da t f o

544
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:39,840
 W i a t f that's scoopy Ramon. Thank You Scooby Ramon. Thank you, and I appreciate this on a deep level

545
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:44,200
 I had this experience when I was in kindergarten and

546
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,440
 Was in a school play and I was an elf

547
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,000
 Sneaking on to the stage

548
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,280
 backing up and I was to bump into Santa Claus and be surprised and I insisted I

549
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:00,720
 Insisted that I hold a toy and then drop it in surprise and shock

550
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:04,400
 I was like, how about I tell you I was like I was giving I gave myself business

551
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:10,420
 I was like, how about I take a toy and I and I well when I bump into Santa. Oh, that's good

552
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:13,240
 That's good. I dropped the toy and they were like fine. Whatever, you know

553
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:20,140
 I was obnoxious and I was you know, 18 19 is my freshman year and only year of college

554
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:24,300
 We did Rosic Reds a gilded also your senior year

555
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:32,760
 We did Rosic Reds a gilded are dead. Yeah, I got cast is just polonius, right? It was just really in that show

556
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,800
 like not, you know in the hamlet a vital character, but still like a

557
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:42,340
 Tertiary role kind of thing and rose goes are dead. I really just came in to illustrate that that's happening

558
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:47,620
 Throughout the hamlet, right and I did so much

559
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:52,080
 Business and I tried to get so much laughs

560
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:57,480
 Like a baddie old man, like I was obnoxious looking back

561
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:03,660
 I'm like so ashamed like if I if I were me now in a play with me then I would be like

562
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:06,840
 Can you chill the fuck out and play your part? Can you just?

563
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:13,000
 Accept that you didn't get cast as Rosencrantz or gilded turn. Can you just move on?

564
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,240
 You know, it was it was it was it was obnoxious I

565
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:27,600
 Got to bust out during a ride. Oh, Matt. Donnelly has a question. That's correct. That's exactly that's exactly the level it was at

566
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:36,480
 During my college freshman year. I got to play rolling mall and present laughter and I had that character is just annoying and crazy

567
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,480
 And so I just got to go

568
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,720
 ballistic as a young

569
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:45,520
 Ham and it was fucking glorious and I killed it

570
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,960
 It was it was really really really fun. But then also I was like well fuck

571
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,280
 I that I was in a main

572
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:56,700
 Production with all the graduate students. I think I'm done here

573
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:03,440
 Boy, I was like, I don't know. Seriously. I got like third for the top billing like what the fuck what else?

574
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,160
 What else is going on? It's six more years to do this again. No, thanks. I'm fucking

575
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:15,520
 That was really one of those things I took away from that experience was like, okay, I can go do other stuff now

576
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,540
 And he did I sure did indeed go do other stuff and

577
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:31,120
 Still is doing other stuff and unless he's died between the recording of publishing of this episode

578
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:34,120
 you never know and I'm still doing the

579
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:42,200
 More enthusiasm than the experience when I got to do the the warm-up gig for P&T

580
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,280
 Yeah

581
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,980
 Exactly. That was ridiculously crazy, but it worked out worked out real good

582
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:53,600
 But I was just very lucky

583
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:59,400
 Right place right time and boy. Oh boy was that guy previous to me just tanking it

584
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:06,180
 Yeah, you just she had like a different job right or whatever we were you there when he got fired or I yeah

585
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:10,800
 I was there as pen stand-in. Yeah, I was doing that's right. Yeah, you were doing standard work

586
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:16,880
 Yeah, I was doing standard work and then I kept doing standard work and the warm-up right for that season. That was wild

587
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,960
 That was a lot of work

588
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:25,600
 Fun though. I think every job I've ever taken was definitely taken with enthusiasm over experience. Yeah

589
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:30,680
 Yeah, I mean at least up until I was 35 right

590
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:37,000
 Including including when Matt called me and said you want to do a podcast I

591
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:43,480
 Mean, I would say that would definitely be enthusiasm over experience for all three of us. That was Paul that well

592
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:49,960
 Yeah, I mean well, but not not really I don't have any experience. I had experience talking into a microphone. That's about it

593
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:56,480
 Oh, I don't I still don't know diddly squad about putting together a podcast properly. No, I mean I know a little bit

594
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,480
 But not not a ton

595
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,580
 Don't get on the feeds. I don't

596
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:05,840
 When other podcasters ask us for advice they are disappointed often

597
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,840
 Like I don't know record it and throw it in the ether

598
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:20,000
 Yeah, release the episodes on time. Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, I can't I can't don't show up a half hour late. I

599
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,560
 Can't start off my TED talk with be friends with Penn

600
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:29,780
 Why not be a hard one to do

601
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:37,400
 It's not easy to execute advice but it is that it is advice that can be executed can be can be done

602
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:43,520
 We got an email here from Anonymous, here's a what would you do story?

603
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,640
 We had a little what would you do action?

604
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,920
 Well, it starts when I visited a dance scene that I hadn't gone to in about 15 years

605
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,400
 I hit it off with a guy I used to know and like a scene from a film

606
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,600
 We danced together for most of the late-night blues party

607
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:05,840
 It was romantic and incredibly hot when we left he carefully asked I might be reading this wrong

608
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:10,640
 But would you like to have coffee sometime to reassure him on several levels?

609
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:15,400
 I answered. Yes, that is the perfect thing to say that is much better than my suggestion

610
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,760
 Which was to go to my hotel room and fuck

611
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,560
 Whoa

612
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,040
 It's a good answer. It's a solid answer

613
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:27,880
 When we met for a date, I was glad to find we were both vaccinated atheists

614
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:32,720
 He's 15 years older than me though, which put me on edge because of a bad experience. I had with an older guy

615
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:38,720
 I started worrying we wouldn't be compatible and saw a red flag when he mentioned a right-of-center newspaper

616
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:44,640
 Still he was kind and empathetic and the chemistry was hard to ignore at this point. What would you do?

617
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:51,640
 But this point I could continue on the day you keep on each other, right? Do we know the gender of our writer?

618
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,120
 We don't okay

619
00:51:54,120 --> 00:52:01,320
 I feel like gay or straight if an older man came to meet you if you want to say let's let's cut through the

620
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,980
 Bullshit and go fuck. I feel like they would do it

621
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:10,840
 Well, I think the writer was was saying that to be funny more than more than like an actual suggestion

622
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:15,680
 The other person the other person they had been dancing with said like hey, you know, we've been dancing

623
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,600
 We were having a good time tonight

624
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:21,760
 Would you be interested in going to get a coffee and they're like I am interested in getting coffee

625
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,200
 I was gonna say we should go fuck but yes, let's go get coffee, right?

626
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,840
 So then the question is how we feel about if they start mentioning right-wing newspapers

627
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,660
 Yeah, like kind of just where we're at at this point with it, I guess

628
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:39,440
 So there's a little bit of a little bit of stuff that they're worried about a little bit of stuff that writers worried about age

629
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,960
 It made the newspaper I guess

630
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:46,560
 But still kind and pathetic and had good chemistry

631
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:50,520
 So, yeah

632
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:57,520
 We did our best to be respectful and with full consent that it might be a one-time only thing. We spent the night

633
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,920
 Okay turned out. He's good in bed

634
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:04,440
 Oh, yeah, and we have a kink in common

635
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:10,340
 So I got very excited at the potential to explore this which would be a first for me. Okay, big, right?

636
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,340
 That's what I'm guessing. So it's like the shrimp

637
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:15,540
 Let's go

638
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:24,600
 We spoke on the phone a few times

639
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,480
 In an impressive backfire of complimenting me

640
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:35,280
 He said he only wants to date women at least 10 years younger because women his own age look old

641
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,040
 What?

642
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:42,200
 Casual sexism and he apologized guys

643
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:51,300
 Know that I'll be breaking up with you in nine years. Yeah, right. I said good day

644
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:03,760
 Don't get comfortable universal all women age the same all men don't don't worry about it

645
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,040
 Wow, no problem I

646
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:15,360
 Called him out of this casual sexism and he apologized next it came out that he voted for a political party that I don't like

647
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:19,260
 But I don't want to be and I hate people who vote X person

648
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:27,840
 Finally, like he was quoting a soundbite. He said it's hypocritical to believe in global warming and still fly

649
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:32,520
 Yep, he doesn't believe in global warming. Come on

650
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:39,760
 I got the feeling he didn't always think before speaking most people wouldn't call their promising sex partner a hypocrite

651
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,040
 with a sell-by-date

652
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:47,880
 Oh with a sell-by-date, right and this is all just making this sex hotter. Yeah, you know

653
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,960
 Sure, that's the kink the kick. Oh

654
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:58,800
 Tell me more horrible opinions. Oh, yeah

655
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:02,780
 Shut up and keep fucking me you big dummy go

656
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:10,220
 Having my first period menopausal mood swings. I crashed hard

657
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:13,840
 Don't be I with your tongue on my toes go

658
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,480
 Hey, that sounds like a good night

659
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:31,560
 Having my first period menopausal mood swings. I crashed hard and ended things. Damn it

660
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:36,320
 I get very uncomfortable with debates and didn't attack his beliefs. I spoke my piece

661
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:39,120
 He listened and it and it didn't become an argument

662
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:42,760
 He apologized properly and was shaken by how much he had upset me

663
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:49,960
 It was the most respectful breakup call I ever had shortly after that time three people I knew got terminal

664
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:54,560
 Diagnoses and depressing political stuff was happening. Oh at a low point. I asked myself

665
00:55:54,560 --> 00:56:02,760
 What would I do if I only had six months left? Oh, my reaction was I would call that guy and tell him

666
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,960
 Don't say anything about anything

667
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,360
 Let's just have some fun

668
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:15,440
 This is really hard right it is this is really hard because it's hard to meet anyone that you're

669
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,640
 Sympathico with in general. Oh that kind of hard. Yes

670
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:26,560
 And then to try and navigate especially currently just how polarizing opinions can be

671
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:31,480
 Sure, but what how important like we've made everything so important

672
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,520
 when I was a

673
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,560
 single I

674
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:41,000
 Remember being an atheist like factored faster than I thought it was

675
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:46,400
 Like I was certainly willing to not give a shit about that person being Christian

676
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:54,660
 And the early dating parts. Yeah, and it just it kind of it would come to a head faster than I than I thought it would

677
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:58,280
 Yeah time, you know, yeah, that's just a younger generation thing

678
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:03,360
 I mean, they don't they don't view blowjobs as a thing that you need to wait on as much anymore

679
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:08,000
 but it's it's true in relationships if you

680
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,600
 You know if you find out that your partner is prone to magical thinking

681
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,560
 then

682
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:20,760
 It opens up other doors and if you find your partner is prone to saying off-color possibly bigoted shit

683
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,960
 there's probably other shit behind there too, right like that's

684
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:33,160
 Well, I mean maybe if you you know, I think it's I think it's hard to examine like

685
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:40,320
 male loneliness white male only this has like its own thing, but like the truth is like this is an example like

686
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:46,000
 Wherever this guy is getting his echo chamber. Yeah, there's no yes global warming, right?

687
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:52,460
 You're breaking up with him sends him back to that space. Yeah, but but yeah, but I don't know

688
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:57,280
 Yeah, but it's not and it's not your job responsibility to save. Yes

689
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:05,560
 Right to save all of stupid white male America like I mean, you know, I've been having I've been out of the game guys

690
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,920
 No, but you know, whatever

691
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:16,320
 But we want we want I found a woman who would save me the thing that I do for my single friends is you know

692
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:19,600
 Like write down everything you want in a man, right? So in this case if you want to say

693
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:26,560
 Awesome in bed believes in science like, you know, like like what happens is like we write that list down

694
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:30,900
 It is not crazy to look at that list. That list is not like there's no one on earth who could fit this bill

695
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:35,320
 No, and like and I did I did that before I ended up

696
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:39,240
 Dating and I made my specific list of things

697
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:45,200
 I wanted in a partner and it not only does it reinforce what's important to you

698
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:52,360
 But it narrows your field of vision and you don't just go wild off the handle looking at people who it just quickly

699
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:57,540
 Nullifies possible bad choices, right? It sharpens your head man

700
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:03,680
 It's it's it's what I talk about an improv all the time too. You know, the the real key to improvisation is focus

701
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,120
 That's it. Where's your focus?

702
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:11,920
 Okay, and so that's it. That's it. It's really just focus

703
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,880
 like I can teach a lot of different stuff, but focus is what it really a lot of what it really comes down to and

704
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,800
 with anything

705
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:24,720
 decide what's important decide what you're truly looking for get clear about goals and

706
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,720
 things that are important to you and

707
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:31,920
 The bullshit falls away. Yeah, but it's hard to keep focus

708
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:39,320
 It's that and that's especially true now and that's why we see a lot of what's going on within our political spectrum

709
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,660
 It is designed to destroy

710
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:44,000
 focus

711
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
 Sure. Yeah. Yeah for sure

712
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:52,440
 I don't want to I'm gonna go back to other point, but what you're I don't want to no no no, no

713
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,680
 Yeah, that point is valid

714
00:59:54,680 --> 01:00:00,320
 but I think so many times like our ability to be flexible to be giving to want to

715
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:06,720
 Put things on the line to like our willingness to possibly change to help to bend for other folks. Yes

716
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:14,840
 I think you get lost in that ship. Yes, and and then and then you combine that with the sunk cost fallacy

717
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,300
 Yes, good example. My yes. Yes. Yes, I envy

718
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:25,920
 I've been in this shitty really you're like I can't get $3,000 in a month. I can't do it

719
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:34,920
 And you think you're gonna get out of relationship you're gonna be embarrassed you think your friends are gonna think oh my god

720
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,360
 You put so much time in your friends won't care at all

721
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,360
 You know

722
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:44,720
 It's it they'll care about you, but they won't care that that that you put more time or less time in

723
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,240
 they don't

724
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:51,360
 You you you anytime you take a step towards being healthier your friends are going to be grateful that you're in a better space

725
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,480
 No matter how long it took you to do it

726
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:56,040
 That's worth saying on its own also

727
01:00:56,040 --> 01:01:01,840
 If they're your real friends, right good and not your frenemies and that's it

728
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:07,800
 Those were talking about also you can be you should be also be more selfish about your friends

729
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,600
 You should be you know

730
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:14,480
 if you if you have a dysfunctional relationship with your friendship group or you feel like you're you know not truly a

731
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:15,840
 like

732
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:20,260
 Jive is not a mute. It's not truly mutual with your friends group. You should get new friends

733
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:26,440
 You should get to find it any kind of hobby any kind of club any kind of meeting. Yeah, you're right any kind of bar

734
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:31,520
 Oh, there he goes. Here we go. You know what he can do better than us Paul

735
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,880
 Jacob can do better than us and I'm glad he's gone. I

736
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:41,200
 Wait a minute. I looked around I turned out I couldn't do better. That's a double-edged right there

737
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,920
 I'm glad he's gone

738
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:52,200
 Then I'm saying as a guy who lives in like, you know an urban and suburban environment

739
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,920
 You know, we have numerous scoops right us

740
01:01:54,920 --> 01:02:00,880
 You know where they have basically stayed in their religion longer simply because they would know they'd be completely alone in their community

741
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:05,520
 Sure, right become atheist like I understand that this is an uphill battle and bigger things

742
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,840
 I'm only saying in your heart

743
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,040
 don't think that like

744
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:17,500
 Compromise compromising all of your wants is the only way you know, right? Right?

745
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,900
 I think you made the right choice in put the kibosh on it

746
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:25,920
 Because fool me once shame on me shame on you fool me twice shame on on me

747
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:30,840
 And wait, what do you what kiboshes has happened here? Well, she she broke it off

748
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:35,800
 And the writer you they broke it off what I

749
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:41,760
 Haven't finished reading this email yet. Oh, I thought I I thought they broke it. Oh shit

750
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,480
 We've just got we've gotten sidetracked

751
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:55,400
 What would I do if I only had six months left my reaction was I would call that guy and tell him don't say anything

752
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:59,840
 About anything. Let's just have some fun. Oh, no, that thought stopped me crying

753
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:05,480
 I asked myself seriously am I that shallow and my brain said yes

754
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:10,480
 Oh, you asked what I want and I told you if you can broker that deal

755
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:14,320
 I'm in after a cooling off period. I arranged to call him

756
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:20,260
 We agreed that being friends was a disaster and I said I had heard of the concept of sex clubs

757
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:26,400
 Where apparently you don't discuss politics, how would he feel about meeting as if we were at a sex club?

758
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,560
 He said I can be there in an hour and a half

759
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:37,880
 He added if I turn up and you decide no, I'll drive home and I'll not sulk about it, which was a helpful reassurance

760
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:46,440
 This guy definitely had a had has some reassuring qualities to him. Sure. This is smart. This is yes

761
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:50,720
 We had a better night than the first at the time of writing

762
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:56,000
 We meet every couple of months always checking. We're still okay with it and enjoying it while it lasts

763
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,400
 We've had some amazing times and he said and done some very kind and thoughtful things

764
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:06,720
 The kink exploring is going very well. I can't believe it took me this long to buy some sex toys

765
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:10,280
 I found he's a fan of Tim mentions poem

766
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:15,320
 Storm and of Penn and Teller's bullshit. So he has critical thinking awareness

767
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:20,120
 It's just well behind the times and certainly not helped by the media and politics that he follows

768
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:22,480
 Maybe some of my attitudes will rub off on him

769
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,440
 Maybe some other things will rub off on him too

770
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:30,240
 Hey as I try to avoid generalizing or being negative and I really try to understand rather than judge

771
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,240
 So am I naive?

772
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:37,200
 Liberated morally challenged making the world a slightly happier place or all of the above

773
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:44,920
 Thanks for reading fucking with the faces in a private sex dungeon after a good spanking tied with easy escape cuffs. That's anonymous

774
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:48,920
 Anonymous. Thank you so much for sharing and being so open with us

775
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:55,160
 That's this is a lot of fodder here to think go through those options again

776
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:59,780
 Am I go ahead Jacob am I it was it was a BC and date? Do you remember?

777
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,640
 Let's see. Am I let me find here

778
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:15,960
 As I try to avoid generalizing and or being negative and I try to understand rather than judge so am I am I naive

779
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:22,000
 You want to go to a one at a time am I naive no, I don't think so

780
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:28,960
 Liberated yes. Yes, you're liberated. Yes. Definitely. Am I morally challenged? No, no

781
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:37,040
 Don't think so making the world a slightly happier place. Yeah, I think so. Yes. Yes, that's it. No like yes

782
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:40,680
 I don't think you're naive. I don't think you're morally challenged. I think you are liberated

783
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:46,060
 I think you I think you are making the world a slightly happier place both for you and your companion

784
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:50,720
 Yeah, the like look you said you have kinks and fetishes, right?

785
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:57,540
 Like that's a it's often a very difficult conversation to broach on in a regular dating environment. You found someone who fits that bill

786
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:05,280
 You want me to put this light bulb where and they agree to everything right you put out everything you want it again

787
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,680
 You just did we just talked about without whether we didn't got to it

788
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:13,960
 You were like if it could be this and not that and always this and never that and he said yes you both

789
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:18,960
 Intelligently made an agreement. Will that get sloppy at some points or we end up in the conversation at some points sure

790
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:26,720
 But that happens in every relationship no matter what you're doing. Anyway, so like what you did do was actually you literally

791
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,080
 Came up with your most selfish list for this person to still be in your life

792
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:34,960
 And this person said they'd happily fit those parameters. That's awesome

793
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:40,880
 You laid it out this person accepted and it seems like it's going okay

794
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:44,560
 because now you might need another guy who's also dynamo in the boudoir and

795
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,960
 And then decide I don't need to meet this

796
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:52,360
 This this is this right winger for for private sex anymore that might happen

797
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:56,640
 But you you've actually allowed yourself to leave that door properly open, right?

798
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:00,960
 Right, if you were dysfunctionally dating this person and you were going to meet someone to be like, oh, but I'm dating someone

799
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,200
 Oh, but it might get messy now. Now you're fucked up, right?

800
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:10,720
 But you you have the exact sexual relationship you want with this person you want to use this person. He says use me

801
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:15,480
 You're in that spot you've appropriately set expectations

802
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:15,840
 Yes

803
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:21,760
 And now you if you would now encounter someone you could have a more fulfilling rich with you'd be able to move on to that thing

804
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,760
 No problem, right?

805
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:26,680
 Now, I think this is a nice thing. I think this is a nice thing anonymous
