 Here's a show. Hey Johnny. Do you want to go to an ice cream social? Yeah, I'd love to great. Let's go
 Several horses reportedly did not come to the Las Vegas rodeo this year because of a horse flu
 No, I know horse whoopies
 really
 Social sitting in Las Vegas, that's Matt Donnelly sitting in Pittsburgh. It's automatically sitting in Las Vegas
 Loaded with horse herpes. It's me. Jacob the audio guy
 Fun first off I didn't because of the music they want to interrupt but Bama lamb
 Horse herpes Bama lamb Bama lamb
 If you type in horse herpes Google will auto fill Las Vegas. Oh shit
 Yeah, wait a minute if you type down herpes at all Google will auto fill lost me
 Can they get this by like sharing a water trough and shit? Is that how bad it can be?
 That how viral it is. Where's Nick Newman when we need him?
 I was looking for him in the chat before we started. He's not in. Let's see
 No confirmed cases were reported reported in Nevada, but there is a significant equine
 Herpes virus outbreak affecting horse events nationwide causing major major disruptions cancellations
 like the all-in barrel race and
 It heightened biosecurity at the NFR rodeo, which is the one in Vegas here during early December
 so a lot of people just didn't bring their horses a lot of people just just left their animals at home and
 Came to the rodeo. Apparently the rodeo was really affected by it
 Paul says Paul Paul's Paul is right. Let's do it
 Okay, primarily directed through contact nose to nose or indirectly from shared items like tack buckets clothing and even people's hands
 Aerosol droplets or contact infected with fluids man. It's amazing how we all don't have horse herpes. This is everything
 I'm already looking up if it can go to
 People no, it's not a zoonotic jumper, please. Fuck. No
 I don't want horse herpes if I
 Know our next humans cannot get infected with horse herpes. Don't worry about it. Keep on fucking those horses
 Keep on the horse a fucking use a stepstool safety first people safety first. That's right. Oh good Lord
 Yeah, just be out there puffing it. Mr. Hands has nothing to worry about
 There'll be more horse herpy stuff in the new Taylor Sheridan show about the rodeo
 It'll be called it'll be called bull rider long dick man
 Speech guy Sheridan's running out of good names bull rider long dick man speech guy
 You know what you know what to say about riding bulls
 What's that? A lot of times people think it's all about those eight seconds. You got to stay on the bull
 Those eight seconds. Those are the least important seconds of the whole thing
 The most important time is when you enter the pen
 my secret
 Give that bull a little light touch behind the ear. I
 got a little dab of
 Hot icy cold on my finger. I give him a little rub right behind the ear with icy cold. I
 See hot and that's what he's what he's quoting. What are you quoting? I'm making up a dumb
 speech that he would do for this
 Rodeo, I thought you were quoting something but you're doing
 I'm improvising Matt. That's what I do. No, no, no
 I didn't mean to be that much of a dick about it
 But you didn't make me feel liberal guilt, that's why I didn't think it was a Sheridan speech
 Also to be fair, I don't I don't watch you don't watch so I don't know enough of
 Okay, so now I know where to go to go with. Okay. Yes
 I rub a little bit behind there and then when that bull knocks me off
 After eight seconds if I stay on there for more than eight seconds
 That bull is outlived its life and that bull is gonna become your case of fajita over at Chili's next week
 But you can't look at that bull and realize that's my case of for a heater coming to me
 You look at that bull thing. What a noble beautiful animal and all I see is the
 999 dinner for two special at Chili's
 You fucking limp tarred
 Enter share it at checkout
 Closer is that more like yes, I don't yeah close pretty that's much closer. What a dick. You're gonna watch any of those shows
 You would hate them Paul
 You would hate them I
 Know there was a thing is a yellow stone like lessons yellow stone
 there was this character a pimp like a hippie who got arrested but he became like a like a girlfriend of
 Kevin Costner, but like in this like pseudo, we don't like each other, but we do kind of thing
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, and her job the last season was just to get lectured by every cast member of a different aspect of Montana society
 It's a good gig if you can get it and at one point this one character who's a Native American
 Who's already was already feeling guilt about marrying into a Montana family that like, you know, it's against her Native American
 Uh-huh, you know, whatever she lectured her and I was like Jesus
 I was like everyone's breaking character just a lecture libs
 Once we torched this lib girl, we can go back to fighting about real things between our cultures
 But in the meantime the enemy of my enemy is my friend
 and
 There's a plot point happening in land made right now and I and I and I and I feel crazy
 Only because like in season one this person got a payout from the oil company like a wrongful death suit
 Okay, this couple this whole season this whole season
 They're fighting over money and I'm like weren't you paid a shitload of money from an oil company?
 Why isn't that coming up in conversation? Why is it coming up?
 You were paid out
 There's a large plot point last season about the large plot point that's happening right now in mayor of Kingston
 which I watch right now like like the pilot episode is that
 What's his name the guy got ran over by a snow blower in real life Oh
 Hawkeye Hawkeye. Yeah. Yeah. Yes
 So that guy he ends up becoming his brother's job because his brother gets killed in a botched robbery, right?
 And they went through like four seasons were like man. We haven't brought him up in a while
 So the last episode that they bring up his dead brother like six times
 So go they're really making up for the lost
 Lost bit there Jeremy Renner Jeremy Renner is who I'm thinking of. Yeah. Yeah, it's hard
 It's hard. He's it is
 Yeah, okay you talk about somebody coming away with the wrong life lessons after a near-death experience
 Yeah, oh
 Yes. Oh, he's just kind of doubled down on his asshole or he's a bit of a shit bird. Okay. Yeah, I
 How I don't know I I like Jeremy Renner a lot
 Not a lot. I like Jeremy Renner. I'd fuck him. He's gonna break your heart Matt. He
 It's probably true
 but he like
 like
 Survived on like like he and his brother were like split like a box like doughnut holes when they were like dirt poor
 Okay, they got by in Hollywood by like buying and flipping a house and then flipping that in other houses and doing construction
 So like that but like he went from like dirt as poor to like building himself up into
 Like a house flipper while trying to be an actor at the same time and I thought that was pretty cool that he was not
 Any kind of like nepo baby or anything down like he really had to like fight to stay in the business and try to make
 A go of it. So I do like it and her locker. Come on. That's a cool debut story. Sure. All right
 What is why is he a shipper?
 I get them vibes when I hear him talk. Oh
 Did something no, he's just kind of he's just kind of his
 When I get along with him, I don't give a shit about that
 His stance on some shit, it's a little bit
 But whatever it's all is weary Paul is weary. I'm good for him. Good for him. Do your thing make you make your money
 Poker the other day for the first time in a very long time. Yeah, and I thought I was gonna watch someone get murdered
 Oh, I was at the poker table. I thought one player was gonna murder another player tournament or open table open table
 Okay cash game. Okay, no big deal low stakes cash game one three one three. No limit cash game
 I
 Fell of it that was at the table a couple of seats down from me
 He won a sizable pot from me got a little bit lucky on the last card drew out on the last card
 Nobody I'm not saying anything to him. You know, I'm do the hand ends he wins
 It's a good size hands doing yeah, you're stewing. I'm not even stewing. I'm like, oh that's over. All right. He got it
 He says without me saying anything. He says to me
 Boy, I thought you were gonna draw out on me there
 And I looked I looked back. I was just confused. I looked back. I was like I wait I was ahead though
 I was ahead until the until the last card you got the last card there and you won it
 He goes yeah. Yeah, but I was mathematically ahead already. I was supposed to win that hand already. I just wasn't ahead on the cards yet
 and I and I kind of laughed I kind of I kind of good because he was
 Absolutely being genuine. He was he was saying that with all sincerity. He was like that. I was supposed to win that hand
 I was ahead mathematically which he wasn't by the time he actually made the call
 He was mathematically behind when he made the call doesn't matter doesn't matter. He won the hand. I wasn't mad about it
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so that was that was that he was a touch of a you know a
 Scouche this much of just a bit of a jerk about it. Just uh, just not even not even a jerk
 I was done with it though. I so we continue playing the game
 I don't say anything to him about it after I got it after I figured out what he meant by that
 Didn't matter that he was wrong. I was over it moving on so about half an hour later
 I win a big hand a very big hand off of that guy. Okay
 So I made all the money back and then quite a bit more off of that guy
 Like I say about half an hour later
 Again, this person is not sitting next to me. There is a person between us
 After I win that hand, I don't say anything because I'm not stupid
 When it comes to this I'm not scenario you're in this scenario. I was not stupid at that moment. Yeah, there we go
 so I
 Don't say a word
 The person between us though looks at the guy who just lost the hell and by the way
 I had drawn out I had drawn out on this hand
 So I got a little bit lucky on this hand and the fourth card out
 I got a little bit lucky with that card. Well the more reason to shut up right? You got lucky. That's it. Yeah
 I'm just being quiet. I'm
 Stacking up my chips. I'm moving on to the next hand the guy between us looks at the guy who just lost and goes
 Well, that was payback for earlier, huh?
 And I like my head just snapped up, you know, I'm looking down I'm looking anywhere but at this guy
 My head just snaps up and I just was like I whatever is happening here. I don't want to be a part of this
 That's I would give a I would give a stern stop helping
 Line to the guy over there. No, I wanted to I wanted to so badly
 I didn't want to open my mouth though
 I was afraid that if I drew any attention to myself that it was all just gonna dump on to me
 I've you did a party consider going
 Right and then high-fiving the guy
 Took the words out of my mouth
 You need to shut the fuck up
 Oh shit
 I was done. I couldn't hold it together anymore. I burst out laughing. You need to shut the fuck up would make me laugh really hard
 I was crying at the poker table. I had to get up and walk away. It was awful
 Because that's it like you you have to laugh at that point because
 That's all you could do. It's all you can do
 And if that guy is above the laugh line, he's about to get kicked out of the casino. Anyway, yes. Yes. Yes
 Yeah, so Jake like I I just want to make it clear that I'm not involved in whatever this conversation is over here
 I I think I'm gonna go home. I think I'm just gonna go home in that kind of scenario
 Can you can you just get up and go? Can you just get up and go after after any game after any hand?
 Open can open table you stand up any time. I feel don't you feel I have felt bad in the past
 I haven't played in forever, but I would feel bad after winning a pot and then leaving
 It's called hit and run it. You know, you're not it's bad etiquette
 It's also how you get money, right?
 it's certainly it is certainly allowed within the rules and the people who do it are
 Probably more intelligent than the other people who are still sitting at the table. I just stay there to lose
 But I think the D to see to take a fake phone call pretend to talk about an urgent matter
 Baby now both babies both babies at the same time
 Guys guys, I gotta go. Sorry all the baby lots of babies so many babies so many babies guys. Hey
 Great game and you need to shut the fuck up. Bye
 I
 Think I stayed for about five more minutes because I didn't know how to not leave awkwardly right? I was like I'm this is it
 I'm leaving
 It was so bad it was so bad I was like this you're gonna get yourself shot
 I'm gonna get shot just by by sitting here. I don't want to get shot
 I don't want to be in a fight with some random dude in a casino at 1130 at night
 I've been sitting at a table where someone hit and run and it's not even I feel that like oh they're there
 You know that that lucky motherfucker
 It's more like all the money at the table is gone. Like you look like it's just a bunch of short stacks
 You're like, oh now what are we all playing for $50? Now the game is just kind of over. Yeah. Yeah
 But still, you know, it's it's an open table
 It's all I would have sat and played for a while longer if this guy had not
 Egged on the guy that I had just accidentally roughed up. Yeah. Yeah
 Yeah, the scenario the the amount of scenarios where the table and the other guy was already putting more cash down on the table
 Like he was staying in. Yeah, so he wasn't leaving. He wasn't going anywhere anytime soon
 Like nope. Nope, whatever's happening here. I don't want to be in it
 People going on tilts one of the weirdest things to watch and it's so hard to deal with and yes
 Especially at like a low stakes game. Yeah
 But this this is supposed to not matter, right?
 Like on on pot therapy Whitney's husband Peter. Yeah, he's a professional poker player
 and so we I always anytime I play poker, which is probably I don't know at this point three times a year I
 Go I'll play poker and often times I will end up with a story for Peter from these low stakes games because he's
 He's won three games aren't the games that he's playing but every now and then you run into a
 Professional, you know big quote-unquote professional poker player at a low stakes game
 Well, they all have these training apps now and they're all like these there's
 Game theory stuff. Yeah makes people do dumb things on purpose to mess with other people's math and no one's getting the cards
 And it's gotten super weird watching people do that at a low stakes game where no one is doing the math in the first place
 Yeah, yeah. It's like meta fuck you. Yeah
 It's it's crazy. It's just a weird crazy thing and also like, you know, and I I've been you know
 We've all been victims of bad beats, you know that kind of thing
 It's like it's poker for a reason, you know, like you're like, oh, yeah, I was doing the math and then gambling happened
 Yeah, yeah, that's the kind of like what we're doing
 is
 Tempting fate for bouts of luck and craziness, right? Sometimes the wrong car just comes out or the right card speaking of gambling
 Go ahead. What are your guys takes on the current state of?
 sports and
 Sort of the veneer cracking around. Oh that play was clearly somebody
 Covering a spread or fucking around for no good reason
 Especially the collegiate level. Well, the Raiders got a lot of heat
 Right. Is there gonna be is there gonna be any kind of real?
 No, because what I don't know but my consequence like you can't have a consequence if you don't know that something happened
 There's no way to tell if something happened unless somebody says like I did this
 I will say that I hear Paul and that like when they start loosening up all the sports gambling
 All the scenarios that everyone thought of sure came up in a hurry all the things like what if this happens what that happens?
 It seems of all come to a head really quickly. Oh
 Let me be clear. I don't think I don't think that Paul is wrong on this
 I think that Paul is absolutely correct on this. Oh, what's that? I don't know. I think you're absolutely correct on this
 I'm saying I don't know how to prove it
 I don't know how to I don't know how to like get anyone but like did you see that play?
 Like it was making being viral. I've been really intentionally not watching any football anything
 but there was some college game and
 The kid is running down the field with the ball and just he's got nobody in front of him
 He's almost the goal line. He just walks off the side
 Have you seen it? I?
 Because there's so many college games. So there's so many that's things like college sports specifically, right?
 so like you can watch the NBA and the NFL you have 30 teams going at it, right or 33 to whatever and
 With college you have hundreds and hundreds of this 30 teams just in the Big Ten, right?
 and and
 And in those scenarios, right those those those smaller colleges where they're not making a lot of money, right?
 So like this if I had the opportunity to take two steps to the left and make $20,000. I think I'd do it
 You know, let's all right
 I'm in for 20. I just need a thousand people to join me
 You're not in for 20,000 you're in for $20, but I feel like I just feel like
 You can't trust any sport at this point on a professional level. I don't think you have here's why here's why I think you are
 Not wrong, but mistaken in the in the path that you're going down. Okay, I don't think you have to go to gambling
 I think you can just go to the to the legit money the quote-unquote legit money in it
 And that's all you have like I don't well, yes, and that's gambling side of it
 I'll think you have to go to the dark money to find the crazy shit
 Oh my god, I was laughing so hard in college football. It's it's getting nuts
 Yeah, and Indiana the mean that's going around is like Indiana's been terrible football for 150 years
 You can pay players and suddenly they're good. They're like
 Indiana was the only only college playing by the rules for the last 150 years
 And I was laughing because Indiana won a crazy game against Ohio State and both right players are interviewed
 We're like I want to thank God. I want to thank our Lord God Lord God Lord God
 And I was like buddy you have the highest payroll
 You could thank old Johnny greenbacks
 You want to thank your river of money of boosters
 God which is what I call all of my sugar daddies here at Indiana University. Thank you God
 No, it's gonna college football is gonna get weird
 College football is about to get bizarre because the amount of money that's going into that through like the legit channels
 Yeah, it's it's so much money. It's yeah, it's gonna be great
 Oh, yeah, and then Andy has mentioned the transfer portal that being able to transfer from from team to team much more easily now. Oh
 Yeah, but coach. Oh, yeah
 Like coaches leave teams with like I'm gonna leave this twelve million dollar a year job
 Even though I was I thought I was trying to kind of stay for ten years
 I'm gonna leave because I was gonna pay me even more money like you can't there's no these contracts mean nothing. Yeah
 Even more infinite money than protein right, but there's 32 NFL teams, right?
 Yeah, just 30 I think it's 32
 So like if you're like the 33rd or 34th best quarterback, right?
 you can now make money by staying at a
 University, yeah playing quarterback in college, right? If you just want to stay at Michigan
 So what's gonna happen make more money playing at Michigan than you can backing up at the New England Patriots?
 What's gonna happen would just make sense for me to play six seven or eight years at Michigan. That's what I'm wondering is gonna
 That's what that's where it's gonna get gonna have 35 years playing college ball, right?
 I mean a Chador Sanders is a good example of one. He's playing for the for the Cleveland Browns now
 he
 When when the draft happened, he's a rookie this year when the draft happened the place that he got drafted at
 They said point-blank. They were like he could have made more money if he had just stayed another year in college
 Yeah, but if he had got drafted in the NFL
 Yeah, they just say it there's like, oh, yeah, he he could have made more money if he had stayed it
 He played at the University of Colorado. They either just stayed there and made more money that would have just been it
 Yeah
 Logan copper scale and chat says isn't isn't youth league in high school football following got a favor for safer sports
 Yes
 And a large in the large part. Yes, but for the less glorious positions like linemen and things like that are you're finding?
 It's harder and harder to find these quality people want to sacrifice their bodies for for the thankless positions
 Well again, I can't I can't say it enough like that that
 Aaron Hernandez special segment that last podcast did they did. Yeah three episodes on him. Yeah, and
 both
 Marcus and Ed were like we came up as youth people young men playing football and
 They talked about the horrors of it through high school and all that kind of stuff and it's just it's you know
 It really it was insane. Well, it changed their mind was insane
 they've been they've been football like Ed has been a football fan forever like Miami Dolphins is like part of his
 Identity as a human being and he's now just now after all this
 This this podcast this little podcast run and doing research in it
 He's really just starting to change his mind around the CTE and the dangers of the sport and just the inhumanity of it
 My brother was captain of his football team in the high school
 Mm-hmm, and he tells stories that I'm still afraid to repeat here now
 Like really that went down like that would be a crazy
 Scandal. Yes. Yeah, there are there are things that happened on a regular basis on the on the teams at my high school
 That people would go to jail for now
 Yeah, they would just they would go to jail for like child endangerment and things like and I'm not talking about like
 Terrible things or anything, but just you know, just just the standard things that we would practice like yeah. Yeah
 fights the
 Cursing the hazing all the weird. Yeah
 It was just weird bizarre shit and looking back on it. You're like, well, that's
 16 year old kids
 Doing this shit and like the old ones are 18
 This is this is stupid. This is just dumb
 I'll tell you what else is dumb but not because they're dumb because we're dumb and that's the following sponsor

 Straight from the horse's ass friend of a friend
 Works at the John wick experience
 Okay, broad area 15 area 15 and every 15 and they
 customer brought
 with them a real doll and said can I can I also bring my companion with me and
 brought in a sex doll as
 Oh
 Okay. Okay. Are they married?
 They had a backstory. I don't know the backstory
 Was he carrying the doll or was it in like was it in like a wheelbarrow? What are we talking about here?
 It was our arm arm wrapped around the shoulder arm around the waist scary
 It was like a like a baby monkey. It was wrapped on him like a baby monkey. Yeah, no
 Don't go wrapping your sex doll around you like a baby monkey. That's
 Yeah, stick to the rivers in the streams that you're used to
 Did you carry your kids like baby monkeys? I carried whatever way they wanted. I carried them every which way I could what's what was best
 Was it arms over shoulders or legs over shoulders? That's easier, right?
 Legs over shoulders is easier, right?
 fireman's carry in a pinch
 Okay
 Like if there's a fire. Yeah
 Some kids rest easy on the hip and some don't it's a weird thing
 So one of my kids was very easy to just hold on the hip and one of my kids was could not it was just it was
 Uncomfortable for both of us couldn't stay there didn't like it. So what was the solution?
 Stop stop walking. Stop raising him. Stop loving him. Stop. Sure. Sure. Sure. Yeah
 Clearly we're genetically incompatible
 Put him on ice flow. He knows I mean, I think he's doing great. I don't know
 Happen to Matt's third son, it's our new favorite segment a baby that didn't fit on Matt's hip
 These are the reasons Matt throws away kids. Oh
 I don't want to I don't want to I was gonna argue Mike Nelson, but my doesn't says yes
 Me my real dog loves John wick and we had to go see
 So, okay
 So somebody pulls up with a wheelbarrow with a real doll
 What's this allowed and they said they said as the basis said as long as you pay for two tickets
 We don't you can do whatever you want. And so they made him pay for a second
 But but
 The doll is taking up the space number one and number two
 Doesn't that reinforce his dream?
 Yes more that's that's what I was gonna say. I was like, I bet he I bet he like
 I'm sure he's like, oh second ticket, of course. I'll have to pay
 I'm still assuming he was it a she
 Was a guy with it was a guy with a girl doll. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's what okay
 I mean, I mean, yeah, that's that's what it was being over girl. It was Jimmy slow. Nina Jimmy. So Nina. Oh lord
 She scoop Jesus says the lady will be paying
 I
 Put the money in her hand and like shakes it off on the counter to different debit cards
 Today I treat my man like a prince he carried me like a baby monkey
 Apparently he did speak in her voice for different parts stop it. Yeah
 Stop it. No, I'm so happy
 No, no, no, no, no, no
 Sometimes I think the John wick movies are a little over the top
 But I really like like the the character and his motivation over the death of his dog
 It was just an emotional connection to his wife
 Sorry, my wife's been drinking. I'm so
 My liquor speaking of liquor it's been a minute
 No, take me to the bathroom and rough up this bus bus. I
 Don't try rub it
 You better put your mouth where my money is and by money
 I mean pussy hole and by pussy hole. I mean strange plastic cavern that needs cleaning
 Built-in flashlight, okay, you wish it was a built-in flashlight this
 It's basically Saran wrap. Oh, no
 Crisco at this point
 When the robotic parts of my bus bus went failure town and he just replaced he placed my innards with Saran
 Crisco and Crisco was a poor choice for some
 Oh
 My horrible innards attract flies and you can't tell where the Crisco starts and the old cum stops
 So, you know clean up is not a breeze as it were
 Okay
 I never want to hear the phrase
 calm again, I
 Want that to be the only time in my life. I hear old come where does the Crisco stop any old come start?
 I don't know
 Not okay with that
 Yeah, at one point he drops her. Oh god. Yeah. Oh what happened eyes popped out
 I can't believe what I'm seeing at the John wick experience. I
 Can't believe my eyes and this is where it gets weird up into this point
 Not weird. This is where it gets weird. Yep
 he quickly
 again third hand story
 Pockets the eyes
 Picks him up puts him in the pocket. Oops, okay
 Still carries around the island's doll for the rest of the experience. Oh
 Doesn't go about putting the eyes back in no because
 He knows there's a possibility of a second drop and he's lucky to have fished him out when he did
 Maybe yeah, it's like I bet cuz I bet those things are I bet those are probably some of the more expensive parts of the doll
 also
 He's fucking those eye holes. I
 That thank you. Thank you for saying it before I had
 That doll is getting skull fuck
 Those eyes are not supposed to come out
 What was I supposed to do your honor not fuck those eye holes
 Real eye popping experience
 Experience
 Supernova girl if you'd seen the kind of mascara she was wearing your honor. She was asking for it. Oh
 Has anyone done a ventriloquist act with a real doll?
 Who's that Lorgren Lorgren, that's that's a great idea. I don't know
 Yeah, it is it's it's super it's super
 uncomfortable funny to imagine a whole a whole doll there

 You know, you're never getting that shit out of my cranium
 That's true Paul
 This is a good time to remind people that we have an obelisk scheme if you're looking for
 Person or one person only to turn on to this podcast
 Have to check out the sex talk complaining about abuse and old gum. There you go
 Eleven thousand dollars
 For what I should have asked you how much do you think a real doll costs?
 Number that seems cheap. No
 Pay for your real dolls Paul. I've looked into their pricing and like 20 so he's had like an economy model
 He's basically fucking a you go. I don't know what he that's not just looking at the website here
 I don't know the first one. He's yeah, he's out there fucking you goes
 You want man, especially if you're gonna take her out in public. You better be having a Maserati
 Yeah, it didn't have need heated seats. That's right. Nick. You got you gotta have one
 It's got those built-in warmers because there's nothing worse than 3 a.m
 Sliding it in to some cold roast beef inside that butthole. Oh
 Nothing worse than that Paul. I mean I have a single thing worse than that
 well, what's worse is after you bust and then you you forget and they turn her over and then you end up in the wet spot and
 It's like well, this is all my fault. How much for just raw doll
 Matt I think what you'd be interested in is the torso model
 Just torso that is very much an availability. I don't want any lip. I don't want
 I
 Bob says Leon
 Buying of course they do buying a real doll now is like buying a BlackBerry in 2003 like it's just
 we're about to get fucking crazy with
 You think this is this is a dumb invest or or is this a smart move Matt and a BlackBerry might be a smart
 Cuz don't you want a dumb real doll?
 You don't want this thing fucking spying on you and killing you in your sleep. These things are according to their website
 They already have AI vaginas
 No, Jacob you've misread that it's a one because of all the raw beef that's crammed in there a little a little steak sauce
 Gets get things moving. It's an a one vagina
 We're not on Twitch, right?
 Which oh, yeah, I haven't put pictures of these real dolls. They're fighting up on
 Like I've definitely found some pictures of just the torsos, of course
 Or as they call it on this website the Donnelly I mean
 Jacob you drive a scooter half the time. I don't like the Donnelly Harold and I don't like the Donnelly torso either
 You know, we don't get to name our legacies
 No, it's not the episode title fuck you guys
 Well, you have to have a really active imagination to go just torso like you know, it's not it's not about that it's about
 Think about having to mess around with the legs all the time
 Yeah, no, that's what I say to my wife all the time
 Do it save several steps? What steps does it save?
 It saves moving giant metal poles out of your way for your date, that's what
 Come over here Bob
 What a world but do you think do you think those kids are gonna last I vaginas he said
 I don't know what that means. I I've been looking on their website to see what that means
 They just call it that and then if it's like it's like it's like would you like me to keep trying to slobber it up?
 No, I came I'd like to go to bed now. All right, would you like me to print out different techniques?
 I'd like to possibly do your wiener some other time
 If you want to tell you several jokes about vaginas and magicians since you're a magician the AI
 Vagina, I would like that you put your dick in the AI vagina and Will Smith is in there to fight it
 That's the AI vagina
 You go you go to go down there and it's just like oh hell no
 Keep my AI vagina out of your mouth
 There is a whole help page here
 Vagina yes or no nothing on this website says what that is though Jacob. What the fuck is that?
 Please look up the torso facts
 What are the frequently asked facts? What are the frequently asked questions about the robot or so?
 Matt do you have any?
 I could I could just you know guess
 No, no
 Frequently asked questions section about the torso only doll. Okay. Well, just what are some of the people with no questions?
 Those men know what they want and they don't want to shut up ship it torso, please
 Let's go go
 Torso engage. There's a whole there is a whole section on storage and maintenance though
 Okay, and the first question is the first frequently asked question is how do I style my dolls hair? Oh
 Man, I know I don't
 Could you take it to a salon?
 sure
 Like you know like like it's like I always talk about this with Donnie Marie
 It's like the fact that like you make all these incest jokes about them
 That's not the part that grosses you out is not the sexual tension
 It's when they're actually brother and sisterly that you're like, oh, this is weird
 Yeah, these these older adults being like teasy brother and sister is so weird
 For instance the actual most disturbing part of the real doll website is the storage tips, right?
 That's it. It's it's the X's and O's that are the sex parts like a given
 But now it's the X's and O's. Let me just read this sentence to you and see if you can just
 Contain yourself. Okay for best maintenance of your doll
 It should preferably be stored hanging in a neutral position with legs lightly spread
 from the provided neck bolt
 You hang the leg by the neck bolt with the legs slightly spread so that things can dry out
 Yeah, and make sure you remove the neck bolt when you're using the doll or when it is lying down
 Mm-hmm. Okay, and then it goes on to talk about avoiding creases in the silicone as that can cause creases
 How much for just the neck both?
 Hang your real doll by her neck bolt, please
 And I will see that you really love her
 Hang your real doll
 Neck bolt in the closet for me. Oh my god
 Yeah, it's a it's a
 Careful now Jacob, we're on a rate of ship. We're I know that's why I showed you a picture of clothes

 Alright, I mean it'd be a good way to just
 Change up the conversations when you're going home, right? Oh real a real buddy talking about anything else except you bringing a real doll to Christmas
 Nobody's talking about politics, right? I mean politics is done. It's just a
 Fucking a mannequin. I don't I don't fuck that that goes on my front lawn that goes on my own
 It's holding up a penguin by the tree
 It's in my major it's my Mary this is my Mary from my major

 Fun and putting the positive vibes out there for everyone. Let's all have a Merry Christmas here on Eternia
 Ho ho ho
 It her hey scoops to check out there you go
 That would be a good crossover. Well, I found this stuff about the AI stuff that new masters. Oh, okay
 Great. Share it a second that new masters universe movie is looking like it might be. Okay, Dolph Lundgren. Oh
 No, I don't know if he might have a cameo in there or not. I
 Know, you know Jared Leto is the one kind of flying the ointment, but they're saying he's Skeletor, right?
 Yep, but they're saying it's it's it's it's getting fairly positive buzz so far. All right, we'll see who knows
 Did he quit? I don't think so. All right, that would be the way to go bossy if he quit
 It would be a big positive buzz, but no, I don't think so, but we'll see. All right, so explain to us AI vagina, please
 According to this. Oh
 Boy, I
 Would show you videos of it, but twitch would ban us
 Like the the mouth movements come on which is just science
 Come on
 The the things they move their mouths around but it's it looks like they're kind of
 okay, they don't look sexy when they're moving their mouth around they look like a a crack addict with their
 They're moving their mouth around like they're grinding their teeth
 On the best day, would you trust a fake robot mouth with your dick? Nope, no me neither. No, what the fuck?
 Dollars for a dick a keen like a simplified toy. You asked that question so backwards Paul. Okay, what's the question?
 How ignorant you are? All right, what's the question? Would you like to have safe sex with a meth head? That's the question
 No is the answer no
 I don't think there is safe sex with a man head
 Don't worry the head and mouth both contain safety mechanisms to lock the neck and mouth in place
 When needed for posing or for rough play? Oh
 No, what so don't worry about it ball. It's all taken care of. No, this doesn't know
 I don't want the words rough play and my dick connected in the same sentence
 This is this is some pen talking about permanent damage
 Acceptable. Yeah
 Shit. No, thank you
 Permanent damage. Okay, that was the phrase right?
 Jesus Christ. I
 Permanent damage. Okay, how much do these things weigh? This doesn't look like it's a lightweight thing
 I'm just imagining carrying this through the John wick experience
 Yeah, that's that's your that's your
 Your gym time, I guess that maybe makes up for it a little bit that you don't have to go to the gym that day
 I guess like I can't find just a I just want to wait of what all these things are and they can't be nothing
 That's really terrifying all of its terrifying. Yeah
 Oh the AI vagina looks like it's basically just a flesh light with a little motor type thing in there
 So it can it can move around a little bit and the reason they call them AI is because you can like
 Plug it into some software that will
 quote-unquote sync up with something you're watching on TV or
 Okay, right like stuff like that
 Like it'll it'll do that or or it can be remotely controlled by some operator somewhere
 So you don't have say on to how it's jerking your we've got a patreon level for that
 I mean absolutely and I think it's like we keep waiting for the moment
 We're gonna declare that AI has gained its own consciousness and I think it'd be funny if it starts with the robot vaginas first
 Well, I mean I see that would not be good for us bossy is dead on here, you know
 Porn is always the forward part in tech. He's looking forward to the torn dick horror stories
 I'm with you. No, but it's absolutely right you you from the days of the printing press you want to know where technology is going
 What technology allows the dissemination of porn most easily and cheaply that is where tech is going
 That was what won the VHS
 Beta war it's a lot of things. Yeah, if if
 That's a weird thing with streaming racing to the first a AI sex pot the cheapest one is that we're gonna figure out
 Yeah
 Seems a good way to become billionaires guys
 Excuse me after I have to leave right now, you know what they say build a better cock trap and the world will beat off to
 your door
 They do say that
 That's a Franklin bon mot right there
 Well, that's one piece of information that Paul has but he probably doesn't have any others so he's gonna lose a jock versus nerd, okay
 Of real dolls and AI

 You couldn't tell where the Crisco started.
 Yeah. Thanks everybody for listening. Stacey, I'm out there. We love you and we'll see you soon.
 I was afraid doing a double today would make a weird one for the second one, but I think we don't wait for that one to kick.
 It's easy. It's always easy to come up with good stuff.
 We double it up on Friday too. We are.
 Let's dance it with the devil. Ride the devil.
 Preaching Fund.

 That's a fucking ticket there.
