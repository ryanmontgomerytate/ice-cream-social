1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
 Oh, hello there.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,320
 I didn't see you there, but I am so glad you are here.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,680
 It's time to thank you, the ice cream truck drivers.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,440
 Who are the ice cream truck drivers?

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,360
 Well, these are the folks that deliver that fucking ice cream straight to your fucking ear holes.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:28,700
 Right now, I'd like to thank David Walker, Dead Laszlo, Dirty Old Scoop, Galactic President Scooper Star McScoopsalot, Ice Blue Scoop, Jacob Dinklaker, Jeff Harris, Jobeth Bowers, and John Mattingly.

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,440
 If you want to be an ice cream truck driver, and I sure hope you do, PreachingFun.com is where you can go.

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,600
 PreachingFun.com.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,580
 Head over there, sign up to be an ice cream truck driver, and who knows?

10
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,120
 The life you save may be your own.

11
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,640
 And now, a show.

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,680
 Hey, Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social?

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,320
 Yeah, I'd love to.

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,000
 Great, let's go.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,260
 Oh, man, it's so exciting.

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,500
 We have the stars of Showgirls, the unauthorized musical here.

17
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,040
 Yes.

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,300
 With us, talking about all kinds of showgirls.

19
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,040
 It's pretty exciting.

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,720
 I made an appearance right here.

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,620
 It's time for Matt and Mattingly's Ice Cream Social.

22
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,760
 Sitting over there in Las Vegas, that's Matt Donnelly.

23
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,780
 Sitting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that's Paul Mattingly.

24
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,020
 And in Las Vegas, it's me, Jacob, the audio guy.

25
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,920
 We're PreachingFun.

26
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,200
 I forgot Pittsburgh for a half second there.

27
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,140
 It's easy to do.

28
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,820
 Somewhere in Pennsylvania.

29
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,340
 Philadelphia?

30
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,440
 No, that's not right.

31
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,740
 No, we're still covered in snow.

32
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,500
 It's so cold here.

33
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,200
 It's disgusting.

34
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,220
 It's in the single digits, and it's going to be that way for a long time.

35
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,320
 It's disgusting.

36
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,840
 We're going to get hit with a lot of snow later this week.

37
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,360
 It's going to be awful, but yeah.

38
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,020
 I walked outside with no shoes on today and just took the dogs outside,

39
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,760
 went and fed the fish and thought, boy, this sure is a nice January day.

40
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,940
 Man, it's getting crazy everywhere.

41
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,960
 Mike.

42
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,120
 Fighting with my kid to take a sweatshirt with him every day.

43
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,880
 He's like, I don't need one.

44
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,200
 I was like, you might.

45
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,460
 It might suddenly become January for real.

46
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,380
 You don't know.

47
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,100
 If you're out after it gets dark, you'll need one.

48
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,360
 I leave the house every day.

49
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,560
 If I have a backpack with me or something, I have a sweatshirt inside the backpack

50
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,680
 because I know once it gets dark, I'll need it.

51
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:25,860
 Jacob and Paul, what was your opinion of Showgirls the movie when it came out,

52
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,760
 and what is it now?

53
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,340
 I love it unapologetically.

54
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:35,760
 We have a friend, SJ, and I have a friend who was in the Showgirls movie.

55
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,440
 She was one of the dancers in the Showgirls movie.

56
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,700
 So we've had multiple movie watching parties with her over the years with

57
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,000
 different friends, and she would talk about some of her experience putting

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,080
 Showgirls the movie together and all that kind of stuff.

59
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,960
 And boy, I was the right age for Saved by the Bell, so Elizabeth Berkley coming

60
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,200
 in to doing an NC-17 movie.

61
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,600
 When I was in junior high, maybe a freshman in high school, was a big fucking deal.

62
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:11,200
 Let me explain that to you very clearly.

63
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,200
 It was big.

64
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:18,460
 It really was like took Tiffany Amber Thiessen's Maxim photo shoot and put it on blast.

65
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,760
 Yeah, it did.

66
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,560
 If you think that's enough, it is not.

67
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,020
 Hold my beer, Maxim photo shoot.

68
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,020
 I, uh...

69
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,680
 It took me a little while to get into that flick.

70
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,560
 I didn't watch it during its original theatrical run.

71
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,060
 I believe I owned it on DVD at some point.

72
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,300
 Maybe.

73
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,440
 I'm not sure.

74
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,700
 But I have seen it a couple times.

75
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,940
 It's hilarious to me.

76
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:49,500
 And I am Facebook friends with Patrick Bristow, who is the catty choreographer

77
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,640
 from the show.

78
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,720
 Great.

79
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,180
 He is actually good friends with my pal, Sarah McKenzie.

80
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,280
 And Patrick Chesney, who has worked with Henson in the past.

81
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,120
 She's a puppeteer.

82
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,940
 And Patrick has gone on.

83
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:12,720
 He is the host of Puppet Up for most of the time that that show has done, which is the

84
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,180
 improvised Muppets thing.

85
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,160
 Yeah, the Henson improv puppet show.

86
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,780
 I think I know where this is going, Paul.

87
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,900
 And no, we're not making an all-puppet version of Showgirls.

88
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,740
 We're not doing it.

89
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,560
 We're not going to do it.

90
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,320
 Not yet.

91
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,300
 Not yet.

92
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,780
 And also, Matt.

93
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,300
 It's not an all-puppet version.

94
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,860
 It's an all-puppet version except for one human character.

95
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,820
 That's how it goes.

96
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,820
 That's how these movies are produced.

97
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,920
 That's right.

98
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,380
 That's right.

99
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,600
 Who would the one human character in Showgirls be, Paul?

100
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,300
 Oh, it had to be Kyle MacLachlan coming back to reprise his role at this age.

101
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:50,180
 He's the only one with the gravitas to pull it off.

102
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,740
 And with a straight face.

103
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,000
 He could do it with a straight face.

104
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,100
 You're right.

105
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,760
 I know.

106
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,420
 I know.

107
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,200
 I haven't not.

108
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,840
 I haven't not.

109
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,700
 I haven't thought about this.

110
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:04,120
 So, but yeah, I'm desperate that maybe one day I'll get involved with Puppet Up a little

111
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,480
 more, too, because I've got a lot of satellite pals within that orbit.

112
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,560
 Paul, the question wasn't about you and puppets at all, as a matter of fact.

113
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,980
 It was, what did you think about the movie?

114
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:21,160
 But what I'm saying is, what I'm saying is, Showgirls has always been rife for parody

115
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,940
 and puppetry.

116
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:32,060
 Well, I believe you do get both in this unauthorized parody.

117
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,960
 I'm going to see it tomorrow night.

118
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,100
 It's a press opening, so I'm going to see it tomorrow night.

119
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,380
 Oh, nice.

120
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:36,940
 I'm very excited.

121
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,100
 I have tickets to see it, I think, on March 1st.

122
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,440
 Okay.

123
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,460
 Very cool.

124
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,780
 Yeah, a group of us are going to go on March 1st and go see it.

125
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:52,020
 Elaine, when this first came on your radar, what made you decide to hop in and give it

126
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,400
 a go to be in the Showgirls parody musical?

127
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:03,240
 I've always been a huge fan, and particularly a huge fan of Nomi Malone, which is the character

128
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,780
 I'm playing.

129
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,100
 I mean, she's just a savage.

130
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:13,800
 Like, when else, as a woman, do you get to, you know, basically, like, tactically stab

131
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,520
 people, push them down the stairs, play all of the emotions, but you're just a girl with

132
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,120
 a dream, and you just have to do, you know, she's just dealing with the obstacles in front

133
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,500
 of her.

134
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,500
 I'm putting them on one by one.

135
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,000
 Go ahead.

136
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,140
 And, yeah, so I've always loved her, and it's a joy to play her.

137
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,300
 A Rosie the Riveter type, if you will.

138
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,760
 A pioneer.

139
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,400
 Sure.

140
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:50,260
 The feminist icon, writer, and director, Joe Esterhaus, named Nomi Malone, because it would

141
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:56,340
 be, basically, also mean, Nomi, I am alone, and he wanted that to be.

142
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:56,360
 I am alone.

143
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,360
 I am alone.

144
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,380
 I am alone.

145
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,220
 very significant

146
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,300
 about that character.

147
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,480
 I want to see a list of

148
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,480
 the top ten things that he wanted to be

149
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,200
 significant in Showgirls.

150
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,300
 Oh my god, me too.

151
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,040
 It's quite, yeah, like the license plate.

152
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,600
 He made all the choices

153
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,760
 thinking he was making a very significant

154
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,540
 movie. Good, good.

155
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,240
 That's what I want.

156
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,840
 Well, and he was.

157
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,300
 Yeah, and he was right.

158
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,820
 And touchdown, success.

159
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,100
 Yeah. Remind

160
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,020
 people who Naomi is.

161
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,780
 It's Nomi, actually.

162
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,720
 Nomi, excuse me.

163
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,940
 Start there, start there.

164
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,560
 I will see

165
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,400
 myself out.

166
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,340
 She's the main, you know,

167
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,580
 main character, one of the main characters

168
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,040
 in Showgirls, and

169
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,360
 we catch up with her kind of

170
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,320
 hitchhiking to Las Vegas.

171
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,420
 She decides she's

172
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,100
 going to go to Vegas and dance.

173
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,320
 We don't know that much

174
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,740
 about her past at the beginning.

175
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,500
 You know, that kind of is

176
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,280
 revealed later on, but

177
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,540
 she's a dancer, she's

178
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,560
 ambitious, and she

179
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,660
 sees one of the big

180
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,680
 production shows in Las Vegas starring

181
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,660
 Crystal Connors, my co-star

182
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,620
 here, Katie, and

183
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,540
 she's kind of like,

184
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,260
 I could do that.

185
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,860
 And from there

186
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,820
 ensues like the path

187
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,740
 of ascension,

188
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,860
 you know, taking out obstacles

189
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,540
 as they come, whether

190
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,080
 that be her fellow

191
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,160
 Showgirls or like Kyle

192
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,200
 McLaughlin, like who's the

193
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,560
 entertainment director, wooing him,

194
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,420
 just kind of,

195
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,160
 you know, all the steps that

196
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,240
 I'm sure real Showgirls

197
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,740
 go through to make it to the top.

198
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,940
 Well, that's what I was going to ask you. I wanted

199
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,940
 to hear about the parallels

200
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,280
 between Nomi and

201
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,360
 your own showbiz career, of course.

202
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,860
 Right.

203
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,160
 What are the

204
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,260
 positives and

205
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:55,740
 negatives?

206
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,000
 Well, you know, if

207
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,900
 a man's trying to sexually harass you,

208
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,120
 sexually harass you, you've got to pull a knife on

209
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,940
 him, obviously.

210
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,840
 Especially, you know, post-2016,

211
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,200
 they really, you know, that is encouraged.

212
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,320
 That's option one. Go right to that.

213
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,240
 You know,

214
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,700
 if

215
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,160
 someone's in your way, you've got to push

216
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,180
 them down the stairs, either literally

217
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,140
 or figuratively, but I

218
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,980
 do like the literal approach

219
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,600
 personally. It is.

220
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,640
 It works. It works.

221
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,300
 Yeah.

222
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,100
 Yeah. It does. And you just have to, you know,

223
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,440
 try and make sure you don't get caught.

224
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,240
 Because

225
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,300
 that's the key to it all, you know.

226
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,080
 We actually did have a guest on the show.

227
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,720
 It was

228
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,100
 a peep show.

229
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,980
 And they

230
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,280
 did have shenanigans.

231
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,540
 Do you remember someone put pins

232
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,960
 in her boots?

233
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,880
 Someone was trying to sabotage her

234
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,900
 and put thumbtacks

235
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,920
 in her boots.

236
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,720
 Oh, I do vaguely remember this.

237
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,940
 That sounds familiar. There was so much

238
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,160
 shit that went on with that show.

239
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,040
 Tara. Yeah. Someone tried to put pins

240
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,700
 in Tara Palsha's boots.

241
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,440
 That makes sense.

242
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,780
 To be fair, I did apologize.

243
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,960
 Well, you know, this was

244
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,120
 the path, the career path

245
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,860
 chosen by Elvira, Mistress

246
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,920
 of the Dark. She came up as a

247
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,920
 Vegas showgirl. That was

248
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,020
 how she cut her teeth. And then, speaking

249
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,880
 of cutting their teeth, Matt, you might want to

250
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,700
 close your ears for this. I've mentioned this before,

251
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,040
 but it's been a minute. So, you remember

252
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,380
 the

253
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,740
 Jenna Jameson,

254
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,680
 the porn star.

255
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,280
 Who? That name's familiar.

256
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,360
 Sorry, I was trying to... She also

257
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,420
 went through a

258
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,340
 dancer slash

259
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,240
 showgirl moment

260
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,920
 at a very early age. And at

261
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,900
 a certain point, she went

262
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,760
 so far. In her ambition,

263
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,120
 she had braces

264
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,460
 on at the time, and it would

265
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,920
 belie her young age.

266
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,040
 She had her brother take

267
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,860
 pliers to her head and pull

268
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,920
 the braces off.

269
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,820
 Yes. Oh my gosh. In order to

270
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,260
 pass as older.

271
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,600
 Yeah. So,

272
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,940
 if you've ever read her biography,

273
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,020
 that's a hell of a showgirl

274
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,520
 biography, too. That's pretty wild.

275
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,800
 I'm going to do that. My son has braces right now.

276
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,520
 I'll make sure to remove them myself with pliers.

277
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,560
 All right. You don't own

278
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,320
 pliers. Daddy needs smokes.

279
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,440
 Jacob,

280
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,720
 take my son's braces off his face.

281
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,420
 Jacob, come over and bring some pliers.

282
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,660
 There's got to be some silver in these things.

283
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,840
 Melt them down.

284
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,900
 Now, Katie,

285
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,940
 every time I watch this movie...

286
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,640
 Oh, sorry. I'm just going to jump right into the next question.

287
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,840
 We both are doing the same thing. We both are transitioning to Katie.

288
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,760
 Go ahead, Jacob. The floor is yours.

289
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,640
 Katie, every time

290
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,640
 I watch showgirls, I...

291
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,520
 I am struck by

292
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,980
 the 90s

293
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,480
 Vegas and

294
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,920
 all of the kind of entertainment landscape

295
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,400
 that was 90s Vegas.

296
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,180
 I moved here in

297
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,420
 2007.

298
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,900
 And you and I have been old... We're old friends.

299
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,900
 We've known each other for a couple

300
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,840
 of years, for a year or two.

301
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,820
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

302
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,860
 This is my training from SJ. I just say I've known people

303
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,240
 for a year or two.

304
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,220
 That's smart.

305
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,180
 Yeah, so we've known

306
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:24,880
 each other for a year or two.

307
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,600
 How much does

308
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,260
 that kind of old Vegas and old

309
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,160
 showbiz casting

310
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,780
 in Vegas and kind of that old

311
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,560
 showbiz energy in Vegas...

312
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,700
 How does that make you feel?

313
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,920
 Compare that a little bit to

314
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,860
 your old days in Vegas, if you would.

315
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,900
 Oh, well, I mean...

316
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,900
 I remember...

317
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,100
 So when I moved here in 2008,

318
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,780
 the Riviera, which is very

319
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,760
 prominent in the backdrop of

320
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,940
 that movie, was still up.

321
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,840
 Some of those old

322
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,220
 neons that you see in the movie

323
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,540
 were still here.

324
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,780
 And so, yeah, it just... When I watch

325
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,700
 it now, parts

326
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,740
 of it feel still very

327
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,800
 like today Vegas, but

328
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,740
 most of it feels really,

329
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,320
 really old and

330
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,440
 not dated, but like, oh,

331
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,780
 that was so beautiful. Why did we

332
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,240
 get rid of that?

333
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,860
 Yeah.

334
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,840
 Yeah, Vegas has gone

335
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,940
 so mainstream now that you see old portraits

336
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,760
 of when it was still like this cool kind of like

337
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,560
 escape place and you're like,

338
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,320
 oh, man, badass, right?

339
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,680
 Yeah.

340
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,560
 Kids from Iowa hitchhiking

341
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,580
 on the side of the road.

342
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,320
 Different places.

343
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,200
 Did you always love this movie, Katie?

344
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,660
 Did you always have a love affair with this movie?

345
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,640
 No, I didn't really see...

346
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,260
 It's weird the way I saw it.

347
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,900
 Upside down.

348
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,260
 When I grew up, both of my parents...

349
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,280
 Yeah, right. My parents were ministers,

350
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,320
 so I definitely didn't see

351
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,480
 showgirls.

352
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,620
 Until I was moving

353
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,700
 out here, like literally the night before

354
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,440
 I moved out here to be in Jubilee,

355
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,740
 I watched two movies. I'm not even making

356
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,400
 this up. I watched showgirls

357
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,540
 and I watched Alive

358
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,740
 because it was on TV when I was about to get on a

359
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,600
 plane. And I don't know

360
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,080
 what's wrong with me.

361
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,640
 If you had given me a million

362
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,680
 guesses for the second movie, I would have not

363
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,640
 gotten to Alive.

364
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,660
 Were you simply trying to scare yourself out of making

365
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,400
 this life move? Were you trying to like,

366
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,020
 don't do it?

367
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,620
 I...

368
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,120
 Yeah, I don't know. But you know, the weird thing

369
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,460
 is that showgirls didn't make me afraid to come

370
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,800
 out here and be in a big showgirl show. It actually

371
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,600
 like made me even more excited.

372
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,060
 Oh, really?

373
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,560
 Because it was so... That movie's so pretty. The

374
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,920
 costumes and the makeup. Oh, my God.

375
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,360
 Yeah.

376
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,280
 Will you give people a little inside behind the

377
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,700
 curtain look? The audition process. We see a little

378
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,580
 bit of like the big lineup audition for the big

379
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,240
 Vegas showgirl show in Showgirls. Will you talk a

380
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,480
 little bit about those big kind of...

381
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,820
 Lineup auditions where, you know, a hundred people,

382
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,760
 200 people, 300 people would show up and they just

383
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,120
 have to basically go through them factory style?

384
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,220
 Yeah. Well, the first thing that Jubilee would do,

385
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,260
 which I totally appreciated, was they held like a

386
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,280
 stick up. And before you even stepped on the stage,

387
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,400
 if your head did not pass that stick, it was, thank

388
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,900
 you so much. Goodbye. Because you're not tall

389
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,000
 enough to be in the show then.

390
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,940
 SJ is familiar with the stick.

391
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:22,560
 Oh, no. Oh, I'm sorry.

392
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,260
 And you're like, I know, but I still want to get my

393
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,300
 tits out today. And now I can't even do that.

394
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,420
 Oh, she would show up with like tall hair and

395
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,900
 everything. And they just, they'd smush it right down

396
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,540
 with the stick. It would be so hurt.

397
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,680
 Oh, that's a bummer.

398
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,920
 That stick was the director. That's the weird part.

399
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,900
 That stick was named Fluff.

400
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,580
 Right.

401
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,640
 That was Fluff the stick.

402
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,540
 Yeah. And then the next thing they would do is you

403
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,580
 had to do PK turns across the stage because you can tell

404
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,780
 in one PK turn, if that person has had any dance

405
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,520
 training at all.

406
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,260
 Oh, fascinating.

407
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,660
 Yeah. So then they would make a cut from there and

408
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,620
 then you'd start learning combos and stuff.

409
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:07,400
 And so before the combos, what, what percentage of

410
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,900
 people are cut before the combos?

411
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,040
 Oh, 50.

412
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,800
 Wow.

413
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,100
 Yeah. Yeah. Cause a lot of girls would show up just

414
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,320
 like, well, I'm pretty, well, I dance at this strip

415
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,220
 club. I could be in this show kind of know me

416
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,120
 style actually.

417
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,720
 Yeah.

418
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,200
 You know,

419
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,000
 that's what I tell myself.

420
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,080
 Where do you think they got the idea?

421
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,000
 I leave the house.

422
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,520
 I tell myself I'm pretty.

423
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,120
 And then I, I, I go about my day with a lot

424
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,760
 of confidence.

425
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,020
 I'm pretty enough to do this.

426
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:41,180
 Uh, and in this show you play, uh, uh, the, the

427
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,580
 villain, uh, Gina Gershon's part.

428
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,900
 Um, was that something you were looking forward to

429
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,080
 playing and something you wanted to play?

430
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:52,140
 I had played know me the last time we did this

431
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,040
 show, which was like, Oh my God.

432
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,320
 Almost a decade ago.

433
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,780
 Okay.

434
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,600
 And when Troy said he was doing it again, I said,

435
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,360
 cool, I'll be one of the dancers.

436
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,340
 I don't want to be, know me.

437
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,480
 Um, cause that part's really hard.

438
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,740
 I don't leave the stage.

439
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,800
 It's exhausting.

440
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:11,260
 And then they just pointed to her head, like

441
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,860
 mental, no, sorry, sorry.

442
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,840
 This is up there with pins saying, don't write

443
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,340
 yourself running in scenes.

444
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,420
 Very smart.

445
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:19,980
 Yup.

446
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,980
 Uh, and so then, uh, when I.

447
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,400
 When it was getting closer to auditions, I kind

448
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,520
 of said to him, you know, I feel like if no one

449
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,220
 shows up for crystal that you're interested in, I

450
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,840
 feel like I could play crystal.

451
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,620
 I've been a show girl now for 17 years and I'm

452
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,940
 tired and I'm jaded, you know, I get this woman

453
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,420
 between the last iteration and this one, you felt

454
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,160
 like you have earned the role.

455
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,160
 Uh, 100, 100%.

456
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,860
 Yup.

457
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,500
 I want the role that I identify the most with, and

458
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:52,960
 that is.

459
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,440
 This person over here, go fuck yourself.

460
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,820
 And now, uh, you and Elaine, uh, uh, have been

461
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,580
 friends for a long time.

462
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,480
 You guys have been accused of being twins.

463
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,480
 Uh, uh, you've done a lot of gigs together.

464
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,580
 Uh, was not knowing if you guys didn't realize the

465
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,820
 audition that you'd be working with each other in

466
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,140
 the two lead roles, right?

467
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:19,940
 Well, it, so Elaine had kind of talked to me

468
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,920
 about maybe auditioning for show girls, uh, before the

469
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,580
 audition popped up and then she just wasn't at

470
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:36,640
 auditions and fucking boss boss way to get one more.

471
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,540
 And then like when they were looking for a Nomi, I

472
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,680
 was like, look, there is one girl I know of in

473
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,680
 this city that is beautiful.

474
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,400
 That is great to work with.

475
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,680
 And that is absolutely not afraid to be crazy ugly.

476
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,980
 That's the requirement.

477
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,180
 Yeah, absolutely.

478
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:01,700
 Uh, and that girl was busy.

479
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,920
 She was, she was too busy making some kind of giant

480
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,680
 Hormel, uh, chili dip on her.

481
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,060
 Yeah.

482
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:16,940
 Elaine, as you have this entire other life as a, uh, uh, is it,

483
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,500
 would you say bizarre cooking influencer?

484
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,900
 How do you, how do you phrase your, your, okay.

485
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,460
 So I, I say like.

486
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,620
 Content creator or like internet chef, but, um, yeah, I kind

487
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,500
 of have an alter ego that's, uh, especially on my Instagram,

488
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:38,680
 like a Midwestern housewife who is well-meaning and just trying

489
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:44,320
 to make, you know, semi homemade, like Sandra Lee in the largest

490
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,520
 quantities possible.

491
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:52,800
 Most of the gigantic grill that you always just pile tons of stuff on.

492
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,800
 Yeah.

493
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,860
 To create these amazing ornate, uh, delicious looking, but crazy huge meals.

494
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:04,680
 Well, thank you for the delicious looking that's, um, such a, quite a compliment.

495
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,680
 Yeah.

496
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,360
 Uh, this summer, like I really, I just had this idea.

497
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,280
 I really wanted to do Blackstone stuff.

498
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,180
 So we got one of those big Blackstones.

499
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:20,520
 I think ours is like three feet and anything that you could cook on a Blackstone or could

500
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,680
 not cook on a Blackstone.

501
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,680
 I tried it.

502
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,360
 So what's your, what's your favorite, what's your least favorite?

503
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:35,120
 Um, well, one of my favorites was, you know, I saw this recipe for twice baked apple and

504
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,920
 cherry pie.

505
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:43,760
 And so I went to Costco and bought three large versions of those and I, um, turned flipped

506
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:51,080
 them face down on the Blackstone one after another, you know, jizzle drizzled them with

507
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,560
 some sweetened condensed milk.

508
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
 Added some other ingredients.

509
00:20:53,560 --> 00:21:02,560
 Just, you know, you need a, if you need like a big pie to feed a group of like 60 to a hundred,

510
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,680
 like I definitely recommend doing it this way.

511
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,680
 All right.

512
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,300
 So it was like, I became friends with Elaine through just like mutual friends in town.

513
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,140
 And so I became friends on a regular Instagram account.

514
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,840
 And then someone's like, well, obviously she's busy being an influencer.

515
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,860
 And I was like, wait, what?

516
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,560
 And I was just only friends with your personal, your personal account.

517
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,560
 Wow.

518
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,560
 I was like, whatever.

519
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:30,180
 And then I went over to your, your big page and you're making a, like a punch for like,

520
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,880
 if you're having a backyard, you know, get together, make a punch.

521
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,560
 And then I was like, and I was, I was, I was like duped.

522
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,320
 You're like, show like a little thing of fruit punch and all of a sudden there's like a kiddie

523
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:45,160
 pool and the kiddie pool is being filled, just filled with, with booze and liquids and

524
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,000
 all kinds of chopped fruit and all kinds of stuff.

525
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,560
 And I was like, what's happening?

526
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,560
 And then I looked at your page.

527
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,560
 I was like, it's all this.

528
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,560
 It's all this crap.

529
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,560
 It's all this crazy stuff.

530
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,560
 Yeah.

531
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,560
 Yeah.

532
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,560
 Yeah.

533
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,560
 You know, like lots of, uh, themed party foods.

534
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,560
 I love it.

535
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,560
 Sometimes it's in a fish tank.

536
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,560
 Sometimes it's in a kiddie pool.

537
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,560
 You gotta make the people happy.

538
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,560
 Give them what they want.

539
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,560
 You do.

540
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,560
 Uh, you do.

541
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,560
 You did one, like a pumpkin pie one near the holidays with on that big grill, like a pumpkin

542
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,560
 thing.

543
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,560
 And I was like, I like this.

544
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,560
 I like weird videos.

545
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,560
 Cause you go like, yes.

546
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,560
 And then all of a sudden something happens.

547
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,560
 You go, no.

548
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,560
 And then something else happens.

549
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,560
 You go, yes.

550
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,560
 And then you're like, oh my gosh.

551
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,560

 Oh my gosh.

563
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,560
 Oh my gosh.

564
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,560
 Oh my gosh.

565
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,560
 Oh my gosh.

566

 Oh my gosh.

571
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,560
 Oh my gosh.

 Oh my gosh.

574
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,560
 Oh my gosh.

575
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,560
 Oh my gosh.

576
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,560
 Oh my gosh.

577
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,560
 Oh my gosh.

 Oh my gosh.

579
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,560
 Oh my gosh.

580
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,560
 Oh my gosh.

581
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,560
 Oh my gosh.

582
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,560
 Yeah.

583
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,560
 Yeah.

584
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,560
 Yeah.

585
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,800
 when you get the call from katie was it oops i forgot or was it like were you on the fence about

586
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:58,360
 committing the time like what happened there no you know what i was on the fence about getting

587
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:07,840
 my boobs out ah ah sure yeah um i mean i wasn't on the i guess like i'm i haven't been in a show

588
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:14,600
 like jubilee i haven't ever been i don't even do burlesque or anything like that so um you know

589
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:22,660
 it was a it was a not sure slash deal breaker for me with um with that and so i had talked to her

590
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:29,680
 about it but then um yeah when they didn't have a know me well i was like okay this is my uh dream

591
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:37,800
 role and um i figured maybe there was a little more wiggle room for negotiation with that you

592
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:43,280
 know holly berry negotiated like five hundred thousand dollars a tit in that one uh movie she

593
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,560
 did monster i think

594
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:44,580
 monster i think

595
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:50,320
 monster's ball that's it wow well my rate is similar

596
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:58,120
 there's also a five in it no it wasn't monster's ball monster's ball yeah it was artsy there's a

597
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:02,240
 movie where she basically like like someone goes like hello and she just puts the thing like it

598
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,280
 was like a big action movie oh yeah that's right puts a something down she's just topless on a

599
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,500
 chair for like a split second and apparently it was like a million dollars just to do that scene

600
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,560
 uh otherwise yeah

601
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,480
 yeah yeah uh and then she did monster's ball just because i think just because she wanted

602
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,040
 to hook up with billy bob thornton i think there was nothing else to it oh i get it

603
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:31,760
 i mean he's dreaming now uh katie you're also very shy about nudity is that right

604
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:39,180
 i was gonna say elaine you probably talked to the

605
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:44,000
 one worst person to talk to if you're nervous about nudity on stage that's true

606
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:53,320
 swordfish by the way swordfish swordfish that's it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah uh i bet it was much

607
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:59,000
 more negotiable i bet katie was probably the hardest person to negotiate with well yeah she

608
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:07,400
 she was pro well katie katie takes the term wiggle room personally she's like no no if there

609
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:13,800
 is room to wiggle we shall wiggle the funny thing is when

610
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:22,760
 oh sorry go ahead elaine no you when when they figured out how to do the topless

611
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:29,200
 not but not topless i was the only one like so i can't get my tits out now because no one else is

612
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:37,240
 all right so you hit your own deal breaker katie you were then yeah yeah yeah well i was gonna say

613
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:43,040
 in the parking lot post like coming in and reading with everyone i was like she only she like had me

614
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,780
 very close to her and i was like oh my god i'm so sorry i'm so sorry i'm so sorry i'm so sorry i'm so

615
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:51,140
 convinced i was like well maybe like jacob by march 1st who knows buddy who knows pal that's

616
00:25:51,140 --> 00:26:00,400
 right that's right we'll see you've been doing uh previews um how's it been going

617
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:09,580
 good really good we've had great audiences um you know some areas get like way bigger laughs

618
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,760
 than you expected and then other areas you're like okay like this needs to be tweaked a little

619
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,920
 because it's not getting a reaction so they've been they've been helpful and they've been

620
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:23,680
 supportive and good yeah i think parodies are hard that way parodies are on the broad strokes of

621
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:29,560
 course it's like it's it's it's very much a layup to obviously celebrate showgirls uh musically and

622
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:35,760
 everything is super fun um but yeah parodies get really tricky because it's hard to figure out what

623
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:43,520
 fits in the box like theatrically like and but you are you're poking at the fourth wall the whole time

624
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,260
 you're dealing with an audience that has a knowledge base of the material paul and i did

625
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:52,560
 50 shades the parody together so that's why um you know we're talking about that is that it was

626
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,360
 always strange to figure out like what your relationship with the audience is with the

627
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:02,600
 material um well and also it's a similar vibe with 50 shades the parody because we always joked it's

628
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,960
 not really 50 shades the parody it's just 50 shades and look how ridiculous this is and i

629
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,700
 think there's probably a not a similar effect all the craziness came from the source material yeah

630
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,720
 right not not to

631
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,180
 similar effect probably coming from showgirls because there are moments that it's just

632
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:24,320
 beyond it is beyond parody some of that film yeah right i mean like direct from the script

633
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:31,660
 you know what's al's line word for word it's like it must be strange not having anybody come on you

634
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:37,940
 yes this is what i'm talking about yeah yes exactly

635
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:43,700
 exactly and paul you relate to that line a lot yeah i was

636
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:49,400
 i thought i mean talking about source material yeah i mean exactly

637
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:57,760
 yeah um playing uh gina gershon's part katie are uh are was is it as fun as you thought it would be

638
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,660
 more fun is it crazy is it hard what what what was it like taking on this role 10 years after

639
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:11,300
 not playing it um there there are parts of it that feel very very natural uh i will say like

640
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,680
 some of the things that i have to say about it are the things that i have to say about it are the

641
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:23,160
 say to know me elaine are are difficult for me because elaine is so so goddamn funny um it it is

642
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:29,960
 difficult at times uh well just not to laugh out loud on stage like my very first scene with her

643
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:35,700
 i say something and then she screams in my face and she runs over to a wall and slams herself

644
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:43,260
 into the wall and it's just like i it's that that's probably the hardest part of being crystal

645
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:49,980
 everything else is natural is it was it a total head trip because you basically went from maria

646
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:58,580
 to baroness von schrapp you know so what what's that shift like uh what's mentally do you find

647
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:05,760
 yourself are you ever at times in opposition to the character you're playing in a way uh what's

648
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:13,000
 what's the game there no never because as i've gotten older in the the tidy space that is the

649
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:19,420
 classic showgirl world i see all these young green girls coming in thinking they know everything

650
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:25,840
 and so i have slowly just grown into crystal i think i think that's just what happens right like

651
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,980
 you just grow up in the entertainment industry and you go like yeah that's just that's just what

652
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:36,020
 people are now i don't know what you want yeah yep yeah so you've made us into this no i was

653
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:41,800
 actually that's exactly that's exactly how i feel this city and and show business in this city made

654
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,620
 me into this

655
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:49,220
 i was uh you know just just visiting with my mother-in-law and she of course uh um was in

656
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:54,320
 no no net with ruby keeler when ruby keeler made her big triumphant return um or whatever and

657
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,620
 someone brought up i'm trying to remember the the name of the other it was another movie star

658
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:02,040
 and ruby keeler putting on her makeup quietly goes like yes but can she still do a thousand

659
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:06,760
 taps blah blah and just talked shit about this other movie star and i was like

660
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:13,220
 based on my health she's still an amazing tap shape at her age in her 60s and basically could

661
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:18,060
 still out tap any any other movie star and i was like man this is the one who left show business

662
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:25,880
 and still like kept her receipts oh yeah i left this whole thing i came back also fuck you

663
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:35,300
 and elaine uh yeah you know my wife is working on the show as well and speaks so much so highly

664
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,700
 of your comedic background do you have a formal comedic background or you're just a funny person

665
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:43,020
 um you know i started in

666
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:47,520
 theater and musical theater like when i was a kid like nine i was like nine i went to perform

667
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:55,060
 arts high school and then um i went to amda in new york for two years and i started working when i

668
00:30:55,060 --> 00:31:04,740
 was 20 and in 2007 and actually like 2008 because i think i started taking at the people's improv

669
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:12,340
 theater in new york and both um nate starkey and ashley ward were teachers of mine love those two

670
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:12,820
 and then

671
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:23,140
 yeah i know me too me too and then when i moved to la i was kind of at the ground lanes like on

672
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:30,000
 and off because sometimes i would take breaks between levels but between 2012 and 2016 that's

673
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,780
 a lot that's not a small background that's a background and actually what groundlings training

674
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,820
 specifically what katie's describing your grounding training must be coming in very handy

675
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,620
 right now with these these big choices i mean i'm

676
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:50,040
 i love exactly i love like brownling style and like just characters and you know exactly

677
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:54,900
 our listeners like groundlings is always about like taking your choice making you distinct and

678
00:31:54,900 --> 00:32:00,140
 then take it to a 10 like that's basically what they're known for is take take your smallest choice

679
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:06,980
 and then make it eat everything else uh and and the character um which is why so many of them are

680
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:11,440
 iconic from our old mad tv days to the ones that have the training that stuck out on senate live

681
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,220
 and stuff it's like those are the the that kind of era of comedy where we're all all sketch comedy

682
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:22,660
 was so character distinct was definitely because of groundlings yeah yeah yeah um so oh so you're

683
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:27,260
 you're a heavy hitter you're you're you i didn't i didn't realize you stuck with the uh all the

684
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:34,140
 training in the uh post pit so that's that's exciting um yeah it was great like i think that's

685
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:41,120
 my favorite thing in life is just you know like laughter of reflection right because like it's the

686
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:48,340
 best way to connect with other people i think yeah yeah i think so sometimes you do it on stage

687
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:56,340
 and sometimes you do it on the internet through food but but through uh uh you are pushed you

688
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,340
 know through pushing the envelope through through tension spots and you know and messing with people

689
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,980
 like you do figure out through filling a kiddie pool with punch

690
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:10,740
 yeah like no i think when you surprise people their re-feelings their real feelings burst

691
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,920
 right that's that's what stand-ups do and everything else is like when you when you

692
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,280
 surprise people their real feelings burst before they can rationalize and so suddenly that's where

693
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:22,800
 you get like a real temperature a real take of what's happening in the room and when you're in

694
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,700
 a comedic environment when we all get to laugh at that time it's a relief we're like oh good we're

695
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:34,600
 all we're all flawed we're all laughing at this thing which means we're all secretly maybe hiding

696
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:40,540
 our terribleness all the time yeah some of us doing a better job than others speak for yourself

697
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,560
 hiding it

698
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:48,200
 well people who want to be decent are trying

699
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,980

717
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:33,460
 same question to katie um well i really love when katie and i see each other kind of for the first

718
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:39,700
 time outside of the dance-off i just think like that's so much fun and and you know i think it's

719
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:40,640
 so much fun and and you know i think it's so much fun and and you know i think it's so much fun and

720
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,020
 god there's i i love the whole thing honestly beginning to end i love watching her song

721
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:49,740
 constant pain i'm on stage for that and i kind of um get to just like oh that would have been a

722
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:53,320
 better question much easier to answer okay elaine what's your favorite katie scene and katie what's

723
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:59,960
 your favorite elaine scene much better you're a better podcaster than i am go ahead oh well

724
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:09,600
 definitely like i said uh crystals big solo ballad constant pain just so much fun i think there's

725
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:15,760
 so many layers to what has been added in that song and there's just things that crack me up

726
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,420
 i mean starting with the lyrics and and what katie's put on top of it being a dancer being a

727
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:26,980
 real show girl i just think that's a blast and the audience is having so much fun at that moment

728
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:37,760
 yeah katie i uh for me it's definitely when elaine comes out to do a song called lap dancing um

729
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,560
 the

730
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:38,720
 the

731
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:38,740
 the

732
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,060
 the

733
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:46,580
 the first time that she was just rehearsing it i had to excuse myself uh because i was crying

734
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:53,380
 laughing so hard that i was disruptive um because i'm not going to give it away but the pole is it

735
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:58,380
 plays a big part of course you know she's got to lick the pole but it plays a big part in that

736
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:07,780
 number and she just goes so full out and it's so goddamn funny uh well that's it i just want to

737
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:12,000
 point out yeah like much like paul and i were when we did for chase the parody what we what was

738
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,660
 particularly great about it was original music uh you're not you're not using typical parody songs

739
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:21,160
 which is a lot of parodies use typical mainstream songs just to kind of make fun of certain elements

740
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:27,200
 or whatever but this is all originally scored right yeah which is that's pretty cool so yeah

741
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,600
 a lot of great songs in it i can't wait to check it out um well thank you guys for coming by uh and

766
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:06,220
 it doesn't matter i'm just a more sure where else is it gonna go this is it uh oh gee scoop in the

767
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,980
 chat matt is pointing out uh didn't your wife do something with the uh with the showgirls my wife

768
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:14,080
 is the choreographer but i didn't i didn't want to like you know flex my uh my family's involvement

769
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:18,580
 with the with the show i just uh no we're just we're just we're wanting people to go see the

770
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:22,700
 thing yeah yeah i think sarah sarah and troy have talked about working different projects for a while

771
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:29,100
 now and uh as you know uh disco closed sarah had free time and uh nature abhors a vacuum so sure

772
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:34,980
 uh she wanted to nature and sarah abhor a vacuum and so uh sarah filled that time immediately with

773
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:41,020
 showgirls and working on showgirls didn't she agree to do it before disco show closed though

774
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:48,980
 yes i think she agreed to do showgirls before she had the time to do it

775
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:56,600
 that's how you get things done i suppose i guess so i guess so yeah so the timing worked out time

776
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,300
 worked out but yeah yeah so it's the

777
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:06,660
 we can't wait uh there we go so yeah um yeah i'm so excited i mean i mean i i love that show

778
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,160
 i've seen uh i saw a parody of it in new york back in the day that wasn't a musical

779
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:16,000
 uh that was just hysterical too and i just uh nice i well i will tell you that no one actually

780
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,400
 loves that show more than my friend maybe i won't name him for the story but he was um

781
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:27,220
 he was uh he was dating a stripper and they wanted to watch it together

782
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:33,500
 and uh he took ecstasy uh uh to when he was rolling when he watched it

783
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:39,680
 and then he was watching it and he thought it was so beautiful and significant and then he

784
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:46,700
 was looking at his girlfriend not react that way and so he was like like leaning over to his side

785
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:52,020
 and secretly texting and calling his friends to express like how amazing and important showgirls

786
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:56,980
 was well i've watched actually because that was paul verhoeven

787
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:01,120
 who directed that that's right yeah yeah that's the man behind the writer

788
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:09,900
 the man behind robocop yes yeah like and if you look at like i've watched some really interesting

789
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:19,000
 uh commentaries online yeah where they kind of deconstruct what's going on it's ah nuts the the

790
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,140
 the stuff that he was the messages he was putting in there that didn't necessarily translate for

791
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,200
 i mean that's that's that's that that is what's

792
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:31,860
 fascinating about if you if you want to look into it at all it is like these i forget what kind of

793
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:35,860
 filmmaking it was but like it used to be when you watch student filmmaking you watch uh whatever

794
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:40,200
 films from another country where like if they showed like uh you know a wine bottle it was

795
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,520
 supposed to mean something every little image is actually supposed to be the significant meaning

796
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:49,080
 and it never translates to the watcher unless you know it ahead of time unless you have also

797
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:54,540
 studied that filmmaking method right this film is filled with it it is filled trying to make this

798
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,520
 such a significant story

799
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:02,040
 um and it just is known for it's like crazy uh backstage antics and then of course

800
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:09,260
 bizarre sex scenes but let me let me let me posit this to you guys let me let me just say like if

801
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:16,640
 the three of us were tasked with making showgirls the year is 1990 whatever it was and somebody

802
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,540
 comes to the three of us and says okay you guys are going to make this showgirls pick uh we got

803
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:24,480
 the girl from saved by the bell she's going to be in it we got all these other people they're going

804
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,900
 to be in it it's vegas showgirls blah blah blah

805
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:32,440
 we'd go great we're going to start looking into this world and as soon as you start looking into

806
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:38,860
 that world there is so much interesting stuff there's genuinely all of this incredibly

807
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:44,960
 interesting stuff in in you know exotic dancing in in the showgirl world and and uh in las vegas

808
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:51,300
 entertainment oh like then you want to try to communicate all of that interesting material to

809
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:55,620
 the audience it's just not a thing that's really communicable

810
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:03,700
 unlike most things in the movie showgirls which are very communicable i think like yeah i think i

811
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:10,080
 think that like if this comes out years later it's more fascinating as a prestige television show

812
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:17,260
 yeah i mean it's a it's a it's a history document yeah yeah i think you really see the world through

813
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,960
 the life of the actual occupation of a showgirl obviously the movie came out last showgirl people

814
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,220
 are taylor swift just nailed her named her album showgirl like there's still a fascination with

815
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:31,040
 this and i think oh and i think largely right now because it's going away largely right now because

816
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:37,880
 of that kind of idea of putting together some kind of really big production show with pageantry and

817
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:42,580
 that being something that attracts modern audiences is going away now it needs celebrity

818
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:49,600
 and ip and all this other stuff to make people uh want to see something i think you know like

819
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:54,720
 the largest driver of tourism right now is the fucking wizard of oz right like uh for for las

820
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:00,880
 vegas right so it's like um like i think like we have this fascination of this era that is

821
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:06,380
 is closing out right even even dita von teese opened up her show over at bally's and the big

822
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:11,680
 discovery was that all of those um is it mac was that what's the name of the famous uh costumer

823
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:17,760
 bob mackie yeah mackie mackie bob mackie yeah all this is because you uh dita's dita show was in the

824
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:23,160
 jubilee showroom at uh bally's right and they were using all of the old a lot of the old jubilee

825
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,700
 costumes i'm just filling people in on what you're saying

826
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,820
 no i'm sorry i'm trying to let you i'm trying to let you also i didn't mean to be like yeah i knew

827
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:35,620
 that yeah but no they they were in the jubilee showroom where jubilee had been since the 60s i

828
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:40,940
 want to say 60s or 70s uh and clothes like i have i've got pictures on my phone somewhere of them

829
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:46,440
 taking the jubilee sign down outside of bally's right uh just because it was it was right across

830
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:51,920
 the street like and so we just watch this happen every night and uh and jubilee was a show that

831
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,700
 i mean i saw i i don't even know how many people have seen it i don't even know how many people have

832
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:59,700
 seen it how many dozens of times i saw jubilee and so like dita's show going in there with all

833
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:03,840
 of the costumes and katie mentioned a little bit like with the height stick and i think i'd even

834
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:09,360
 talked about this seeing dita's show when when they were doing it it was so neat with jubilee

835
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:16,640
 because it was it was this this beautiful exhibition of you know here here are all these

836
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:24,180
 these people and we have gotten a group of people that we can get to look as identical as we can

837
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,600
 still have a hundred people on stage but we're getting them to look as identical as they as we

838
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:33,740
 can with that with the height and the build and everything else and then we're just going to

839
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:40,500
 display these costumes on them yeah and so to see that and so to see dita then take that and say

840
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:45,540
 we're we're going to get people who look as different as everyone just truly looks we're

841
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:51,160
 not going to do any of that nonsense of of trying and not nonsense it's not fair different time uh

842
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,360
 but like we're not going to do any of that stuff where we're just displaying the costume

843
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,920
 we're going to display the people as well and so dita having people that were of kind of every

844
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:05,760
 shape and size up there wearing these costumes that for decades and for my whole experience had

845
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:12,200
 been like no you have to look like this to wear these costumes it was a neat thing to to watch

846
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:17,000
 history kind of get turned on its head a little bit with uh with dita's stuff but then yeah i think

847
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,440
 you're i think you're onto something though i don't know how interesting that was to the layperson

848
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:34,620
 was i think i think i i think that it through its efforts became iconic stamp of like what to go see

849
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:39,900
 in vegas right when you were there like and i think part of it was the toplessness and then that kind

850
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:45,140
 of stuff but i think i think these that era where you try to meet in the middle right it was like

851
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:48,180
 sure you're going to stop us but we're actually going to show you production anyway we're going

852
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:53,600
 to we're going to value and you're not it's not going to be lurid it's not going to be sexual i

853
00:47:53,600 --> 00:48:00,320
 mean that's that scene in rocky four when apollo creed is coming out and and the huge the huge

854
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:05,660
 production thing with the bull that collapses and all that stuff that's just a scene out of

855
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:11,160
 jubilee it is they did they do that shot that's in the jubilee theater where they do that shot

856
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:17,060
 and they just did a scene from jubilee and and put uh apollo creed in front of and put a boxing

857
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:23,280
 ring in front of it but i mean that's what they did every night yeah it was crazy no he's talking

858
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:23,520
 about like

859
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,060
 you know they basically had those costumes just locked up there's no one in charge of preserving

860
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:31,920
 them and so basically that production company was like good lord and tried to like preserve as much

861
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,540
 of it as they could and and do whatever and we we don't we still right now don't have like a museum

862
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:43,640
 or a preservation space for these iconic costumes of this was the same kind of difficulties and

863
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:48,840
 travesty that happened when they closed down the experience there were so many pieces of memorabilia

864
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:53,560
 uh the jimmy hendrix experience so there were so many pieces of

865
00:48:53,600 --> 00:49:00,440
 memorabilia and actual legit costumes and you know right not to mention all the replica stuff

866
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:06,920
 that just a lot of it went in the fucking trash oh i mean i was i was working at the tropicana

867
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:13,220
 uh after folly's brager closed which was the kind of the sister show to to jubilee it was the other

868
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:21,000
 big showgirl show in town and i mean i found a room one day maybe a year after follies had closed

869
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,060
 that just had basically all the costumes that had been worn on the final night

870
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:30,700
 they had just taken all those costumes as soon as people got off stage and thrown them into boxes

871
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:34,480
 and closed them up they hadn't washed them they hadn't laundered them they hadn't dry cleaned them

872
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,540
 they hadn't even dried them out yeah and so like they were all sweaty they had mildewed like they

873
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:45,360
 just they just rotted like it was it was horrible well it's it's you know we'll save the day there's

917
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:30,760
 like literally on the road to the restaurant the squall stopped and i get out and i look at my phone

927
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:08,160
 and i go like at this point we should just get alerts for when the buses are on time

928
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:12,920
 right hey everything's going to plan right every other day you know that

929
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:17,880
 shit's happening so yeah um i like that maybe there was a guy at the weather service who was

930
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:21,860
 hard of hearing and every time anyone said anything he's like what squall board oh i'll

931
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:30,080
 send it out sure hit the squall button squall button the fact that they cut off the squall

932
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:35,720
 warning and then issued it again like five minutes later as soon as we got on the road

933
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:42,060
 they started it up again like fuck you so yeah the only i'm not a fan of this winter bullshit

934
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:49,400
 i uh because uh you know i i travel a lot and so sometimes planes are delayed the only airline i

935
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:53,720
 know that will delay a plane and then go never mind actually we're leaving early is southwest

936
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:59,940
 everyone everyone else if you're playing delayed then it's just delayed but with southwest your

937
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,800
 place late you're like don't go anywhere because they might just turn around be like never mind

938
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:08,360

939
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,640
 on the fucking southwest man i love my southwest

940
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:18,620
 so i so most years i go i take the truck and i go pick up firewood yeah and they there are these

941
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:22,820
 services in town that's what i thought jacob i thought you were a man you know that's the thing

942
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:29,040
 so every year i've done this every year i've done this this year i couldn't find anywhere that would

943
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:33,360
 let me do it wouldn't let you pick up firewood they wouldn't let me pick up firewood everywhere

944
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:37,280
 is doing deliveries and i asked one guy i was like what's going on with this and he goes oh

945
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,600
 some people are they'll come pick it up and then they'll drive it somewhere and resell it

946
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:49,400
 like on their own oh this is the economy we're living in guys so what

947
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:57,240
 you're still selling them a truckload of firewood i agree like so why can't i buy a truckload of

948
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:01,460
 firewood oh my god that's funny wood people will be like look ticket master couldn't figure this

949
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:07,460
 out you can't either pokemon can't pokemon can't figure it out that's there's a whole economy based

950
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:12,020
 around reselling pokemon shit you can't help it half of the half of our current economy is just

951
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:20,320
 reselling pokemon cards so i have this area in my in my shop in my in my garage uh that is the the

952
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:24,660
 firewood pile and it's you know big area there and we pile all the firewood up there every year

953
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:28,980
 and and it's there it's it's indoors a little bit like we don't have to go outside to go get

954
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:35,680
 it during the winter time it's nice and uh so he he pulls up in his truck and he takes one look

955
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,980
 at where the firewood is going to go and he goes oh that's not going to fit

956
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:51,660
 and i go and i say very confidently don't worry i do this every year and i point at my truck

957
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:58,460
 which is the same size as the truck that he just pulled up in so i'm feeling good i say i i go load

958
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:03,020
 that truck up every year with firewood i stack it all right here we'll stack it up and we'll and

959
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:07,560
 we'll put it in front of each other and it it doesn't look like it'll fit but trust me it'll

960
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:12,040
 fit and he goes oh okay great and we start unloading the firewood and we're like oh my god

961
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:18,580
 wouldn't we start stacking it up he was correct

962
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:26,300
 i was gonna say the fact that he was like all right was basically like you know

963
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:31,520
 let's go then you just did the equivalent of someone who works at a restaurant

964
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:37,200
 uh every day yep and the and the customer going like i eat here all the time

965
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:41,980
 yeah you're like no i work here all the time and you don't you just don't yep

966
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:52,340
 he is a he is a professional wood stacker as you are a a biannual stacker yes yes an amateur at

967
00:58:52,340 --> 00:59:02,220
 best yes and uh so we got um kind of the main space of a firewood storage area filled up

968
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:07,980
 yeah and i looked at his truck i turned to look because he was kind of like bringing wood to me

969
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:11,040
 while i was stacking he had more to come really paying attention to the truck

970
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:16,500
 and so i turned and looked at the truck and keep in mind the area that i usually fill up

971
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:25,280
 with firewood is now about halfway filled up at this point i have filled up about half of the

972
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:32,680
 normal load that i bring into this oh so you you were wrong by like a a a great deal you're you're

973
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:39,900
 wrong by a significant percent a great but you said that the same size truck turns out when you

974
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:47,620
 guys throwing pieces of firewood into your truck willy-nilly and just stacking them a lot less

975
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:54,220
 firewood fits in it than when when one guy very carefully goes through and stacks all the firewood

976
00:59:54,220 --> 01:00:00,540
 into the truck getting as much firewood into the truck as possible oh okay so this is do you think

977
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:09,040
 you have more than a year's worth of firewood here then oh yes not only do i have more than a

978
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:16,060
 year's worth of firewood currently at my house i have more firewood that i've already paid for

979
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:21,920
 at this guy's establishment that now that he knows me i can just go pull up in the truck and he will

980
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:28,360
 load it he was like we we stacked as much as we could i was like i'm gonna call it there was still

981
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:33,580
 maybe a third you gotta if you don't have an account on truth social right no no okay you

982
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:37,500
 should get one because what happens is they're gonna eventually need to start paying some people

983
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:41,720
 to host book burning parties and so like you should make sure that you're on the forefront of

984
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:48,160
 that jesus christ get on the cutting edge you can get on the any any book that mentions the word gay

985
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:55,240
 or trans or whatever or a black person or or facts our country had slavery at one point

986
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:59,780
 that's all gonna get burned that's all gonna get burned and they're you know what they're

987
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:06,140
 gonna need for that firewood exactly i'm not i mean it's it's strange for me to tell you to be

988
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:07,480
 profiting in these strange times and i'm not gonna tell you to be profiting in these strange times

989
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:13,040
 but i'm just looking out for you man it's you know we gotta pivot sometimes we just have to pivot

990
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:21,500
 you gotta pivot we gotta jeremy pivot jeremy pivot so okay okay wait so where are you where

991
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:25,020
 are you loading up when you when you're realizing this failure of loading your truck properly is

992
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:30,760
 happening where are you where is this this is at the house is that your house so he so he brings

993
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:34,920
 the truck because he because they won't let me come pick it up so he brings a truck load to the

994
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:43,440
 back to the truck in such a way that he can he is fit he has filled every space in the truck every

995
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:49,540
 nook and cranny what he did is firewooded when the guys fill my truck up when i go pick it up i i

996
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:56,380
 basically pull up hand them like 60 and they just like four dudes just start throwing pieces of

997
01:01:56,380 --> 01:02:01,060
 firewood into the bed of the truck yeah i'm always a little worried that my truck is going to get

998
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:06,140
 damaged when they're loading it get out of here really that's how they're loading it that's the

999
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:07,480
 way in which they're loading this

1000
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:13,140
 this guy had like carefully packed all this firewood into the bed of his truck

1001
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:19,040
 and i mean it had to have been three times as much as i usually get into into mine same price easily

1002
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:25,140
 a little more expensive but definitely worth the worth the extra cost wow but you're at your house

1003
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:31,580
 i'm at my house so we're stacking it up in my house okay and we got there was maybe a quarter

1004
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:36,620
 or so of his truck bed left and i called it i was like i can't

1005
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:43,080
 like i'm gonna have to start moving shit around to find places for firewood now and i knew that he

1006
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:47,620
 was close by because we had already talked about it i was like you're gonna do more deliveries with

1007
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:52,620
 this truck tomorrow right he said yeah so i said if i leave firewood in your truck that doesn't that

1008
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:55,960
 doesn't screw you up on your on your later deliveries that you're doing tomorrow he said

1009
01:02:55,960 --> 01:03:00,540
 nope i'm already partway loaded then that's just that's all that means it's a great said can i just

1010
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:05,960
 come pick up about this much firewood later on from from your place which is right down the road

1011
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:06,980
 from my house yeah

1012
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:12,380
 and he goes yes you can and he looks at he goes that's about two and a half wheelbarrow loads of

1013
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:16,460
 a firewood that i owe you uh you should argue with right there you'd be like no

1014
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:25,340
 this sounds like he was very gracious i've got a wheelbarrow in the back we'll load it up and

1015
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:30,500
 test this out this guy was very gracious in victory he was yeah he certainly was he was

1016
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:37,280
 very gracious like he had a second opportunity to misjudge his call again i mean you did miss

1017
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:42,580
 runner but uh still i mean if you two are the only ones that are getting it and he's just like

1018
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:49,060
 i mean at that at that point i'm like whatever you say man yeah i'm not i'm not disagreeing

1019
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:54,580
 with a single word you have to say if you tell me that i should be using a different type of wood

1020
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:58,560
 great load all this up take it away bring me whatever you think i just agree with you

1021
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:06,240
 holy amazing amazing oh i i was i went back in the house and uh later on sj gets home and i was

1022
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:11,000
 like you see that uh giant pile of firewood she goes yeah said we have uh more coming

1023
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:18,680
 that chunk that because like i basically made my two big piles of firewood that i always make

1024
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:24,820
 and then i made two big two more big piles of firewood in front of that and i was like as soon

1025
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:30,660
 as we burn this like ancillary pile we're going to get enough to make another ancillary pile

1026
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:35,240
 the only thing you should have done is gotten out chat gpt and be like chat gpt how much wood

1027
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,200
 will the fit and

1028
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:41,420
 here and then like put it in his face like no i did my research i did my research this wood

1029
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:46,640
 should fit it'll be fine no we're stacking it wrong we're the problem

1030
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:54,880
 you and i are equally the problem here sir equally uh so you load it from his truck to

1031
01:04:54,880 --> 01:05:01,340
 your truck at your house no no his truck to the end of the house my truck was not involved got it

1032
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:05,700
 okay okay that's where i keep getting confused okay yeah we were loading it into like the wood

1033
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:10,720
 storage area in in my house and he was like it's not going to fit in that storage area yeah yeah

1034
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:14,140
 and he was like absolutely not and he was just and you took the rest of the wood and built a

1035
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:22,620
 second storage area you built a second just put that wood together yep that's right that's right

1036
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:27,240
 this is the you know what this means you have too much wood we should host some kind of mini

1037
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:34,080
 burning man we should build some kind of figure that we can that we can torch an effigy uh to

1038
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:39,960
 celebrate something i can't think of any uh public figures that you'd want to burn an effigy right now

1039
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:45,800
 i don't really i don't think we have we need to wait for a more uh aggressive political climate

1040
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:49,720
 so we can just just just a just a a know-it-all norwegian is what we'd build

1041
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:53,980
 god damn it

1042
01:05:53,980 --> 01:06:03,800
 oh fuck oh people are asking why i didn't want to stack it outside i i just didn't want to it was

1043
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:11,060
 more of a pain this is this is easier it can rain in vegas it can rain in vegas also like i've got

1044
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:16,300
 kind of an outdoor fire pit and there's already a wood pile outside that kind of runs that fire pit

1045
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:24,040
 and that that one's also full jacob is neat he doesn't want sloppy wood about his yard he needs

1046
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:30,240
 things tidy yeah plus this guy is like a mile down the road from me this was just easier yeah

1047
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,800
 this was just much easier as a guy a little jock versus

1048
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:37,580
 as a guy who gets firewood a bag at a time from the grocery store

1049
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:44,560
 it is easier it is easier

1050
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:50,040
 ladies and gentlemen

1051
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:52,420
 it is

1052
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:09,240
 Explosion!

1053
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,040
 Of wood.

1054
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:15,560
 We got a scooper from the OG Scoop today.

1055
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:17,500
 I think he said this was an AI scooper.

1056
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:20,100
 So I don't know what that means, but we'll find out together.

1057
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:24,480
 The categories are Matt, Paul, Jacob, and Ice Cream.

1058
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,300
 Paul, you're up.

1059
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:27,400
 I'll try me.

1060
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,520
 Oh, Lemur Screamer, they are local trees.

1061
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,920
 Thank you for asking, Lemur Screamer Creamer.

1062
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,240
 They are indeed local trees.

1063
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,140
 It's a wood, like a tree service.

1064
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:37,220
 This is the other half of the tree service.

1065
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:40,300
 So they cut down trees in town and around here and everything,

1066
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:44,020
 and then chop them up and let them sit and season for a couple of years,

1067
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:45,000
 and then sell the firewood.

1068
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:50,760
 So Andy had AI just generate all of the questions and answers for this quiz.

1069
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:51,540
 Okay.

1070
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:52,980
 Oh, all right.

1071
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:53,580
 This is scary.

1072
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:54,400
 We'll see how this goes.

1073
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,620
 All right, I'll take me for 200.

1074
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:57,920
 Let's see.

1075
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,940
 The state where Paul was born, its official name is a Commonwealth.

1076
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,060
 That would be Kentucky.

1077
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:06,200
 The KY itself.

1078
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,720
 My old Kentucky home.

1079
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:10,100
 Let's see.

1080
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:10,620
 I'll try.

1081
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:12,220
 Well, I'll try Jacob for 200.

1082
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:16,060
 Andy, I'm asking, when you put this into AI, did you put any facts in with it,

1083
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:19,980
 or did you simply want AI to use whatever knowledge it already had of this podcast?

1084
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:22,660
 I'm curious about, like, the actual input for this quiz.

1085
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:23,480
 Oh, yeah, that's interesting.

1086
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,100
 Yeah, yeah.

1087
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:31,900
 I gave it just some, like, one-word things, like Springsteen, Louisiana,

1088
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,260
 bourbon, et cetera.

1089
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:34,720
 Okay.

1090
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:41,800
 Yeah, and then they kind of just went crazy, and some of the questions are really odd.

1091
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,780
 I'll bet.

1092
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:44,880
 I'll bet they are.

1093
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,000
 All right.

1094
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:46,640
 Thank you, Andy.

1095
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:47,380
 We'll find out together.

1096
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:48,520
 Enjoy.

1097
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:49,220
 Thank you.

1098
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:54,080
 The only U.S. state that isn't divided into parishes instead of counties, a legacy of

1099
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:57,120
 its French and Spanish colonial days, it's Jacob's home state.

1100
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,940
 That, of course, is Mississippi.

1101
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:00,640
 It's Louisiana.

1102
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:01,740
 Come on.

1103
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:02,400
 Come on.

1104
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:07,700
 If you read the $800 question, it's like, Matt last sent a dick pic in this decade.

1105
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:11,900
 I feel like we'd all get that right.

1106
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:12,700
 Matt, you're up.

1107
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:17,020
 I guess we're on a roll here.

1108
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:18,340
 I'm going to go with, no, you know what?

1109
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:19,280
 I'm going to do Paul 400.

1110
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:20,000
 I'm going to try this.

1111
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,460
 Mixing it up.

1112
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:28,460
 Paul's favorite Star Trek series, the one with captains Janeway and formerly Sisko overlapping

1113
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:29,640
 in the same era.

1114
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:30,360
 What?

1115
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:36,260
 No, I'm on board.

1116
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:37,180
 I like this a lot.

1117
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:38,420
 Oh, man.

1118
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:41,640
 I wish I knew this just because it'd be funny to take this question, but I don't.

1119
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:44,040
 I don't think AI knows this.

1120
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:48,960
 Are you passing?

1121
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:49,300
 What are we?

1122
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:49,720
 What's happening?

1123
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:50,100
 I'm passing.

1124
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:50,460
 Oh, yeah.

1125
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:51,840
 Paul, I guess.

1126
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,260
 I mean, I guess it's next gen.

1127
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:54,400
 All right.

1128
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,820
 Star Trek, Deep Space Nine or Voyager.

1129
01:09:57,820 --> 01:09:58,660
 Paul loves both.

1130
01:09:58,660 --> 01:09:59,880
 He quotes DS9 more.

1131
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,700
 No, that's not.

1132
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:02,180
 There you go.

1133
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:03,100
 That's blatantly not true.

1134
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:04,460
 No, that's just.

1135
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:06,740
 Paul, you just saw it on the screen.

1136
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:07,620
 It's very true.

1137
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:10,660
 This is why we've got to burn down these goddamn AI power.

1138
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:11,700
 No, this is great.

1139
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:16,860
 Every AI facility must be burned to the ground because this is the kind of bullshit.

1140
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:18,000
 Oh, my God.

1141
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:18,480
 I know, right?

1142
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,460
 Oh, fuck, fuck.

1143
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:21,620
 I'll keep digging into my own grave.

1144
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:22,140
 600.

1145
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:23,160
 For 600.

1146
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:26,180
 The Simpsons episode where Homer goes to space.

1147
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:29,420
 Paul can quote the entire rake scene on command.

1148
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:30,600
 Oh, God.

1149
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:31,820
 I hope this is just an episode.

1150
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:34,500
 I know it's got to be Deep Space Homer.

1151
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:35,960
 Oh, okay.

1152
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:38,060
 But that's Deep Space Homer.

1153
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:40,940
 See, now you're friends with AI again.

1154
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:42,320
 Look at you go.

1155
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:42,940
 No, I'm not.

1156
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:45,560
 You love AI.

1157
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:46,320
 You love it, man.

1158
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,480
 I'm not convinced.

1159
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:52,560
 Does the rake thing, does Sideshow Bob's rakes happen in Deep Space Homer?

1160
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,340
 I don't know.

1161
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:55,780
 I'm going Paul for 800.

1162
01:10:55,780 --> 01:11:01,540
 Paul's go-to improv comedy rule slash theorem that states,

1163
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:03,920
 there are no mistakes, only blank.

1164
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,600
 Opportunities.

1165
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,060
 We'll see what they say here.

1166
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:08,360
 Opportunities.

1167
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,140
 Opportunities.

1168
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,540
 There's happy accidents.

1169
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:12,980
 I mean, I'll say opportunities.

1170
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:13,900
 That is what he says.

1171
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:16,020
 Gifts.

1172
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:23,380
 I am so on board with this.

1173
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:24,240
 Matt, you're up.

1174
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,040
 Ice cream.

1175
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:25,820
 200, please.

1176
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:31,260
 The top-selling ice cream flavor in the United States year after year.

1177
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:35,360
 Well, according to AI, it's going to be like strained peas.

1178
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,700
 Strained peas, Neapolitan.

1179
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:39,600
 Strained peas.

1180
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,720
 I'll go with vanilla.

1181
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,400
 Let's try it.

1182
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,740
 No, I'm sorry.

1183
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:45,780
 It's strained peas.

1184
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:48,900
 Holy shit.

1185
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:49,920
 It is vanilla.

1186
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:50,780
 Paul.

1187
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:54,460
 I'll try Matt for 800.

1188
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:55,380
 Let's go crazy.

1189
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:55,980
 All right.

1190
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:57,180
 Daily double.

1191
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:57,800
 Yeah.

1192
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,380
 Here's where I win.

1193
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:00,760
 How well do you know me, Paul?

1194
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:01,480
 I'll be so upset.

1195
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:02,440
 If you get this wrong.

1196
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:06,720
 In what decade did Matt last send a dick?

1197
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:15,820
 In 2013, Matt absolutely lost his mind watching Penn and Teller debut their jaw-dropping new

1198
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:21,920
 version of this classic stage illusion, one they had spent over a decade perfecting, involving

1199
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:26,720
 a live stick of dynamite and a bullet catch gone terrifyingly real.

1200
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:27,920
 What?

1201
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,940
 This is just slop.

1202
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:31,140
 This is just nothing.

1203
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:33,800
 I mean, this is, this is, I'm going to say bullet catch.

1204
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,880
 Let's try it.

1205
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:38,980
 It's the bullet catch.

1206
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:42,220
 Well, that bullet catch is in the question and it's absolutely wrong.

1207
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:43,280
 There's no dynamite.

1208
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,640
 There's no dynamite.

1209
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:48,560
 Gone terrifyingly real.

1210
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:49,240
 What the fuck?

1211
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,320
 The bullet catch was definitely not debuted in 2013.

1212
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:53,660
 Oh my God.

1213
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:54,900
 That's great.

1214
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:56,080
 Good Lord.

1215
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:56,500
 It's me.

1216
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,000
 I'll try Jacob for 800.

1217
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,180
 Jacob's favorite style of bullet catch.

1218
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:06,520
 It's the style of knife for everyday carry originally designed by Bob Loveless in the

1219
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,180
 1960s.

1220
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:13,300
 What?

1221
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:16,640
 Who is Bob Loveless?

1222
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,020
 You know, your favorite style of knife.

1223
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:19,560
 There's got to be a Leatherman, right?

1224
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,860
 Did he indeed make knives?

1225
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:23,800
 Is this a Leatherman?

1226
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,300
 Like it could be like a Leatherman.

1227
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:27,780
 It could be like a switch blade.

1228
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:29,560
 I bet it's a Leatherman because it could be.

1229
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,020
 Well, who the fuck knows?

1230
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:31,400
 Who the fuck knows?

1231
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:32,380
 Oh, no, no.

1232
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:32,960
 60s.

1233
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,360
 I'm going to say butterfly knife.

1234
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:35,320
 Oh, there you go.

1235
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:36,980
 I'm going to go butterfly knife.

1236
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:41,860
 A drop point or a hunter knife.

1237
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:45,260
 You don't even know your own favorite knife?

1238
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:46,140
 Come on, Jacob.

1239
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:47,000
 Apparently not.

1240
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,020
 Apparently not.

1241
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:50,480
 It's a bunch of shit.

1242
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:55,940
 Ice cream, 400.

1243
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:56,040
 400.

1244
01:13:56,040 --> 01:14:01,000
 This ancient civilization around 2000 BC.

1245
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:05,420
 Is credited with the earliest known ice desserts made from fruit and snow.

1246
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:08,020
 The Ice Maniacs.

1247
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:09,220
 The ice.

1248
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:11,020
 Show me the Ice Maniacs.

1249
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:13,860
 I'll pass.

1250
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:15,200
 Paul.

1251
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:19,900
 Pass.

1252
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:22,620
 It's me.

1253
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:27,380
 This is the Chinese.

1254
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:28,580
 Chinese did a lot of things.

1255
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:29,800
 I'll pass, though.

1256
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:31,580
 Fuck.

1257
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:33,760
 It was the Chinese.

1258
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,680
 It's just the Chinese.

1259
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:38,440
 I didn't believe in myself, everyone.

1260
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:39,860
 Believe in yourself.

1261
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:41,560
 That's the message from today's show.

1262
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,700
 Paul.

1263
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:44,980
 I'll take Matt for 600.

1264
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:47,860
 Daily Double.

1265
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:49,180
 Both the Daily Doubles.

1266
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:52,760
 They were the bottom two questions for Matt.

1267
01:14:52,760 --> 01:15:00,200
 Bruce Springsteen's debut 1973 album that gave us Blinded by the Light and Spirit in the Night.

1268
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:00,840
 Oh, gee.

1269
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:01,160
 Jesus.

1270
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:05,380
 Was this.

1271
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:09,060
 Well, unfortunately, Paul, unlike the last question, the answer is not in the question.

1272
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:10,300
 No, it's not.

1273
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:10,660
 Okay.

1274
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:14,120
 I was going to go with Bruce Springsteen, but.

1275
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:14,860
 No, no.

1276
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:17,780
 Paul, if I was to say hello to you, that's a form of.

1277
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:18,800
 Greeting.

1278
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:19,720
 Uh-huh.

1279
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,220
 Mm-hmm.

1280
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:22,360
 Greetings from.

1281
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,440
 Yes.

1282
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:24,300
 Yep.

1283
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:24,640
 Ah.

1284
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,200
 All right.

1285
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:30,240
 New Jersey City, where he famously started his career.

1286
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:30,680
 Uh-huh.

1287
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:30,740
 Uh-huh.

1288
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:30,800
 Uh-huh.

1289
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:30,820
 Uh-huh.

1290
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:31,240
 Oh.

1291
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:32,800
 This could be the tripping spot.

1292
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:33,800
 Asbury Park.

1293
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:34,660
 Oh.

1294
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:37,080
 Is that what the album is called?

1295
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:38,840
 Greetings from Asbury Park.

1296
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:41,180
 Greetings from.

1297
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:41,860
 I'm sorry, Paul.

1298
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:43,480
 It's greetings from Asbury Park, New Jersey.

1299
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:45,840
 Greetings from Asbury Park, New Jersey.

1300
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,520
 I'm sorry you got that incorrect.

1301
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:51,760
 I'm sorry, Paul.

1302
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:52,800
 Oh, boy.

1303
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:53,500
 It's me.

1304
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:54,980
 I'll try ice cream for 800.

1305
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:56,880
 Oh, you really dinged him on New Jersey?

1306
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:59,040
 He didn't get New Jersey.

1307
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,440
 The AI said it was wrong.

1308
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:04,940
 Is it just greetings from Asbury Park or is it Asbury Park, New Jersey?

1309
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:06,380
 It is greetings from Asbury Park, New Jersey.

1310
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:07,080
 Okay.

1311
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:11,020
 Everyone calls it the greetings from Asbury Park or greetings for shorts.

1312
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:11,160
 Yes.

1313
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:20,740
 While we're here, famously, it's because Springsteen, his whole band left after the riots and started making money with Southside Johnny in North Carolina.

1314
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:24,940
 So Springsteen started making money going to the New York Village and doing the Dylan route.

1315
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:30,640
 They wanted to be the next Dylan, but he got his band back together for it, and they were still pressuring him to be like a New York Village.

1316
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:37,420
 He was a musician, so he insisted the title of the first album be called Greetings from Asbury Park, New Jersey as a fuck you to the record company.

1317
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:38,160
 Okay.

1318
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,800
 Oh, I like that.

1319
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:40,280
 Yeah.

1320
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:43,520
 I also like that Southside Johnny got a little.

1321
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,660
 Anytime we can bring in Southside Johnny.

1322
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:49,440
 We are by far the number one Southside Johnny podcast.

1323
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,180
 Easily.

1324
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:53,860
 Easily the number one Southside Johnny.

1325
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:56,960
 And we can probably easily get him for next to confess.

1326
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,420
 So those things are also true.

1327
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:01,660
 I don't know.

1328
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:06,080
 I mean, honestly, the fact that we haven't called him up for a turnout at a tyrannies.

1329
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,260
 That's that's that's the move.

1330
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:09,700
 Yeah.

1331
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:11,520
 He might have just my God.

1332
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:14,120
 You'd pack the whole place.

1333
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:15,020
 Oh, absolutely.

1334
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:16,240
 He might have been there anyway.

1335
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:20,820
 The record holding number of scoops balanced on a single cone.

1336
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:23,520
 Guinness of 2023 within five.

1337
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:35,340
 Uh, 37.

1338
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:36,840
 Good guess.

1339
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:39,800
 125.

1340
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:40,800
 My left.

1341
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:41,920
 What are these?

1342
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:44,880
 It's like little pancakes of fucking ice cream.

1343
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,600
 Little pancake ice cream.

1344
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:47,460
 Bullshit.

1345
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:49,120
 Matt.

1346
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,760
 Oh, let's do.

1347
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:52,580
 Don't worry, Matt.

1348
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:53,480
 There aren't any daily doubles.

1349
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:53,840
 Left.

1350
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:54,260
 Jacob.

1351
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:54,720
 600.

1352
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:57,900
 The NFL team.

1353
01:17:57,900 --> 01:18:00,360
 Jacob bleeds black and gold for their home.

1354
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:02,720
 Dome is now called the Caesar Superdome.

1355
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,660
 That would be the Falcons.

1356
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:05,140
 Atlanta.

1357
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:05,860
 The Falcons.

1358
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:06,260
 Of course.

1359
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:07,160
 The Falcons.

1360
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,080
 The Saints.

1361
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:11,000
 I'm sorry, Matt.

1362
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,420
 That's the New Orleans Saints.

1363
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:13,720
 The New Orleans Saints.

1364
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:15,360
 Is that actually the correct answer?

1365
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:15,740
 You are.

1366
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:16,300
 Oh,

1367
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:17,360
 yeah.

1368
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:34,120
, you are ruthless today, Jacob.

1369
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:36,120
 I'm sorry, Matt, it's the AI.

1370
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,120
 It's not me.

1371
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,120
 It's the AI.

1372
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,120
 I'll do Matt for 400.

1373
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,120
 Matt's home state.

1374
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:41,120
 Whose nickname is the Garden State.

1375
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,120
 Despite what you might think from the turnpike.

1376
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,120
 New Jersey.

1377
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,120
 Wow.

1378
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,120
 I'm sorry.

1379
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,120
 It's brand New Jersey.

1380
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:47,120
 Sparkling New Jersey.

1381
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:48,120
 New Jersey smell.

1382
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,120
 Yeah.

1383
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,120
 I'm sorry.

1384
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,120
 It's brand New Jersey.

1385
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,120
 Sparkling New Jersey.

1386
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:53,120
 It still has that New Jersey smell.

1387
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:54,120
 Yeah.

1388
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,120
 It's me.

1389
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:56,120
 I'll try ice cream.

1390
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:57,120
 600.

1391
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:03,620
 The ice cream chain founded in Burlington, Vermont in 1978, whose flavors include cherry

1392
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:05,620
 Garcia and fish food.

1393
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:07,620
 It's fish with a PH.

1394
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:08,620
 Fish.

1395
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:12,620
 I believe that would be Ben and or Jerry's.

1396
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:13,620
 Ben and Jerry's.

1397
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:14,620
 Ben and Jerry's.

1398
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:15,620
 Ben and Jerry's.

1399
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:16,620
 I'm sorry.

1400
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:17,620
 There's no and or there.

1401
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:18,620
 I'm sorry.

1402
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:19,620
 There's no or.

1403
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:21,620
 It's just and.

1404
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:22,620
 Matt.

1405
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:23,620
 You got Matt or Jacob.

1406
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:24,620
 I guess I'll go with Jacob for it or just so I can break even.

1407
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:25,620
 The brand of bourbon Jacob keeps on his bar cart that's distilled in Kentucky, but named

1408
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:26,620
 after a Louisiana parish.

1409
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:27,620
 What?

1410
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:28,620
 Do you know the answer to this, Jacob?

1411
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:29,620
 I don't own a bar cart.

1412
01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:30,620
 Is there an answer to this?

1413
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:31,620
 I don't even have a bar cart.

1414
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:32,620
 I can't even think of a parish name to name.

1415
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:33,620
 I mean, there's like a bar cart.

1416
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:34,620
 I don't even have a bar cart.

1417
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:35,620
 I don't even have a bar cart.

1418
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:36,620
 I don't even have a bar cart.

1419
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:37,620
 I don't even have a bar cart.

1420
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:38,620
 I don't even have a bar cart.

1421
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:39,620
 I don't even have a bar cart.

1422
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:40,620
 I don't even have a bar cart.

1423
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:41,620
 I don't even have a bar cart.

1424
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:42,620
 I don't even have a bar cart.

1425
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:43,620
 I don't even have a bar cart.

1426
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:44,620
 I don't even have a bar cart.

1427
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:45,620
 I don't even have a bar cart.

1428
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:46,620
 I don't even have a bar cart.

1429
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:47,620
 I don't even have a bar cart.

1430
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:48,620
 I can't even think of a parish name to name.

1431
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:49,620
 I mean, there's like Orleans.

1432
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:50,620
 Treme.

1433
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:51,620
 Rapids.

1434
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:52,620
 I'll pass.

1435
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:53,620
 Paul.

1436
01:19:53,620 --> 01:19:54,620
 This has to be a Kentucky.

1437
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:55,620
 I don't know.

1438
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:56,620
 I don't know.

1439
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:57,620
 I don't know.

1440
01:19:57,620 --> 01:19:58,620
 I don't know.

1441
01:19:58,620 --> 01:19:59,620
 I don't know.

1442
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:00,620
 I don't know.

1443
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:01,620
 I don't know.

1444
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:02,620
 I don't know.

1445
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:03,620
 I don't know.

1446
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:04,620
 I don't know.

1447
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:05,620
 I don't know.

1448
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:06,620
 I'm not sure.

1449
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:07,620
 I don't know.

1450
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:08,620
 I don't know.

1451
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:09,620
 I don't know.

1452
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:10,620
 I don't know.

1453
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:11,620
 I don't know.

1454
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:12,620
 I don't know.

1455
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:13,620
 I don't know.

1456
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:14,620
 I don't know.

1457
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:15,620
 I don't know.

1458
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:16,620
 I don't know.

1459
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:17,620
 I don't know.

1460
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:18,620
 I don't know.

1461
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:19,620
 I don't know.

1462
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:20,620
 I don't know.

1463
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:21,620
 I don't know.

1464
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:22,620
 I don't know.

1465
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:23,620
 I don't know.

1466
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:24,620
 I don't know.

1467
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:25,620
 I don't know.

1468
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:26,620
 I don't know.

1469
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:27,620
 I don't know.

1470
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:28,620
 I don't know.

1471
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:29,620
 I don't know.

1472
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:30,620
 I don't know.

1473
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:31,620
 I don't know.

1474
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:32,620
 I don't know.

1475
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:33,620
 I don't know.

1476
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:34,620
 I don't know.

1477
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:35,620
 Yeah.

1478
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:36,620
 Yeah.

1479
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:37,620
 Yeah.

1480
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:38,620
 Yeah.

1481
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:41,140
 Not Ocean, but they've got other Jeffersons.

1482
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:42,480
 Yeah, yeah.

1483
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,220
 I do have some Jeffersons in the bar.

1484
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:45,340
 Cart?

1485
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:45,880
 Well, there you go.

1486
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,300
 I don't have a bar cart.

1487
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:48,080
 I just have a bar.

1488
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:50,860
 We've got to build you a bar cart before next game.

1489
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:52,300
 I do need a bar cart.

1490
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:54,600
 Paul closing out the category and the game.

1491
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,540
 Matt for 200.

1492
01:20:55,540 --> 01:21:02,300
 This duo has performed together at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas since 2001.

1493
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:03,360
 Penn and Teller.

1494
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:04,580
 Siegfried and Roy.

1495
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:06,860
 Siegfried and Roy.

1496
01:21:06,860 --> 01:21:08,200
 Penn and Teller.

1497
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:14,320
 I really like that Ben and Jerry's, the answer for Ben and Jerry's earlier, had the ampersand in it,

1498
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:17,580
 but the Penn and Teller answer has the word and spelled out.

1499
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:20,220
 Good old AI coming through.

1500
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:20,760
 That's right.

1501
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:26,260
 That is the game Paul wins with 600 because he loves AI the most.

1502
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:28,620
 Matt's in second with negative 400.

1503
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:30,640
 I'm in third with negative 1600.

1504
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:32,000
 That's from OG Scoop.

1505
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,360
 Thank you, OG Scoop.

1506
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,320
 Yes, thank you.

1507
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,800
 That AI Scoopity worked out just fine.

1508
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:37,460
 Oh, my goodness.

1509
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:38,600
 I'll say this is a fine.

1510
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:39,140
 It's an experiment.

1511
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:41,400
 I don't know if it's worth replicating.

1512
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:42,240
 We're going to do it all the time.

1513
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:43,380
 No, let's not do it anymore.

1514
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:45,260
 Let's leave AI alone.

1515
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:46,820
 Let's stop fucking with AI.

1516
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:50,060
 Hey, Matt, how is Penn doing, by the way?

1517
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:51,160
 He hurt his ankle, yeah?

1518
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:51,620
 He did.

1519
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:52,540
 He broke his ankle.

1520
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:54,440
 He had to cancel all the shows this weekend.

1521
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:56,620
 And then, of course, he canceled the podcast.

1522
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:59,820
 So I only know from a couple of text exchanges that he's doing okay.

1523
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:00,540
 He's on the mend.

1524
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:00,680
 Okay.

1525
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:04,020
 I remember distinctly.

1526
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:08,280
 It really hit me again yesterday when I read this news,

1527
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:09,420
 and they had to cancel shows.

1528
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:17,440
 I remember distinctly on, I believe it was March 12th of 2020,

1529
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,220
 right before the shit hit the fan.

1530
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:19,900
 Yeah.

1531
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:20,120
 Okay.

1532
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:22,520
 And I was talking with one of the bartenders at Absinthe,

1533
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:26,220
 and we were talking because, you know,

1534
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:29,400
 there were rumors of things having to go on pause for a moment.

1535
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,060
 Yeah.

1536
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:30,980
 We didn't know it was up.

1537
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:34,640
 And I said, well, I'll tell you this.

1538
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:38,360
 I just found out that Penn and Teller have put their show,

1539
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:39,080
 it was on hiatus.

1540
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:42,560
 And there has to be some real shit for that to happen.

1541
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,760
 So I think things are coming down.

1542
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:50,380
 And sure enough, the next, like, day and a half later, kaboom.

1543
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:51,020
 Yeah.

1544
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:52,560
 They were a little bit ahead of the curve.

1545
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:53,880
 But then it all turned out to be fine.

1546
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,100
 Yeah, no, everything was great.

1547
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:55,800
 Everything was great.

1548
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:57,360
 Paul, as usual, was incorrect about that.

1549
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,920
 Everything's just been up, up, up, up, up since then.

1550
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:00,500
 That's right.

1551
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:02,620
 Turned out it was a hoax.

1552
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:03,540
 Yep.

1553
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:05,120
 And we're not still dealing with it.

1554
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,600
 Yeah, me and my negative Nancy thinking, well, I mean.

1555
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:07,760
 That's right.

1556
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:11,080
 I am a little concerned that I could explode at any minute,

1557
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,180
 having had many vaccines and updates.

1558
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:14,460
 But whatever.

1559
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:18,140
 But the government's following your every move now that it has,

1560
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:19,020
 you know, microscopic robots.

1561
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:19,500
 That's true.

1562
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,380
 I do have lots of tracers in here.

1563
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:23,520
 I'm basically a walking air tag.

1564
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,940
 So.

1565
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:27,240
 I've said that about you for years.

1566
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:33,520
 We're getting a shout out here.

1567
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:37,900
 Hey, Paul, Nick's son is playing basketball in Madison County

1568
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:38,260
 tonight.

1569
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:39,700
 Go Eagles beat the Indians.

1570
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:40,600
 Let's go.

1571
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:41,540
 Go for it.

1572
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:41,760
 Yeah.

1573
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:42,380
 Beat the Indians.

1574
01:23:42,380 --> 01:23:43,780
 Of course, they're still the Indians.

1575
01:23:43,780 --> 01:23:45,300
 We're not going to change that.

1576
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:50,680
 Of course, my fucking alma mater, Madison Central Indians are still

1577
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:51,160
 the Indians.

1578
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:52,320
 Good Lord.

1579
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:57,100
 I will say it did give me that one wonderful moment when and

1580
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:58,980
 John has told the story before, I think, too.

1581
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:03,200
 But, you know, I had I was able to during a homecoming parade,

1582
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:07,740
 the Latin club, I chained up my brother to a giant.

1583
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:12,000
 That paper mache rock and because we were the Latin club and we did the

1584
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,640
 the myth of who is it that brought fire to the to the.

1585
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:16,920
 Yeah.

1586
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:17,660
 Prometheus.

1587
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:18,460
 Prometheus.

1588
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:18,820
 That's it.

1589
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:25,420
 So and he was cursed to have a vulture liver out or an eagle eat his liver

1590
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:25,800
 every night.

1591
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:35,080
 So we dressed John up as the opposing team chained to a rock and us with a

1592
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,140
 hatchet like an Indian hatchet.

1593
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:49,740
 I got to drive my brother getting his liver chopped by another football

1594
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:56,380
 player down the main street of Madison County, Richmond, Kentucky.

1595
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:57,900
 That was a fucking highlight.

1596
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:58,600
 Yeah.

1597
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:00,240
 John says he's not in show business.

1598
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:02,620
 That's a starring role.

1599
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:05,160
 That goes on the resume.

1600
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:06,480
 That better be on his resume somewhere.

1601
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:07,320
 It should be.

1602
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:07,620
 Yeah.

1603
01:25:07,620 --> 01:25:10,420
 Opposing team Prometheus.

1604
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:14,260
 I have another list here.

1605
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:15,880
 Another modest list here, Jacob.

1606
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:20,920
 Are we we're figuring out what's going on with with the with the list thing.

1607
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:21,240
 But yeah.

1608
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:21,780
 OK.

1609
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:22,860
 We're going to keep on thanking people.

1610
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:23,340
 All right.

1611
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:25,460

01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:46,160
 Mastrangelo.

1676
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:47,400
 We should have switched lists, Jacob.

1677
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:48,200
 I had that one down.

1678
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:48,880
 We should have.

1679
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:49,920
 Mastrangelo.

1680
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:50,600
 That's it.

1681
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:56,080
 I hear these names and know them, but then you see them and you just have no idea how

1682
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:56,300
 to say them.

1683
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:56,460
 You're on the spot.

1684
01:27:56,460 --> 01:27:57,120
 You're on the spot.

1685
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:01,500
 Oh, this is the Wednesday episode, yeah?

1686
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:03,360
 So this goes out Thursday, is that right?

1687
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:03,820
 Or Wednesday?

1688
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:04,300
 That's right.

1689
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:04,340
 That's right.

1690
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:04,860
 All right.

1691
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:06,660
 So I want to.

1692
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:06,700
 All right.

1693
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:06,720
 All right.

1694
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:14,620
 So to give a heads up to Scoops, we're aiming for a Friday night Zoom hang, 9.30 EST, my

1695
01:28:14,620 --> 01:28:15,040
 time.

1696
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:21,240
 So it'll be 7.30 on the West Coast, but then we'll go for a couple hours of playing some

1697
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:22,500
 games and hanging out and chatting.

1698
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:24,320
 You said that'll be Friday, Paul?

1699
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,320
 That'll be Friday night.

1700
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:26,940
 Friday, January 23rd.

1701
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:27,580
 That is correct.

1702
01:28:27,580 --> 01:28:29,560
 Friday, January 23rd, this coming week.

1703
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:36,660
 And I will send out the invites through Patreon shortly after our second recording here.

1704
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:38,340
 And try and get that all squared away.

1705
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:40,280
 Leon is coming aboard.

1706
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:43,100
 Thank you, Leon, to help lead us through some games.

1707
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:44,840
 It's going to be a real fun night.

1708
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:46,260
 Yeah, we're all going to have a good time.

1709
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:48,700
 These hangouts have been exceptionally fun.

1710
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:50,420
 So I'm looking forward to it.

1711
01:28:50,420 --> 01:28:54,400
 And please hop on board and join us on Friday night.

1712
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,620
 And I don't have to.

1713
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:56,940
 I'm on vacation right now.

1714
01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:58,040
 So I don't have to work.

1715
01:28:58,040 --> 01:28:59,740
 I don't have to worry about getting up early.

1716
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:03,120
 So I'll be well rested and feeling bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

1717
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:03,440
 Who knows?

1718
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:04,960
 I might go for a while playing games.

1719
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:05,420
 Who knows?

1720
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:06,560
 And hopefully.

1721
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:11,500
 Hopefully Matt and Jacob can drop by at some point in the evening, even just to say hi.

1722
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:12,460
 Yeah.

1723
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:13,580
 When is it?

1724
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:18,040
 It's going to be Friday night, 7.30 your time starting.

1725
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:23,360
 I will be performing a show in Cincinnati, I believe.

1726
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:23,920
 There you go.

1727
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:25,240
 Yeah.

1728
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:25,840
 Oh, yeah.

1729
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:28,380
 That's why we're doing a double today is because Matt can't do it on Friday.

1730
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:29,080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1731
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:30,880
 So January 23rd, I'm in Lexington.

1732
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,600
 January 24th, Cincinnati.

1733
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,980
 January 25th, Bloomington, Indiana.

1734
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:36,580
 Then August 15th, I'm in Lexington.

1735
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:36,640
 Then August 15th, I'm in Lexington.

1736
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:37,580
 Then August 15th, I'm off to Chicago.

1737
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:40,060
 And January 27th, I'm playing at a comedy club there.

1738
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:42,060
 28th, Green Bay, Wisconsin.

1739
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:43,760
 29th, Madison, Wisconsin.

1740
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,320
 And January 30th, Milwaukee.

1741
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:49,300
 And January 31st, Wabash, Indiana.

1742
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:52,780
 I'll also give a shout-out to the 31st.

1743
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:54,200
 That's Saturday the 31st.

1744
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:59,400
 Myself and my friend Sarah are going to be teaching my free improv workshop that night.

1745
01:29:59,400 --> 01:29:59,700
 Oh, nice.

1746
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:02,700
 And I've already put the stuff up on Scoop Group and whatnot.

1747
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:06,480
 Appreciate everybody retweeting and sending out the word to people you might know.

1748
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:10,920
 If you're in the area or you might even find yourself traveling to the area,

1749
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:16,540
 it's out there near Pittsburgh in, oh, what's the place called?

1750
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:18,720
 I can't remember the name of the crazy little town.

1751
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:22,180
 But, yeah, look it up online.

1752
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:23,020
 It's right there.

1753
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:24,240
 It's on Scoop Group and whatnot.

1754
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:28,840
 But it's free class, two hours of fun with me and Sarah teaching some improv.

1755
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:31,040
 Come check us out.

1756
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:31,660
 Hang out.

1757
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:32,400
 Come see me.

1758
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:33,360
 It'll be great times.

1759
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:36,020
 Remember, there are no bad things that happen in improv.

1760
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:36,300
 Okay.

1761
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:36,500
 Bye-bye.

1762
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:36,600
 Bye-bye.

1763
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:36,620
 Bye-bye.

1764
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:37,380
 Lonely gifts.

1765
01:30:37,380 --> 01:30:39,700
 Thanks for listening, everybody.

1766
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:42,120
 Stay safe out there, and we'll see you soon.

1767
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:44,280
 We'll see you soon.

1768
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:56,040
 I am hoping the weather holds for these next couple of weeks.

1769
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:58,860
 It's going to be kind of crazy out here.

1770
01:31:06,580 --> 01:31:21,500
 I am hoping the weather holds for these next couple of weeks.

1771
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:21,540
 I am hoping the weather holds for these next couple of weeks.

1772
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:21,560
 I am hoping the weather holds for these next couple of weeks.

1773
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:21,600
 I am hoping the weather holds for these next couple of weeks.

1774
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:21,640
 I am hoping the weather holds for these next couple of weeks.

1775
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:21,680
 I am hoping the weather holds for these next couple of weeks.

1776
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:21,940
 I am hoping the weather holds for these next couple of weeks.
