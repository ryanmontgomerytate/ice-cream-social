1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
 Oh hello there, I'm so glad you're here, it's time to thank the Ice Cream Truck Drivers.

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,440

 Now here's the show.

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,600
 Hey Johnny, do you wanna go to an Ice Cream Social?

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,600
 I do.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,600
 Yeah, I'd love to.

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,600
 Great, let's go!

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:54,600
 It's a bank show, it's the day after the bucket show, here we are, home at it and still in

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,600
 town.

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,360
 We're in town, it's time for Matt Madley's Ice Cream Social, sitting over there, it's

17
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:07,240
 Paul Madley, sitting over there, it's Matt Donnelly, sitting over here, it's Shakeup

18
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,240
 the Audio Guy.

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,240
 Can I get you to 8.8?

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,240
 We're PreachingFun.

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,240
 Maybe.

22
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,240
 No, this is Stopgap.

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,240
 Yeah, this is churn, stopgap.

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,240
 Churn, stopgap.

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:25,160
 Stopgap, churn, you make me wanna stop my truck and fuck you.

26
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,160
 Stopgap churn.

27
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,480
 Oh, I knew it was roomy.

28
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,800
 I don't know what to talk about first, whether we had a good bucket show or not, or that

29
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,280
 Paul gave my children porn, I don't know which one we should dive into first.

30
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,880
 I would say let's start with the bucket show and let's billboard Paul giving your children

31
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,880
 porn.

32
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,880
 Fine.

33
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:54,120
 I'll take it, I'm no prude.

34
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,400
 I feel like that was shots fired at my direction.

35
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,960
 Oh yeah, there were, there were definitely shots fired.

36
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,560
 Now I'm gonna talk about it, now we're gonna talk about it.

37
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,560
 Okay.

38
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,560
 Now it's out there.

39
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,920
 Why'd you give Matt's kids, Paul?

40
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,680
 So I got to go to visit Ralph's, which is my favorite comic book shop in the world and

41
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,040
 got to talk to my buddy.

42
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,040
 He's doing good.

43
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,280
 Don't miss Ralph out at Alternate Reality Comics.

44
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,600
 It is the hot spot for the comic bookage out there in Vegas.

45
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,880
 And I got Keeler, Keeler is very into comic books right now.

46
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,600
 I got him some books last time, got him some Fantastic Fours, and he's got a couple of old

47
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,040
 Guardians of the Galaxy.

48
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,080
 So we were looking for maybe get some more of those Guardians of the Galaxies, that kind

49
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,880
 of thing.

50
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,880
 Ralph did not have those.

51
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,880
 Fucking Ralph.

52
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,720
 No, they're a little harder to come by.

53
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,720
 Fucking Ralph.

54
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,680
 But he did have a copy of Infinity Gauntlet, the trade.

55
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,680
 So I grabbed that.

56
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,680
 Okay, Ralph.

57
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,400
 Because that's a key thing that Keeler needs to check out because like, and I, you know,

58
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,480
 it's been a minute since I reread that story, but Mephisto plays a role in that.

59
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,480
 And that's the new--

60
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,480
 From He-Man?

61
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,480
 No.

62
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,800
 This is not, by the way, where the story's going.

63
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,080
 Paul's just doing a recap of all the comics that Keeler bought.

64
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,720
 It's not Fisting Porn that he gave you?

65
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
 And then I bought him--

66
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,600
 If he gave your son Fisting Porn.

67
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,960
 What was the other one?

68
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,120
 You haven't gotten the latest issue of The Angry Goose?

69
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
 I got him--

70
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
 The pissed off Goose.

71
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
 The All-Star Superman.

72
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,120
 You're waiting for the trades to come out?

73
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,120
 You don't want to get it?

74
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,440
 Those spoilers, please.

75
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,240
 Angry Goose game is hot shit.

76
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:38,240
 No, I got him the All-Star Superman new mini trade.

77
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,240
 And that's the pornography?

78
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,240
 No.

79
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,240
 Oh, okay.

80
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:46,800
 Then I went to the 50 cent bin because I love to raid me some old comics because you can

81
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
 find some gold.

82
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
 I found a--

83
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
 Early 2000--

84
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,320
 Savage Dragon number one, Minty Fresh, a bunch of stuff like that.

85
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,640
 I got him some Rob, Batman, and Robin.

86
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,080
 You're just going to do Rinner Corridor to this bank episode twice, one where Paul tells

87
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,800
 his version first and one where I tell my version first.

88
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
 Right.

89
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
 Yeah.

90
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
 It's going to be great.

91
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
 And then the audience can decide which one they want to listen to first.

92
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,320
 And then I see there's a copy of Powers.

93
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,320
 Okay.

94
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,320
 Here you go.

95
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,320
 One of my all-time favorite books.

96
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,320
 Powers.

97
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
 Brian Michael Bendis.

98
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,320
 Kyle Austin.

99
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,760
 Brian Michael A. von Ohming, whose artwork I love and follow through a bunch of different

100
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,760
 books.

101
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,760
 So--

102
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,360
 Do they have any particular styles to their artwork?

103
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,800
 It's very angular.

104
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
 Okay.

105
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
 It's very angular.

106
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,600
 So I think Batman Beyond.

107
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,040
 Right now I'm thinking of the movie Heavy Metal.

108
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,200
 That's what I'm picturing right now.

109
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,200
 More Batman Beyond.

110
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
 Okay.

111
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
 You know Batman Beyond?

112
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
 You familiar with that?

113
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
 Kind of very, very angular.

114
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,480
 It's almost Bruce Timm.

115
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,960
 Oh, Bruce Timm.

116
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
 Sure.

117
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,960
 Sure.

118
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,960
 Sure.

119
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,960
 It's very Bruce Timmian.

120
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,960
 Great.

121
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,960
 Michael A. von Ohming stuff.

122
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,760
 Anyway, I pick up that book and I'm like, oh, great, Powers.

123
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,320
 And it's a newer issue, newer in that it probably came out 10 years ago.

124
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,800
 And you were like, Matt's children need to be introduced to Powers.

125
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,240
 I was like, Powers is such a good book.

126
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,800
 This is the guy who invented the Miles Morales Spider-Man, which my kids love.

127
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
 Yes.

128
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
 That's the Spider-Verse Miles Morales.

129
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
 Okay.

130
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,720
 Brian Michael Bendis did Ultimate Spider-Man back in the day, reinvigorated the character

131
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,520
 in whole huge ways.

132
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,280
 And he is a juggernaut of--

133
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,560
 I still haven't seen that second movie.

134
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,560
 --comic stuff.

135
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,560
 The first one was so good.

136
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,800
 I just never got around to seeing the second one.

137
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,360
 And he's deep with that movie, too.

138
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,880
 He was big in-- I think he had a--

139
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,520
 It's one of the only movies where the multiverse really just is the plot and works.

140
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,640
 You're like, oh, this is just a really well-earned use of multiverse.

141
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,640
 Oh, did you not see the Dr. Strange?

142
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,640
 What was that?

143
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,640
 Which one was that?

144
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,640
 It was the Dr. Strange.

145
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,640
 Yeah, I saw all of them.

146
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,640
 Yeah, yeah.

147
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,640
 First, I saw Dr. Strange.

148
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,640
 And then I saw Dr. Strange from Google.

149
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
 Yeah, that was good.

150
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,040
 And then finally came back, Dr. Strange, like, guys, seriously, though, you won't believe

151
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,040
 it.

152
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
 Dr. Strange.

153
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
 Lots of places.

154
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:04,720
 Dr. Strange and the Net Full of Jello.

155
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,320
 So I get it.

156
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,720
 And I've got a couple other books.

157
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
 And then we're heading out.

158
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,160
 That's Paul's brothers, by the way.

159
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,440
 Paul's brothers in the house, by the way.

160
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,440
 Oh, yes, honks here.

161
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
 Yeah.

162
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,920
 And so I bought these books for Keeler.

163
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
 And then I'm handing them over.

164
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,720
 And then I'm like, oh, wait a minute.

165
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
 Sometimes--

166
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,480
 No, we got in the car.

167
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,480
 Comic book's in hand.

168
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,480
 Everything's purchased.

169
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,480
 Matt has had enough.

170
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,480
 Paul turns to me and goes, oh, there might be boobies in one of those comics.

171
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,440
 I hope that's OK.

172
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,440
 OK.

173
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,400
 Are the kids with you?

174
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,400
 What am I going to do?

175
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

176
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
 What am I going to do?

177
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,400
 Turn around, yank it out of his hand, go back into the comic book store.

178
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,360
 If I knew it was to the 50 cent bin, maybe it would have been more of an option than

179
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,360
 I thought.

180
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,000
 But I was like, well, there's no turning back now.

181
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 We live here now.

182
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 We live here now.

183
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,360
 This is the multipurpose that we currently live in.

184
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,720
 I'm not upset that he did it.

185
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,520
 I'm upset at the sequence of events.

186
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,480
 But I sequenced it out of my head in the wrong way, too, because I just didn't remember.

187
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:10,200
 I was like, oh, yeah, there's some-- but it's very like circle with another circle on it.

188
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,080
 It's very like happy face eyeball.

189
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,640
 Paul, some of the great graphics of the boob.

190
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,920
 My son has to understand that the main character in the very first page is at a strip club.

191
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:27,240
 And I have to let him take in that plot point and just figure out how he's living his life.

192
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,960
 Look, my kids are being raised in Las Vegas.

193
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,160
 They pass little darlings billboards all the time.

194
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,160
 That's right.

195
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,760
 There was a moment at the Bucket Show last night where I think Jonathan stopped the show

196
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,040
 just to make sure that everyone knew that those two kids in the front row were your

197
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
 kids.

198
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
 Yes.

199
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,320
 It was like, everybody, I need you to know something, there are two children up here.

200
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,080
 They're Matt's children.

201
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,080
 They're fine.

202
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,720
 Jonathan made some real hay about them in the front row.

203
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,560
 It was like, why do you bring these children to this R-rated show?

204
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,520
 At one point he went to duct tape Hilliard's eyes.

205
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,520
 Oh, good.

206
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,520
 Well, it was funny.

207
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,560
 The last Bucket Show-- and we'll get back to-- there's no way to go back to it.

208
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,760
 Basically, I was just like, the sequence of events is before you hand my child the thing,

209
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,080
 think is there boobies in it.

210
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,760
 The second thing is then ask me before you purchase so that I can get cool dad points.

211
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
 Right.

212
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
 You're right.

213
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,880
 Instead, Paul just put me in a position to just be an impotent fuddy duddy.

214
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,880
 Right.

215
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,880
 There's no way I was going to stop.

216
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,040
 And I won.

217
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,920
 I won completely because then we pulled up to another-- we pulled up to another comic

218
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,920
 shop.

219
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,280
 Paul, what did you win?

220
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,700
 I'll tell you what I won.

221
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,580
 We pulled up to another comic shop and we're getting ready to hop out of the car.

222
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,000
 And I was like-- I was kind of half apologizing.

223
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,040
 I may have overstepped there.

224
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,120
 I didn't really recall that there are boobs, possibly boobs, but I think it's fine and

225
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,120
 dandy.

226
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,120
 Age one.

227
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,120
 He's got to learn.

228
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,120
 He's got to learn some time.

229
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,120
 It's fine.

230
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,120
 That's what I want.

231
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,720
 I want old Uncle Paul to be in charge of my child's sexual awakening.

232
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
 If he ain't awake now--

233
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,720
 He's got to learn some time.

234
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,720
 Yes.

235
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,720
 If he ain't awake yet, it ain't happening.

236
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
 He's 12.

237
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,720
 I'm sure he has membership to--

238
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
 He's awake.

239
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
 He's awake.

240
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
 Yeah.

241
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
 He's awake.

242
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
 That's awful.

243
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,720
 Yeah.

244
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
 He's got his own OnlyFans.

245
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,280
 He's got a subscription to Jugg's Magazine.

246
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
 Jugg's Magazine.

247
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
 Nudie magazine day.

248
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
 Nudie magazine day.

249
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,320
 Dad, do you mind if I get the mail?

250
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,320
 Any discrete packages for me?

251
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
 Just go get the mail.

252
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,120
 I'm looking for a rather discrete package.

253
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,240
 Hey, but it's been a huge help having you get the mail.

254
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
 Oh, yeah, sure.

255
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
 Yeah, yeah.

256
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
 I love to do it.

257
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,040
 I camp out there now just to make sure I don't miss the mailman.

258
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,920
 We're good friends, he and I. Can you imagine--

259
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,560
 He brings me comic books.

260
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,560
 Can you imagine--

261
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,560
 Just the man with a wink like, here you go, pal.

262
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,800
 Some good editorials in the back.

263
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,280
 Here's another issue of Powish for you.

264
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,360
 Boy, these circles really kind of look like tits.

265
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,920
 You won't believe it.

266
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,320
 These circles are so fucked up.

267
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,440
 Now, every time he goes to get any basketball or soccer ball in the garage, he bunches.

268
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,440
 Oh, no.

269
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
 Forget it.

270
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,440
 Yeah.

271
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,160
 It's a very basic shape with sexuality.

272
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,120
 He gets a protractor out and he's like, "Oh, it's roundish, bwaaang."

273
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,120
 Yeah.

274
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,120
 No, I fucked up.

275
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,120
 No, but--

276
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,640
 Boy's 12, so he still yells bwaaang every time.

277
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,640
 Bwaaang.

278
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
 Bwaaang.

279
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,640
 I raise it.

280
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
 We have to communicate in our household.

281
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
 Bwaaang.

282
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,720
 When you're 12, it makes that sound.

283
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,200
 It is that strong.

284
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,040
 Oh, I miss it.

285
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
 I know, right?

286
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,040
 Those were the days.

287
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
 Now he goes, "Bwaaang, bwaaang, bwaaang."

288
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:36,040
 See, the whole time I thought something was wrong with Matt's car.

289
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,800
 Turns out there was a sexual awakening happening.

290
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,800
 I also was reading Powers.

291
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,800
 Bwaaang, bwaaang, bwaaang.

292
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:46,360
 I already fished out a few of my copies in 50 Cent Den, but they were in another section.

293
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:52,180
 But we're hopping into this new comic shop to go browse around a little bit more.

294
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,720
 I was like, "Yeah, you know, I'm sorry.

295
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,720
 I might have overstepped."

296
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,760
 But I really was like, "He's got to learn sometimes.

297
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,760
 It's fine."

298
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,280
 It's just a round little boob.

299
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,280
 Both?

300
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,480
 You're ping-ponging between two incorrect things.

301
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,420
 But then Matt's like, "It's fine.

302
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,420
 He can have it.

303
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,420
 No problem."

304
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,420
 Which is great.

305
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,420
 What other choice did I have?

306
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,420
 Right.

307
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,420
 You're done now.

308
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,480
 Then Keeler goes, "I'm trading for Paul as my dad."

309
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,960
 And I said, "You are going to regret that decision so quickly."

310
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,880
 I said, "But you are going to enjoy your meals more."

311
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,880
 Yeah.

312
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,880
 Yeah, yeah.

313
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,880
 Yeah.

314
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,880
 You're going to love the food.

315
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,880
 The food plan?

316
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,880
 Top notch.

317
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,040
 Cologne and cheese, hot dogs, mac and cheese.

318
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,040
 Top notch.

319
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,040
 Forget about it.

320
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,040
 Pizza?

321
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,800
 Every day, if we want it, who cares?

322
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,800
 But that soccer game?

323
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,800
 No.

324
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,800
 Forget about it.

325
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
 No, no, no.

326
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,800
 What time does it start?

327
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
 What time?

328
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,800
 No, no, no.

329
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,800
 How hot will it be?

330
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,800
 No, we're not doing that.

331
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,800
 Oh, no.

332
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,800
 Will I sit in the sun?

333
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,800
 In a folding chair?

334
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,800
 You want me to coach what?

335
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,800
 Eat shit.

336
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
 A plasticky folding chair?

337
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
 Here.

338
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,800
 Here's two Game Boys.

339
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
 Leave me alone forever.

340
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:01,160
 And then we were in the second comic shop, and when I stayed away by the near shot, he

341
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:07,040
 turned to the guy who works there, he goes, "Do you have anything more adult?"

342
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,880
 And he slid a $5 bill across the...

343
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:15,400
 Do you have any of those Tijuana Bibles where Mickey's like really slipping it to all kinds

344
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
 of kids?

345
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
 You got any books?

346
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,200
 You got some Tijuana Bibles back there?

347
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,440
 Because that's what I really...

348
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,440
 I'm hungry for that poor art.

349
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,920
 I didn't think we were going to get an episode title out of this story.

350
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,920
 You're familiar with Tijuana Bibles, aren't you?

351
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,920
 I know what you're talking about.

352
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,920
 Yeah, yeah.

353
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,920
 Yeah.

354
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,920
 I've never heard them called that.

355
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,920
 I'm not familiar with the term.

356
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,640
 So a Tijuana Bible is a bootleg comic usually involving big brand name characters doing

357
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,440
 pornographic things.

358
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,440
 And it's...

359
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,360
 They're usually published out of Mexico.

360
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
 Mickey Mouse fucking Cinderella.

361
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,360
 Yes, exactly.

362
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,360
 And so...

363
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,360
 Where is it?

364
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,360
 Where can I do this?

365
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,360
 Instead of us, see?

366
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
 Oh, boy.

367
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,360
 We've peaked visit.

368
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
 Oh, it's like I was young again.

369
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,360
 Holy shit.

370
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,360
 Fuck me.

371
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
 Oh, Tijuana Bibles.

372
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,360
 No one call me up to the chalkboard to solve some math.

373
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
 Oh, no.

374
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:05,360
 I'll just be back here with my inconspicuously wrapped package.

375
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,400
 Nothing to see here, Mrs. Johnson.

376
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,120
 Oh, I got a divorce mini.

377
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,880
 I'm back, Mickey.

378
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,520
 Paul cemented his love with my children.

379
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,520
 Yeah.

380
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,520
 I'm sorry if I'm cutting off Paul's narrating of a Tijuana Bible porn.

381
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,080
 I was telling a dumb joke.

382
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,080
 It's...

383
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,080
 It's...

384
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,080
 It's...

385
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,080
 It's...

386
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,080
 It's...

387
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
 It's...

388
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,080
 It's...

389
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,080
 It's...

390
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,080
 It's...

391
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
 It's...

392
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,080
 It's...

393
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
 It's...

394
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
 It's...

395
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
 It's...

396
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,080
 It's...

397
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
 It's...

398
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,080
 It's...

399
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
 It's...

400
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
 It's...

401
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
 It's...

402
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,080
 It's...

403
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,080
 It's...

404
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,080
 It's...

405
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,080
 It's...

406
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,080
 It's...

407
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,080
 It's...

408
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,080
 It's...

409
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,080
 It's...

410
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,080
 Mickey goes up to Donald.

411
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,080
 I got a scratchy Funko pop for my other child.

412
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,080
 Yeah.

413
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,080
 Keeler's not so much on the reading tip right now.

414
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,560
 I feel your pain of your children loving Paul more.

415
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,560
 Right.

416
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,120
 Because Uncle Paul is fun uncle.

417
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,120
 Yeah.

418
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,120
 You know?

419
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,120
 He's like, you know, no limits.

420
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
 He knows his job.

421
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
 He's no limits.

422
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,120
 Yeah.

423
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,120
 Yes.

424
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,120
 No limits.

425
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,120
 Well, because I am still there.

426
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,120
 Right.

427
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,120
 What?

428
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,120
 No.

429
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,120
 Yeah.

430
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,120
 What?

431
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,120
 I'm still there.

432
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,120
 What are you talking about?

433
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,120
 Peter Pan.

434
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,120
 Yeah.

435
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,120
 Do do do.

436
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,120
 Fly me to Neverland.

437
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,400
 This is what Peter Pan really looks like.

438
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
 Yep.

439
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,400
 Yep.

440
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,400
 Yep.

441
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,400
 Yep.

442
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
 I am...

443
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,400
 Paul has a habit...

444
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,400
 Sorry, Wendy.

445
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,400
 Paul has a habit...

446
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,400
 He's wearing green tights.

447
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:41,400
 ...of giving gifts to people, like, of things that he likes and therefore things you want.

448
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
 Well, like...

449
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,400
 Yes.

450
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,040
 Most people who don't have children don't understand, like, how different they are from

451
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,040
 year to year...

452
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,040
 Yes.

453
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,040
 ...in terms of what they can and can't watch or take in or whatever.

454
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,040
 Yeah.

455
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,040
 But Paul got your...

456
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,040
 Yeah.

457
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,200
 So I was explaining this to you last night.

458
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,520
 So when Eve was two, for Christmas...

459
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,960
 He always sends stuff for Christmas.

460
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,960
 Yeah.

461
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,960
 Sure.

462
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,960
 Which is great.

463
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
 Yeah.

464
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,960
 It's awesome.

465
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,700
 And he sent the entire DVD full collection of Looney Tunes.

466
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:15,360
 And he's like, "Now you and Eve can, like, watch all the Looney Tunes."

467
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,800
 And I'm like, "Great.

468
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,800
 She's two."

469
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,360
 And I'm like, "There is no understanding."

470
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,560
 She's not going to use sign language for more Looney Tunes.

471
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
 No.

472
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,560
 Yeah.

473
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,560
 She's like...

474
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,560
 Yeah.

475
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,560
 Yeah.

476
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,560
 But...

477
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,560
 I want more food.

478
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,560
 I need to be burped.

479
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,560
 Yes.

480
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,560
 Also, can we watch all of Looney Tunes?

481
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,560
 Yeah.

482
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,560
 Right?

483
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,560
 But now, almost 10 years later...

484
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,560
 [gibberish]

485
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,560
 Hello, Eve.

486
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,560
 [gibberish]

487
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,560
 What was that?

488
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,560
 That was the Tasmanian Devil.

489
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,560
 Thank you.

490
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,560
 That was the Tasmanian Devil.

491
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,560
 Man.

492
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,560
 Okay.

493
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,720
 That was better than his Donald Duck and you still don't know why everything's better than

494
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,720
 my Donald Duck.

495
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,720
 We'll let the listeners decide.

496
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
 We'll let the listeners decide.

497
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,720
 Do you think anybody's still listening?

498
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
 No.

499
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
 But then...

500
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,720
 But...

501
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
 But it comes around.

502
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,720
 Yeah.

503
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,520
 So, almost 10 years later, Shelly was out of town, and I had the girls.

504
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,520
 And I was like, "All right.

505
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,280
 We're going to have movie night.

506
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,880
 And let's go rummage through my old DVDs and see what we found."

507
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,880
 Okay.

508
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,880
 Because I was like, "We're going to watch The Three Amigos."

509
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,800
 And so I was like, "I'm going to introduce you to the great Singing Bush."

510
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
 It's all of it.

511
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,800
 Yeah, yeah.

512
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
 Just a plethora of wonders.

513
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,800
 Great movie.

514
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,800
 A plethora.

515
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,960
 And so we go through there, and we find it.

516
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:36,240
 But on the way to finding the Three Amigos DVD, we also found the box edition set of Looney

517
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,240
 Tunes.

518
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,400
 And they know Looney Tunes at this point.

519
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
 They've seen a few.

520
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,480
 And they're like, "Oh," and they flip their shit.

521
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,620
 And we watched Looney Tunes, and I introduced them to the Coyote Roadrunners for the first

522
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,620
 time.

523
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:52,680
 And it was one of the greatest nostalgic, awesome moments with my kid.

524
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,680
 Because they're freaking cackling.

525
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,680
 Chuck Jones, baby.

526
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,240
 And it's the best.

527
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,920
 So it comes around.

528
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
 But I hear you're...

529
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,280
 The listeners are familiar with the amount of movies that Paul says I should watch with

530
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,600
 my kids that are just not appropriate.

531
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
 Just not appropriate.

532
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,480
 It's the same thing with my kids.

533
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,840
 To be fair to me, I made a big list of movies I thought could be appropriate for the last

534
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,920
 time Honk brought the girls out.

535
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,960
 And we've landed on Back to the Future.

536
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,360
 Oh, and it crushed.

537
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,360
 It did, right?

538
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,360
 It crushed.

539
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,360
 She's still loving it, right?

540
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,360
 It crushed.

541
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,360
 Eve was like...

542
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,360
 Eve's in that...

543
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,360
 She's 11.

544
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:29,600
 So she's now starting in that area of being able to understand the uncomfortable humor.

545
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:37,360
 And so when Marty's mom is hitting on Marty, she was, I mean, contorted in the chair.

546
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,200
 But it's a testament to how good that movie is.

547
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,200
 It makes you feel some shit.

548
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,840
 And to how much incest still affects people.

549
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:52,960
 And I guess how healthy your children's internet porn searches will be, since that seems in

550
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,360
 vogue on the internet.

551
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,360
 It's everywhere.

552
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,400
 It's so bizarre.

553
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
 But that's good.

554
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,840
 Because she's still like, have you done the follow-ups yet?

555
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,640
 We haven't done any of the follow-ups yet.

556
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
 Yeah.

557
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,640
 But...

558
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,640
 Well, that's great.

559
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,640
 We should.

560
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,640
 For sure.

561
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,160
 Nora was still a little too freaked out when the Libyans came and shot up Doc Brown.

562
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,160
 She was out.

563
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,160
 She's like, "Oh, that's too much for me.

564
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,160
 I'm good."

565
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,160
 She's gone.

566
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,160
 She's like, "Nope."

567
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,880
 But Eve stuck through and really enjoyed the Libyans.

568
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,920
 But yes, I would definitely at this point have shown, had I had children, they would

569
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,680
 have seen way more inappropriate material than being supposed to, way more inappropriate

570
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,680
 stuff.

571
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:35,560
 Now, John, how much are you looking forward to next year, Paul bringing your then 12-year-old

572
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,560
 pornography?

573
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:42,560
 Are you looking forward to this, or do you have a little trepidation here?

574
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,640
 As long as the quality is a little higher than eyeball boobs, maybe it's okay.

575
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,640
 Circle on a circle?

576
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,640
 Yeah.

577
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,640
 All right.

578
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,640
 All right.

579
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,640
 Well, but I mean, he's sort of...

580
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:57,960
 You've given some stuff, like a couple years ago, you gave her the entire ElfQuest series.

581
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,960
 Right.

582
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:09,280
 Now, that's not super out there, but it's a little more violent and mature for my 10-year-old.

583
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,280
 But my girl's there...

584
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,280
 I guess the mall seems a little brutal.

585
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,280
 ElfQuest.

586
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,880
 Eve is a voracious reader.

587
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,800
 That's why I got it for her.

588
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,800
 She does not stop.

589
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,800
 Now.

590
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,800
 And she really loved it.

591
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
 She will read anything.

592
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,120
 And so she devoured it.

593
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,120
 She loved it.

594
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,120
 Yeah.

595
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,120
 It's a big volume.

596
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,800
 To the point she reads so much that she will oftentimes come and she'll just be talking

597
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,640
 to us, and then she'll say a word weird.

598
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,240
 You know what she's saying, but she pronounces it weird because she's just read it.

599
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,240
 She's only seen it.

600
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,440
 She's only read it, and then she's read it as it's phonetically spelled or whatever.

601
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,200
 And then she'll come and she'll say it, and then we sort of laugh, and then she gets mad.

602
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,200
 And we're like, "No, no.

603
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,320
 It's crazy that you know these words, and it's pronounced like this."

604
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,320
 And she's like, "Oh, okay.

605
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,320
 Well, it looks like this."

606
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,960
 I've had a hard time explaining to my youngers, basically, I don't know how to... busting

607
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,960
 chops.

608
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,960
 When we laugh at the thing that you're known for, we're not trying to hurt your feelings

609
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,960
 or ridicule you.

610
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
 We're not trying to make fun of you.

611
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,900
 Maybe that's the thing, because early on here, it continues through your whole life.

612
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:16,400
 But within funny people, it's love language.

613
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,400
 And that's the thing.

614
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:24,200
 As soon as we're on that group chat with Jonathan and Brad, and Brad starts busting my balls,

615
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,640
 I'm like, "I'm fine."

616
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,000
 I'm like, "We're good.

617
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Nope.

618
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 We're going to have a great show.

619
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,320
 I got nothing to worry about here.

620
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,440
 He feels comfortable giving me shit.

621
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,880
 That's all I need out of a comedy partner.

622
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,000
 That's it."

623
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,600
 But I guess it just takes a little while to know, to learn that.

624
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,560
 But maybe you can explain it to them like that, that it is love language.

625
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,600
 Yeah, we're trying to.

626
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
 I know.

627
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
 It's hard.

628
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,400
 In the moment, it's still like, it's like, "Urgh."

629
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,600
 Well, when it's the first time, right, when it's the first time you've ever been called

630
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,400
 out on something silly, and you go, "Oh."

631
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
 Yeah, yeah.

632
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
 I take it great every time.

633
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,400
 But also-

634
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,040
 We're going to talk about the bucket show in a minute.

635
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:09,760
 Thank fuck he can feel a little bit of shame, because that's what's wrong with the world.

636
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,120
 Nobody feels shame anymore.

637
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,120
 That's funny.

638
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,120
 That's true.

639
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,120
 You know?

640
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,120
 It's a control thing.

641
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,120
 Sure.

642
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,120
 You're not in control.

643
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,120
 Sure.

644
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,120
 You're not in control of people's narrative of you.

645
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,120
 And it can be a little jarring.

646
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,560
 I'm like, "Oh, shoot.

647
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,800
 This is how people talk about me, and I can't do anything about it."

648
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,120
 It also depends on their age.

649
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,120
 Oh, for sure.

650
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,120
 I don't know if you've noticed that.

651
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:35,080
 Because when they're younger, it's just ... But now, my oldest is reaching an age where her

652
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,520
 appearance is becoming more important to her, and the way she ... You know what I mean?

653
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,520
 Yeah.

654
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,520
 I mean, a little bit.

655
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,520
 I have two boys.

656
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,520
 She's becoming aware of other people's-

657
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,280
 If you go further, it just becomes a nightmare for me.

658
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,280
 Go keep going.

659
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,280
 Yeah.

660
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,280
 But anyways, so it just-

661
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,280
 But you got boys.

662
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,280
 Yes.

663
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,280
 Yeah.

664
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,280
 Different.

665
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,280
 You got the easy pass.

666
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,280
 Easier to buy porn for.

667
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
 Yep.

668
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,280
 That's true.

669
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,280
 That is true.

670
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,280
 Way easier.

671
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,280
 The sapphic comic book is a rare beast.

672
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,280
 It's weird.

673
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,280
 I think it's backwards.

674
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,600
 I think boys are harder when they're younger.

675
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,560
 Well, traditionally, they're harder when they're older.

676
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,560
 And then-

677
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,920
 Boy, ay, ay, ay, ay.

678
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,520
 And then it reverses because little girls are just evil.

679
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
 I didn't know that.

680
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
 Right.

681
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,520
 In their 40s, they're really difficult.

682
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:29,440
 You know who else got Matt's children some pornography?

683
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,440
 That's the following sponsor.

684
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,840
 Today's show, Matt and Maddie's Ice Cream Social, is brought to you by Greasy Al's Parmesan

685
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,840
 Scented Deodorant.

686
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,840
 Ooh.

687
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,840
 That's right.

688
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,840
 That's Greasy Al's Parmesan Scented Deodorant in 2022 from Dungeon Scoop and Dragon Scoop.

689
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:50,000
 (singing)

690
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,800
 Hey, Paisan! Why don't you get your face up in this pit right here?

691
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,920
 You're gonna smell a frickin' pizzeria! (sniffing)

692
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:05,120
 What do you think? Oh, that's nice. Yeah, that's my parmesan diode!

693
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:12,720
 Mmm. Made with only the fresh grated cheese. It goes right on. Guaranteed to stick to your pit hair.

694
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:22,640
 Oh, I got that. I also got gorgonzola flavor. And for the ladies out there, I have tampons made of

695
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:36,400
 prosciutto. Enter H. Scoops Checkout! Lord! Paul's pronunciation of prosciutto really got to Matt.

696
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:47,440
 Matt did not like that pronunciation. It's not an all-Caps version of boy-o-o-o-o-o-y. I remember,

697
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:55,840
 whatever, the early days of accessing celebrity porn on the internet. Oh, right. Clips from movies

698
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,640
 that already exist, but you're like, "What?" Oh, like Mr. Skin? Mr. Skin before Mr. Skin.

699
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,960
 Yeah, Mr. Skin before Mr. Skin or whatever. What was that like? Cave drawings? That's right.

700
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:11,440
 What was it? Circles on Circles. Penelope, what was it? Who was it? Who was it? Penelope Cruz?

701
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,960
 Was it Penelope Cruz? Penelope Pitstop? That's it. Penelope Pitstop from Wacky Races? That's it.

702
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,480
 Latin actress who was briefly Tom Cruise's Penelope Cruz. Yeah, she spelled it with a Z though.

703
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,640
 That's right. It was Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. Did she put them on a glass at some point?

704
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:33,040
 So, early, I'm showing my age here by describing the porn I'm looking at.

705
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:45,920
 It was in a comic book. No, it was a screen grabs of, and so it had subtitles on the screen grabs

706
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:51,600
 of her taking her top off or whatever, and she referred to her nipples as slices of pepperoni,

707
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:57,040
 and I was like, "Oh." He took it right out? Yeah, I was like, "Oh, come on." I'm out.

708
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:03,680
 Whatever the opposite of boy, shang-a-lang-a-lang, whatever the... That's it.

709
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:17,600
 Is that Pac-Man dying? Yeah, the last thing I want to do is be sucking on a nipple and get

710
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,560
 a little garlicky aftertaste. That's going to throw it off real bad. I don't want any aftertaste.

711
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:28,160
 I just want regular garlic taste. You want full-flavored garlic nipple sauce?

712
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:36,800
 I'll take any nipple I can get at this point. John, let's go get it out, buddy. Pickled nipples.

713
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:45,760
 This Papa John sauce. Garlic buttered nipples. That's my favorite shot.

714
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,760
 Last night we did the Bucket Show. Yes, we did.

715
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,560
 It was super fun. Matt, Mattingly, Jonathan, and Brad.

716
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,760
 Yeah, Jonathan, Mangum, and Brad came out. I just had someone mess with me now and do the thing I

717
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,600
 hate the most. He goes, "I didn't realize it was Brad and Jonathan." I was like, "Dude, there was

718
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,640
 never..." That would have made the difference. Come see the show or don't. Also, every post about it,

719
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,720
 every ad about it had all four of you out there. I wasn't keeping Jonathan off anything. He was on

720
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:19,120
 the poster that Eric made and we mentioned in the video. He didn't get billing last time because it

721
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,880
 was a last-minute thing. Yes. Right. We talked about it. He didn't get as much billing. We talked

722
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,200
 about him after the show last night because he was a last-minute addition to the last Bucket Show.

723
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:36,080
 I actually paid to boost the post, the video of Brad and I talking about the show. It's not

724
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,920
 because I was concerned with turnout, is that I hate the like, "Oh, I didn't know you guys were

725
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:45,360
 doing that." Shut up. Facebook makes me pay to talk to my friends. I'm paying the money to make

726
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:51,200
 sure that none of my friends fail to know that it had happened. I didn't know Jonathan was in it. I

727
00:26:51,200 --> 00:27:00,400
 was like, "No, just stop it. Just stop it." Super fun show. Great turnout. It was July 5th of the

728
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:06,160
 night, the night of July 4th. Not the biggest theater going. It's hot. It's hot. It's Vegas.

729
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,120
 It was a Saturday night. We don't usually do stuff on a Saturday night. There are other

730
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,080
 things to do in Vegas on a Saturday night, turns out. But it was packed. We had to get extra chairs.

731
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:22,000
 We got extra chairs out like four or five different times. It was so much because we got there. We had

732
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,760
 rows all set up and everything. Then as soon as we opened the doors, we're like, "Well, those chairs

733
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:36,720
 are full." Yeah. Yeah. So fun. Great crowd. We were Destination Tourism. Multiple scoops.

734
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,280
 Yes. People actually ... I mean, John came out for it. John came out for it. Lee Popsicle came out.

735
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:46,080
 That's right. Ben Sherman. Yep. Yep. It was wonderful. It was really fun. I mean,

736
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,080
 Sarah Boyle and Bat Scoop, but they live here. That doesn't count. But-

737
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,640
 It counts though. They keep showing up, doing the thing. They're diehards.

738
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,800
 Yeah. Another scoop. Oh, shoot. I'm blanking on his name, but he flew out from Northern-

739
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,560
 Milkleg Scoop. Yes. Milkleg Scoop. Oh, yeah. From Northern Cal.

740
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,680
 Yep. Oh, Milkleg Scoop. That's right. He's the guy that-

741
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,040
 Yeah. Did you miss him? He was out there last night.

742
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,280
 He beat you in the costume contest at ScoopFest. He beat me in the costume contest.

743
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,840
 Close. I'm glad you didn't see him. It would have been so awkward.

744
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,360
 It would have been. Yeah. I'm glad I didn't see him.

745
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,640
 Fucking fight. Throwing down.

746
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,600
 It's on site with Milkleg. On site.

747
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:26,320
 And my children were there as well. And it was just a super fun show.

748
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,640
 It was a super fun, crazy show. It was. Brad had some really great

749
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:38,320
 ideas in the way we generated our information for our scenes with Hot Seat, having it mostly

750
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,000
 come from interviews on three different games. That was the key way we generated-

751
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,560
 So we typically see a short form improv show. It's like, "Can we have a location?

752
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,360
 Can we have a relationship?" We were doing that. And so Brad's idea was like,

753
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,000
 "Let's really chat with people and then take whatever we want out of the interview and do

754
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,680
 the scenes off of that." And one, that was successful. And two, our most ambitious

755
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:02,640
 swing on that ended up being great, which I was like, "Instead of doing a scenic game,

756
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,240
 let's use an interview to set up Jeopardy and we'll get our occupations from the interview.

757
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,120
 We'll get our categories from the interview." The fact that you got those great categories

758
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,640
 was great. Those were juicy. She said she wanted to do the Four

759
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,920
 Horsemen of the Apocalypse cartoon. I go, "Great. What are those four again?"

760
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,680
 And she named the four and was like, "That's our category."

761
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,080
 Well, her idea was really, really good. It was about the four horsemen of the apocalypse

762
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:31,120
 having to deal with the ramifications of taking care of all the souls that came up during COVID.

763
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,280
 Oh, that's what she said.

764
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:38,000
 Yeah. She said the four horsemen are forced to deal with all the idiots that died during COVID

765
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,920
 because they didn't take proper precautions. So that's her whole idea. The pitch is like

766
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,840
 dealing with the dumbest ghosts you've ever dealt with in the afterlife. I thought that

767
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,840
 was really a fun idea. That is a fun idea. I was in and out of the

768
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,960
 room while you guys were interviewing her. Yeah, so I only heard little bits and pieces.

769
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,760
 I heard the four horsemen part and then I heard something about COVID.

770
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,960
 But yeah, that makes a lot more sense. That's a good idea.

771
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,720
 It's a good idea. The gem was her talking about her

772
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,960
 sort of relationships. Yeah, we're getting there.

773
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,040
 Oh my gosh. I stumbled into gold.

774
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:14,400
 Gold. Diamonds, I would say diamonds. These two people were sitting right in

775
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:20,480
 front of where I was standing to the degree that when Matt said at first when he picked out this

776
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:27,760
 young lady, he pointed back there and I was like, can Matt not see me? Is Matt pointing at me?

777
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:33,920
 Am I a shadowy figure in the back of the room? What's happening? What? Okay. But yeah, so she

778
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:39,680
 was there. Her boyfriend was not there with her. That's what we discovered. Her friend, her friend

779
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:45,200
 who is a long time friend. Yeah, was there with her. We all know what that is. Yeah. Yeah. No,

780
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,680
 we definitely stumbled onto. Well, because in the order I said, you know, do you, do you have a

781
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,720
 roommate? I live at home with my mom. I said, oh, okay. Do you have a boyfriend or a girlfriend

782
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,760
 order? She goes, I have a boyfriend. I go, how long has it been out? And he goes, five years.

783
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,720
 And the audience went, oh, yeah. The audience did the math real quick.

784
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,520
 If you ain't shacked up after five years, something's up. And then I said, is your

785
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,680
 boyfriend here? She goes, no. Right. I go, oh, who are you here with? And she goes, a friend.

786
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,800
 And the audience went like, oh, I let her go to the audience. I go, relax. I think I'm going to

787
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,880
 actually authentically extinguish this by going like, and you have a girlfriend or a boyfriend?

788
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,080
 He goes, nope. And then the audience just went raw. Just roared.

789
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:32,560
 Wait, you thought you were genuinely knocking that out? I mean, I was going to be still playful

790
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,640
 with it, but I thought it was building fast. I thought you were egging it on.

791
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,480
 No, I thought you were actually trying to make her more comfortable because the audience was

792
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,920
 like flipping. I was like, okay. They were going really hard on her and she was going hard.

793
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:50,560
 I was trying to spread it out a little bit. I definitely thought you were playing the dumb

794
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:56,240
 a little bit to egg the audience on. Well, I was going to ask him the question I asked him

795
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,200
 no matter what, which was, if you were dating someone for five years, would you think you'd

796
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,760
 move in with them by now? And so I knew I was going to that question next, no matter what.

797
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:11,360
 But she was a great sport to have a good sport about.

798
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,000
 And he was great. I talked to him a little bit after the show and yeah, I was like, you guys were

799
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,280
 fantastic. Thank you so much for being good sports. And they just had a great time.

800
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:24,320
 Yeah. And so for the occupation, what's great, what I loved about it was that in Jeopardy,

801
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,920
 it takes a while to set up, right? So you decide whether you're going to get categories or not,

802
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,840
 but that's another round of suggestions and you get three occupations and then the audience has

803
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,800
 those occupations and you have to come up with it. And then you have to worry about their

804
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,520
 expectations with the occupations. You have to be the funniest plumber, the funniest whatever,

805
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,840
 bus driver. Horseman of the apocalypse.

806
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,480
 So all we do is interview her and I said, well, you're not going to believe this,

807
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,880
 but you've inspired this fever dream Jeopardy. And then boom, we start playing the game and

808
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,520
 Brad plays a guy who works in the back at Nordstrom Rack.

809
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,200
 Cause she, uh, she works at Nordstrom Rack. Yeah. That was part of her interview.

810
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,520
 Jonathan played, uh, the guy in the back, the guy in the back, the friend in the back.

811
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:08,640
 That's right. The back rack. Yeah. And then, uh, Paul played the mother that she lives with.

812
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:16,400
 Yeah. And then the Jeopardy categories were, uh, conquest, war, famine, uh, and the other,

813
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,440
 and the other one, uh, and so pestilence and pestilence and the other one and the other one.

814
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:29,040
 Yeah. I kept all five. Yeah. I thought it was war. She listed death is one famine and pestilence,

815
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,560
 but she named, she didn't name death as one. She said conquest and war specific.

816
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,880
 Cause I made a joke. I go, good. You got to keep those separate. Right.

817
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,280
 Conquest and war. I'm like, what? No, it's, it's war, famine, pestilence, death.

818
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,800
 I did us traditionally. I did think it was wrong, but that's fine. But who knows?

819
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,040
 This is why her cartoon's not going to get mad. That's right.

820
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:50,960
 Can't even name the four horsemen you're making the cartoon about. No, the four horsemen are

821
00:33:50,960 --> 00:34:01,760
 Ric flair, aren't Anderson. No, no, no. The four horsemen are Mickey Mantle, uh,

822
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,960
 Lou Terry, Tully Blanchard.

823
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:14,720
 There's Greg Maddox. Schultz was in there. Uh, Steve Avery. It was Mike Singletary.

824
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,440
 Are there four horsemen in every sport? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, the, uh, what was it? The,

825
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,080
 the, the 90s Braves pitching staff, they, yeah, they were the four horsemen. It was what Greg

826
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:29,200
 Maddox, John Schultz, Steve Avery. And there was one other guy in that, in that line. That's when

827
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:36,080
 the Braves won the wonder division, like 20 years in a row. They've said all the pitching, uh, uh,

828
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,720
 conquest, war, famine, and death. Oh, she did do it. Yeah. No, she got them.

829
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:46,720
 Well, she didn't say death. She did. She said war and conquest. She said pestilence. Did she say,

830
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,480
 she said pestilence? She said pestilence. She might've said pestilence instead of famine.

831
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,200
 Okay. Well, but she didn't say death. She said death.

832
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,360
 Okay. Well, the white horse is interpreted sometimes to be conquest or pestilence. So I

833
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,120
 guess, okay, I thought there was death road. I'm going off of chat. GPT. So she could be wrong.

834
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:07,120
 Don't ask tap GPT. If it made you feel better, I think Paul was going off of the movie tombstone.

835
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:12,880
 No, there was a pale horse coming and you tell him I'm coming. The pale horse is death. That's

836
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,840
 not the white horse. The pale horse is different. The pale horse is different than white. Trust me.

837
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:22,000
 In my Irish household, pale is different than white. It's also known as the bucket horse.

838
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,520
 The black horse is famine, right? The red horse is war. I'm going to go ahead and ask him to make a

839
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:33,040
 Penn and Teller jokes out of this, out of the four horsemen. That'll, that'll sing.

840
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:41,680
 Matt is typing into his phone. It was a faster joke to make than to type. So that went really well.

841
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:49,680
 All the, all the scenes went really well. We had a great time doing songs.

842
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:59,200
 Spadoni came through again. Oh yeah. Dropped it like it's hot. Um, which was great. Uh, he's just,

843
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:04,000
 he's just on it. And I think that was lovely. And you know, Spadoni is such a gift, man. That's what

844
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,480
 I'm saying. Like he, he's no small part of why we shine a hundred percent. I try to explain Spadoni

845
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,520
 to other, to other, uh, performers in town and other, uh, comedic performers in town, especially.

846
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,680
 I really, and I mean this is Spadoni will listen to this, I'm sure. And this is just blowing smoke

847
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:28,720
 up his ass now, but, uh, he is so fucking good at that. Get a job, Spadoni. Oh, Tasmanian Spadoni.

848
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,840
 If you want to break it up, I can read a Penn and Teller joke about pestilence. Uh, Penn,

849
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:39,040
 this one comes riding out to conquer the world just like Teller here when he discovered TikTok.

850
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:47,600
 Oh boy. Boy. Chat GPT. Well, you know what? Job security. Riding jobs. Officially safe.

851
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,320
 Horseman spreads plague. Teller spreads 15 second card tricks that cost us actual gigs.

852
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:58,320
 Teller is a burden, you guys. Oh boy. And, uh,

853
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:04,640
 chat GPT's stake on the Penn and Teller relationship is that Penn is dragging Teller

854
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,800
 along. And, uh, also this joke is really the future is I'm pretty sure Teller is still yet

855
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,640
 to discover TikTok. So we'll just, uh, but when he does, it's going to be a mess. No, I mean, Spadoni

856
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,560
 did, uh, my, my shows for the fringe festival and you know, one of the things we did was, uh, you

857
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,440
 know, we, we tried a big swing and then we made an adjustment together, like on a fly over like one

858
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:31,440
 phone conversation. And then it was just flawless, uh, for the final two shows. And, uh, I was like,

859
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,640
 it's just great to have them up there. Right. And my wife was like, well, it's just like having them

860
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:40,880
 for the bucket show. Right. That's a special unique thing. Like to just have like someone that's just

861
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,720
 the fingers of the glove. Right. Like I just went through those shows effortlessly. He got his laughs

862
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,760
 for adding awesome musical references and stuff and absolutely building my tricks to a crescendo.

863
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:55,200
 And I did this without any, we did no major rehearsal, no major notes. She's just, he just

864
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:01,920
 does it. Yeah. It's a, he, he catches things that you do and adds, adds things like the flashback

865
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:10,240
 stuff. Yes. He is perfect at, at finding those moments and doing the, you know, and even though

866
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:19,600
 he did it last night. And, uh, what was interesting about it is that, uh, I think it was, it was Brad,

867
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:24,880
 it was Brad and Jonathan. No, no, I had to tag in because they didn't know it.

868
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,080
 Correct. But you were right there and hit it. And then as soon as you did it, then it was perfect.

869
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:35,360
 He's like, of course. Then, and then, you know, yeah, Brad and Jonathan, who don't work, he played

870
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:40,560
 flashback during their scene and they both froze and I tagged out Jonathan and said to Brad and go,

871
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:47,680
 Hey, it's me. You're dead. You're younger. You're younger than you were. Yeah. And we kept going,

872
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,720
 but it was, it was a fun, that was a fun moment. But, uh, yeah, I mean, I was driving the car with

873
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,440
 Paul last night and I just said, like, honestly, it's like the first time we, we, we did it. We

874
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:04,480
 jammed together in 2008 at the, uh, you know, uh, what was that theater called? Onyx. Onyx.

875
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,240
 Use your microphone, please. Onyx. Thank you. Uh, his microphone in his mouth or in his lap.

876
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:18,000
 At the Onyx, uh, through the sex shop into the back. If we, if we, if we took a photo of a packed

877
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,520
 theater with Brad and Jonathan performing with us and send it to us in 2008, we would be like,

878
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:29,280
 this is awesome. Right. This is, this is badass. Um, and it was like, who are those old motherfuckers?

879
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:36,160
 Yeah. Like, am I dying my beard? What color is that? Um, and, uh, and it was fun. I mean,

880
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:42,000
 all these guys, I mean, it's just, it's just so fun to play with those guys. Brad's so smart.

881
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,400
 It was a gift. So quick. And Jonathan's just so playful and so fast and just always is ready to

882
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,680
 push anything off the rails and make a bit out of anything. And it's great. Even backstage,

883
00:39:53,680 --> 00:40:00,480
 Brad was being, I think Brad was nervous. Yeah, yeah. But Brad was like, uh, uh, uh,

884
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,640
 expressing it through like, like little, little fastidious activities, right? So we had like four

885
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,440
 liquid death cans and he's like, well, how are we, now we're going to know which one's which or

886
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,920
 whatever. And so I wrote my name Slopley on mine. So he decided he was going to write his very, uh,

887
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,520
 uh, precisely on his candy, but little bees, little bees all along the lip. And it was like,

888
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,080
 make sure you don't put it too close to where your mouth's going to be. Very strong marker

889
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:27,680
 taste of water. You don't want that. Yeah. And it was totally bidding and it was very funny.

890
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,240
 And then Jonathan came in and did the same thing to his water can just picked up his own water

891
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,400
 cans. Oh, sure. No problem. And just started writing the same bees all over, just like a half

892
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,880
 an inch, not even like a quarter of an inch lower, minor, a little bit lower attention. It was so

893
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,880
 funny. They just, it just bits for days and just, oh, it just ready, ready, ready, ready, ready.

894
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:54,640
 It was good. It was good. And again, and huge thanks to Troy for giving us the majestic,

895
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:00,400
 unbelievable. Uh, let's think it's like last time was just everyone doing art for art sake, right?

896
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,200
 Jonathan flies in his own dime just to do an improv show. This guy does tours with Wayne Brady,

897
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:12,080
 right? Brad and Colin play thousand, 2000 seat theaters across the nation, right? But they come

898
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:17,040
 out just to do improv because just to do something else, just to do another improv show. And you know,

899
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:23,040
 Paul flew out and I, I guess I had the easiest job here. I'm already doing it. Um, and then Troy,

900
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,600
 you know, gives us an amazing deal, uh, to be there. And that's the thing is like, we're all

901
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:32,000
 doing art for art sake. That's right. And that, that, I felt like that, I feel like that doesn't

902
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,560
 happen when you're older as much. Right. And, and, and, and Paul, um, and Troy is doing the lion's

903
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,360
 share of art for art sake. He's not making a lot of money at that theater and that theater being

904
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:48,800
 open. Uh, but Troy just wants, this is what happens. Troy was such a good deal. I simply go,

905
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:56,000
 what dates open, right? Like what, how can we not interrupt any flow of your actual money making

906
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,880
 endeavors in that theater? Uh, and, uh, and he just gives me a date and, and that's like a really

907
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:09,680
 cool agreement to have, uh, with him. And, uh, so when he said July 5th, I was like a Saturday night,

908
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,400
 what, what, what, what? Uh, and he said, yeah, it's July 4th weekend. I go, oh, right. Yeah. Yeah.

909
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,000
 I'm dumb. So I was really worried that we were not going to, people are not going to come out,

910
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:25,840
 but it was a great, great house. There were at, uh, so it was an 80 o'clock show at about, uh,

911
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:30,080
 seven right about seven o'clock. I had to walk outside, uh, just to, just to go to the car for

912
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:34,000
 something, maybe put something in the car or whatever it was. And, uh, there was just a guy

913
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,320
 outside at 7:00 PM. It was like, Hey, you guys open in the house? I said, no, no, no, the shows,

914
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,920
 the shows not until eight. Cause I don't know. I know. I just wanted to make sure to, to get here

915
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:51,040
 and have a good seat. Oh, great. Yeah. The house will open about half an hour. Um, yeah, no problem.

916
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,840
 And then he goes, great. Yeah. Thank you so much. I was just going to finish cooking these eggs on

917
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:59,040
 the sidewalk. No problem. Yeah. So he walked off and it ended, but sure enough, like he was back

918
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,160
 15, 20 minutes later and he was first in line at the door and he was, he's ready to come in.

919
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,480
 I was like, man, as soon as I walked up there, getting ready to open the house, there was a line

920
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,800
 down the sidewalk. All right, this is, this is going to be good. This is going to be a good night.

921
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:19,520
 Paul was up and down off of the ground. Paul was rolling around. Paul, Paul was so, uh,

922
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:25,920
 physically I am ambulatory once more in the show. It is revolutionary. Well, and, and I'm, you know,

923
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:31,680
 I credit, I credit myself. No, I credit my fantastic doctor for fixing my hip, but I also

924
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,640
 credit myself for continuing to press forward with a somewhat physically demanding day job.

925
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,160
 Even though it's part time, I am up and down, stocking shelves on the ground, back and forth,

926
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:47,360
 lifting heavy boxes, dah, dah, dah, dah. And it has really helped keep me cooking. I am, I, and,

927
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,960
 and that's why I'm going to send my kids to work in a factory. It's a good idea. Good. Yeah. But

928
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,160
 yeah, I'm, I'm as soon as they turn 12 and a half, it's really just turning a corner for me now.

929
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,960
 Like honestly, I've just getting back into teaching, just getting back into just being able to drive

930
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,160
 around and feel like, okay, I can get out here and walk. Like even just at the airport, I park in the

931
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:11,520
 far off space to try and save a couple of bucks for the company because it's not that much further.

932
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,320
 But when I was walking with that fucking hip, right, it was like going through the desert. I

933
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,720
 was like, and just walking the other day, heading back in, I was like, man. That's why I like Paul

934
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,040
 as a business partner when he has a bum hip, he's still parking at the back. I do saving that six

935
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,360
 dollars. I do it. I do it for the company. Company man. Company man. Company man through through.

936
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,440
 But it was- Just to be clear, I'm not as good as a company man. That's all right. No, no, no.

937
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:40,160
 I only park in the very front spot. Okay. Valet. How much is it? I don't care. I don't care. But

938
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,320
 of the three of us, I probably need the steps more anyway, so it's fine.

939
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:52,800
 SJ does ask every night, she'll be like, is your company paying for this? Yes. Why don't you just

940
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:59,600
 spend this? It's my company. It's not someone else's company paying for it.

941
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:09,200
 It's not a different- It's still our money. Yeah. We have 900 amazing bosses out there.

942
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,200
 They don't want us getting the valet service at the airport. No.

943
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:21,120
 Whose money do you think I'm spending? Exactly. Exactly. The three of us went out to brunch

944
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:29,280
 yesterday. So good. We came back- Makers and fixtures? Makers and finders. Makers and finders.

945
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,240
 Yeah, yeah. I thought it was fixtures, but it's fine. Either way, the name makes no sense,

946
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:37,840
 who cares? But neither one of those words mean empanadas, and that's what it's known for.

947
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:44,000
 When I first saw Makers, I'm like, that's like a poop analogy. That's what people say to their

948
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:50,800
 kids. Does baby need to make? Oh, you haven't heard make? Oh, I don't like that. I've never

949
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,720
 done it though. I've never done it, but I've heard of it. But it's gross, right? Yeah. That's when I

950
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:00,800
 heard Makers and finders. I'm like, oh no. I find- Then you got to find- Oh, if it's a sinker. I find-

951
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,760
 Makers and sinkers? Because if you make and then it sinks- You can make a sinker. Then you got to

952
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:11,280
 find it. You don't want it to sink. Right. If you're healthy, it's floating. Makers and floaters is

953
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,600
 what you want. That's what you want. That's it. Our health expert, Paul Mattingly talks about

954
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:21,520
 the proper poops. I just remember- This guy walks more than all of us from his parking space at the

955
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:27,440
 airport. It's true. And shits more than all of you combined. I'm just up there dropping off the car

956
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,640
 at valet and here comes Mattingly. Just a sweaty mess in the back of the parking lot. I'm not a

957
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:38,400
 sweaty mess. That's the other thing too is like, I have some endurance again. I have some stamina.

958
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:44,880
 I wasn't winded during the show at all. I was like, this is great. I can do this show. I made a point

959
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:51,760
 of during the week, the two or three weeks before the show, I made a point of doing a lot of singing

960
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:57,440
 in the car because I hadn't been using my voice. So just singing a lot just to get my voice up.

961
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:04,560
 Crap. Keep that mic in front of your face. No, I'm what they call a performer. Yes, that's right.

962
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:13,440
 Who calls you that? Anne. She says, what sort of performative bullshit is this? And I say,

963
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:20,000
 thank you. I thought I was eating pussy. And she's like, well, why don't you tell your mouth?

964
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:31,280
 Sideways like a typewriter. God damn it. Always with the sideways, just running a bit into the

965
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:37,360
 ground. I'll tell you who else was not impressed by Paul's cuddlingus. And that is the following

966
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:43,040
 sponsor. Slappy tears. That's right. Drive through funeral services. Say that final goodbye to your

967
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:50,080
 loved one from the comfort of your car. One, uh, with one slow speed slap on their urn or casket

968
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:56,240
 before going on with the rest of your day. That's from little Sally scoop in 2024, slappy tears,

969
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:03,920
 drive through funeral services. Hey, everybody. It's, uh, it's the Elvis, uh, it's Elvis from the,

970
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:09,120
 we know where you're from. It was, it's okay. Hey, yeah. Well, that's right. Yeah. That's where

971
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,560
 to below depending on which there's only one of you, right? Well, no, there were two of me.

972
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:19,920
 Did you know I was a twin? That's true. That's true. My baby, my baby brother died. My baby

973
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:27,760
 brother died before I was born before you were born. He died. He died. Born. He born died. Yeah.

974
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,640
 Anyway. So I've been prepping for this my whole life. Essentially I was prepping for this before

975
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:40,400
 my life even started. Oftentimes we have to say goodbye to our loved ones, but we don't know how.

976
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,840
 So Elvis here has made it easy. I made it real easy for you. I got to get in your pink Cadillac

977
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:51,120
 and drive, drive right on by and give it all there in a slap. Just come on by and give that

978
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:56,000
 earn a slap. Say goodbye baby brother who died in the womb with me, who I hung out with dead in the

979
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,080
 womb. That was something. Boy, not much of a conversation with my baby brother. He's dead.

980
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:07,520
 Yeah. He was stillborn. Yeah. She's not going to talk. Yeah. That was the funny thing of my mom.

981
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,440
 Mama said, that was the funny thing. Mama said, mama said your brother was stillborn. I said,

982
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,120
 well, yeah, he came out right. And she says, yeah, but that means he's dead. I said, oh,

983
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:20,880
 I thought you meant he was dead, but then he was stillborn. She's no, he was stillborn. Me's dead.

984
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,960
 That's a real clever turn of phrase of us. Good work. Good work talking to your mom with that.

985
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:31,200
 Thank you very much. I came over that one on a fly. Me and mama, me and mama were having a little

986
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,320
 conversation about, you know, it's always fun to hang out with your mama and joke about your dead

987
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:43,600
 baby brother. That's what you do. Yeah. Well, speaking of gallows humor, come on down to my

988
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:50,960
 funeral home. Elvis's slappy, slappy goodbyes, slappy goodbyes for your dead baby brother or

989
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:57,520
 whoever else might be dead. And you can slap them and just go, you don't have to stay and listen to

990
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:08,400
 some bullshit about the Lord or whatever. Just go home, go home, go home. Thank you very much.

991
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,760
 Enter. Hey, scoops to check out. Boy, I'm glad Paul was doing that vocalizing in his car to warm up

992
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:23,840
 for that. Yeah. I'm as they say, performative Paul would have. Oh, look at that. Look at that

993
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:28,000
 circle on that circle. God damn. That's, that's the finest looking titty I ever saw.

994
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,440
 Hey, uh, Hey Priscilla, you might get a little bit of work done. So you

995
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,000
 booze look more like circles and circles. Okay. Okay. Great. You don't like these pepperonis?

996
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,200
 No. Oh, well, yeah. You know what? I'm going to put a little fried manner sandwich on him,

997
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:50,640
 on him nipples, fried manner nipples. I just don't want to see the translation in the screen grab.

998
00:50:50,640 --> 00:51:03,680
 Uh, yeah, we've not talked about this. Okay. If the magic dragon. Oh yes. This

999
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:11,280
 SJ and the ruckus winners, winners of best comedian and best bands. Yep. That's right.

1000
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:18,080
 From the Las Vegas weekly. Uh, and, uh, you know, uh, a lot of that was that we, we, we,

1001
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:23,360
 we launched a campaign, launched a campaign and our scoops. We talked about it on this very show.

1002
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:29,520
 And, and, and they got our friends, yes. Put them over the top. That's what scoops do. That's right.

1003
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,600
 Our communities, they come through, um, and change the subject for a moment. Congratulations

1004
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:40,160
 to city cast of Las Vegas for winning best podcast in Los Vegas. Congratulations. To be fair,

1005
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:46,720
 we have had David Jan Fiegler on the show. How is that fair? How does that help the argument

1006
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:53,520
 of fairness? We know the winners. Yes. We are, we are, we've been on their show. Right. We helped

1007
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:58,480
 them win. We are winner adjacent, but I will also say in this, it doesn't feel like winter adjacent

1008
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,840
 Paul. They're in Las Vegas. It's Las Vegas awards. Of course we're adjacent to them. We're also in

1009
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:11,280
 Las Vegas. In this situation, I feel okay because David Jan Fiegler that makes one of us is the one

1010
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:17,040
 who helped Jimmy slow Nina out. Yes. His pinch David figure is a, is a, is a, is an attorney,

1011
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:22,080
 legit fucking hero. Yes. He is representing all the people who've been wrongfully arrested

1012
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:27,360
 during protests. Right. He's been helping people get out of jail. Uh, he, he's a, he's a better

1013
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:32,320
 person than us, but is he better podcaster than us? We're not disagreeing that he's a better person

1014
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:36,320
 than that. Right. It's just, is he a better podcast? Right. And maybe the answer is also yes,

1015
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:41,440
 it might be still, does he need this award more than us? Yes. But even still,

1016
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:49,600
 I'm okay with it. Well, that's good. I'll get there. Okay. Paul's okay with it. Yeah. And you

1017
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:57,200
 know what? I'm not planning on stopping this. So no, I am now that we have one best podcast

1018
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:02,720
 I'm out. We did win back in 2016. Exactly. We peaked and I'm done. And that was, that was,

1019
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:07,520
 that wasn't just best podcast Las Vegas. That was just best podcast. Yeah. Period. Yeah. That's the

1020
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:15,760
 problem. The category is too narrow. That's what it is. That's the problem. Wait, wait, wait, wait,

1021
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:21,920
 wait. You guys consider yourselves a Vegas podcast. I consider you universal. Yeah. That's right. They

1022
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:27,680
 found out Paul is in Pittsburgh, disqualified us. That's right. I mean, David's podcast is about

1023
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:33,040
 Las Vegas. It is a Las Vegas podcast award. Like his show is about Las Vegas. Our show is just

1024
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:37,440
 happens to be in Las Vegas. Uh, so it's just another way that he's better than us. Yeah.

1025
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:43,440
 Yeah. I mean, David has a law degree, you know, like a real sub this show, we don't have to keep

1026
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:48,000
 listing ways that he's better than us. We just, I just don't have anything. He can hang his diplomas

1027
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
 and degrees on the wall. I can't, I need awards. Right. I need awards to hang on the wall because

1028
00:53:52,000 --> 00:54:00,320
 I don't have any other things I've ever accomplished. Matt, Matt, don't say that.

1029
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:06,560
 We got some pictures. Yeah, we have pictures. Put some pictures up from last night to be like,

1030
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:09,840
 look, I performed with some great players. Actually, one of the guys we got up was a

1031
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:14,000
 photographer. I will shout out his Instagram because he, he took a lot of great photos,

1032
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,480
 but let me find him. Uh, I leaned up because I had to put a microphone stand out, but Paul

1033
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:26,000
 thought I was trying to show him my phone. Uh, yes. Uh, third, third I viz, V I Z third, I viz.

1034
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:32,160
 Yeah. It took a lot of great photos of us. Yeah. Uh, we'll put them up on our socials as well.

1035
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:36,160
 And he does a lot of, uh, a lot of comedians in town. Yes. Yes. Pictures of comedy shows.

1036
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:40,000
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was really fun hanging out with me. Me hung out for a bit last night.

1037
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,600
 Yeah. I got him a poker chip. I brought poker chips to hand out to people. Good. I know everyone

1038
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:56,320
 I tried to give a chip to already had one. So weird. I was watching Matt would go around and

1039
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:00,160
 be like, hi, can I give you a poker chip? They'd be like, Paul gave me one. Yeah. Sometimes that

1040
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:06,400
 does happen, but that didn't happen last night. Okay. All right. All right. But there are plenty

1041
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,320
 of times I've beaten you guys at a punch on a poker chip thing. Yeah. Because you have, that's

1042
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:15,440
 right. There is that you are chip for. Well, I'm trying to promote this goddamn podcast. Get some

1043
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:21,760
 more ears on this shit. I want the award to do that. We're out here spinning gold. I'm going to say

1044
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:27,280
 it's been an Elvis gold. Uh, you got some more chips. Yeah. You still like in general or on me,

1045
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:32,240
 you had a discovery of some, well here. Oh yeah. Yeah. They're chips. I need to grab some. You were

1046
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:36,560
 doing some construction in the wall. You found some old chips from like the fifties and someone

1047
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:43,120
 task of a Monte auto chips. That's right. I thought I had buried these, I thought I had buried these

1048
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:49,040
 forever and they are rediscovered. Do you think we've got some red ones now? Yeah. There's some

1049
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:54,240
 red ones out there. Sweet. Yeah. I think we've got red and black. I love it. I think those are two

1050
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:59,680
 general colors that we have. Yep. Speaking of SJ and the ruckus. Oh shit. Here comes SJ. Everybody

1051
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:07,680
 give it up. Winner of best of Las Vegas. Good morning. It's like back in the day when SJ would

1052
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:14,480
 just pop in. That's right. Roll out of bed. Go see what the boys are doing. Pretty much when we had

1053
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:20,480
 now she has my mic. I know. Yeah. SJ just walked in, took Matt's microphone and then walked away

1054
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,840
 from that. It's okay. Well you did hand it to me. Yeah, but I didn't know where you were going. We

1055
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:29,840
 can share. Yeah. There you go. There we go. John, give SJ the mic. There you go. Yeah, yeah. We can

1056
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:34,640
 share. There you go. What's going on y'all? Winner. We're looking at a winner right now. We were just

1057
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:43,760
 talking about you winning the best of Las Vegas. No. And how we didn't. Yeah. A winner is a winner.

1058
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:55,680
 SJ's. I got to tell you guys. SJ's pity tone just made Paul spit. I got to tell you,

1059
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:02,720
 it really changed our relationship in the house. Our relationship in this house has not been the

1060
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:21,360
 same. SJ just patted his podcast on the shoulder and said, we're really good friends. You're like

1061
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:34,560
 a brother to me podcast. He told me, he's like, Hey there, um, Pip was here and you know, he wants

1062
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:42,480
 to win this thing. And, but on the same page is like you best band and, um, uh, best podcast. So

1063
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:47,440
 we were like, Oh, this would be cool. Like, let's just do all of it. Yeah. Yeah. So we almost did

1064
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:54,800
 two out of three. Amen. We won the, uh, like a derby in the preakness, but failed at the bell.

1065
00:57:54,800 --> 00:58:04,320
 There we go. We also didn't win a best patio. Yeah. That's okay. Also, you might have though,

1066
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:09,520
 because I don't think I got like, they found me through Facebook. You might have one,

1067
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:18,160
 but Jacob's whiskey pit doesn't have a Facebook page or a phone number to call real. We didn't

1068
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,680
 follow through on the bit. That's what we're saying. We should've made a Facebook page or you

1069
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:25,280
 should've made an actual Jacob's whiskey. You might, you might've won. You just didn't know.

1070
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:30,480
 We don't know. We don't know. You'll never know. Uh, but, uh, uh, uh, so what's it like? What's it

1071
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:36,480
 like being a winner? What's it feel like to win in life? We want to know. You already know you've

1072
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:42,720
 won stuff before. I think we've won. I think we have won the weekly. I think we've won. I think

1073
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:49,840
 we've won the award we're talking about before 2017. Yeah. The year after we won the first one.

1074
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:53,440
 Cause that was, uh, Corey helped us out with that one. That's right. Getting us, uh, yeah.

1075
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,800
 Cause like we went to the event, uh, for that actually went to the event this year. Yeah. It

1076
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:02,160
 was up at the Mandalay Bay at the time. Oh yeah. It was at, uh, uh, founders. Uh, what's that place

1077
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:07,280
 called? Founders room. The post party. That's it. Yeah. The post party was cool. Founders room is

1078
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:11,200
 the room at Brian brushwood's place where all the founders hang out. That's where I went. Yeah.

1079
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:16,320
 I try one. That's right. I went near the break studio. It is. Okay. You guys got it. You know

1080
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:22,720
 what it's like. Uh, it was, uh, the resorts world this year. Ah, so yeah, it was really cool.

1081
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:28,560
 Honestly though, seriously, it was like super, I, I forgot about it. Jacob told me about it and I

1082
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:32,800
 got this call from this guy and he's like from the weekly. Yeah. Yeah. From the weekly. And he's so

1083
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:37,280
 excited. He's so excited to tell me. And I'm like, what are you talking about?

1084
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:44,080
 Give me a lawyer. I know. Right. It was really great. Um, but yeah, we went to the,

1085
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:50,960
 the band was like, what we won. Yeah. They like, I was like, yeah guys, like this happened and

1086
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,960
 everyone's just like freaking out. Right. So a couple of them went to the party with me,

1087
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,600
 but it was just like, I don't know when the band it's, it's great because it all ties in so nicely

1088
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:04,960
 because the band knows the scoops because the band plays in front of the scoops at scoop fest. Yeah.

1089
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:09,440
 So like they were excited not only to win the award, but they were excited that the scoops had,

1090
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,920
 uh, had banded together to support them and everything. Like, so they're the guys, especially

1091
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:19,920
 I think we're just gin genuinely touched by the whole thing. Yeah. So we're pretty pumped. Yeah.

1092
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,200
 So thanks guys. I think the, the, the, the awkwardness of feeling is that you're not

1093
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:28,240
 leaning in and I think you guys should walk around like we are the best. We are the best.

1094
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:32,800
 Yeah. So we've been posting like obnoxiously about it and like you, you got, I don't know,

1095
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:37,520
 you guys probably don't have it, but like in the Vegas, like entertainer world, like everyone's

1096
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:43,520
 already throwing shade at us. Like good. They're like someone posted, Oh, isn't it cute when like

1097
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:48,000
 Vegas people just give each other awards? Like right after we were like going off about this

1098
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,760
 and people were like, yeah, I know it's so stupid. I'm like, you're not getting hired again. You're

1099
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:59,120
 not getting hired. These are people who like sub for us. These are musicians. What are you doing?

1100
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:03,600
 I know that's really dumb. That's just shoot yourself really stupid. I know. I know you guys

1101
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,600
 probably didn't run into that, but we run into that stuff all the time. We only have, we only have nice

1102
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,880
 Saras and Ross and Brenna Folger were like, fuck those guys.

1103
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:19,120
 We, uh, we really, we, you know, the scoop community is the outlier community of the internet,

1104
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:25,200
 which is wonderful. We are, we are insulated from all that, that crazy shit, but also personally,

1105
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:33,120
 and I think you as well, I think all of us ascribe to this, um, I am okay with applauding

1106
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:37,600
 being happy for people and giving them their flowers when they are rising. Right. Even if

1107
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:42,960
 I'm not doing so great. I mean, because it's, maybe it's just not my time right now. It comes

1108
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:47,680
 around. But if you don't about not my time or whatever, don't be an asshole. Right. But,

1109
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:52,000
 but if you can't celebrate other people's victories, what do you expect is going to happen when you

1110
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,120
 win? Exactly. You know what I mean? Like you gotta be, well, they're not going to win because they

1111
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:01,760
 just talk themselves out of that. But high tide raises all boats, man. Right. That's an improv

1112
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,080
 thing too, though. I mean, like we, we literally have each other's backs because if you, because

1113
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:10,960
 that's all you got out there on the stage. And if you're not just ready to be like that motherfucker

1114
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:16,480
 just nailed it. No, I have some, I also have some hack bits I can go to any moment. Oh yeah, you know,

1115
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:24,000
 you do. I keep some stuff in the back pocket. Yeah. Well rehearsed, clever bits. Oh, you have

1116
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:33,280
 a clever ones too. I didn't bust them out. So saving for a rainy day, but you got all those away.

1117
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:40,720
 You gotta be happy for other people's successes. Yeah. It's also business. Unless it's a business,

1118
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:45,760
 unless it's like, unless it's like a billionaire won something, then you're like, well, fuck you.

1119
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:52,240
 Even then it's just people giving each other awards, but it's always going to be like people

1120
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:56,800
 in the same industry giving each other awards. That's what awards are. Whereas the Oscars are

1121
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:04,000
 very much more globally merit based. They're very external. Right. Well, even if you're not

1122
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,360
 super happy for them, don't come out and talk shit. It's like, just let it be. That's so dumb.

1123
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,800
 Whatever. Like we're like, obviously, you know, just moving on, but I just thought it was funny,

1124
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:18,320
 like throwing shade like that, but wow, come on guys. Yeah. Well, basically like the, the,

1125
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:25,760
 the whatever's darkest, uh, not darkest, the most like, um, detached or whatever.

1126
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,800
 What's the emotion for like, not wanting to give a shit about nonchalant. No,

1127
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,920
 the most nonchalant you should be is go, oh, well they're going to get more work. Like that

1128
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:36,640
 should be the most like, Oh, good for you. Good for them. More work. I actually be the, like the

1129
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:43,840
 most, the limit of whatever you'd be like, how dare they reward locals stuff for doing a working

1130
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:48,560
 local band. Want an award. Fuck off. Yeah. I scroll through those awards and I go like, oh great.

1131
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:52,560
 These people won. Yeah. And that's the end that I, that's, that's the last that I think about.

1132
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:57,360
 Exactly. And by the way, like in terms of like, for you guys, like it actually does, like if you,

1133
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:02,800
 if you put a best of Vegas sign up, uh, out before on the, on the casino, before they go into the

1134
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:06,640
 lounge, they're going in, they're going to be a little more curious about like, who are these guys

1135
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:11,040
 and maybe give you a little more credit. It's so interesting. Like we're yeah, exactly for that

1136
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:16,560
 reason. So anyways, um, I know it was like funny for you guys, but thanks. Oh, we're glad with no,

1137
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:20,960
 it's it, but it's, you know, it gives us a good band at scoop fest guy. Damn it. That's the best

1138
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:25,840
 band in town. Hey, I know. So that's the other thing too is, um, we actually got, um, asked to

1139
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:29,280
 go to Loughlin that weekend for like, it's a big concert weekend out there. And I was talking to

1140
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:36,800
 the boys and I was like, guys, we gotta play scoop fest now figure out a way to handle it.

1141
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:43,200
 If you had to go to the guys, she, the guys, the guys decided to do scoop fest. They were like,

1142
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:48,080
 we gotta do scoop. That's a much more fun gig than, uh, than anything else. We actually didn't want

1143
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:53,680
 you to lose out, uh, uh, uh, on the scoop fest. And so we, we went on the Loughlin message board

1144
01:04:53,680 --> 01:05:00,320
 and said, I guess I'll let anyone play Loughlin now. Uh, see if we can just get them to pull the

1145
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:06,960
 offer. Oh, look at Loughlin people giving each other awards. Loughlin all the way to the bank.

1146
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:11,680
 Yeah. Did you guys see speaking of Loughlin, uh, did you guys see the plane emergency landing out

1147
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:17,840
 there? So Loughlin, Nevada is right on the border, uh, with, uh, Arizona. It's right there on the

1148
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:23,360
 Colorado river. It's beautiful, beautiful town out there, uh, right there by the Arizona border,

1149
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:27,360
 uh, right on the other side of the river. This is Jacob. All of us who's watched Viva Loughlin

1150
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:32,640
 with Hugh Jackman when I was on TV. So they know and so they don't need to explain Loughlin.

1151
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:39,840
 So they know all about bullhead city over there on the other side of the river. So bullhead city is

1152
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:45,120
 like Loughlin, just a small Arizona city right there on the, on their side. It's the Nevada

1153
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:50,800
 border. An American airlines flight. The other, uh, the other day earlier this week is crazy as

1154
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:56,080
 wind. It was all the crazy storms, crazy wind, an American airlines flight, you know, like a, uh,

1155
01:05:56,080 --> 01:06:02,800
 seven 37 size plane, whatever type of plane it was had to land at the bullhead city airport

1156
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:09,200
 in Arizona, which is just a landing strip. There is no airport. There is no airport staff.

1157
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:16,000
 There's nothing. So a plane full of passengers had to land in bullhead city, Arizona, uh, to,

1158
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:22,160
 to divert there. There was, there are no other planes for them to get onto the crew on their

1159
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:29,200
 plane timed out. So they weren't able legally to fly anymore. Yeah. And so a plane full of people,

1160
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:34,720
 come from away style. Basically it was, it was the come from away in Arizona.

1161
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:40,320
 What's interesting is that Loughlin is actually, and this is a true, uh, thing. They're, they're,

1162
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:47,280
 they're lobbying to get, uh, support from the state because basically we're going to be building a new

1163
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:52,720
 terminal. Cause our airport traffic is getting crazy and they want to be an overflow terminal.

1164
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:58,560
 Okay. And so they want the resources to quickly shuttle people from there. Oh, it'd be great.

1165
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:04,480
 Oh, that'd be amazing. I mean, if you do that, you can build out Loughlin. You can make it a

1166
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:11,520
 suburb. Yeah. It just, all you gotta do is put a billion dollars into a, uh, uh, high street rail.

1167
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:21,120
 Well, I guess, uh, maybe in 20 to 50, maybe, maybe, maybe, um, but, uh, best in Loughlin now.

1168
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:25,680
 But so, but I bet like, but, but basically like that helps them make their case. Right. See,

1169
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:30,320
 see, we're right here. We're right here. We're the closest airport. Yeah. And it is like an hour

1170
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:34,480
 drive. I mean, it's not, it's not very far out of Vegas. No, but that's, but, but if it had high

1171
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:39,280
 speed train, if you get there in 20 minutes, exquisite Paul, no one is not, no one said high

1172
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,720
 speed rail. You're the only one who said high speed rail. You're right. It is much more pleasurable

1173
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:48,720
 to just drive to Loughlin. That's the only option on the table, Paul. Yeah. Gorgeous drive though.

1174
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:53,040
 You're the only one who said there's going to be a high speed rail, but you're going to do

1175
01:07:53,040 --> 01:08:01,840
 no other. I didn't say it. I'm demanding it. I'm demanding it. Yeah. And then you just shat on it.

1176
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:08,640
 Drive that fucking drive. Eat shit. Cars. I don't want to do that. No, it's a beautiful drive where

1177
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:16,960
 you see nothing garbage. And then once you get there, you're in Loughlin. So that's the upside.

1178
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:23,840
 Oh yeah. This is where we're launching the SJ and the ruckus party bus shuttle from Loughlin to Vegas,

1179
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:29,920
 45 minute concerts. See, once you get a few things, yeah. Once you get a few things out there,

1180
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:37,440
 yeah, then you can do it. Yeah. Lawless Loughlin, all law. It is, it is the Loughlin's for scofflaws

1181
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:41,760
 that you can have them for free Loughlin. Loughlin's for scofflaws. Give them time to

1182
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:47,760
 get out of bed. Just like Virginia's for lovers. Loughlin's for scofflaws. And are there whores out

1183
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:56,560
 there? Is that the thing? Is that the other direction? I mean, sure. I'm pretty sure whores

1184
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:02,160
 are in every direction. Uh, but uh, I mean, you know what I mean? You want me to find your whore

1185
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:07,920
 in Loughlin? Legal whore. I know. No, I'm not thinking about, I'm thinking about Loughlin. Paul's

1186
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:13,040
 always thinking about, I'm trying to get Loughlin on the perump man wagon here. I don't know if

1187
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:18,800
 Loughlin has legal prostitution or not. See, and there should be because just like everything

1188
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:26,000
 technology based porn goes first. Where porn goes, technology goes. We are fucking so out of pocket.

1189
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:32,640
 No, I don't know what he's doing anymore. I'm just so glad that he warmed up his singing voice. We

1190
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:38,960
 want to train. The only way you can get a good train is if you run high speed rail on some horse.

1191
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:44,240
 You know where they show like the, the, the public access meetings and the one guy gets up and talks

1192
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:48,080
 and everyone's like, what is he talking about? That's this Paul's like the second guy at the

1193
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:54,480
 Loughlin. I'm just 10 years ahead. I'm just 10 years ahead. You're light years ahead buddy. Okay.

1194
01:09:54,480 --> 01:10:00,480
 But honestly, that's where technology is always guided by pornography. That is the truth from the

1195
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:07,120
 printing press to the Tijuana Bible to the speed train between Loughlin and Vegas is an overflow

1196
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:16,080
 airport. Poor leads the way. Absolutely. Absolutely. As always. And in conclusion,

1197
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:22,880
 in conclusion, split some rails on these horse and get this train built governor town meeting

1198
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:28,240
 adjourned meeting adjourned, adjourned. Hey, sharks, did you know the sex industry is a,

1199
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:36,160
 if you can, if you go to your industry, you build a whore train, people will come

1200
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:46,960
 get on the whole train. You can ride train. The whole train to Loughlin would be sold out every

1201
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:56,480
 day. And I'll fuck you at the station. I can't believe you're putting SJs new band name on blast.

1202
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:06,960
 Listen, I think that sounds fun. Just a party train full of loose, loose men and ladies.

1203
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:11,360
 I'm actually not here. I'm just me. I'm watching season two of severance, but I just like the

1204
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:19,440
 atmosphere. You're one nerdy guy on his laptop while there's just balls swinging bullet train

1205
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:26,160
 to Loughlin. That's what it would be anyway. Just a bunch of loose people. It would be people who

1206
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:35,040
 like the Colorado river. But the other thing is, man, that camp, it would make a bunch of these

1207
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:41,200
 people feel so like, because it ended up being, if it's a good high speed rail, 25 minutes tops,

1208
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:46,800
 Oh yeah. Plenty of time to clean up done. Don't have to be overly performative with your lover.

1209
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:52,000
 It's the rushing of cleaning. That's really what's been holding back the industry here in Vegas.

1210
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:59,200
 Don't rush me, but you've only got 25 minutes. So you better just get to the business,

1211
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:06,480
 do your business and clean up. Grab your copy of powers, get on that train and go.

1212
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:14,000
 Well, I hope everyone who has a governance over Loughlin's listening, I hope the Arizona

1213
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,840
 and Nevada governor have taken notice. They know what, you know, and you know,

1214
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:23,200
 isn't the founder of Loughlin, his name is like Ted Loughlin, right? Don Loughlin.

1215
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:28,800
 Have you even been on the cruise that tells you all this stuff? I've been on it twice today.

1216
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:33,120
 It does seem like a fun town. I've never split any horse there, but it's been, it's been fun.

1217
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:38,880
 Loughlin is for scoff laws. I mean, I'm going to tell you right now, if next year we had scoop

1218
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:44,000
 fest in Loughlin, it would be awesome. I'm on board. It would be on board the whole train to

1219
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:50,560
 Loughlin. I'll fuck you. We already have another location. We do. We do think it's maybe premature,

1220
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:54,960
 but I think we're pretty confident. I do. Yeah. This is our last year at the Orleans. I think.

1221
01:12:54,960 --> 01:13:01,040
 I think so. Yeah. Don't tell him that yet. Okay. Don't let the Orleans know yet. They don't listen.

1222
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:05,200
 Oh, you think I actually, they probably really grateful. We are happy with the Orleans. We love

1223
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,920
 the Orleans. Whoever's listening for the liens is working somewhere else in two months.

1224
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:14,080
 It's true. There is turnover there. The one tech guy, the one tech guy. We've had the same guy.

1225
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:20,000
 He's got it easy over there. Yeah. He's great. That's hard to replace. That's like probably

1226
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,640
 being like, like, you know, where the, the rats chew the wires. Oh yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. When

1227
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:28,800
 like the lights turn off, he's like the rat got to the wire again. Hold on. Exactly. Well, we're

1228
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:33,280
 coming to the end here and I just want to just say that let's go around the room and let's all just

1229
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:37,840
 say things that we could teach some, we could teach the people of Laughlin. Let's go. Laughlin

1230
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:45,680
 lessons is what we'll end on lessons. All right. Uh, take a fucking bath, you stinky cheese assholes,

 Okay. I'm good. Yeah. Okay. Thanks for this. Everybody. I want to thank Ben's left great in

01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,560
 and all the spilled jizz. Wash them trains.

1243
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:39,360
 That's farts in a bag dot biz. If you want to support the hay scoops railroad that's going out

1244
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:44,960
 to Laughlin. Head over to farts in a bag dot biz and preaching fun.com there for as little as two

1245
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:50,960
 dollars. You can be part of the railway to Laughlin experience. We're going to raise,

1246
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:57,520
 we're going to raise the bonus episode amounts to two billion. And if we hit it.

1247
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:04,960
 So many bonus episodes and a train to Laughlin. And just mouthfuls of boxcar wheelies. You're

1248
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:13,360
 just going to be choking on, on hobo rail riding wiener all day. I don't wash my ass or balls.

1249
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:27,280
 I've been fucking on the railroad. All these Laughlin whores with dirty seats and sweaty

1250
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:35,760
 beats. We're heading out to Laughlin. All right. Can you smell that Laughlin train?

1251
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:40,400
 It's coming down the track. You can smell that dirty underwear. There ain't no coming back.

1252
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:46,240
 All right. Thanks for this everybody. We love you and we'll see you soon.

1253
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:48,080
 You filthy Laughlin bitches.

1254
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,840
 There ain't no sensitivity when it's business and it's business.

1255
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:29,200
 Fucking whores in Laughlin. That's all I ever do.

1256
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:36,160
 It's fun down there. Y'all don't even know. I bet. I was trying to get in there. I don't know if

1257
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:40,480
 we're still on there. I don't know why I pulled my mic forward, but we're still there. I was trying

1258
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:43,200
 to get, I was trying to see if I could do magic shows out there. I love it out there. I think it's

1259
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:48,080
 so cool. Is your underwear stinky enough to get in? That's what they asked right away. Yeah. They

1260
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:54,320
 hand them over. And the answer so far is no. You'll get there. I guess the Febreze method works.

1261
01:17:54,320 --> 01:18:01,520
 Oh, covering it is oftentimes just worse. See ya. That's the joke I made. That's what I, and I

1262
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,280
 - I followed up.

1263
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,120
 - Follow up.
