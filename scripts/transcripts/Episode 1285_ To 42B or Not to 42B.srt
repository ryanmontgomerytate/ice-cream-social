 am willing for you to be made fun of by your peers I said fine with that trade

26
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,960
 off I packed it with my regular microphone road runs road rig microphones

27
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,160
 you know handheld microphones for right Africa Babel and I said I packed this

28
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,080
 one because that way I thought if I could drive and do that we could do the

29
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,080
 podcast while actually driving and like Mike Mills our producer/host said what a

30
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:47,120
 terrible idea well once we ended up driving through not one but two

31
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,000
 blizzards well that would have been distracting so trying to podcast would

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,920
 have been really really difficult we honestly I'm sad that we don't have just

33
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,640
 recordings of you guys trying to podcast through a blizzard yeah we we hit a

34
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,400
 second blizzard and we were all upset because the first blizzard was very much

35
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,600
 talked about in the news as is coming towards us and then we hit a second

36
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,840
 blizzard in India and I was like what no we had no idea we had no idea we're

37
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,160
 gonna hit a blizzard and then we we hit this gas station at like like midnight

38
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:29,560
 trying to fuel up and get some food and we're just surrounded by snow coming

39
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,880
 down it was I guess the tip of the lake they kept saying so like the flakes are

40
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,480
 really big chunky flakes tip of the lake I was like I'm not not to borrow from my

41
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:44,040
 clown name but chunky flakes a lot of chunky flakes coming down and then the

42
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,400
 clown the guy in the gas he was like oh my god no we're getting at least ten

43
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,980
 inches and I just heard from Valparaiso they're getting you know 15 inches and

44
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,720
 the other reports I mean everywhere I go it's like he was like don't go anywhere

45
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:59,680
 and one oh we were at a gas station in the middle of some town that they have

46
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,400
 hotels so terrible advice we were a gas station intended to give anyone we were

47
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,360
 going somewhere yes and then we were like kind of starting to panic about

48
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,680
 like what do we do and looking at the nearest hotels and then I remembered hey

49
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,840
 guys the all the information we just got was from a cashier at midnight in a gas

50
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:25,240
 station so like all of the reports are coming from you know one point even the

51
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,400
 cashier he's working with she was like can you chill out and he's like I'm just

52
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,120
 telling them

53
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:39,960
 great and then she was like that guy's a soft guy over there you can ask him and

54
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,720
 I was like well this is the kind of town we're in where we're actually at the

55
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,720
 coffee shop you know the coffee stop where the guy who's salt in the roads is

56
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,520
 there yeah I said oh you know the salt guys because he's my dad and I was like

57
00:04:50,520 --> 00:05:01,860
 we are in a tiny tiny town oh boy but you made it out we made it out we lost

58
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:08,120
 an hour driving from Milwaukee to Wabash Indiana and then we got in end up

59
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,040
 getting in with the snow at like five o'clock in the morning with a 9 a.m.

60
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,720
 lobby call so it's pretty great it's pretty great so we had two shows Wabash

61
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,320
 and then they put the man a two o'clock instead of four but we did two shows in

62
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,680
 Wabash we were a little delirious but they were super fun great crowds came

63
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:33,540
 out and including the else Roth's yeah and Michael else Roth always being a

64
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:40,400
 gentleman brought me a dr. pepper cream zero for me to delicious he knows is my

65
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,200
 favorite he goes brings him to scoop fest he knows he knows his stuff but I

66
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,440
 got to sneak out and have a little bite to eat with with the else Roth the hard

67
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,120
 part is always finding a hooker that's named dr. pepper cream zero I think he

68
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,440
 just tells how Matt happens to be in I think he just pays extra for whoever to

69
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:04,800
 just say it I don't think he can to do the legal name change does anyone who's

70
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,040
 in the commitment it's Michael else wrong that is true that is true so are

71
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,840
 you still in snowed in areas now or you're back no I'm back go back in Vegas

72
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,720
 yeah yeah yeah but you've been driving through crazy snowpack everywhere well

73
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,320
 yeah and the good the good news for me I seem like I was making the big

74
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,960
 sacrifice everyone else was flying out of Fort Wayne I drove the Sprinter van

75
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,640
 back to Cincinnati to drop off where we rented it from and flew out of

76
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,280
 Cincinnati and everyone's flights were messed up and delayed out of Fort Wayne

77
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,320
 and everything everything in Cincinnati is going off without a hitch so I was

78
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,900
 like if you look yeah would you drive three hours just to make sure your

79
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,900
 flights were totally normal you would say yes fine yeah yeah yeah there's some

80
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:58,600
 driving who decides to introduce letters to exit numbers you know this has been

81
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:04,360
 at the top of my list to talk about four years I'm glad we're finally getting to

82
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:10,120
 as a secondary component of the exit right so you go 42 B right so you go by

83
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:16,280
 exit 41 then 42 a 42 B 42 C and you're there come driving out here in fucking

84
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:23,520
 Pittsburgh you will it is everything is just blabbered a blabbered a blaze oh

85
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,440
 Pittsburgh is no I mean like it has so confused riding with the uber drivers in

86
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,760
 Pittsburgh it's the worst I just had I had to stop paying attention but it has

87
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,640
 to be a meeting right and that means some of the meeting goes whoa whoa whoa

88
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,360
 those exits are too close together to have their own numbers well I guess

89
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,840
 that's it I guess that's it numbers are mile markers yeah essentially mm-hmm I

90
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,760
 mean on the right on the interstates growing up you'd have the mile markers

91
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,200
 and then you would have an exit and the exit would serve as a mile they're

92
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,840
 supposed to correspond pretty closely yes right all right I guess the letters are

93
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,040
 just between the mile markers but yeah it seems like they've they've raged out

94
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,840
 of control Jacob Jacob just said something that makes a lot of sense and

95
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:17,600
 I feel dumb for bringing it up but no I think that's how it's supposed to be I

96
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,080
 don't think that's how it is out here well it's definitely because they're

97
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,280
 just too close exits like we have like on the freeway here we have you know the

98
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,160
 flamingo eggs and the tropical eggs that are not a mile apart from each other

99
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,640
 right the designs of all of it are just so it's just so bad I drove I had to

100
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,640
 drive in for class last night and just two or three times I was like god damn

101
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,960
 it where did you learn the driving in Pittsburgh just isn't designed at all no

102
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,200
 it's not and it's it's it's terrible roads stacked on each other over the

103
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,560
 years and I just you know we keep discovering everything in our society is

104
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:02,040
 built as a massive Psyop to confuse and upset us and control our brains and I

105
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,040
 feel like the driving shit is a big component of that too like they make

106
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,760
 these things now we're talking Jacob's making sense Paul saying it's because of

107
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:17,280
 a Psyop we're back in business I'm telling you it's all just like I mean of

108
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,080
 course the interstates were built for interstate trucking primarily but now we

109
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,880
 always have to use them to just get to our third and fourth jobs I don't know

110
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,000
 it just seems fucking insane to me how much we have with the interstates

111
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,480
 initially built primarily for trucking yes yes oh I didn't know that yeah

112
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,680
 Eisenhower was the president who did a lot of interstate stuff right yeah yeah

113
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:48,080
 yeah I like when you could point at a president and just casually list the

114
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:55,360
 thing that they did here's just something that happened under this

115
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,280
 administration that was just I don't know I guess a net positive I guess I

116
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,880
 don't know sure at the very least it's something that got accomplished also the

117
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,160
 crazy fucking thing with my commute now I've got into where I'm really leaving

118
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,640
 very early because I know how insane the commute can be but it's

119
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:23,640
 approximately I think as the crow flies as you'd say about 12 miles from my

120
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:29,480
 house good shape and I couldn't fly 12 miles if you paid and it takes me no

121
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:37,160
 less than 45 minutes yeah ever that's the that's the quickest ever that's just

122
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,960
 the amount of time that that trip takes because you got and I and I'm so I got

123
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:49,360
 so spoiled in Vegas too because it's all on a grid out here it's yeah be a horsey

124
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,380
 trail this guy owns a part of this this is where you cannot be this is a

125
00:10:54,380 --> 00:11:04,120
 demilitarized zone it's just fucking bananas the loopy doop floop driving shit

126
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,480
 on the horse 150 years ago does that how you were gonna get to work today yeah

127
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,840
 oh well there's the easiest way for the nag to get through without breaking its

128
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:20,200
 leg my wife I keep asking you not to call her that that'll work that'll work

129
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:26,280
 for a Porsche in about a hundred years that's perfect no problem yeah I'll be

130
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:31,740
 perfect for a German engineered piece of machinery horse rhymes with horse I'm

131
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:37,880
 sure it'll be fine anyway uh yeah so I've been busy with improv this week I

132
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,840
 had a free class on Saturday that I co-taught with my friend Sarah we had a

133
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,640
 couple of ladies come out we're gonna be working with them on a project too which

134
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,840
 is cool they got to see it big shout out to Malia for coming out to the class too

135
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,400
 and it was awesome to have her there and a couple other scoops Alex and Anna

136
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:01,040
 showed up which is awesome just great to see scoops coming through at my little

137
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,200
 events I don't know the algorithm is not promoting the stuff I'm promoting I

138
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,760
 thank every scoop for retweeting and putting out as much info on that class

139
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,840
 we could we still had nine people I promoted the shit I mean I got promoted

140
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,560
 I didn't pay for anything you're having a crazy winter aren't you that's part of

141
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,160
 it too yeah yes yeah ultimately it was we had nine people show up in two degree

142
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,040
 weather so that's pretty good right possible that everybody knew about it

143
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,400
 it's also possible that the algorithm just did its job and everybody in

144
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,000
 Pittsburgh knew about that class and just nine people were in it's possible

145
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,680
 it's quite possible it's cold as fuck it's cold as fuck out here and just

146
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,840
 insane and every time and like and then I was going to teach my new level one

147
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,200
 which had to get postponed I was teaching they're doing that yesterday so

148
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,840
 last night again I'm heading out early my class starts at 630 I'm in the car

149
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:57,280
 around 5 I open up the garage door and it's fucking snowing again it just

150
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:09,560
 doesn't stop but we've got a solid you know almost ten to twelve-inch he's got

151
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,880
 a solid twelve inches it's just not moving it's not going anywhere it's just

152
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,960
 there I've already had to dig out my mailbox I had to dig out a place for my

153
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:24,080
 fucking take out your mailbox I had to dig out the mailbox because the mail

154
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:31,400
 people were like please dig a path so we can get to your mailbox so I had to dig

155
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:36,360
 dig a big old path to get him yeah that big high of seven on Saturday scooping

156
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,560
 over girl yeah it's cold as fuck out here and then I dug a place to put my

157
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,440
 trash can so that it wouldn't be out on the street exactly you know and the

158
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:51,080
 plowing is is crazy so it's where I'm digging out is like 14 inches no I mean

159
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:56,400
 my buddy my oldest friends Pat said picture him and his kids standing on the

160
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:02,200
 Navis Inc River in Red Bank New Jersey oh that river never froze over the

161
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,160
 entire time that I lived in like my entire lifetime I've never heard of that

162
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:13,360
 river being frozen it was it was nuts this is when Matt goes into his no such

163
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,520
 thing as global warming because the river froze spiel now that's right

164
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,120
 exactly it the people just don't understand like it's guys it goes both

165
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,840
 ways it's real cold we've been asked to have an emergency Vegas parking and

166
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:38,960
 weather from Ryan is it me or is there a recent increase in people who insist on

167
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,040
 backing into parking spaces why is this what does it mean for our society as a

168
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,760
 whole I need an emergency Vegas parking and weather this is a great point I have

169
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,720
 noticed this too and I asked but I just like Jacob had a very logical answer for

170
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,040
 my exit thing there is a logical answer as to why there's an increase in this

171
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,420
 happening great because I've noticed this too I want to know the same thing

172
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:08,720
 quality of reverse cameras you're right yeah all these cars put much better ways

173
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,440
 where they show you the lane that you're turning in and everybody would rather

174
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,240
 park pulling out of their spot that way then backing up it's annoying ready rich

175
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,520
 has the best take on this is that you shouldn't be mad that people do it you

176
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,360
 should be mad that people are bad at it that's right because that's it it's like

177
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,680
 what happens is that it takes so much longer if you're waiting to park and

178
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,960
 you're behind someone and they have to do this giant production to get the car

179
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,760
 back into just pulling in a goddamn space I I'd like to I'm a backer inner

180
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:40,240
 I've been a backer inner for for decades unapologetically especially with the with

181
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,200
 the truck you know if I'm driving a pickup truck it's just so much easier to

182
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:49,960
 back in and then pull out nose first I am but yeah when people are bad at it

183
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,720
 it's terrible and if there are a line of cars behind me in the parking lot then I

184
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,040
 do the gentlemanly thing and I go nose in just just to do it a little faster so

185
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,840
 I don't have to pull forward and then back in yeah I'm a consummate pull

186
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:09,080
 through guy so I go all the way to the other side that's backing in but I'm

187
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,160
 going through and then then I'm ready to go that's only dangerous for like two

188
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,840
 split seconds yeah what do you mean dangerous if someone else is someone

189
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,920
 else wants to pull into the regular spot that you're pulling forward you don't

190
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,920
 understand how I do my pull throughs I park in BFE there is not another car

191
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:31,500
 around me my friend this is the thing that drives seriously and goes fucking

192
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,560
 crazy over my parking she's like you always zig when I think you're gonna

193
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:41,280
 sag manically I go I go so far away she's like the other night it was it was

194
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,160
 balls cold again the wind was blowing we had to go to Lowe's this was right

195
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:52,200
 before the fucking crazy storm hit and we went to go find a terracotta pot just

196
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,880
 in case we needed an emergency heater type thing we could pack because we had

197
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,940
 plenty of candles and we just needed a terracotta pot to use as an emergency

198
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:05,300
 heater if we absolutely lost power and everything went to shit hey man it works

199
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:14,120
 it fucking works so we went to go pot it was freezing cold backstage at Madison

200
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:21,240
 Wisconsin and and Mike noticed that the dressing rooms had old light bulbs not

201
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,320
 LEDs but old style light bulbs there's a yeah close the doors leave the lights on

202
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,800
 and we went and did a sound check and we came back took the toastiest dressing

203
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:36,720
 rooms we basically easy we easy baked ovened our dressing rooms and they are

204
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,680
 they are hot yeah this is how you fucking do it and yeah so these are the

205
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:47,800
 hacks but yeah I parked over by the garden section and pretty close to the

206
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,800
 front but there was nobody else there and we had to walk all the way and she's

207
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,080
 like what the fuck you doing Mattingly you're killing me this is crazy she's

208
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,800
 like just shivering and shaking the whole way and I'm cold too it's cold as fuck but

209
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,800
 then we got the thing and we're heading out the door and I'm like can we go back

210
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,560
 over to the door we came in on she's like no we have to go out this exit which

211
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:11,520
 is even farther away from where you fucking parked and I'm I didn't know I

212
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,320
 thought we could go out the front again she's like no we can't why did you do

213
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,640
 this this is insane that's really she she does not like my parking but I don't

214
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:27,800
 sound like this she does but my parking could not be could not be safer in so

215
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:39,080
 much as there's no one there no I don't like people combat park when it when the

216
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:44,640
 spaces are diagonal you don't back into spots when they're dying what that's

217
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,960
 right even no you don't you do not back into that's that's how they're designed

218
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,160
 and so you don't have to back yet yeah that's of the douches and still do it

219
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:01,440
 buddies literally doing that right now listen to me douches stop it here you

220
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,720
 hear you douches that's like almost doing a donut to get into that shit that's

221
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,680
 making a you what a load of people do that in the Caesars parking garage all

222
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:18,440
 the time sure has the angled parking spots but they will get into the the

223
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,080
 wrong lane you know they'll be they'll be going up the down lane and now they

224
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,160
 have to back into the spot just because they they can't get into it that's a

225
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,600
 double douche it's not to two negative don't make a positive that's a double

226
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,400
 douche that stays double douche it's two squared it doesn't make a positive I

227
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:39,440
 don't know when I see them doing it I give them the stink eye they know what

228
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,120
 they did they know what they did we've got snow lined up on the streets

229
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,680
 everywhere still and the small as the roads already are it makes some lanes

230
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:54,080
 like even more super tight so it's a little dodgeball out there we should

231
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,680

00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,800
 of Jacob with the construction of the giant guitar a lot of cool behind the

250
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,280
 scenes picture the new hard rock guitar I was walking under that the other day

251
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:45,040
 and snap the pic of it to to send out to the scoops yeah yeah they're the the

252
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:51,080
 cross pieces on it they're starting to test the the lights oh cool Wow so it's

253
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,640
 still I think like a year out from being open but they're starting to test like

254
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:01,560
 individual those these giant LED lights that cross the entire tower they're

255
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,760
 started to test those out and yeah it's pretty fucking cool it's it seems like

256
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,840
 it's curving back up so like the shape of the guitar is kind of completing if

257
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,520
 you want to see something that kind of looks like it if you're curious about it

258
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,400
 though there's one in Miami that is similar to the one the one that they're

259
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,320
 building here but the one they're building here is just right on the Las

260
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,160
 Vegas strip and I mean right on it like yeah all the other casinos are set back

261
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:31,480
 from the road this tower is like next to the sidewalk that's crazy that that's

262
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,520
 wild and it's gonna yeah it's gonna stick out like a sore thumb but that's

263
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,760
 it's the landscape of it dramatic yeah the strip is definitely gonna be but

264
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,360
 that's what you got to do and then we've also got photos from Matt on the road so

 fun back in the day I don't know anymore I don't even know if ever the will the

311
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:34,000
 people ever listen to I don't know what the fuck's going on at the time it

312
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,320
 didn't seem like it was but now it seems like it really was oh god damn shit is

313
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:47,840
 fucking crazy right now it's crazy oh somebody wrote us the other day on pod

314
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,040
 therapy actually as this comes out of that show might not even be released yet

315
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:55,240
 so I might be crossing timelines here but they were saying because you know we

316
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:01,120
 commented on pod therapy when the most recent presidential election happened and

317
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,800
 just said you know basically let's all let's all stay calm and react to things

318
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:11,520
 as they happen and you know a lot of things have happened since then and

319
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,560
 continued to and so they wrote in and they said you know hey you guys you know

320
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,600
 you said react things as they're happening and now a lot of things are

321
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:26,560
 happening and now what and we were like yeah you whatever you want ever you

322
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:32,160
 think about that that's that's what we think too we agree that's yep I am that's

323
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,840
 that's just it I have a lot of friends in Minneapolis from the improv community

324
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:41,400
 back in the day many apps sure I'm so grateful that we got to go out there

325
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,440
 that you brought me along for that festival just recently because I got to

326
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,040
 get a taste of that place and the people who were working a huge at the time got

327
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,920
 to take me on a quick little tour we went around they showed me the George

328
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:58,560
 Floyd Floyd Memorial and everything so I was in that whole zone right like it was

329
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:05,800
 chill no Minneapolis is a great city and there's a lot of pride in it and so like

330
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:11,000
 what I'm seeing in my timeline is like I am actually like really proud of my

331
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,960
 Minneapolis friends I feel like I feel like I feel like oh yeah I feel like

332
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,800
 they chose the wrong city to mess with in a lot of ways yeah it really seems

333
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:26,320
 like that I proud is a good word it's they're doing a really good job I feel

334
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,000
 bad this is just arbitrarily heaped on them because someone was mad they didn't

335
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,760
 win the state in an election oh no I'm not mad about that at all I have I am

336
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:41,800
 thoroughly not bothered by the arbitrariness to heaping on Minneapolis

337
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:49,640
 the shit that just that seems fine blows my mind the stuff that just making me so

338
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:56,040
 I don't know not hopeless but I'm very curious as to where we go from here in a

339
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:03,000
 lot of ways because it seems to me that no one is exempt from this shit no

340
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,280
 matter what side of the aisle it's getting you know where we're going from

341
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:12,320
 this we're going we're going to full-on anarchy colonies Mad Max style I think

342
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,480
 you might be right Jacob because here we go it's just gonna be city-states it's

343
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,960
 gonna be old-school city-states there's no one each other Athens and Sparta

344
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:29,400
 there is no no for me there is no one at the federal level I would trust in any

345
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:34,320
 respect so how do you take directions like there's no one to give us a voice

346
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,600
 there's no one to unify and say hey maybe this is our next move or maybe we

347
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,560
 should try and improve this next you know there's no there's no steps that

348
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:48,800
 are being lined out there's no actionable plan to be taken as I simply

349
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:55,800
 do not trust anyone and I mean nominate you Paul Paul you should take us to take

350
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:01,480
 us to the promised land no no ah all right no Jacob will you I'm just gonna

351
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,880
 go around the horn here no I don't I don't know that I don't I'll go to the

352
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,480
 rest of the zoom technical school port will you take us to the promise it's not

353
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,880
 supposed to be any one person it's not supposed to be any one person that's why

354
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,280
 we have a group of government oh you know you're right Paul you're right Matt

355
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:24,920
 I think we're doing wrong zoom chat zoom chat this group of people will you take

356
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:29,840
 us to the promised you know one person it's a group of people I would love to

357
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:37,880
 have scoop community lead us into whatever's next for a fee for a fee

358
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,680
 there's a patreon level for that chaotic clumsy who the fuck knows what's going

359
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:46,640
 on anyway I'm just SJ just texted me she is at the hotel in Canada oh good she

360
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,120
 made it back they didn't she made it back her passport well we were a little

361
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,440
 leaving Canada because she's there on like a work visa thing you know it's all

362
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,120
 legit and everything and she was like leaving and then coming back in less

363
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,920
 than a day later during the during my work visa that was the only thing that

364
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:09,840
 she was a little itchy about going back yet of course but I like it all she has

365
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,480
 the paperwork for everything and it was all just legit Paul it is nice that is

366
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,920
 the nice thing about doing this in your late 20s versus your early 20s is you're

367
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,840
 you're prepared and you're just doing it all legit this time we did it in our

368
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,640
 early 20s we were just doing like tourist visas be like what we're not

369
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,400
 working while we're here I still remember bring a suitcase of mr.

370
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:42,740
 Piffles customs of being like it's just for friends gonna show it off to some

371
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:48,700
 pals right if we had our merch confiscated multiple times by Canadian

372
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:54,120
 officials sell t-shirts and mr. Piffles dolls what what do you do they hold it

373
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,080
 for you to come back is that how that yeah yeah pick it back up on your way

374
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,160
 out yeah that's not so bad if they sell it at the duty-free shops I was gonna

375
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:06,920
 say I doubt they just doubt they just hold on to it for you now anymore yeah I

376
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:13,000
 don't think anybody's doing us any favors at the borders these days I think

377
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,680
 our goodwill ship has sailed back through and everybody's wearing the dog

378
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:22,640
 who knows shirt yeah Paul just say I was I did Penn Sunday school yesterday and

379
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,200
 again yes this will probably come out before that so we're jumping on podcasts

380
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:31,040
 in multiple directions here okay but Penn always brings up it's a quote

381
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,840
 attributed Gandhi but people are suspicious whether it is but that it is

382
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:39,720
 first they ignore you then they laugh at you then they fight you and then you win

383
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:46,840
 and the the quote is about fight you stage yes yeah I mean there is reason to

384
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:52,760
 be hopeful Donald talks about all time protests always work protests always

385
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:58,240
 work yeah and I know I brought up on presented school the counter example you

386
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,160
 know that I don't like is there was anti-abortion protests my whole life and

387
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,920
 I thought there's no way they're gonna take away freedom of choice from from

388
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,640
 women that's that's a right it's it's it's really bigoted towards one gender

389
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:19,420
 that's the way laws supposed to work but it did it worked so January's you're

390
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:25,520
 absolutely right j6 definitely kind of worked it worked so you know we were at

391
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,760
 that we were at the fight and jail phase of of the protest movement so yeah I'm

392
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,400
 just my hope is that we can survive the fighting the fighting stage yeah I agree

393
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:41,200
 with you I think the I think the the the old way is is dying and this and these

394
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,200
 are the death throes yes there is some of that too I just hope we can we can

395
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,000
 survive it I hope we're good at the end of it and a lot of people who are staying

396
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,520
 on the sidelines are no longer staying on this like it is it is it is galvanizing

397
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,560
 what is happening that is true yeah well I've certainly I've certainly seen you

398
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,900
 know plenty within the podosphere coming forth and letting our voices be heard

399
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,960
 and I don't want us to be out of that conversation anyway I want everybody to

400
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,020
 know which side we're on at least what side I'm on for sure and I want

401
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:13,080
 everybody to know they're not alone out there we see it we feel it we hear it

402
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:19,520
 it's fucking horrible and I like guess like Matt said we're coming together

403
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,760
 we're getting out there we're getting our voices heard and we're gonna get

404
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,560
 through it somehow I think so we don't have any choice we don't have any choice

405
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,040
 but to get through it I mean I don't think we'll ever do things that are

406
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,680
 better for the environment there's certain things I've think the ship is

407
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:35,080
 sailed on but I think for protecting our own freedom and stuff I think we're

408
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,720
 gonna we're gonna get better at it hopefully hopefully yeah the river will

409
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,800
 freeze over a few more times and somebody will go hey wait a minute well

410
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,580
 I mean it's all fucking connected right like I truly believe we're gonna have to

411
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:53,440
 dismantle these goddamn data centers and holding cells we're gonna have to

412
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,640
 dismantle all that we're gonna actually physically have to get in there and

413
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:03,600
 break apart some structures I'm following there's a new giant data

414
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:09,480
 center being built in rural Louisiana not too terribly far away from my mom's

415
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:14,960
 house mm-hmm and so I've been following this and it's it's a you know huge it's

416
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,960
 I I don't even know how many multiple acres yeah yeah acres and acres of

417
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:27,240
 warehouse being built and it's the new meta like AI Center and it's being built

418
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:33,800
 in a town of like I don't know a few thousand people and everybody there is

419
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:39,800
 just like scared and yeah weirdly in the dark about everything that's happening

420
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,800
 cuz it's gonna it's gonna take all their water supply it's gonna fuck that's it

421
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,480
 it's water electricity is gonna be a thing and yeah the fact that they can

422
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,080
 just arbitrarily decide well now electricity cost five times what it used

423
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:57,640
 to because we need more of it for this I guess so Will Smith can eat spaghetti in

424
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:03,760
 a more convincing way what the fuck man you know what I was off of it and

425
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,000
 so you said that now I'm kind of back out you're back on you like being more

426
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,480
 convincing will buy spaghetti if I watch unbelievable spaghetti eating it ruins

427
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:16,440
 my day noodles yeah oh we got to do something to get through this uncanny

428
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,320
 valley I'll tell you what else we're gonna do to get through it and that's

429

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:52,120
 metaphor I think you just put like essentially what's gonna happen yeah hey

451
00:39:52,120 --> 00:40:03,320
 I'm just a plain old barn right barn restaurant tour difference what's the

452
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:11,000
 tenth that is doing he's right here doing the dip I want to do a Matt was

453
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:17,440
 right segment beast games continues to be the craziest fucking bat shit thing on

454
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,600
 television anywhere I'm on episode up to episode 3 with my kids are watching that

455
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:28,880
 oh my god I see that survivor also can't watch it it scares me to see it okay so

456
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:35,560
 last year this is a spoiler never mind I'll wait it's crazy though like last

457
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,240
 year we talked we talked about beast games because Matt started what Matt

458
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,680
 started watching beast games with his kids that's right came out yeah because

459
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:47,520
 Matt Matt's kids like every other child on the planet watches mr. beast on

460
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:53,960
 YouTube uh-huh and so watch that I watched it because I love really bizarre

461
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:59,520
 reality TV game shows like the the competition reality TV thing is like a

462
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,920
 weird spot that I like to dig into in these things games is truly like the

463
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:10,840
 weirdest one it is this year is much more competition based and less

464
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:15,320
 psychological torture based so far yes that I've been watching so that part I

465
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:20,160
 like it is still so funny where he sets up things to have like this twist and

466
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:25,080
 when people don't become absolute assholes it's so clear he's so

467
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:31,680
 disappointed like he's so upset people I am on episode 4 yeah I'm one episode

468
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:37,000
 ahead of you yeah and I'm gonna tell you that he has noticed that too and

469
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 changes some of his tactics going forward to get them to do it so the

470
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:53,840
 niceness might not continue as it is in the earlier episodes it doesn't go it

471
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,280
 does not go to psychological torture though I mean it definitely doesn't do

472
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:03,100
 that laugh about it the first season there was so much crying yes and so much

473
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:09,120
 like it was just awful yeah I can't I can't do it it makes me upset to see in

474
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,000
 the clips like I said I'll just get something else come up in a scroll I'm

475
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:19,040
 like oh this looks awful yeah I know it's tough but it is it is really like

476
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:24,040
 super we I watched this one this other reality show competition game out of

477
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:31,120
 Korea because they make some fucking weird ones over there and this is the

478
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:38,440
 idea of it and the execution of it both are so much bigger and stranger because

479
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,960
 of it because they're doing these things on such a large scale I mean when they

480
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,600
 when they filmed it in Vegas they were in Allegiant Stadium they go out to

481
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:53,520
 these places out just in the open areas and build these giant scale things and

482
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,520
 it is weird the amount of effort that goes into something that is so stupid

483
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:05,960
 yeah yeah yeah I say that as a podcaster but we have it on the effort and we're

484
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:17,960
 we're right we're in check we're in check we got it we got it I don't know I

485
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:22,480
 keep watching it and I'm like every time I go every time it says TV PG at the

486
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,400
 beginning of it I notice that and I think of your kids and I go like yeah

487
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,000
 cuz kids are cuz kids are watching this and I've been trying to watch it through

488
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:37,680
 the lens of a young person watching it which is impossible for me to do it is

489
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:43,360
 it bothers me on it doesn't bother me but it like it it it makes me

490
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:49,800
 uncomfortable on a different level yes well on a more positive media note new

491
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:55,040
 show new show note I will shout out mystery science theater and rift tracks

492
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:00,440
 are combining again or should I say rift tracks is basically re taking up the

493
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,840
 mantle of mystery science theater 3000 and they are going to produce four new

494
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:16,480
 episodes utilizing Kevin and Mike and oh my god Bill from the OG rift tracks crew

495
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:23,000
 as you know reprising their roles Tom Sarvone Crowe and him and yeah it's

496
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,400
 gonna be really cool to see them back in the saddle instead of the whole new crew

497
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,840
 which nothing against the new crew for the most part there were one or two

498
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:36,160
 times that whoever was voicing Crowe on a couple of this last season I was like

499
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:45,280
 shut up they were just screaming like that is not the fucking voice but yeah

500
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,200
 it's already up to 1.6 million on Kickstarter that's amazing brand new

501
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:53,160
 thing and they've still got 45 days to go something like that wow but it's a

502
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:58,520
 wonderful thing to see them back at it and this is the rift tracks fans coming

503
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,760
 through big time for them because I've backed several of their kickstarters to

504
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:08,280
 a back the mystery science theater crew too but I am far more in the camp of

505
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:13,040
 what rift tracks has been doing than the last because laughing and more than the

506
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:19,040
 than the MS the last MSC 3k failed because people were just kind of like

507
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:24,120
 that like because that last season was just not great and it's because they

508
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:28,040
 really jacking around with who they had voicing Crowe they had a couple people

509
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,560
 really knew how to do it but then if you're watching a movie and someone's in

510
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:40,000
 there shut fucking up I can't I love the things that bother you about about

511
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:48,640
 movies Paul it's I watched that mystery science theater 3,000 season and there

512
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,640
 was a single time that the robots voices even occurred the most recent one the

513
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,000
 most recent season I don't know if you saw this most recent season I didn't see

514
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,560
 the most recent one you'd because you would go oh shit I can't unhear this

515
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:08,760
 it's awful it's awful it's just a screeching banshee and and it just ruins

516
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:14,400
 any of it so they had good performers that first reboot they were fine I was

517
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,560
 like this is great you know let's go but now I'm really excited because it's the

518
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,400
 old bots with the old voices it's you know you don't want weird sounding

519
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,920
 Muppets it's the same shit people are all on the Kermit thing too you know

520
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,640
 there's something to it there's really something to it and you know Kermit the

521
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:36,420
 Frog always said it's not easy being blue hey invent some new robots they

522
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:40,280
 invented some new robots throw them in there that's fine but also just don't be

523
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:45,160
 screechy screechy ain't gonna just goddamn screechy ain't funny it's not

524
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,320
 not Dustin Diamond is he's no longer with us yeah he's no longer and so I

525
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:53,640
 mean just just bringing it up and it's truly in bad taste so everybody who is

526
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,600
 doing screech impressions on mystery science theater 3,000 episodes just

527
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,240
 stop it exactly well they've they've stopped it because they didn't get fun

528
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:06,080
 in our last one but anyway Mary Jo Peel is gonna be back as Miss Forrester and

529
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,960
 that's gonna be funny Pearl Forrester so that's gonna be funny too they got the

530
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:14,720
 proper antagonist with them I think it's gonna be quite good I'm looking forward

531
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:20,480
 to the new four episode mini season thing I went ahead and backed it on the

532
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,360
 Kickstarter and of course got to get my physical media on so I ordered the four

533
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:32,080
 DVDs and VHS tape yeah the VHS tapes are going up dude the money on those it's

534
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:36,400
 crazy it's true I don't doubt it they're really expensive now comparatively

535
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,640
 especially like horror I think it's dumb but I don't doubt it I know it's done

536
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,120
 but there is a huge market for it but anyway just want to say shout out to the

537
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:48,280
 rift tracks guys I listen to them every night pretty much Matt have you dipped a

538
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:53,280
 toe yet on the old to be did you take in any of the rift tracks films yet to try

539
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:59,480
 and use them as sort of your lullabies I have not used them as lullabies or check

540
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,680
 them out I should I should really should you really should they had some really

541
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,320
 great stuff in there right now yeah I'm about to do another two-week stint on

542
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:12,640
 the old Sun Princess so maybe I can crack it then well and I'll just put this out

543
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,640
 there's my number one recommendation for anyone who wants to see if they like

544
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:23,360
 this kind of shit go on to be look up rift tracks and then watch samurai cop

545
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:30,240
 the samurai cop episode of riff tracks is one of the funniest things I've seen

546
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:37,160
 it so many times still laugh my ass off even just thinking about it it is a

547
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:44,840
 super cheese-o B movie action thing it's crazy I it's great you know if you if

548
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:49,880
 you grew up like us when that was the thing like you know aping commando and

549
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:55,560
 all those kind of things but samurai cop god damn it's the movie is so crazy on

550
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:02,760
 its own so check it out if you get a chance it's also amazing like how many

551
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:09,680
 movies have they covered they are I think they they're cracking around 500

552
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:14,080
 maybe more it's amazing like how many like because it's not like there's a

553
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:18,560
 certain aesthetic because there's a lot of like just bad bad yes yes and it's

554
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:22,600
 it's it's it's a very fine needle of thread you wouldn't think but it really

555
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:28,560
 is and there's some of them that are better than others by far basically it

556
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:33,320
 feels like what their show basically is is it seems like if Penn's old movie

557
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:37,560
 night had morphed into a podcast I mean yeah that's what you know mystery

558
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,880
 science theater was always that but there there has to be a certain level of

559
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,840
 watchability to the movie that's right it can't just be absolute trash

560
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:49,960
 unwatchable and again has to have decent audio and all that kind of thing

561
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,440
 because otherwise it just you know you can't sit there for two hours and

562
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,320
 watch it and there's been a couple of of them that are really pushing the line

563
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:03,040
 because they are digging pretty deep in the catalog but yeah man oh god this

564
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:07,320
 samurai cop will fucking well I mean we we learned that lesson too with some of

565
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:13,040
 the episodes of what was the the Michael Landon angel show oh yes I would have a

566
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:17,320
 highway to heaven I would have it not all gems not all some of those were just

567
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:21,720
 so bad you can't make fun of them right oh this thing's like I love the movie

568
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,080
 night at Penn's house it was like one of my favorite things and then when I was

569
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,720
 younger and I had a house full of guys that's what we do we would just flip to

570
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,960
 find the worst movies on HBO and make fun of them it was an activity I loved

571
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,680
 it I miss it I was like I'm basically hoping like my kids are now getting funny

572
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,840
 enough that like if I can get them on board I have to figure out a way to like

573
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:42,160
 get them into the idea of making fun of a movie while we watch it out loud to

574
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,880
 make use of the lap but I feel like I can recreate it with my with my boys

575
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,040
 right now show them some mystery science theater riff tracks has some some

576
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:53,840
 question like samurai cop would not be suitable for your young ins it's it's

577
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:57,760
 violent and there's boobies and shit circles and circles you wanted me to show

578
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,560
 them terrifier three I mean I do still want you to show them terrifier three on

579
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:05,000
 Christmas I would give you I might I would I might actually give you money for

580
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:14,640
 that it's the first 15 minutes it lose their fucking minds all right tell you

581
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:19,600
 what if Matt loses jock vs. nerd today he's showing his kids terrifier 3 on Christmas

582
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:40,120
 the hunt for balls we have a winter Olympics themed scooperty from freehold

583
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:47,600
 scoop today the categories are curling biathlon luge and bobsled I'm up first

584
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:52,560
 oh let's see I'll try curling for 400 this is how much the stones that the

585
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:59,480
 players slide down the ice way in pounds within five this is the first one this

586
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,600
 is the first how much does the Rockwell is the first question but Jacob they're

587
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:08,680
 called stones and you know in Europe when you say oh I lost 30 stone or more

588
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:13,400
 oh you know or I lost five stone over the summer vacation because I stopped

589
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:20,900
 eating gummy bears or whatever so maybe I believe that's 20 pounds you think you

590
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:25,520
 think one stone is 20 pounds I was about to say I don't know I think that's what

591
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:37,360
 it is uh fine Paul 20 pounds that's my logic all right let's try it 42 oh the

592
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:42,000
 answer 42 that's much heavier than that's heavier than 20 that's two

593
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,660
 not within five at all I think it's well I don't know what it's I thought is one

594
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:48,760
 I was gonna ask you is one stone 20 pounds that's what I thought I say

595
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:55,240
 somebody weighs how many stones oh it's 14 pounds oh one stone is 14 pounds yes

596
00:52:55,240 --> 00:53:06,040
 sorry Paul you're up okay um biathlon let's go for 14 for 400 biathlon

597
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:11,640
 combines cross-country skiing and this other sport target shooting target

598
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:15,600

00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:31,080
 household devices to melt the ice causing the stones to go further and

601
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:41,360
 curl less rooms brooms and rushes chimney chimchimmy chimchim surey Jeff Loomis not

 in my house it's me I'll try bobsled 400 mmm an Olympic bobsled team consists of

603
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:57,660
 either two athletes or this many I believe it's four I believe of two or

604
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:02,600
 four yeah don't they have single-person bobsleds or are they called something

605
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:08,280
 that's skeleton oh that's right skeletons over you lie down yes feet

606
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:12,120
 first skeleton what's the one what's the one where you go headfirst is that the

607
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:18,720
 last skeleton head first and skeleton feet first is luge oh maybe that's the

608
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:25,880
 first question on luge Paul you're up I will take biathlon for 8 by athlete

609
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:31,920
 shoot it targets from two positions standing and this lower position fucking

610
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:39,840
 that's why they're biathletes they have to show that they're biathletes yeah

611
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:44,680
 fucking a lady and the other is fucking a dude

612
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:57,880
 band kick kneeling one leg up kneeling prone prone like the like the oh so we

 pronin yeah I'll do curling for 1200 all right oh shit oh my god the target

616
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:39,200
 scoring area of the ring is called this the same thing you might call your

617
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:52,320
 residents buck house domicile to the tickle house

618
00:55:52,320 --> 00:56:05,640
 this is the house or the I think it's home base like in tag oh I think it's

619
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:08,760
 just home I think it's just home

620
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:15,280
 they send it home I think that's what that's from I'll go I'll go with home

621
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:24,520
 all right the house we were close nobody listens to Jacob I would have been

622
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:31,560
 closer to the fuck house yeah it's me I'll try but curling well I'll try

623
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:35,720
 biathlon for 1200 to both in Vegas you should know the house always wins

624
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:40,000
 athletes must hit targets at this distance in meters during Olympic

625
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:48,000
 competition within five meters 14 pounds Jacob 14 pounds final answer it's

626
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:58,760
 English money I feel like it's I want to say it's like 25 but it might be 50 I

627
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:13,120
 don't I got a pass Paul I'll go 50 all right it is 50 yeah I'm a biathlete sure

628
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:22,440
 Paul you're up I'll do it for 2000 let's go daily double look at this here we go

629
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:29,320
 Norway's all inner yours run holds the record for most olympic biathlon medals

630
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:39,040
 with this many within three or John for every in our board Boria Dean borderland

631
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:45,280
 borderland for every person offended by Paul's accent earlier think about how

632
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:54,000
 the norwegians feel okay only in our borderland Bjorn Bjorn Dylan that's it

633
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:02,960
 so those things only come around so often four years four years I think no

634
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:14,520
 no Matt every so often can you win multiple medals like swimming yeah in

635
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:23,040
 biathlon I mean I think I just win for the biathlon that I'll go here right I'll

636
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:31,880
 go with five okay let's see 13 Jesus fuck me what you were doing the right

637
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:38,080
 math you just did not get close to what Norway shit early in your version so

638
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:41,880
 well you just had he had multiple events to place in I didn't realize it was a

639
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:48,760
 multiple event I mean you're assuming he I'm not assuming anything only I only

640
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:55,560
 don't know only is a dude's name sure I think all right great double down same

641
00:58:55,560 --> 00:59:07,640
 points is only a man Matt you're up I got a curling for 2000 the main two types of

642
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:12,280
 shots are curler throws are draws and this other type designed to remove the

643
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:22,360
 opponent stones dickhead ministration boppers boppers great answer if it's not

644
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:29,300
 called Bob should be boppers I'm gonna go with knockouts oh good guess good

645
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:41,840
 guess I'm getting Chinese food later tonight I can't fucking wait I'll go

646
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:47,280
 bobsled for 800 the athlete who steers the bobsled from the front position is

647
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:55,840
 called this captain suicide Edward his name is Edward it's something about the

648
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:00,840
 hell they have like a leash right it's like it's a couple of little strings

649
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,960
 pull things yeah a little pulley string so it's probably something like the

650
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:09,720
 leashman or the the stringman the leashman I saw those I saw those guys

651
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:19,960
 they played prim the quartet I saw it with Chuck Connors was still on it

652
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:27,080
 deletion but he says they saw Chuck Connors in the leachman nobody saw Chuck

653
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:40,000
 Connors in the leachman ah it's like the the steerer or the wheel man there you

654
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:45,720
 go wheel man he's the wheel man he's using ropes he's like the rope stir or

655
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:50,680
 something no they call him the wheel man ironically Paul oh because he drives to

656
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:56,640
 the event well uses his feet probably - oh I don't know I don't think I don't

657
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:01,160
 think they use their feet yeah it's on a thing uh yeah I don't I don't know I

658
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:12,260
 passed Paul okay here we go they use their feet final answer ropesman show me

659
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:21,760
 ropesman pilot or driver well well well well well aren't we creative mr. Bob

660
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:29,320
 sled or should I call you Robert sled Paul you're up fuck I'll do luge for

661
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:34,480
 2000 oh let's do it I gotta get back on Germany has dominated Olympic luge

662
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,680
 winning approximately this fraction of all gold medals in the sports history

663
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:48,200
 within ten percent 73 percent Jacob that is dominant for sure let's see I'm sorry

664
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:52,960
 it's 60% you're off by three percent

665
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:16,480
 oh no now that I've leapt into second place by the way we got five questions

666
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:21,120
 left quick score check I am currently winning with zero you're not uncatchable

667
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:31,360
 donnelly Matt has negative 2400 anybody negative 4000 anybody just say at this

668
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:36,240
 point in the show that the three of us really know our winter Olympic sports oh

669
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:41,880
 got that winter Olympic fever that's right man I think it's the flu Matt

670
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:50,520
 you're up let's go I'll go lose for 1200 okay luge runs are time to this tiny

671
01:02:50,520 --> 01:03:01,120
 fraction of a second where races are often decided my penis oh it does come

672
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:11,920
 in second I would guess thousands oh good get a thousandth of a second I mean

673
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:17,600
 that's a that is a tiny fraction of a second on thousand yeah I'm sorry it's

674
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:25,000
 100 ah mr. by mr. by one order of magnitude a bridge too far a bridge too

675
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:35,520
 far gift of the Magi last place is within my grasp mattingly mine too this is the

676
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:41,100
 maximum weight limit in pounds for a four-person bobsled including crew

677
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:48,340
 within 100 pounds well each of the people weigh a hundred and twenty pounds yes so

678
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:55,720
 that's another five hundred and and twenty pounds right plus some of them

679
01:03:55,720 --> 01:04:02,920
 been snacking so that's okay 550 just for the people about 550 550 maybe let's

680
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:07,480
 let's be generous their athletes they're hefty muscle weighs more than fat let's

681
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:13,240
 say 600 just for the four individuals okay the thing itself is very lightweight

682
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:21,000
 I think the sled the sled I would imagine the sled the chassis is all

683
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:30,040
 fiberglass II right sure it's something yeah so I don't know 30 pounds for the

684
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:36,080
 chassis okay then you've got to have the structure and the thing to hold it

685
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:40,160
 together that's where the real weight comes in but I would see isn't the

686
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:44,960
 thing holding it together no I'd say the the the legs and the thing would be the

687
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:54,960
 that's that's another 200 so probably get 250 for the whole kitten caboodle so

688
01:04:54,960 --> 01:05:04,400
 250 plus 600 so 850 that would be my guess okay I pass Paul you're up all

689
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:10,600
 right so the so 850 I think would be a safe bet maximum weight I'm gonna guess

690
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:20,480
 is a thousand let's try a thousand I'm sorry 1389 pounds I underestimated you

691
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:30,320
 underestimated Paul you're up yet Luz and Bob sled left Bob sled down on the farm

692
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:36,800
 for 2000 Jamaican famously competed in this year's Winter Olympics inspiring

693
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:45,720
 the film cool runnings Oh cool runnings happened when I was still in high school

694
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:54,120
 which had to be 92 or 93 okay John Candy was alive right but when was that winter

695
01:05:54,120 --> 01:06:20,000
 Olympics okay now I got to count it down so 6 2 18 10 6 to 98

696
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:41,960
 94 90 had to be in 1990 I guess 1990 and it wasn't that's not even I was off by

697
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:50,600
 two years somewhere we're gonna lose two years or gain two man I suck a man Matt

698
01:06:50,600 --> 01:07:03,880
 yet lose for 400 or 800 no matter what you do it doesn't matter I'll do one

699
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:07,680
 bomb sled question right but then I clearly lost that money somewhere lose

700
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:14,200
 sleds have no break so athletes slow down using these parts of their body

701
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:21,360
 what parts of their body they use to slow the sleds down I think it's grow

702
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:29,600
 them whoa Bob Evans it's like a beaver tail just like dragging it down

703
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:40,480
 oh if you're if you're scrotum as beaver tail oh I mean it's gotta answer feet

704
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:47,040
 right it has to be one of the I'm done guessing at this at this fucking game is

705
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:52,560
 it is it their knees the back of their own heads now the luge are they on

706
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:55,600
 there on there are they on their stomach or on the on their back no they're on

707
01:07:55,600 --> 01:08:00,680
 their backs they're sitting skeleton his head first okay so the sitting loses

708
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:10,080
 feet first okay chaotic either hand they use their opponent's stones oh they

709
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:17,480
 throw up parachutes I'll say hands let's try hands their feet

710
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:25,280
 damn it I've been really gonna marry it down to 50/50 on this one the wrong way

711
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:29,680
 every time you have been really good at least saying the correct answer

712
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:37,560
 somewhere in your discussion I'm closing out the category and the game lose for

713
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:43,080
 400 if I get this question right one of us will be in positive points well I'm

714
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:49,600
 not counting a day unlike Bob's letters who sit upright yes lose up right news

715
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:56,800
 athletes race in this body position they're on their backs yeah wait a

716
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:01,400
 minute Jacob that puts you in positive points

717
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:10,800
 400 points I will just happened is I won the game with 400 points Matt is in

718
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:16,120
 second place though with negative 4400 points and Paul is in third place with

719
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:25,080
 negative 7200 points Winter Olympics catch the fever everybody the fever get

720
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:30,820
 pumped JJ just popped in the chat I'm trying to get JJ on earlier but she had

 so long that you are just de-aging because the Disney the Disney magic is

741
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:52,540
 just continually de-aging you I'll tell you what I I've gone places where people

742
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:56,680
 are like she's a vampire Matt was at the crazy castle in Savannah Illinois where

743
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:59,760
 people that tour it try to get me to stand in front of a mirror and then they

744
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:07,240

 we will not do gross that's where you that's where one person tells two

814
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,720
 friends and then they each tell two friends and all that stuff that's a

815
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:19,520
 pyramid scheme we are an obelisk scheme one person you find one person that's

816
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:24,240
 gonna really dig this show vertical growth all the way to the top build the

817
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:27,560
 obelisk tell that one person who you think is gonna really dig this weird

01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:31,240
 shit that we're doing over here and they will then be part of it as well then

819
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:35,960
 they'll tell a friend and they will build the obelisk if everyone listening

820
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:40,800
 right now would simply tell one person and get one new person listening we

821
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:46,700
