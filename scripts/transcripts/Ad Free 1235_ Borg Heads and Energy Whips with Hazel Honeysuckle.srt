22
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,120
 and she's sitting in front of the Sun on her video so I mean it's it could

23
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,320
 happen any moment yeah yeah yeah yeah does any have any Star Trek characters

24
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,480
 ever died by just being thrown into the Sun that's got to have happened in

25
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:21,960
 Star Trek I'm sure oh that's a good point Paul you're telling just a star

26
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,600
 plenty of people followed into stars I think but I don't know about our son yeah

27
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:33,280
 oh I mean stars are other people's sons that's right let's not

28
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,160
 disparage other people's sons people well the Sun of Vulcan one of Vulcan

29
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,280
 Sun's exploded and Osmos the whole sure sure that was son of Vulcan Sun exploded

30
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,040
 and the osmosis and the whatnot then we used the Sun our earth Sun's

31
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,360
 gravitational forces to go back in time and save the whales using a Klingon bird

32
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,580
 of prey so sure for now we should we should hashtag for now I don't think it

33
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:09,480
 took I don't think it took I mean last like proper Star Trek invention you

34
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:18,760
 attended oh god as an actual I don't I mean the last time was two years ago at

35
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,880
 Rio when I was doing Fool Us and happened to be there at the same time I

36
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,200
 didn't really get to go to the con proper though I got to just see people

37
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,720
 walking around and well when was the last time you like went out of your way

38
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,160
 and I'm gonna go to this Star Trek convention got yourself a ticket did the

39
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,000
 whole nine and I have never I have never gotten a ticket for a Star Trek

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,160
 convention that you never entered through the Stargate or wherever they

41
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,040
 walked through to go I have never gone through as a civilian I've always been

42
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,080
 there for work all right okay all right then what was last time you worked

43
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:58,640
 convention when they still had them at the Hilton so it's been a minute it'd

44
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,480
 been a minute it's been it's been probably a good solid 15 years since

45
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:11,280
 I've been the Hilton at a very long time none of them have closed they're just on

46
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,760
 hiatus right how long until the Star Trek experience comes back I have no

47
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,480
 idea I have no idea well first turn back into the Hilton well here's the thing

48
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,440
 hazel is on the ground floor out there she is amongst the peoples what scuttle

49
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,480
 but have you heard about people trying to bring back the experience scuttle them

50
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,600
 butts hazel I mean there's a whole chapter new book just about scuttling

51
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,640
 butts the butts the butts are saying oh so much to do that oh I should bring

52
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:44,160
 about it would be great they don't they don't understand is anyone saying oh I

53
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,040
 should do that is anyone say oh I with the money that I currently have should

54
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,640
 do that oh that's a shame here I am just stuffing them in my ears and wiping my

55
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,760
 ass with them why don't I put them towards Star Trek it'll make the same

56
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:04,800
 amount of what I tell you a bunch of people though were like hey you know

57
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,600
 that you know that Empire strips back show you should do that you should do

58
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:18,560
 one of those for Star Trek oh right that's that's that's it and and how's

59
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,880
 that going well I think we're gonna need another Kickstarter for that one right

60
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,160
 but I use the Empire back seems to be going well right I think so yeah yeah

61
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,080
 it's a great show it is a great show I got to see that here in Pittsburgh oh

62
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,960
 yeah yeah nice it seems to punch above its weight class it seems to deliver

63
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,840
 more than what you're expecting mm-hmm oh I would agree with that yeah first

64
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,920
 scene they come out strong in that in the first scene of that show they come

65
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,880
 out just swinging they're real good yeah Jeff Loomis is saying that Empire

66
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,480
 strips back touring show was close to a sellout for an entire month in Seattle

67
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:05,320
 oh wow so that's you go on the ground reporting ticket sales we love it we

68
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,920
 love it well and it's and it's it's doing decent business in Vegas it's got

69
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,760
 it's found itself a residency of sorts right oh I hope they did well during the

70
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,640
 Star Trek telling me right now I'm gonna put him on speaker oh jeez oh boy the

71
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,960
 chaos yeah it seems like a lot of people were going to see that show well hi

72
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:30,560
 Brian you're in yeah going beautiful this is the sound brian makes when he

73
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,260
 was want to talk personal stuff himself in that situation where he's extroverted

74
00:06:37,260 --> 00:07:03,400
 with his friends where he gets to say no that's it you've reached a limit I mean

75
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,560
 by virtue of her Asian race yes

76
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:23,560
 there he goes there he goes big tribal chief Brian brushwood everybody I got to

77
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:30,280
 take the moral stand there Andrew Eaton everyone Andrew that was heating that

78
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,400
 was heating for sure mm-hmm so there is crossover than hazel between the Trek

79
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:41,260
 and the Wars oh yeah yeah of course of course of course I mean I drive a

80
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:46,120
 stormtrooper car and I was a Klingon so it's all good yeah right but that that

81
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:52,000
 that hurts the idea of doing a Star Trek version of Empire Strips back you think

82
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,880
 yeah well cuz it's already done you think it's cannibalizing its own

83
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,720
 audience you're not gonna fly out to Vegas twice to see two different

84
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:10,600
 burlesque shows I know I think there is a slight possibility that you could man

85
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,760
 I really like your logic there you make the same person you could make the Trek

86
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:21,240
 one way more tech forward I don't know I don't know you know what the key would

87
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:27,320
 be I'm gonna shark tank here I'm out I'm out here's what was that is that a foot

88
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,280
 that was coming in what in the hell was that what is that why I wanted to turn

89
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:39,520
 off my background why was that is that a Horta oh it's a dick rock oh it's a big

90
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,720
 old dick rock it's not a Horta all right but it might as well be say Horta one

91
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:53,200
 more time ball Horta Horta got that you know the way to do it this here's the

92
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:05,840
 successful thing they just closed Muppets 3d we almost had it with borg 4d at the

93
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,960
 experience but what they didn't do they had stuff that would move your butt in

94
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,920
 the seat they had water that would squirt in your face but they didn't have

95
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:20,120
 things that would attach to your junk so if you get into a theater and you get

96
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:26,080
 borgified in the crotch uh-huh and the show literally fucks you while you're

97
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,880
 watching burlesque preach then you are going to go see that show a couple times

98
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:39,680
 probably we got to go back because you slept through the second half for the

99
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:46,240
 first time you gotta go back twice there's no intermission was just a

100
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:58,800
 refractory period the smartest person handling the Star Trek IP is hazel

101
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,760
 honeysuckle that's right the person doing the smartest thing is combining her

102
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,560
 superpowers as a nerd and burlesque artist it's true hazel what's your

103
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:17,520
 website it's boldly stripped calm boldly stripped calm and what will people find

104
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,620
 when they go to boldly stripped calm oh people will find a very excellent

105
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:29,400
 Kickstarter campaign where I'm where we are raising funds to create the second

106
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:35,040
 version of boldly stripped I've noticed only stripped to a bit of electric

107
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,920
 bugaloo a simplifying a bit of paring down of the options that was offered a

108
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:46,640
 boldly stripped one like lessons were learned I think so I think so is that

109
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,000
 when we can get the button put on it upside down or or to the left or to the

110
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:59,560
 right depending on which box you click for delivery purposes like with all

111
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:05,160
 kickstarters it's full of all kinds of options so that you try to keep some you

112
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,320
 must have understood one it was the first one was so much more successful

113
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:16,520
 than you imagined it was going to be why did you just go right away what took

114
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:22,080
 you so long to come around to think about doing version 2 I had to wait long

115
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:31,360
 enough until I forgot how much work it was that's a real thing yeah that's it

116
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:39,520
 that makes a lot of sense so now you just launched you've already achieved

117
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:46,960
 your your goal and your stretch goal yeah we made we've done three stretch

118
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,120
 goals so far and you've nailed them all and nailed them all and you're gonna add

119
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,240
 more stretch goals or you're done with stretch goals never done with stretch

120
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:03,160
 goals yet because one should be a Star Trek convention watching Paul sit

121
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,080
 through a show in his own taint tickling chairs one should be that should be one

122
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:12,280
 stretch I want to know exactly what he wants attached to his joke during the

123
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:17,400
 show no no you sort of device you think you want to know that but you don't I

124
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,960
 thought I wanted to know that one time I found out I didn't want to know let's

125
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:26,960
 just say the question implies that he's picky and he's not I'm imagining I'm

126
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:33,320
 imagining a Borg's head comes up out of the chair in front of you and you just

127
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,800
 take that Borg's head are you supposed to imagine the Borg says attached to a

128
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,280
 sexy body on your own or are you supposed to be picturing skull fucking a

129
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,920
 Borg that's what I'm the Borg's head yeah the Borg's head will be all on us a

130
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:54,240
 skeletal spindle like the Queen like the you know is gesturing how the head would

131
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:02,160
 go towards him and hazel yes it'll come out on a hanging spine and then and then

132
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,680
 you pick the orifice this is the thing so either you can go choose your own

133
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,400
 adventure you can go for an eye socket because it's a Borg yeah or you know if

134
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:18,920
 you want to get wild you can go for just a straight-up mouth or you can have it

135
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:25,680
 add on like it's got like a tongue attachment or something for the lady I'm

136
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,880
 going for the ear because I wanted to hear I want to hear me coming okay yeah

137
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:39,040
 you can go for the ear or it could be a or it could be a Borg's butt with the

138
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:46,480
 words ass simulate on it that could be kind of cute as simulate that's what it

139
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:56,240
 is Borg for board 5d plus ass simulation that's it simulation we got there

140
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,400
 everybody who we've arrived who's gonna work there that's what I want to know

141
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:08,480
 who wants to clean up after the audience and they all your remnants is mopper

142
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:15,160
 resistance is futile and your remnants are pure aisle that's how it's going

143
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:23,720
 space just mopper space just mopper someone's got to do it it can't be any

144
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,840
 worse than the shit that was going down during chicken jockey during the

145
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:38,560
 Minecraft movie so upset about us disparaging you're right fuck plastic

146
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:44,320
 sci-fi things in an open theater that you're taking random shots of the

147
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,760
 Minecraft movie look this is just the next step in the popcorn buckets tell me

148
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:57,200
 I'm wrong I'm wrong that's just one more month until a popcorn bucket fucks you

149
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,880
 they already sold a big old Galactus head and he had big old ears you could

150
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:09,080
 hold on exactly the dune worm no the dune worm was just a fit that was the

151
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,360
 shot across the bow and people did not answer the call and I'm disappointed

152
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:23,160

 really funny Matt thought it was gonna be awkward but in the other direction

175
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:59,320
 yes no plenty of people make it awkward too what's the most awkward somebody's

176
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:08,440
 made it um gosh I don't know what do they touch the picture in front of you

177
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,720
 do they put their finger on like a body part I like some sometimes people pick

178
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,880
 up the book and look at every single page and then just put it down and walk

179
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:27,360
 away data committed to spank bank mission recently I was at magic live and

180

182
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,600
 I knew they were like $200 books so I didn't even pretend to thumb through it

183
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,200
 I just I was I dared to read the back of one of them and then I was like I'm

184
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:52,480
 gonna stop touching these books all together because I'm not spending but

185
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,560
 yeah so but that guy had no problem that guy just thumbed right through it left

00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:40,440
 dogs out and straight out my back door up in the sky I'm seeing UFOs now I say

214
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:46,120
 UFO because to me they were UFOs they were unidentified unidentifiable they

215
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:54,880
 were flying it was a straight line of about five just dots of light okay and

216
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:01,400
 then occasionally lights were blinking in to the left and right of the column

217
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:07,460
 and zipping in towards the column then disappearing blink in zipping toward the

218
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,840
 column disappear and then the column was going up and then disappearing and then

219
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,040
 another one would start at the bottom and disappearing strange were you

220
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:24,760
 watching an elevator no okay but here's the fucked up thing I would say that

233
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:40,520
 course there's some weird shit going on who knows what it is but if aliens showed

234
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:48,400
 up tomorrow would you react with with surprise joy or just kind of kind of a

235
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:57,560
 board like of course you're here I'd be like hmm I'd be surprised yes I'd be

236
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:05,800
 surprised and I'd be like wait we didn't get ready hold on we gotta fix open up

237
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:13,480
 open up a flap and get some of this heat out of here what somebody open a flap

238
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:19,800
 wait we're not ready but open a flap if I saw we didn't clean up the alien land

239
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,400
 in front of me I'd be like oh man this is gonna be the worst Paul is right

240
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:31,280
 email I've ever gotten so terrible so your first concern hazel is a tidy house

241
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:40,080
 when aliens come you know like like the like the Federation they always they

242
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,680
 always wait till like the society is ready they have to achieve warp

243
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:51,120
 capability they have to achieve more capability yeah yeah but they can't join

244
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,600
 the Federation until they've like got their shit together right you know which

245
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:02,160
 blows my fucking mind that the earth was ever even let in like even if you look

246
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:07,720
 at the if you look at first contact and you're like wait a minute they came to

247
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,000
 earth they saw that from Cochran go warp and then they went oh yeah this planet

248
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,760
 just recently got decimated by full-scale nuclear assault I think

249
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,200
 they're good to go come on join us guys but then they got their shit together

250
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:28,760
 for like you know I don't know 50 years or something oh boy oh boy we were we

251
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,920
 should never have been allowed in the UFP it's all there is to it that's it

252
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:38,280
 preach yeah you know me preach if I was on a walk and the aliens landed it would

253
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,800
 be so sad as I'd be concerned about my family and then I would like awkwardly

254
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,480
 not be able to run full speed back to my house like I'd have to like jog for a

255
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:54,520
 minute and like keep walking fast then like jog for another minute and the

256
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,640
 aliens would just be standing behind you with their arms crossed just looking at

257
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,760
 you in judgment like don't get me wrong I'm one of them making fun of Tom Cruise

258
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,880
 running in movies right like oh there he goes ha ha ha meanwhile I can't do it I

259
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:11,520
 couldn't even do a Tom Cruise movie if you paid me it'd be really tough no it's

260
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,480
 to be fair though I would I'd love to give it a shot so if anybody would like

261
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,600
 to pay me Tom Cruise is going great to make a movie I will happily attempt to

262
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,720
 make that movie absent of money I'm just doing the Tom Cruise fitness challenge

263
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:31,360
 and that's where I will try to become a better runner and also strap my thing

264
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,480
 strap myself onto various dangerous objects and see if I can pull off a

265
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,960
 classy stunt at my age so that's those are the two things I thought you were

266
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,520
 gonna say strap myself to various objects and fuck them like Canada RMS

267
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:54,680
 Nicole Kidman shot myself to those objects meanwhile the Penelope Cruz

268
00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:03,440
 longing for a nice piece of cod the whole time you know what I could really

269
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,200
 go for right now some cod did this isn't that possible come out or it hasn't

270
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:14,400
 come out yet and nobody cares that's right yeah yeah nobody cares anymore

271
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,600
 nobody gives a rat fuck that first the first one the first one that he had the

272
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,760
 audacity of that last one to be like oh it's a two-parter and it's also 18 hours

273
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:28,920
 long like eat my butt sir no one has time for your garbage bullshit but the

274
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,520
 other but the bad guys might get an AI thing Paul you're not totally wrapped up

275
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:41,640
 in that that apparently was the whole thing like the the the MacGuffin they

276
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,520
 were having like all these discussions about what's the MacGuffin what's the

277
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:50,200
 MacGuffin and Tom Chris finally like just nuclear bombs just make it nuclear

278
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,520
 bombs and that's what they did it's like bad guys have nukes good guys need to

279
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,840
 stop them done this is so dumb I don't think it was I thought it was like an AI

280
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:06,360
 thing like a computer that could that could control nuclear bombs oh got it

281
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,280
 okay oh that's what sunk that submarine that submarines full of nuclear bombs

282
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,440
 that's the whole beginning of the movie which is all I watched how many mission

283
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,960
 impossible movies has Tom Cruise made everybody no price is right rules just

284
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,560
 how many how many hazel's hazel's correct she just yawned while you asked

285
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,200
 that yeah yeah that's correct that's the right answer that's exactly it it's

286
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:32,240
 boring cuz it's cuz nothing's gonna happen the answer is fine the answer is

287
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:38,840
 eight and I had no idea you know just three you know what I think um Fast and

288
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:45,400
 Furious was benefited from the tragic passing of Paul Walker in so much as

289
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,560
 something could actually happen to a main character but I guess in the in the

290
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,320
 fictional world he's not really dead is that right are they gonna AI him back

291
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,160
 into the new movie is that what I'm hearing now Wow wait Paul what's his

292
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:03,480
 name Walker Paul Walker they're gonna AI Paul Walker into a Fast and Furious

293
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:11,200
 movie I think so let's see here the new one seems like a mistake I think you're

294
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,200
 right Matt I think it's a terrible mistake and a terrible precedent to set

295
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,840
 to bring back dead people into movies yeah but if it goes I'm totally making

296
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,360
 Ben Hur two and I'm bringing everyone back Ben Hur two remember they did a

297
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:29,960
 Ben Hur remake today like who the fuck had a ball it was it was remarkably bad

298
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,560
 right but who even has the balls to even go you know what we should make again

299
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:41,680
 Ben Hur yeah what epic the fuck could you even add to that oh my god I love

300
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:47,200
 remaking things they do the upcoming the upcoming Fast and Furious movie the

301
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,400
 upcoming final Fast and Furious movie rumored to be titled fast 11 fine Jesus

302
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:57,280
 Christ set for release in April of 27 is planning to feature Paul Walker's

303
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:02,680
 character Brian O'Connor will likely use CGI and potentially AI to recreate his

304
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,240
 likeness Oh not his corpse then I gotta string him up like a fucking puppet

305
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,180
 they're not gonna weaken it Bernie's them glad I'm glad they told us how I'm back

306
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:27,980
 family did you miss me that's all about family not some child he didn't know he

307
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:32,360
 had dressing up like him and trying to look like him in the movie because it's

308
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:37,120
 been that long it has been that long his his kids are alive I think he really is

309
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:42,880
 like supposed to be like on vacation kind of thing in the storyline he's on

310
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,840
 hiatus I don't know or maybe he's dead in the story and then they're gonna

311
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,440
 bring it back but everybody dies in that thing now too and they bring him back

312
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,240
 same thing with what's your head hey whatever Paul he's family all right we

 Walker family never dies take a look you think I'm joking motherfucker look

315
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:09,640
 family never dies this one literally never dies they could do a crossover

316
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:18,720
 could call it Paul walking dead I've literally never been more interested in

317
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,960
 the Fast and Furious franchise I bet Kirkman could get on board he's a

318
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,000
 magician he could write some great shit for that he could make it work

319
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,800
 get all those Atlanta tax credits they helped make it happen no the Paul

320
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:39,200
 walking dead hazel any thoughts for putting video content as part of your

321
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:45,120
 attached to your your your magazine with with animated Paul Walker driving you

322
00:32:45,120 --> 00:33:01,240
 around funny you say that because no except for the Paul Walker part yeah we

323
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:07,840
 okay so one of the shoots we're gonna do is a Ferengi mm-hmm oh whichever you

324
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:14,800
 know I know everyone was clamoring yes well the thing is tell tell everyone the

325
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:20,320
 thing about the Ferengi ladies the thing about the Ferengi ladies and they're not

326
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:29,560
 they're not a very you know progressive progressive civilization not at all but

327
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:34,040
 their women their women all are just naked all the time

328
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:42,360
 ah and they're not allowed to do business profit it which is like their

329
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:47,320
 whole society is about earning profit right so the women are naked and they

330
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:56,200
 can't work and like the kinkiest thing is for woman to wear clothes and this is

331
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:01,800
 this is how they they got the the main characters like the main Ferengi

332
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,560
 character to put it on would land them in jail is that what was that what

333
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:11,960
 happened ah it's like oh the main character like goes home and his mom's

334
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:17,440
 like wearing clothes and he's like oh gross gross mom and then she takes her

335
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:23,920
 clothes off and he puts his head in her lap oh boy it's weird no what you said

336
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:30,960
 sounds great yeah yeah now I gotta do the rest of this show like this so to do

337
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:37,440
 a risque Ferengi female boudoir shoot as it were yeah you're gonna have to put

338
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,360
 some stuff on she's gonna put it on yeah yeah it's gonna be the only clothes character

339
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,840
 in the entire book I mean that could be funny to have it go in reverse to start

340
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:50,200
 off really would go oh it's it's definitely going in reverse completely

341
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:54,840
 starkers and then yeah full clothes by the end of it that's fun actually that

342
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,640
 would be a really funny burlesque routine like a bad camp act you know

343
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,320
 where you just keep putting on clothes and so you're like giant like a snowman

344
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:08,160
 you know that guy wore all the t-shirts how many t-shirts did he get to didn't

345
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:19,800
 hurt himself real bad doing that one guy who's famous for wearing t-shirts Paul

346
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,520
 just asked three questions if none of us have any idea what he's talking about I

347
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:30,080
 just remember this guy wearing so many t-shirts and it got really bad and I

348
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,320

354
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,640
 outfits so it looks like it looks like almost like Jabba the Hutt with a tiny

355
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,680
 head out of a bunch of clothes and then a bunch of Ferengi dudes just like

00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,040
 documentary and there is a story that Armand Shimmerman tells because he was

374
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,600
 one of the original Ferengi in deep space not or in the original or in next

375

 gonna be like the Klingons of next generation ah that was the start told us

377
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,960
 about this before I think I have and and there was a there's a scene where

378
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,400
 they're on this planet and they've got you know the Frank you have these

382
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:00,040
 directors like oh yeah grab your heads and like writhe around in pain and Armand

 think nobody's gonna think that these guys are scary at all ever again and he

385
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:14,840
 was dead right and they became these very clownish aliens from that point on

386
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:21,120
 but they wanted they wanted to set them up as like the big bad alien species for

387
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,560
 the for the whole series and no one bought it no no one's like those those

 my energy whip and that was a make a sandwich of your innards that was of

395
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:20,960
 course the episode that Tennessee Williams wrote for Star Trek Hazel

396
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,840
 Leon Kasab just asked you about what was there a something in the first boldly

397
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:30,680
 stripped what what is that and is it an axion a till axion that's how you say

398
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,600
 that okay and is there a till axion in the second boldly stripped and what is

399
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:42,760
 it not so far come on come on what's it till axion it's a Neelix it'd be a whole

400
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:59,360
 cooking see it's a Neelix come on Jacob it's a deal moving on again this is that

401
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:04,160
 this is what you you would lose your mind Jacob and Matt if you were ever in

402
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,400
 these writers rooms because Neelix that's correct

403
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,400
 Neelix was supposed to be the Voyager breakout character they're like

404
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,960
 oh this whole thing this is gonna be such a great thing this Neelix character

405
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:23,080
 and they fucked it up six ways to Sunday they had him dating a 12 year old it's

406
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:30,800
 like nice no no no she was like yeah yeah yeah yeah it's awful I was trying

407
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:44,560
 to make it sound a little more this looks like she Tara's ugly step-cousin oh

408
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,880
 they nearly wait there was a female the problem is female till axion Ethan

409
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:54,600
 Phillips they don't allow female till axions on the internet I bet you anything

410
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,800
 Ethan Phillips is a chill guy from what I've seen of him he seems like a nice

411
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:04,800
 dude the actor who portrayed Neelix that character is so fucking annoying and

412
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,840
 stupid I don't think it's Ethan Phillips's fault I think he's great

413
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:15,520
 exactly that's what I'm saying but he is like let's get this character and he's

414
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:20,560
 kind of like oh he loves to like sell stuff to people and he's the cook yeah so

415
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:29,160

420
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:59,180

 yeah gotcha gotcha yeah yeah yeah you have two big floppy horns why are their

480
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:27,300
 horns so floppy why are they such a floppy horned people they're they're not

481
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:32,000
 horns they're they're called leku actually the leka zoom type and they're

482
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,780
 bred that way because they've gotten more docile as they reproduce because

483
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:37,980
 no one to keep the aggressive ones as pets so slowly but surely they've

484
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:45,060
 gotten dangly they just got floopy they got drippy over time the same horns that

485
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:57,900
 happen to basset hound ears no did I did I do the beholder and scoop fest yes yes

486
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:01,600
 I did yeah was that last year or the last one we did right that was what you

487
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:11,540
 did yeah that was the D&D thing yeah yeah yeah that was great I've been I've

488
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:17,660
 watched Sandman I finished up Sandman on Netflix okay you watch the second

489
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:26,580
 season I did I started to watch that that animated kind of wrap-up of the

490
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:32,260
 final first season that they just put out uh-huh and I and I and I couldn't

491
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:37,220
 even get through it I was too depressed I had to stop it was it I was like oh

492
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:42,180
 where where where's the population at with Neil Gaiman are we allowed to say

493
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:47,180
 we watch Sandman or like salmon are we not allowed to say we like the Sandman I

494
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:52,780
 was Neil I mean he's he's problematic as hell at this point yeah he's been

495
00:50:52,780 --> 00:51:03,220
 accused of being a dirty bird that's right at home yeah yeah I mean and what

496
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:05,860
 stinks I don't know I thought Netflix actually did a really good job of

497
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:10,700
 creating the comic to the series I didn't watch the animated thing I just

498
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:15,260
 watched the actual episodes smart this is because I had to nope out after I

499
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:18,540
 watched the first five minutes I was like oh god I can't take this this is and I

500
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:21,980
 basically was like breaking my heart true to the comic look at it go and I

501
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:25,480
 think it's a fascinating world that was created that I really liked when I read

502
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:29,580
 it because I was like yeah it doesn't really advance it doesn't like it's not

503
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:33,700
 driven by like a plot plot more like you just keep exploring worlds and the rules

504
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:38,100
 that go with the world's similar what we've been just doing here today and so

505
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,380
 I thought like it was really neat compelling it's also great to watch

506
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,780
 before going to bed because it's not it's not a compelling plot point with

507
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:46,500
 cliffhangers so you can just watch one weird dreamy scene and go right to bed no

508
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:53,300
 problem and then I was like I don't think I can talk terrified about

509
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:58,180
 sleeping at all I've worried about whatever happens once I fall asleep can

510
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:03,780
 be completely leveraged against me and generations of my family no problem and

511
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:07,540
 oddly enough as you're watching it though the character dream which

512
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:12,780
 obviously is influenced by Neil Gaiman himself and the whole fashion trend that

513
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:20,420
 came out of that and it's all about guy regretting his past and moving around

514
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:25,700
 see if he can go about possibly changing who he is and I was like man I'm trying

515
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:30,100
 to keep my mind off of things and this thing is just poking the bear of what's

516
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:36,340
 happening in real life and it's really strange oh I have a hard time with those

517
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:39,980
 shows he does not the character does not have a good relationship with any of his

518
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:48,220
 exes I'll tell you that much right now so wouldn't it be great to see a show one

519
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:56,140
 time where everybody's like oh yeah that's my ex we get along fine but

520
00:52:56,140 --> 00:53:00,700
 there are actors in it that are amazing I enjoyed the first season very much she

521
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:05,260
 is really fantastic yeah I watched a few episodes of the first season it was good

522
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:08,620
 I don't know why I stopped watching it I might have just forgotten about it

523
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:11,780
 maybe I went to sleep you might have seen the whole thing it was only like

524
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:16,660
 eight episodes Jacob oh maybe I saw all of it though no because they weren't

525
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:24,980
 long right no yeah an hour okay yeah but let's see you guys want to do a little

526
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:29,740
 scoop mail here oh my gosh more than anything on earth let's do a little

527
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:40,420
 scoop mail we are one from dirty rotten cone artist dearest Paul your gnome

528
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:45,780
 repair operation from episode 1194 would make an excellent YouTube channel you

529
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:49,600
 could film your gnome repairs and put them up as fun videos you could then

530
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:54,180
 parlay that and then selling the gnomes from the videos people could send their

531
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:58,020
 gnomes in for restorations and you could film those at charge for it the money

532
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:03,980
 prints itself I look forward to the meteoric rise of Paul and am and gnome

533
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:11,660
 dome fucking with the face that's the dirty rotten cone artist Paul have you

534
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:15,260
 thought about opening up a gnome hospital we thought about it we actually

535
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:19,740
 did talk about it a little bit and was like maybe we could just do this and I

536
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:24,260
 was like no oh no I'd love to get internet today so Paul might might be

537
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:29,340
 having problems here I said you know and said maybe we could just do this and I

538
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:36,220
 thought yeah that'd be great but I don't I don't think so oh I gotta work out

539
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:46,180
 it's over guys it turns out gnome repair does not provide health care so but gnome

540
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:53,720
 repair content does provide extra money that is true I'm not ruling it out in

541
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:58,700
 the future fixing up stuffed animals I'm not ruling it out in the future I'll

542
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:02,100
 tell you one problem though with some of that repair video shit I don't know if

543
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:05,260
 you guys are how much how deep do you guys go and repair videos cuz I watch

544
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:11,980
 quite a bit oh all I'm doing I used to watch a lot of them like fixing old game

545
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:15,980

00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:23,300
 up the product and then pretend to repair it you know what I mean like

547

 a bunch of people in New Hampshire who are trying to start like a government

 gelding for the people this thing Paul you're up yo also side note my dad we

579
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:25,060
 might have had a solution for not for long the podcast as a viable thing

580
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:29,380
 because we talked about trying to use a patreon that like own a horse and then

581
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:33,780
 it turned out that all right like that was like crazy money silly even with a

582
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:38,700
 discount my dad found a site called racehorse.com where you can buy like

583
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:44,460
 small shares in horses for like 119 dollars my dad bought a share in this

584
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:49,740
 horse and I was like oh well that's patreon money we can probably do and so

585
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:55,420
 we can we can we can we can buy steaks and young horses and small steak and

586
00:59:55,420 --> 01:00:02,540
 follow their travails yes okay yes could we buy like a frozen package of horse

587
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:06,500
 steaks with that money we can instead of buying steaks in a horse we'll buy

588
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:10,620
 steaks from a horse yeah two different websites but we could totally do it okay

589
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:28,420

647
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:06,020
 my instinct is to keep clearing out the horse it's kind of already set that I

648
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:10,380
 actually only used one answer I got from hazel then I passed the other two so I'm

649
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:18,900
 gonna actually switch to scoop stable please for 400 Matt's gonna make a

650
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:24,300
 change let's see listeners listener letters become scoop mail but if a horse

651
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:28,460
 delivered them the segment would share its name with the 1860s all equine

652
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:34,220
 postal service that galloped across the West that would be the pink pony club

653
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:44,380
 the pink pony club it's the pony you deliver letters pony express the pony

654
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:50,460
 express of course it's the pony express I've read that they did not actually

655
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:56,260
 gallop the very far they would it was apparently a what do you call like a

656
01:07:56,260 --> 01:08:00,620
 publicity stunt they would gallop into and out of town to make it look like

657
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:03,780
 they were just galloping the whole time but you couldn't gallop a horse that

658
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:06,740
 long so they know gallop in and out of town and then just walk the horse that

659
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:10,260
 makes it apparently like a publicity thing that they did on purpose yeah those

660
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:19,580
 man the whole world is bullshit man yeah Paul hoof and glory hoof and glory for

661
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:28,020
 1200 and the 1973 Belmont this chestnut won by a record 31 lengths secretariat

662
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:34,220
 secretariat is correct huzzah it's the only one you know Belmont being a third race

663
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:39,900
 it's the third race rubbing it in yep I know that I don't know who wouldn't know

664
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:46,100
 that I'll see I'll try horse sense for 2000

665
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:52,620
 daily double boy you died the bullet there man you did did and I jumped in

666
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:57,660
 front of it a horse can't perform this normal mammal function which is why

667
01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:03,460
 choking or stomach upset is a medical emergency done done done done done they

668
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:09,140
 can't regurgitate something right they can't like like like cough something up

669
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:18,340
 and and like vomit or vomit regurgitate cough it up I don't know if they swallow

670
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:21,900
 something basically they can't like vomit it back out okay okay

671
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:29,300
 vomit yeah yeah show me vomit vomit there man I was you not I was not like if you

672
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:32,820
 gave yourself points for regurgitate because those are different things no

673
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:39,060
 they're not are they no they're not rotating vomit is not regurgitation um I

674
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:43,380
 believe it just from an attention standpoint no but I mean you can say

675
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:48,380
 that birds regurgitate baby birds really funny the thing that took down our

676
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:54,540
 podcast with this vomit versus vomit like I went to counter I was like I don't

677
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:56,780
 want to have this I don't want to have this argument at all I shouldn't have

678
01:09:56,780 --> 01:10:00,180
 even said what I said I suppose there I mean like it's probably the bird

679
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:05,180
 probably is regurgitating food that hasn't gone all the way past it's uh now

680
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:07,500
 there has to be a difference I think Matt's right there has to be a

681
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:13,580
 difference I just don't know what the difference is yeah Matt you're up scoop

682
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:22,420
 stable place for 800 what is the name of the official pony of pod therapy oh it's

01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:30,020
 Emma's pony if that helps Jim's dad is a horse oh you had one too many letters on

684
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:43,220
 that I don't know is the answer let's see if you were going to buy your son's

685
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:47,500

686
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:51,020
 some trucks or something to to drive around on the living room floor to talk

687
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:57,100

 happy with that joke score check I liked it I liked it nobody didn't say that no

699
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:31,180
 everybody agrees with that that is the best joke you made the whole show good

700
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:39,380
 joke just nobody likes it Matt and I are both died at 2400 Matt Paul has 1200 we

701
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:43,060
 got scoop stable for 12 and 2000 I guess okay I guess I'll get the big one and

702
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:49,220
 try and win the game 2000 how dare you big one Nick's transport rant mentioned

703
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:54,740
 that crossing the US border with racehorses triggers USDA Coggins

704
01:12:54,740 --> 01:13:00,580
 paperwork testing for this blood-borne disease named for the bacterial agent

705
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:07,020
 EIA objection your honor this yes this is scoop stable scoop implies ice cream

706
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:11,380
 social there have been two pot therapy questions in this category I'd like it

707
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:16,660
 banned I'd like it stricken sustained sustained this will be stricken from the

708
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:26,060
 record hey information on the blood-borne bacterial agent EIA there was

709
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:35,540
 no horse who got a disease yeah I mean I I just don't think there's any way that I

710
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:42,580
 would possibly know this pass Matt I'm just reading through it to make sure I

711
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:46,020
 actually understand the question because I really didn't the first time I was to

712
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:49,820
 be distracted by why am I answering pot therapy questions but I'm assuming this

713
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:53,260
 is a bit that we did on pot therapy at some point that I don't remember yeah

714
01:13:53,260 --> 01:14:00,580
 it's gonna be a pass for me Jacob Paul could it be hoof and mouth disease

715
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:08,580
 that's something horses get I think I've got hooves and mouths they do I got

716
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:14,900
 hoof and mouth disease from my nieces right yeah I should get in your hooves I

717
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:31,060
 didn't I didn't make your hands get like like Oh Shetty yeah just turn turn them

718
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:36,740
 into hoops their whole guys it makes your eyes get really big I was in mouth

719
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:39,220
 that's why I was doing horse sense categories waiting for the horse eye

720
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:47,620
 question it never came equine infectious anemia that'll just nice otherwise known

721
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:53,980
 as hoof and mouth of course and Matt close it out the category and the game

722
01:14:53,980 --> 01:15:01,420
 scoop stable for 1200 in the show pod therapy which therapist on the show pod

723
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:08,540
 therapy does the most pod there pies Matt that's Jim if Jacob if Jacob names

724
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:14,140
 a full after the show's tagline it's jockey club approved name 18 characters

725
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:18,340
 max would read like this

726
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:27,500
 or preaching fun no different different tagline preaching fun is really more of

727
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:32,020
 our tagline but but maybe something else that could be confused as a tagline oh

728
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:46,660
 what what in the but farts in the bag dot biz keep going I'll just pass Paul I

729
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:50,940

733
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:11,500
 oh no just preaching fun it's preaching fight would have been the whole thing of

734
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:15,820
 preaching fun okay I was right I was right the whole time why doesn't matter

735
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:22,900
