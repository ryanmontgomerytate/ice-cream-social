 it's time for Matt and Mattingly's ice cream social sitting in Pittsburgh
 Pennsylvania that's Paul Mattingly sitting at sea it's Matt Donnelly sitting
 Las Vegas the bad-ass me check out the audio guy we're preaching fun fun I'm
 doing wonderful I'm out on the the seas outside of Canada I said last week that
 I was gonna go to st. John Newfoundland and I was so excited turns out Canada's
 wicked wicked crazy with st. John's so it turns out it was st. John's New
 Brunswick and not they're lousy with st. John's now I already have an affection
 for st. John and the Virgin Islands right John's Newfoundland that I wasn't about
 to get off the boat for this st. New St. John I was like I don't have room I
 don't have room in my heart for a third st. John you have plenty of st. John's in
 your life you don't need more do any of these locations go by St. John because
 that's a real thing you know we're going from st. John's engine yeah well it's a
 there you remember a air wolf right of course I remember air ball so string
 fellow Hawk yeah he was always looking for his brother St. John and that is a
 shortened way of saying st. John so there were kids that were named St. John
 I just wondered if they ever if that ever applies to like cities I'll open my
 porthole and ask okay anyone go by St. John I'm just kidding my porthole over
 looks out into a wall so a wall in the boat yeah my porthole looks out into the
 vast six feet away as a wall that's what I oh you're just docked right now no no
 no no oh no you sure it's an internal hole it's an internal portal my god it
 is a glory pole I mean he might be docking right now as well
 oh yeah in a glory porthole that's cameras from the waist up so we have no
 idea we never will know are you ever gonna be on boats with pipe to plane
 again soon I don't know I'm on there they're joining the boat the ship that
 I'm on right now next week okay so ships in the night we we would have
 cross paths on the day yeah like I'm getting on the way I'm me getting off
 except that I am and now I have to get off early right here's the thing so I'm
 on the ship for four days and that's because originally they wanted me here
 for the week but the week started at scoop fest and I said I can't do it I
 got to go to scoop fest right then I got this offer for Virgin Voyages to join
 Virgin and that was a two-week gig so I want to say yes to that and basically
 saying told by agent I will I will let go of this gig if it means you know if I
 have to just just to still do virgin right yeah and that would give me days
 off after scoop fest that'd be nice so I was like there's no way they're gonna
 agree just to have me on this ship for four days but they're just going to just
 truncate the front and back end of the week and they did now you have discovered
 the true infinite money glitch that is cruise ship lines apparently what also
 meant and that means that I knew that I was getting on a performing like those
 and I was doing shows right and so was it when you got on yeah I didn't do two
 shows that night wow shows the next night holy shit dude how did that go
 luckily you were nice and rested so yeah so at scoop fest I had the already had
 this hard task of it that I've never go away for three weeks and I'm away for
 three weeks and then on top of the three weeks I'm going for in cruise ships I
 have two shows in Sparta New Jersey on October 16th and the improved jammer
 Union on October 18th October 17th is the smartest shows and so I had to pack
 for magic shows for all of those things plus materials you know I could go you
 know I go through materials things like that and and and so I was already pretty
 nerve-wracked plus I did magic at school fest which means I had to bring stuff
 just school fest so I had to bring it I had to perform them bring it home or whatever so
 the only chance I had to really pack with sanity was in the dinner break
 between daytime scoop fest and nighttime scoop fest on Saturday yeah right which
 was a two-hour break and it was like a true two-hour break because we finished
 up right before the break started in the daytime session so like we actually had
 about two hours between the daytime session and the Jog vs. Nerdball and
 during ice cream social I was getting notifications on my phone from Air
 Canada right and I was like that's weird I mean I'm flying tomorrow but I can
 check in sure whatever and they were and they were inappropriate messages right
 they were like dick pics and a lot of stuff yeah they're basically saying no
 there was they were showing you show me mine they're saying if you don't respond
 to these text messages we're putting these on the internet so you didn't
 respond and now they're out holy Mike Johnson
 but I don't know Paul Air Canada okay I've gotten an email like a week before
 whatever and I saw that they were shifting the time of my flight like a
 half hour earlier okay great what I didn't realize is that they also shifted
 it to a day early day earlier than a half hour earlier 24 hours and a half
 hour earlier yeah this is Air Canada not not not my cruise booker right yeah
 right I think it was booked and then the airline moved the thing well they moved
 oh it's Air Canada so the times are metric that explains it that explains
 that explains the disconnect it goes by how long it takes ice to melt that's how
 they ancient ancient Phoenicians had sundials most things in Canada are based
 on how long it takes ice to melt yeah that's right so I just spend the dinner
 break rescheduling my travel frantically just on the emergency line lines because
 suddenly I was not on the flight that I supposed to be on right and and I should
 have another like the whole that's the whole thing and so I could you know how
 to take the reservation but you don't know how to hold the reservation and I
 so I basically had to come back to the jock versus nerd ball without knowing
 what I was doing the next day and then at the end of the costume parade I got
 an email saying that I had to be on a flight at a 6 a.m. flight so I had to be
 at the airport at 445 of the morning that is some shit bags bullshit and then
 because it was a last-minute flight it wasn't direct so I had to take three
 flights to get to Canada oh holy fuck man so I was three flights total of 15
 hours by the time I got to my hotel they let you sit on the wing and then I'd
 asleep and get up right away and just get to the ship oh and then it's like go
 to the ship there's a guy on a bike he just goes Matt Donnelly he goes yeah he
 goes forgive me it's my day off and he's just dressed in like head-to-toe and
 beautiful biker riding bike outdoor gear right that's like forgive it stranger
 yeah but they're waiting for you get in there and I was like oh I said I can't
 have gone here any faster than me meeting my driver on time and my driver
 getting me out of time I don't know what I could have done yeah step on it
 waiting for me what yeah and then I see noted it for you if you get that get me
 there in time for my show I get around to the port and the the pork is we have
 no record of you being here I was literally just told two minutes ago and
 a hundred feet ago that you were waiting for me inside yeah apparently not that
 guy so finally a guy from business comes out and basically reprimands someone at
 the dock for looking up my thing improperly that person being very
 defensive and I was listening to a very snippy conversation guys guys guys
 could you please have this uncomfortable conversation after I get on to the boat
 I would like to get onto the boat you guys could have this conversation for as
 long as you want after I'm gone and so this is like normal little gang way it
 goes right up to the fourth deck yeah and then there's a zigzaggy gang way
 really long gang way that goes up to the seventh deck and and the first of a
 princess gestures me to the zigzaggy gang way that goes up three stories and
 I have two giant banks and my my backpack in banks and I was like are you
 sure I can't go up the little one yeah
 yeah but there's like no that's where most of the guests are getting off to
 go into it's a Saint John to Halifax and singe in Halifax and and so I go to move
 like all my stuff and there's a guy you know working for the cruise like an
 eager young young guy English other first language goes can I help you with
 that I was like boy can you he takes me up but I'm in a crew cabin not in a
 guest cabin yeah and so we get on the ship and I was like showing him my room
 number and he's trying to get me to this the seventh deck where the crew for the
 regular cabins right I'm trying to explain to him no no I'm in a crew cabin
 yeah so he's stopping as he stops like a janitor and they and they speak Spanish
 to each other and the janitor's like no follow me and I go through this ornate
 path we're all set I'm like outside of the ship on this weird deck area where
 I'm looking at the thing or I'm like I don't know if I this isn't supposed to
 be here then boom I'm into a crew area and then into finally into my cabin and
 the good news is my cabin is 50 feet from the theater oh that's oh that's
 that's big that's big yeah yeah so I get all my stuff in the theater back in the
 thing and then I realized I should go get like a cup of coffee or something to
 eat or something and I am walking aimlessly in the crew area please
 someone give me coffee try to find your way I was like yeah no one no one showed
 me how to get out to the regular ship yeah and so I see two guys and I'm like
 I'm just trying to get to like the regular part of the ship or like where
 the passengers go or whatever and they go who are you are you supposed to be
 back here what are you doing there is a there is a hard line like I said when we
 were doing second city tours we had a very fortunate situation where we had
 passes that were literally crew and passenger status right we had both so we
 could we could go anywhere but yeah if you haven't been designated they get
 snippy yeah but they figured it all out did you do a little quick bit of table
 side honestly or did they harpoon you I straight up just I straight up just
 walked away I walked up to another floor I'm good and then I went up to you just
 left them arguing about who yeah I was like I don't want to I don't want to do
 this and no that's awesome later that's awesome be another way you know what I
 bet I can find it on my own see you guys have a good day never mind yeah so yeah
 it was it was it was it was a it was a big adventure to get here and then just
 do two shows right away and they were really well good I was like I was like
 this could get this could have gone a lot better if I had those shows were
 all right imagine if I had slept so listener Chris Lowry is on the the he
 listens to the show and he and his wife book book travel for people yeah go
 with Lisa.com that's where they help set up people want to see me on the ship and
 stuff and so Lisa his wife is on on the ship and I met her before she's come to
 my Elton shows they offered to take me out to dinner at the beautiful Crown
 Grill nice on my on the second night I was on board and then they were telling
 me about how they ran into people who saw my show on st. John and I was like oh
 I don't think they're gonna tell me a story where they complimented me she was
 like yeah one guy was like yeah it wasn't really for me mind reader guy or
 whatever and I was like why are you telling me this story yeah what the
 hell this next story super awkward then cuz I just saw several people that hated
 your show I understand I'm not for everyone as I said as I said it's good
 fest you know you know you're not for everyone but as soon as you hear it it's
 devastating so very critical about my outfit that I was wearing at the time it
 really hurt but they talked about how they basically said like oh we're going
 to the embassy the Crown Grill but they said the other name for another ship's
 stakeout so yeah Cagney's I think it was called okay and so then that so I go oh
 so they were coming here to this thing tonight that's what they told you they
 invited you to dinner to join them here and I go yeah so they're here yeah and I
 go like oh okay and we look around or whatever we don't see them just now
 getting back to my room from getting coffee for this episode I end up taking
 an elevator and two guys are like oh you're the mindbender guy and I go yeah
 yeah we saw you show the other night I go yeah and then nothing okay and then
 the opera silence the guy goes I think we saw you the night at Cagney's you're
 having dinner with Lisa and I go oh my god it's them it's the guys they were
 talking to it's the eyes not for me it's not for me guy
 amazing I'm face-to-face like a murder she wrote mystery novel we're like I
 had the key I had the key that they right they named the steakhouse the wrong
 steakhouse and it's the only thing they could have said to clue you in this
 confirmed but it did not enjoy my show yeah we saw you show the other night
 there were chairs and everything hey Oh Rica is making a great point in the
 chat here she's saying Matt is upset that no complements his show but when
 he runs into audience members he doesn't compliment them either and that's a
 really good point yeah I have to go back and tell those guys nice hats nice hats
 assholes let me have to do that oh you guys are great at Cagney's the other
 night I saw you order that steak amazing work yeah well we got a Rica I'm not
 upset that no one complements my show I'm thrown off when people insist on
 telling a story that someone did not enjoy my show that is weird man that's
 weird that was no problem hearing nothing that's different that's
 different is that what is that where your brain goes after you've booked
 people on thousands of travel experiences is that you just get to like
 oh yeah well you know a lot of people just hate you and they don't really yes
 I mean people definitely get into that state of mind of like none of this
 matters to me so why would it matter to you right yes right comes right that's
 the energy of like that we're just shooting the breeze I just know this I
 know that yeah these guys hated your show but it like in their mind she's
 sitting there thinking like oh Matt has done this show so many times well surely
 people have disliked the show before it can't bother him it's just water off and
 ducks back like who cares we're being harsh too wasn't that he hated it just
 wasn't for him oh no no he actually sent me a message as well the way the story
 actually goes is that the subtext of the stories was told to me it basically
 didn't didn't believe I was an actual mind reader oh really well in that case
 I've got good news for them they were they were right so this is Simon Cowell's
 cousin and which is I should make no claims during my show that I like I set
 the premise but I do I do know I basically like all of my stuff as if I'm
 doing any mind reading bits it's all comedic right like I get the results
 correct but all I'm trying to do is make sure it's funny along the way and that's
 the it's the weird thing I imagine but you it's a you can't deny it if someone
 goes like yeah I don't think you really do that you're like yep that's right
 that's correct and so if you're upset with me for even towing the line for
 claiming to have superpowers I could if that upsets you I get it like I can't do
 anything about it it's it's it's it's the deal right all right I did it Jacob
 nailed it I said Oh Rico's name correctly on air oh nice oh I am
 impressed I know I am and I noted that I have never heard I'd never heard the
 pronunciation correct and I was like oh yeah Rica yeah yeah took me 12 years and
 and her something by African babble to get it right but that's what happened
 perfect finally got it oh man Jacob you asked me for a sponsor and I can't
 access my phone so I'm gonna go over to a web page and open it up there oh nice
 well while you're doing that we'll just we'll just talk a little bit scoop fest
 here we just had our big scoop fest it was amazing it was oh we are all almost
 recovered and by all I mean like fucking everybody I imagine I mean I don't buddy
 yeah everybody got beat I didn't get kovat this time well there's that that I
 know of yeah but also like legit like I felt like everyone not just us I felt
 like the attendees were like Jesus by the end of the yeah well actually I was
 having a conversation with Ryre the night of the loadout because we even
 commented during the during the show during the scoop fest podcast that the
 energy you kind of like went weird in the room for a while and we were kind of
 chatting about that and the energy of the of the whole thing and it really
 seems like everyone came to scoop fest as you know in a way that you would
 expect which is a relief you know they're coming to scoop fest as this as
 a big energy relief thing and especially by the end of it everyone was kind of
 like sitting in that lull yeah I don't know it was it was a it was an
 interesting it was an interesting thing yeah I think I think so I think I think
 this I really you know we talked about this in a few episodes back but like I
 that is it is a crazy time yeah and I think and I think during Penn Sunday
 School live like Penn really hung a lantern on it in terms of talking to his
 children yeah you guys don't know that this actually is incredibly unusual
 right and like what's happening is impossible yeah and so you know none of
 this that is happening can happen it's none it's all impossible but it's
 happening anyway yeah yeah yeah and the shows also 12 years old or whatever 11
 years old and so are indeed our we've all gotten older we're older and so is
 everyone else maybe the evening festivities started 7 and not 8 wrap up
 around 7 I don't know I don't know about all that we're all gonna go to the
 sizzler and have dinner around 4 bird no I mean like something who spearheads the
 the the nighttime programming and stuff I was like panicking trying to add stuff
 and then by the time it all went down I was like oh I put a lot of stuff up here
 oh yeah we need we needed I did have I did maybe over program some some of some
 nights it was activities no laws though that's for sure no I mean to go in
 order a bucket show crushed so fun yeah big thanks to Brenna Mark Robert Mark
 that was fantastic this again and like I had so many scoops coming up and saying
 it was the first time they'd seen a bucket show and I was like well hope you
 like that one because it's never gonna get any better than that
 was actively telling people to not come back to future bucket shows because that
 one was that was to be the best one I don't know if it went quite that far but
 I just said that is the best it's close yeah as close if you came to see both
 those shows shit I don't know man I don't tell you great we're doing we're
 doing one at Tunis Tavern like real soon it's like October 23rd let's oh we're
 gonna crush that one we already sold some tickets for it let's not no we're
 gonna crush that one because that one was already planned that one was a was a
 carve out in Paul's statement never see another one unless you've already planned
 to see no it was just it'll be better it was just really it's just one of those
 things too again and even like I was doing that interview for the documentary
 and I recounted our first meeting Matt and how you had friends in the audience
 that night after we'd done our show and they asked you how long we've been
 working together yes it's just well it's just one of those things it just kind of
 remind me again it's like we had two brand new people who we hadn't played
 with in forever don't play with regularly and it was like you know forget
 it I had never I had never coached Brenna's impromptu yeah or one with
 Brenna yeah I just knew we just we vibrate Brenna obviously his podcast
 co-hosts and friends and stuff and she always said like oh we should all just
 shook around some time look everybody it's a cold runner and everybody hey you
 wave to all the scoops she's got to go pick up our giz from the grandparents so
 she's she's across the state to go grab the doggy yeah yes yeah rainbow bright
 shirt represent be safe sweetheart holler if you need anything I love you
 too all right did you guys have a favorite part of scoop fest no I mean
 somebody else was trying to zip through an order because the next day was the
 barbecue right and Jacob you cooked barbecue pulled pork and yeah my god
 dude you fucking crushed that too oh it was so good I really wish I could have
 gotten more of that pork but I I didn't get enough but it was good yeah the food
 Alex Bartman made fresh pizzas for everybody oh yeah the pizza was great
 yep the food was the food was all was all solid
 SJ made SJ's famous mac and cheese that shit was great too yeah so we all we all
 pitched in a little bit this year instead of doing any we didn't or last
 year we cooked the main stuff and then ordered the sides and this year we said
 now fuck it we're not ordering anything yeah we're doing it all it was really
 good and it was it was nuts it was nuts for you guys to pull off all the stuff
 you pulled off yeah it was windy that was the only thing we didn't account for
 was wind I remember driving a day and it rained for like two minutes I was like
 rain we have not we have no backup plan for rain dead if it rains I had a germ of
 a plan but it wasn't a good plan it was not a good plan at all yeah yeah I mean
 scuba nova girl in the chat is saying everyone cram into Jacob's house that
 was gonna be plan B yeah yeah I feel like we were definitely just gonna get
 the plan B well as funny as it was it was still pretty hot and the Sun was
 pretty blazy and you know you had that shade wall everybody just rammed up
 against the shade wall yeah and then I got really red to the point where scoops
 were like are you okay I had to let them know that that's just what the
 Mattingly jeans do I just get real red looking I'm fine I didn't I didn't burn
 like you can see I don't have a sunburn yeah but I just I got really red I look
 like I'm gonna explode when I'm mowing the lawn out here like if I come inside
 just be at and hands it's like oh my god you're a lobster I'm like it's just what
 I do my body just it gets it's you know that's how I'm getting the heat out it
 comes to the front but yeah I do I really ate exactly a pine a plane played
 the the barbecue they were fantastic that was the that was the biggest swing
 I did I pulled for this one was that my friends from Ireland were all off they
 weren't they weren't obligated to be on ships and so I said if you're available
 let's get you in here and so they I flew them in from Ireland to be here is their
 first time in Vegas and they just were absolutely blown away by they exhausted
 and I had to write them a note being like you know it's very common that
 people love Las Vegas and also think three days is plenty right oh yeah and
 and that was the case for them they were definitely like just wiped at the end
 sure but they yeah they crushed it at Jacob's house and they're they're just
 that I love those guys so much and they're so charming and they're such
 they're great at what they do and it's they have such different personalities
 and they all find a way to really shine and it's really funny and I like them
 and so yeah they I was I was very emotional watching them play in Jacob's
 backyard that was yeah it was great it was a big carry deal for me and we were
 supposed to have you you're talking about the wind we were supposed to have
 another entertainer at the at the barbecue but the wind kept Michael Doe
 from being able to juggle at the barbecue right so Mike no it's Parkinson's yes
 and he asked it he said yes to do excuse us before he knew he had it right
 his obligation and then he has to juggle you know 500 throws every day to make
 sure he can keep movement in his body and be able to do what he does for a
 living while he fights this vicious disease and then it's fucking windy as
 hell yeah it's windy we might not go and I said oh you can't you don't want to go
 he goes well I can do it the show will be funny but there will be no juggling in
 it and then he said no successful juggling there will be throwing but not
 catching not catching I said okay let's let's let's just call it so I was so
 aggravated too because it was like it was perfect all afternoon and then like
 20 minutes before Godot was was set to go up that's when the wind kicked up
 yeah like it was it was and then like half an hour later it was it was back to
 be in like there was a light breeze but it was fine after that still but yeah
 it was crazy it was crazy for a minute yeah yeah and then but he still was
 phenomenal yeah well and then he did the variety show yeah yeah yeah so then that
 night we surprised the audience with a reuniting of two characters in a clown
 shortly after the very recent breakup of the podcast to do a podcast battle Jimmy
 Sonina dressed in full clown regalia he did was delightfully ironic because in
 their Cirque show it's Johnny and RJ have to wear a lot of makeup and Jimmy
 doesn't and so it was very funny for Jimmy to come in full makeup while
 they were there goes and we had delightful trivia battle hosted by Mikey
 for between between us and they won yeah they did spoiler because we're gonna put
 those in our patreon feed like always and so that was really fun then while I
 was doing my shows at the Magic Castle a month ago someone on my special
 like touring company feed on my abracadabra which is a whatsapp thread
 right I share my my all my all my adventures and someone said why aren't
 you and Nick doing scoop fest and I literally just turned to him backstage
 like good point Nick what are you doing this dates like when I was like all right
 come out to scoop Nick and I did our pillar set in that we did the Magic
 Castle at scoop fest which is so fun because in our set I get to do an
 illusion with Nick that he normally does with his wife and I love doing this bit
 it was great the whole thing was great that whole that whole show was really
 really good so you make you make an excellent magic assistant Matt this is
 this is a running gag right that was really funny that bit was funny
 Alex Ramone had a bit in his show where he has someone called misdirection and
 in his regular show he used to show girl as misdirection and we did the Magic
 Castle I came out as misdirection and the foolers tour I came out as
 misdirection and telling me to just improvise and dance and pretend I'm a
 showgirl is not a tall not a tall ask for me in any way no I I will I will fake
 dance until the Sun comes up and basically it's also me going like I have
 no magic responsibilities great I'll be over here being funny yeah yeah you do
 all the work I just have to pretend like I'm you know doing this or that no
 problem oh and I still get credit great even better and so yeah we have to do
 that bit and yeah yeah I the show Nick and I have done is really come together
 now we've done it two different two different runs beach run is always like
 15 shows yeah so it's really become like a really fun show to do I really enjoy
 doing it and and that was fun and then Lindsay Benner I don't know dude and

 into this with it's now it's now part of the party over at Las Vegas at the
 Cosmopolitan right and same thing where she said like hey you know I can do this
 bit in the show and I heard she told me you know I hope I'm not portraying any
 confidences but she said that they were a little like what I don't know or
 whatever and she basically was like just let me do it yeah yeah because like

 are people who wanted to do it but then like took jobs a month ago that left
 town like and it just was like I just kept watching the thing and at one point
 I was texting Jacob like days beforehand being like I'm really in my head about
 this right this year's variety show and I was coming up with like backup plans
 of maybe doing violin prob with Maeve Kennedy from the trio like I was like
 really like what's happening and then some things just fall in our lap like
 Stapes was still in town just around or what JD was like you know Stapes is down
 I was like oh right we got Stapes that was great days before Harrison Greenbaum
 calls me up as hey I'm gonna happen to be at the Rio this week are you gonna be
 in town I was like well that scoop vest and of course Harrison was like yeah
 down no problem yeah so good he was goddamn that was so good it's like
 really happy about it and someone I've been trying to get to for years to do it
 because we have a lot of friends in the burlesque community and like to go a
 little burlesque in more Vegas we could throw in a little a little a little fun
 burlesque although we are Kevin is always like hey as weird as you want to
 be oh yeah like whatever shits like been too weird for other burlesque shows do
 it do it here yeah go like I mean jumping ahead Hazel
 performed and Hazel and I spoke a month or so or earlier and she was like I I
 could do just like a classic burlesque thing and and just come out and be
 pretty and and have pretty costumes and fans and everything I was like that's
 great people will love it I'm sure if you do it you can also do your weird
 stuff yeah the weird the weird stuff will play and she came out on stilts
 dressed like a giant tree yeah she was a hint from Lord of the Rings and from
 Lord learn she was treebeard a sexy stripping is sexy beard it was amazing
 two tiny hobbit dolls that she made kiss and make out with each other and they
 stripped - yep and but I finally we've tried in the past with our friend Nick
 Byler came by who does this really incredible act in absent and he's just
 and he's also in disco studies the the the host there extremely talented
 fascinating guy he was great yes he does this really we did this really weird
 thing in the show hot trashed or the pandemic where he tries to make a banana
 daiquiri while trying to still hit a triangle on the notes during this one
 song it's this conflict between trying to make the daiquiri and at the triangle
 all while he's wearing just a banana a skirt made of actual bananas right and
 it was great to have some equal representation from the male side of
 burlesque world and then I had Jonas Wilberton and I forgot that I was also
 burlesque yeah yeah but he was a very funny John John Mack and fro uh-huh
 where he has the audience hit him with tennis balls and he does so he does a
 seer wheel which you know those of you in the circus world are familiar but
 those you may not be it's a big giant steer steel wheel it looks like a giant
 hula hoop a steel ring that he is able to manipulate and swirl around and this
 was a steel ring with a radius of about what six and a half feet or not a
 radio yeah what's the thing across the circle whatever that distance is right
 yeah this was the smallest stage he'd ever perform this yeah we only gave him
 eight feet of space he had done it on a on a nine footer I think maybe mm-hmm he
 he had kept asking me like there's a version I can do without the wheel I
 said then let's do that and he goes we'll just send me the dimensions anyway
 and I said in dimensions and he goes oh that's pretty small I go then don't do
 the wheel just do the other part yeah and he goes okay well I'll bring the
 wheel just in case and I go okay and then he sends me we load in and I see
 it's a carpeted stage which is again not ideal for zero so it's carpeted so if
 you don't want to do the wheel do not do the wheel and he goes all right I
 probably won't but I'll bring it just in case yeah and then not only was it
 carpeted but it had nth leaves and leftover banana daiquiri all over and
 tomato juice yes it had tomato seeds banana juice had fucking leaves so I
 would I had been sketching stuff away with my foot the whole time because I
 knew that wheel was coming I was trying to make sure that was oh yeah but oh
 y'all were we were all like try to clean the stage as much as possible I told
 him afterwards I said that was fucking brave dude and that was amazing but it
 was it was also really really funny and really really awesome yes one coming up
 on in November he's doing a show over at the Vegas Theatre Company so we're
 gonna have him on as a guest oh great great great great yeah yeah but yeah
 Brenna did a more another goblin burlesque Stephen Roberts came by crush
 doing stand-up yes not a not a show without Stephen yeah and without personal
 highlight for me was Michael Gudeau yeah yeah and seeing Mike do it seemed like
 you don't do it it was so good it was so funny and holy fuck yeah we talked
 about it at the at the con but uh you forget we're friends with Michael Gudeau
 we hang out we chat with Michael Gudeau we all forget that you get Michael Gudeau
 on stage and he's a goddamn killer I mean it's just what he's gonna get on
 stage just do it it's crazy to me too I was lucky enough to go see him with the
 Lance Burton show way back in the day right and this is when I was first
 working with Second City as a full-time Second City and class act that Lance
 Burton is he called me out in the show had me stand up and wave to the people
 because nice because Lance Burton knows how to be a fucking entertainer you know
 we help each other we talk each other up right that's what it's about and that
 that had that moment has stuck with me and just like the fact that Michael Gudeau
 and Mac King both specifically came out to watch us do the bucket show I got I
 put it up on our Facebook and whatnot Mac tweeted about it because he loves
 come see us which is just so amazing to me because he's one of my heroes too we
 have we have fucking strip performer royalty at this fucking thing yeah like
 real deal you can't get any higher on the total poll how many shows did he say
 he'd done it was 19 years 19 years thousands and thousands yeah I mean it's
 nuts and I just forget like he just gets the audience right in that pocket
 well he knows what he's doing and as soon as as soon as they're there you're
 like oh I forgot it's just cruises yeah from here like it just he just is so
 funny and there's so many gags and he just nails them and it just was like oh
 god it was great he really you really that was the second time I was very
 emotional at scoop fest was was that right there it was really awesome it's a
 big moment it's a big moment I again I'm just I'm just honored that that not to
 say that Harrison's ice stacking prediction via 9/11 theme didn't really
 I loved that too my brother was involved in that trick and that made it even more
 special for me it's only it's only appropriate because your brother was
 involved in the in the real day too right involved involved is a big way to
 say helped out with building seven but I mean you know you sure you say what you
 want to say involved masterminded I know he won't take credit for the master
 minding of it but that's only because he's modest then we had our mouth finger
 bottle competition oh yes oh my gosh it gets better every year I so all through
 scoop fest I make it a point so we you know our room there at the Orleans our
 big our big convention room there at the Orleans it's right off the main hall in
 their convention space there's other conventions going on while we're there
 there was some religious thing going on on one side of us there was a family
 reunion going on on the other side of us so I made it a point to as much as
 possible keep those main doors open no no just during the whole goddamn thing
 it is it is entertaining for me to watch people walk past those doors it's the
 reason that I keep them open I love watching watching people look in and be
 like I do it every year I love it during mouth there was a crowd of people at the
 doors with just pure confused look it was great at one point I went to you
 know use the facilities and I was in a bathroom stall in the men's room and I
 heard two guys talking go like yeah they're not really checking any badges
 over there that whatever that scoop thing is going on over there and then the
 other goes yeah but like what the hell is going on over there what guys like
 we could just go in there they're not gonna stop us and the other guys like
 yeah but should we do I want to do that dare I dare I let my freak flag fly what
 I'm trying to put an obelisk I believe inside of me I don't know how they were
 gonna do it that makes me laugh they're not checking badges like you wouldn't
 know like you wouldn't stick out like a sore fucking thumb if you weren't a
 scoop or if you weren't at least down to clown this year our mystery our mystery
 gift was a fez yeah where you could be jeweled so we had a bejeweling station
 you could you could you could which was a stroke of genius by the way that
 bejeweling station was that worked out well that goes that I mean he's here and
 that goes that Michael Osroth is basically our director of scoop fest at
 this point he really is he did a fantastic job with these these turned out
 awesome he kicks everything uphill for us well we tried it well we all pull our
 hair out trying to pull off school fest and and acts as a wonderful ambassador he
 and Laurie in the party room to help really initiate and introduce other
 scoops to each other in the party room really gets the conversations going and
 that that vibe carries on to the show itself we were running into new tariff
 shit we were running into all kinds of stuff yeah and I we really wanted pink
 robes to continue the robe theme to figure out the Neapolitan effect we had
 vanilla now we have a strawberry and and and then what's coming next chocolate
 robes get warm and some experience pain I said I do an idea to mess with it okay
 but but I don't remember the game of the idea of fans but then says I think I
 think it was me it might have been you I mean we can look through that we can
 look through the text but I think it was me I'm not taking I know it wasn't me so
 that's I'll give you full credit okay it was me it was it was you or it was you
 or Michael yeah me and Michael I think but Mike but again so many times we're
 like oh because of this is getting expensive because of this we can't do it
 or whatever and else from just kept after it yeah to make sure that we had
 everything we wanted to deliver to the scoops the way we wanted yeah I have
 ideas and Michael actually makes them happen
 I'd yeah exactly ideas yeah those you guys listening just just picture casino
 floor and a bunch of people in pink robes and maroon fezzes with a big not
 occult on the back we're going in and out of the casino right it is the best
 sight it is the funniest thing so funny it's just great so yeah and during all
 this yeah I think we'd figure it out we had a documentary crew running around
 during all this yes capturing all this madness yeah yeah it was just really
 really great and yeah a supernova girl in chat saying the group photo never
 happened yeah I just want to note an entire documentary happened so just just
 yeah there's gonna be there's gonna be like just clear we really did cover it
 yeah I mean if you really want to get technical like hundreds of thousands of
 group photos happened as the documentary goes on we also we did a we did a group
 photo with the at the ball too we did we did we did do that yeah yeah yeah yeah
 we usually do one earlier in the in the event yeah but yeah we did one at the
 ball this year yeah I have great news I just got a text message I'm being

 it is a hard time to be looking for work right now and yeah this shit happens to
 us and we're not even looking for work right you know what I mean like fucking
 every day it's fucking nuts I feel so bad yes oh yeah in the chat a wall scoop
 says even if they crash scoop fest what would you have done if they were
 enjoying themselves and not being disruptive excellent point and the
 answer to that is probably nothing well that's why I just commented I said
 exactly we just try to obelisk him yeah we give him some poker chips and say
 please download our shit all day long man get out chips and hey check us out
 yeah yeah it was nuts it was nuts no finger but whole oh those are things we
 had a confessional booth set up oh I know our separate repeat I am excited to
 hear those I haven't heard anything I don't know and one of our old friends
 was a Piper was behind there helping out and I said are you having shoes there
 and also you haven't fun just oh I'm having a blast just it is so great to be
 in the room where I'm not the weirdest person in the room oh and I said like
 think of it too yeah beautiful beautifully said and I was like that's
 exactly what I want people feel like yeah they come you know it's like that's
 exactly it's all about letting your freak flag fly man yeah we don't give a shit
 it's like you know yeah you know we're welcome yeah very welcoming community
 yeah look at that we're up to 40 participants that's a new record for the
 chat guys we're doing it that's growing what else was it scoop fest we had the
 mouth finger butthole tournament we had all of the quizzes with Mikey oh which
 yeah yes oh yeah he outdid himself again this year oh uh we should say on
 the show to several people asked about it at scoop fest people saw some medical
 attendants checking out Mikey at one point that was just a it was a very
 minor thing no big deal everybody is perfectly fine it was the casino being a
 little overly cautious just having their people check check Mikey out after a
 little slip and fall that we checked on him he was okay everybody's good they
 were they were everybody was healthy and happy oh then we had oh Celestia thank
 you scuba cabra in the chat for reminding me Celestia was there doing
 caricatures yes jock versus third ball whole every time I walked over to see
 what she had done for for a new group of people over there it was more
 disgusting and more wonderful than anything I will say my brother was like
 ooh we should get a we should get a caricature and so I did play my scoop
 card and got cut sees in line to do a dare you I know but it was you know my
 brother I see my brother maybe twice a year if I'm lucky in person so it was
 really nice to actually get a moment to to have this and we've got a really
 special year we have to get Celestia to do one of the three of us yes yes we
 should well I mean shit she'll do that it's hard to go sit for anytime you know
 what maybe we can have her do that during the zoom because we're having her
 on soon maybe we can do that because I'd love to I'd love to get one and put out
 put it up in the new chart well we'll talk we'll talk to her about that when we
 have her on next and see if she can just watch us during a zoom if that would be
 enough for her to get us I'm sure it would would work yeah so she was
 incredible like and also I had a personal highlight with the Pollywood
 Squares that fucking talk tell us about Pollywood Square what happened there so
 I was a little worried because of the board I was kind of like all this work
 into this fucking thing and if this doesn't go well it's gonna be the worst
 but then Ryerson who fest I was like the only note I have was not enough Paul
 my whole thing and so like like we did a lot of stuff a lot of things but Paul
 you know was not I basically was like Paul is funny we're trying to get him
 involved we were trying to get you to host a little bit of the trivia battles
 and so the adjustments we made was let's let's take on everybody in trivia so
 that it's right it's it's Paul and us against everybody instead of having two
 podcasts face each other right and then my brain was like oh Hollywood Squares
 but everyone's Paul it's Paul's characters all of Paul's characters and
 I in we reach out big there's a way to do with technology but well I go no no I
 want a physical clunky awkward big square yes where we have to move squares
 around Paul and I got of course turn to Ryar Apple door and to be like you you
 know what I'm talking about you know what this means so Ryar Apple turn made
 the biggest clunkiest Hollywood Squares board that could even fit through the
 door right with hangable X's and O's that was like nine feet what was it was
 like nine it was huge yeah and and that was the thing Ryar and and Mike were
 bringing it out and Ryar said they couldn't hardly fit it through the door
 right and it started well they couldn't fit it through the door that's why they
 had to come through the a different area they started from backstage on stage it
 started to crumple and bend and fuck up and the moment it started to just fall
 apart Ryar was just like oh this is gonna be perfect and he was right he was
 right the stupidity of it all just added just layers of dumb and it just oh it
 was so good it was down here you were Paul Lind Johnny Australia yeah Truman
 Capote which is a new one earlier in the day mum-rah mum-rah my favorite Paul
 Stanley vampire Bill Cosby yeah child barrel child yeah oh man and it was we
 were just asking trivia questions and making Paul's characters answer all of
 them Paul just came buckled right into the format of knowing how to play
 Hollywood Squares and I've watched a lot as a kid yeah yeah and it was
 hysterical it was so fun it's really good I was like and I was like you were
 like I would know I was like this is I as soon as it came to my head I was like
 hit it's in and it was floating is like I could we could do this multiple times
 like I was like if anything falls short I was like yeah we could just do another round with more
 characters even one point James like well if it's good and I was like no no
 this is good I don't know why there was doubting I don't know why there was
 doubting this pimping Paul nine times is exactly what the show needs and at the
 end Paul was almost guilty about how well I went he said so it felt a little
 self-indulgent and I was like right your festival it's true yeah yeah we're at a
 festival of you it's talking about yeah it's all good we're at a festival about
 you yeah and we are celebrating a show that has your name in the title it was
 it's it's possibly a little self-indulgent in some way the whole
 thing is self-indulgent it's now on the list right with mouth finger butthole
 that is now just a it's it's just on the list yeah yeah it's like that could be
 done at churnouts - yeah yeah well now I've got an idea for it for for zoom -
 I've got an idea for it for on camera oh hell yeah yeah mini version that Paul
 can just stick his head through that sounds fucking fantastic it's gonna be
 great that is good good good it was fucking hot shit and it made me laugh too
 so that was great yeah yeah I'll tell you what else Paul is gonna stick his
 head through and that's the following sponsor pizza for your hands that's
 right no more chewing with that pesky mouth of yours now there's pizza for
 pants hello I'm Reginald Felicity Guinevere and I have invented pizza
 mittens that's right pizza mittens cooked fresh every day made to order
 slathered in the finest of pasta sauces and mozzarella cheese the mittens are
 then placed on your hand piping hot and it's like the old Edward 40 hands days
 remember those days remember being an Edward 40 hands do you ever have friends
 do that to you and when 40 hands they would take a cold 40 of alcohol and they
 would duct tape the 40 to your hand and then you had to drink the 40 because
 it was so cold to drink the 40 quickly to stop all the coal so it gets you
 drunk really fast there's a similar thing but with pizza as mittens and so
 the pizza comes on it's pretty hot so you got to eat the pizza very quickly to
 get the heat off your hands but then the heat goes in your mouth and you burn
 your mouth but it's still really good it's still really really good yes yes
 yes and her hay scoops to check out so then what else what else was oh Gabrielle
 Lester just destroyed she just crushed Gabrielle yeah so fun and that was
 Carrie's mom who was up there with her I believe she's just known as mama scoop
 now yeah so so for those of you who don't know I hope I'm not putting
 anybody on blast here but Carrie brought her sister and her mother which is great
 and I think her sister spent more time than she thought she would hanging out
 with some of the events her mom certainly did her mom wasn't sure she was
 gonna enjoy it at all clearly she did oh by the end of it her mom was in yeah and
 I thought even by the end of it halfway through it mom was in I believe this was
 on Friday they got the hard news that their brother had suffered a stroke mmm
 oh jeez yes and it's so that yeah mom was upset sisters upset carries upset
 they're all fucking you know it's rough because it's in fees in Florida right
 what can you do luckily scoop fest acted as a distraction and by the end of the
 event his health had improved he was doing much better of course still you
 know not an ideal situation but things are going better and yeah yeah yeah so I
 think not only did it like it helped as a distraction and everything but yeah
 it was really cool seeing mama scoop find out what this community is all
 about and kind of just get with it crazy the shenanigans that is involved in this
 community yeah yeah but yeah Gabrielle was was great and then we brought back
 the pineapple and people to play for everybody to play for all the people not
 just the barbecue and of course that culminated with sweet Caroline we finally
 got to combine the the two bits the one the one that we do yelling fucking whore
 in between the bits and then again a great time to be looking out of the
 front door of the convention hall and watching the people walking by oh I bet
 I bet did they lose their fucking minds I bet those oh pure confusion it's
 wonderful and then adding in I don't believe you you're making it up and so
 we finally got both bits combined into sweet Caroline yeah and well we were
 shouting it Phil just turned to Fionn and said what is happening right now who
 knows they were confused but they loved it right I mean they just yeah well
 here's the funniest thing okay so one of the things that happened behind the
 scenes was you know they say we'll take requests and we we had them take a break
 to do Hollywood squares and so in the break people come up to me giving
 different songs you know one of the things that what's it called Princess of
 the City or whatever that's not the famous average song is by the Pogues oh
 it's a what's it called a New York City fairy tale or something like that yeah
 fairytale of New York that's what it's called very very New York it's a
 traditionally Chris it's a Christmas song but it's it's crazy it's about the
 deterioration of this long-term relationship these two people that grow
 to hate each other and yeah it's really it's a beautiful song but it isn't
 traditionally traditionally a Christmas song they're just cracking up going like
 I guess we'll just play it even though it's a Christmas song Merry Christmas
 yeah and then another song someone came up to Fionn and again just like you know
 time and culture and everything else he's the he plays the flute in the band
 and someone came to Fionn was like oh would you play like the orange flute of
 blah blah blah or whatever I don't know the name of the song no that was it and
 film just dead face was like ah maybe I don't know if we know that one and in
 this face is that it is a song about the English like conquering the Irish like
 the orange flute is about like the orange like yeah yeah it's like you
 were not playing that it's like when I first when I first start when I was
 first sitting there at the barbecue watching I was like I wonder if they'll
 do like the the Outlander theme and I was like that's Scotland you dumb I didn't
 say anything but I was like the Outlander theme that would be that's
 fucking Scotland you don't even yeah shut your fucking yeah people who are
 from Scotland do not want to be told they're from Ireland and vice versa and
 vice versa it's very key thing I don't know why anyone would do it yeah very
 crazy Ozzy no I'm not gonna I'm not gonna touch that so there we go and they
 never played long distance no they didn't play long distance but we didn't
 ask we didn't ask him to learn long distance that's okay I'm sure they know
 it I'm sure I'm sure they've just picked it up by just hearing it on the radio on
 the international radio stations all the time so that being like I can't believe
 somebody's asked that's great basically get any other situation we would just be
 entirely offended but it was like let's just let it go I'm sure it was just an
 earnest request and not a lot of behind it not realizing what it meant and yeah
 yeah yeah yeah that's amazing that's amazing yeah it's horrific and orange
 flute that's it the old orange flute oh yeah yeah this is just this is about
 this is a story of the Irish version of Benedict Arnold basically betraying the
 Irish to the English yes so now so now it's not a song that they play all the
 time is it but it but it isn't a traditional Irish song and not it did it
 recounts a terrible time for the Irish but it is the one that I'm finding here
 is by the Dubliners and it was done in 19 it was released in 1965 so that would
 be that would seem to say it well it is a traditional Irish song but just of a
 very sensitive topic yeah probably so it'd be to be a different thing if we've
 gotten out we've gotten out of the knowledge that I have I okay I have is
 entirely based on reading these lyrics here and that's it I love that they did
 a Wild Rover because when I used to sing at the bar at Star Trek the experience
 when I was doing I'd do a Klingon opera occasionally we would get some Irishmen
 in who and we'd swap songs it was great and they did Wild Rover and I learned
 Wild Rover yeah and so I knew Wild Rover and then but I knew a call for Wild
 Rover it's an offensive call I don't know they were ready for it I don't know
 if they've ever heard it but it's you know that I've played the Wild Rover for
 many a year and I don't know this but but then it goes and it's no name never
 right up your ass no never her no more will I play the Wild Rover no never no
 more so but that I learned that from other Irishman so it is a legit call
 response move for that song but yeah that was great they played that one too
 yeah yeah they were just it was great and I sent them to they got to go to
 Mystere while they were here oh fantastic did they get to do a backstage tour - no
 they had to get back and play the show well at least they got to see it that's
 cool I said I sent to Piff Piff the next day so you'd see Piff show the next day
 yeah next day Penn Sunday School live if you it's coming out this week just just
 check it out Penn coming back from England fighting a nasty nasty cult yeah
 tough it out for scoop fest of him telling a story about Piff Piff is there
 so Piff comes out from backstage and surprises the audience and it's Piff the
 magic dragon and he's got a steel chair I got to do my if impression just spot on
 yeah oh yeah yeah like Gudeau said and it was a really good it was a really
 really fine episode of Penn Sunday School especially health is considered
 Penn's health but it was it was great yeah then Piff stayed by he broke down
 his appearance on Foolish with Hondreau yeah it was funny that's the funniest
 thing is that you know Penn one Piff I know if Penn was sticking around Penn
 couldn't stick around because he was sick you want to know if Hondreau's gonna
 call in the Hondreau wasn't available to call in sent a small video but I was
 like I was there I'll help or whatever and I just should know better by now that
 Piff the magic dragon is always ten steps ahead of everyone has already
 planned everything yeah and so I tried you'll hear if we play that if we'll
 play it on those feet or not I'm not sure I don't think it's maybe it's good
 audio without video but I tried to help early and then there's a point where I
 just realized I should just shut up he's got it he's got it yeah yeah and and he
 just it just did a very funny presentation of all of breaking down his
 this is disastrous appearance it was a disaster it was it was funny to watch
 live I mean it really is it's up there with your cutting the tip of your finger
 off at that performance that you did I mean it's the same kind of thing yeah
 and if I had a perfect sense of humor about it it was great oh yes and Hondreau
 will probably develop a sense of humor about it one day well I mean he was good
 enough to leave a message that was nice yes yeah that we do a trivia battle with
 great night our epic battle continues yes you're now to what to know in our
 last battles against great night it's pretty impressive if you don't have the
 other battles that we've had against great night we are to and oh against
 great night I'm telling you ever since Ryre made that badass fucking belt
 that's ours baby that championship now we've got something to fight for yep
 yep and we and might I say I'm pretty sure I put us over the line with
 Blueberry Hill that's right you sang us you sang us into victory last year it was
 because the movie was one that I had actually seen before the terrible movie
 was one that I had actually seen before this year Paul Golden pipes Mattingly
 Blueberry Hill there it is and the ice cream social live you'll hear it that's
 the episode that just went up yeah and so that's there and so we go to the
 jock vs. nerd ball for baby probably the one of the best years ever man it was a
 solid jock vs. nerd year the foolers were there unbelievable including math
 the mind noodler it Michael Elsroth dressing up like Jessica
 Jane Peterson from head to toe from the foolers tour was really something else
 all weirdly accurate outfit we're the accurate great well for a minute I
 thought she was here I thought that was her I was JJ got tall what the hell yeah
 it was pretty great yeah turn to Michael's thing I got us in the photo to
 JJ and him going I hope she's not offended by anything I've done here and
 I said are you kidding me she is what Jessica Jane I found these shoes on the
 strip Peterson offended by yeah I mean if you put on Vegas stray shoes get the
 fuck out nothing nothing can faze you you're beyond the human capacity for
 phasor at that point I can't fathom that process I'm still thinking about that
 from last school fast clearly I am she's not she's not of this earth I don't know
 why you're yelling at me about it Paul said Jessica Jane got something else
 going on she's just a little wood nymph it's amazing yeah so funny see and then
 I said to the whole foolers thread so Christine just up as Alex as Vinnie
 Grasso with a bald cap on great helping people with cards left and right yeah
 it's really funny yeah really got good at that Amy was just as me as hillbill
 which is very good Amy did a card trick for me at one point as hillbill it was
 Amy had me pick a card and then she flipped me off and said fuck you I'm
 from Jersey
 the Alex remote would just Alex with abs just an ab shirt and a stuffed dog and
 just Alex wrote me saying thank you for the abs thanks for giving me abs and

 patch the patch on the on the sleeve of that one of those it was just a really

 and I had all the all the facts written on yeah that was great that informative
 Lemmy was really good too yeah oh man yeah so good it was back from like some
 of the facts were like from the scoop fest is so funny right yeah so many so
 many anyways yeah so it was just a beautiful beautiful event crazy great
 everyone come out yeah we can't do this without our community it's just
 incredible and fingers crossed for where the documentary goes thank you all for
 participating in that oh thank you to our safety cones we could not do it
 without our safety no geez that's the whole thing man oh yeah my lobster club
 barista guy was there oh yeah yeah yeah yeah so fun so fun we look as true
 country scoop we learned that Krypton is the eighth most common gas in the
 atmosphere and that was one of informative Lemmy's cards mm-hmm
 amazing yeah and by learned that I mean Mikey told us that and we all took it as
 truth and none of us have done any further research I believe Mikey 100% oh
 me too clearly Mikey yeah I'm fine with this I'm just narrating but it was great
 and then had a wonderful time over at McMullin's McMullin's actually worked
 out this time this was a good good yeah I think yeah did you guys like a
 revamp or whatever like their staff was on point did you see that does the staff
 had a scoop hat on they somebody got got one of the waiters a scoop hat or they
 got I don't know how they got it but they had a scoop hat on yeah while they
 were serving on on Friday night country scoop in the chat gave him gave that to
 the bartender yeah he was oh man and he wore that for for at least the rest of
 scoop fest he was well done country days that was really really kind of you it
 was incredible and and and like always the scoops treat everybody really great
 tip-heavy bought me food bought me drinks it's great yep just so oh and if
 anybody wondered if the Irish trio pint of plain went to McMullin's and tried
 Irish nachos yes yes and they loved them oh my god yeah I said I said I was
 afraid to even show you this whether you think it was like offensive to you or
 whatever oh and they go well there's nothing like that in Ireland but boy
 there should be this is really good they're really blown away particularly by
 the nacho beef the beef that goes on the Irish nachos right and it sounded
 like an Irish stew beef the corn beef the nacho beef yeah no it wasn't corn
 beef just the regular ground beef oh okay they're spiced ground beef yeah oh
 but the way they make it at the at the McMullin's they're like this tastes
 like Irish like stew beef this doesn't taste like nacho beef and they were like
 flipping out about it oh that's cool devoured two plates of Irish nachos
 blown away yes though three who's super that was that was my favorite but I sent
 them a picture with them in front of the plate I said my four favorite Irishman
 it was the three of them in a plate of Irish my favorite Irishman and my three
 friends from Ireland the country's not chiming in it's the same beef they use
 in their Shepherd's pie there yes and this way it's like it's like it's
 actually why I like I like that we do every year and a half for a variety of
 reasons one is right now to give us breathing room to not think about the
 next one oh to like that extra six months like our lives change enough that
 different people come into our lives to bring to scoop fest yes you know we get
 to include different people in it and so that's like really always kind of
 exciting to do and and and also we lose track of how many we've done so it makes
 them all really special because I'm like I don't know how many like how many
 businesses I'm like I have no idea I don't know and how awesome I think it
 was was it you Matt or Jacob one of you two what me came up with the thought of
 selling twenty twenty seven scoop fest
 nothing to see here I don't think that should be said on air but yeah I hear
 your buddy and I appreciate it okay they're not for sale right now so no no
 no no I'm not saying I'm gonna be an edit yeah yeah but yeah yeah it's all
 good yeah that's fine all right well we'll say it out loud now people at
 scoop fest were able to buy super early bird tickets or the next event yeah yeah
 yeah but that just now I was one to say with that was that it just to me speaks
 so highly of people trusting us and then being enthused about this event yeah
 that's not even announced yet right well the people that basically okay the
 people that come a year after year after year and I really wanted to reward them
 yes we're doing that yeah and so we wanted we wanted to give people a
 special discount on early bird even though we haven't figured out where it's
 gonna be there's no the time frame of where it's gonna be we know it's gonna
 be a year from late April early May yeah inside the actual specific dates yeah
 we've got a window yeah and and so basically if you were willing to roll
 with the punches we want to reward people who come year after year and so
 we give you a special a special ticket so they're there each everyone else and
 we'll get everybody else we get early bird tickets out and at some point in
 the in the future as well once yeah once we figure more of our ducks out exactly
 yes yeah yeah we usually announce it about a year out yeah I'm trying to put
 anybody on blast but yeah do you understand it to the listener this could
 not be the best news do you understand why I was trying to not do it no okay
 not everyone had the opportunities to do it people who are listening to the show
 weren't all at the show right all right no it's great but and we will we did we
 did discount for the people there we'll do a different early bird discount for
 everyone when we get the the tickets up to yes yeah we're gonna take care of
 everybody as much as I can it could be a bit of a sticking point for some of our
 international scoops as I'm seeing Bozzie right now but that's not our
 doing per se yeah yeah yeah well I mean we did vote for him twice some people
 three times good lord but yeah yeah it's gonna be great we're looking for the
 next one do you have any kind of trivia we have we have talked everybody's ears
