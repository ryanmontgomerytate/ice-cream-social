 here's a show hey Johnny do you want to go to an ice cream social yeah I'd love to great let's go
 hey how familiar are you guys with uh
 not at all but I know a little bit yeah yeah it's time for Matt Mattingly's ice cream social
 sitting over there in Pittsburgh VA that's Paul Mattingly sitting over in Las Vegas it's Matt
 Donnelly in Las Vegas as well it's me Jacob the audio guy we're preaching fun uh it's a lot a
 lot like Taskmaster it's I am a huge fan of how did this get made the podcast with Paul Shear and
 Jason Manzoukas who has done Taskmaster in the past I don't know if he's on this season or not
 that well Jason Manzoukas and I haven't gotten to it I was just informed by a friend but Jason
 Manzoukas basically wrote them being like why aren't I on this show and like barged this way
 on and got himself invited onto the show yeah uh but it's an English show and you should have
 English comedians or British comedians on there and uh it's just a snarky host
 and they put people through like random tasks where they have to be very creative or justify
 their answers it's all very like very funny and I didn't know about the show and turned out a friend
 of ours their daughter uh was uh I'm being informed that's that's not snarky it's just British uh
 fair enough and uh their daughter was totally into this show and so we uh decided they're
 birthday party so what happened was uh uh my kids invited out to California and um and they
 couldn't come without bringing a gift because every on the show every comedian has to bring
 a gift with a certain theme ah and uh the theme had to be uh uh rain and uh sticky was the was
 the theme of the of the uh so everybody brought her a rain stick an impressive an impressive
 object it was rain and sticky and someone could have you could have done that but the problem is
 if you watch the show if you do something predictable then the snarky slash just British
 host will slam you and not give you points so you have to surprise they'll be British at you
 and give points and so at first I was like I cannot believe that I'm driving my kids out to
 California and I'm giving them homework right but I started watching the show with my kids
 and they haven't seen it either at the prep and the show is really great like it's really funny
 I'm gonna have to check it out it's it's really great
 what gift would you bring under the restrictions of rain oh I I'm glad you asked I already thought
 about it I would bring a bottle of pancake syrup that's exactly what I was gonna do I was gonna do
 a Mrs. Butterworth dressed up like a queen oh no no I'm going to have somebody else sit in a chair
 and then I'm going to do a sticky rain on them oh I was going to have the queen
 the queen Mrs. Butterworth she would have the rain of sticky oh that's good too I like that
 it's a bit of a pun what about you Matt what did you end up bringing her so I helped my kids out
 with two different ones my one kid decided to make a fortune telling jar of answers to any
 questions that he had with a with a fishing pole with a and this the hook was sticky it was a ball
 of sticky tape so great he basically wrote like yes no maybe ask again fill in the blank
 hell no uh oh he didn't write a whole bunch of like really super specific answers and just drop
 it in there uh no you should not invest in that property yeah and my other kid uh took an umbrella
 wrote the most impressive thing on the umbrella uh with sticky notes and then uh dropped glue
 sticks from strings from each prong on the on the umbrella uh so he opened up the umbrella
 and with that had an umbrella of glue sticks he won he won the challenge with the really with
 the glue stick umbrella yeah he's he's good at a lot of things this was a like 24 hour event
 this was my friend went way the fuck overboard so uh they were throwing a birthday party for
 their child with all the kids the next day but the chosen five were to be contestants in in in the
 in the contest for the whole day the day before they're doing all of that and then having a
 yes i was like that is crazy that's too much you need to have an intervention with these people i
 i was like no one loves their child this much no one no uh so we had our objects i
 load up with all the stuff they needed for their sleepover and they were tasks waiting at the door
 uh before you enter the house so it's like they have these like little ornate envelopes with like
 the red wax kind of sticky on them or whatever and i
 i had two children so they were given two different assignments one was told to enter the house in the
 most annoying way please i don't even know i don't even want to know which kid that was
 go on and then the other kid was told enter the house in the smartest way
 both kids instantly had an idea great so uh one kid who had the annoying assignment just
 opens door
 and goes hey six seven six seven six seven six seven six seven six seven uh and just does it
 and my other kid just threw his stuff at me and ran around the house like went to find another
 way into the house yeah and so i entered behind the kid who got the annoying assignment and said
 you got to go find my other kiddies coming in some other part of your house
 probably good luck to everyone involved
 uh you know they were given like all kinds of crazy tasks and the birthday girl was the host
 and the mother was the co-host and they literally uh ran the whole afternoon with games uh and tasks
 for five of her friends to compete in in a contest that took place all day
 you know i'm thinking about i think this is a girl parent versus boy parent difference
 you know i'm thinking about i think this is a girl parent versus boy parent difference
 you say that jacob just but i think it's just a demonstration of how much harder it is to be a
 girl parent than it is to be a boy it definitely is it definitely is different challenges for sure
 i i would say though too like some people birthdays are way more of a thing like with my
 yes wife's family birthdays are big big deal you get to eat wherever you want
 everybody has to go along like it's a it's a it's a thing yes my my family wasn't that big
 of a all i mean occasionally it would be a big thing when we were little little littler but you
 know it wasn't uh it was in our house it was able to be shuffled around like we still would do like
 a dinner somewhere or some kind of event but it was like hey this brother has a basketball game
 this brother is a football game this was it's like we need to we're gonna do it next saturday
 well especially you got that many siblings too yeah yeah so it was always just a movable thing
 right like we're gonna go have dinner we're gonna we're gonna have a cake
 and candles or something like that some kind of celebration thing and we're gonna do it at
 some point did you have a heavy month matt was there a triple sibling like with my period
 yeah yeah did you have to you know really contain your birthday flow
 no we were pretty we're pretty spread out actually with my fam oh that can be a trouble
 with the period too yeah june july we have a june and july we have a june july and august three month
 see a doctor see a doctor and then and then uh yeah april december my sister and i are uh well
 we're nine years apart but we're five days apart that was with the only similar birthday okay
 that's what i was wondering yeah yeah but now like when my uh do you know all of your siblings
 birthdays i do yeah wow that's why i know no one else's right uh but uh people go like
 something's like i've gotten shit for like not remembering when
 someone's birthday is and i'm like man i just have my family and that's enough
 but my when my when my second son was born just two days after my birthday
 i was relieved i was like great we don't have to worry about my birthday ever again
 and that can just be his birthday yes i really thought it'd be so cool to have the same birthday
 but it didn't work out right probably for the best for his own thing but i thought it was awesome
 i mean i think that'd be nice yeah because when he's when he's little you just don't mention it
 right you know like you're at his birthday party or whatever and like you know like it's also my
 birthday kids yeah yeah or just be getting jealous hey room full of eight-year-olds
 and no one has told me happy birthday today i think i'll be taking this toy thank you very much
 just be like i thought it'd be cool with it but you know what now that i see it happening it's not
 it's not cool this is not
 i also want a cake i did not sign up for this
 it was tough you know who else thought they were going to be okay with not being the center of
 attention for a few minutes but they were just wrong about it it's the following sponsor today's

 um i have an eye doctor's appointment today guys well i hope your eye isn't exploding like mine is
 i know i know the funny thing was is that i uh i've had eye insurance been paying for
 eye insurance for the last three years and i haven't gone yet never used it and it was
 only because i went to the verizon store for my ordeal don't worry i will not get into it again we
 don't have the time and they did they did they call you out on your giant font old man
 i'd love to read the terms and services here but it's one letter per scroll here
 jesus christ i broke my thumb trying to get to the bottom to agree to continue
 your your tos took me 18 years to scroll through
 like i'm so stupid about eye stuff like i was like i don't know the difference between like
 who gives you glasses for someone who gives you an eye exam like i just was like there's
 glasses things optometrist versus optician maybe optician and then i looked ophthalmologist
 pearl vision was right next to the verizon store there ah and then as i walked by it for like the
 third time because i went back and forth so many times uh i noticed there were doctor's names listed
 on the door
 oh my god
 oh i was like oh so they got eye doctors in there
 that's one of my doctor places and so i walked in
 and said can i help you i said i i bet yes
 and they said how can i help you i'm having an issue with myself are you in network
 i go apparently i've had very good eye doctor uh insurance for a long time like they basically
 it's vsp they take it everywhere it's basically what i've been doing for a long time
 i was told oh great and so i said i have this insurance and i had it on my phone and i said
 jesus that font uh get in this chair now you gotta dilate your eyes
 i see that you have v scroll s scroll b insurance
 that was matt realizing he couldn't spell insurance
 oh
 bail bail on bit yep um do i know how to spell insurance i think i do but i'm not completely
 sure insurance i insurance i insurance and i said i have this insurance i've never been doing i
 anything before my eyes are terrible please help oh god wait now are you wearing contacts or
 anything yet i've never worn contacts i i have readers i've never worn contacts i've never worn
 contacts i've never worn contacts i've never worn contacts i've never worn contacts
 yes all over my house like like easter eggs on easter okay every room has like a pair of readers
 i've just thrown there just in case and what what number uh reader are you are you purchasing and
 hiding around your house uh that's the round one with a big stick at the end of it and it's like
 that's it that's a real big and you know like you just just a magnifying glass 175
 oh that's not too bad okay okay great good good yeah
 i've recently started hiding readers around my house as well uh that just go along with my
 contacts because now my farsightedness is thinking about starting to catch up with my nearsightedness
 which is going real bit real bad for jacob seeing anything hit the tune jacob let's hit the tune
 middle-aged white guy let's do it where are we god damn there we are i couldn't find it
 keys to your reader glasses because i need i need i've added one to the kitchen because i used to
 have one wherever i'd sit and i'd sit in the kitchen and i'd sit in the kitchen and i'd sit in
 the kitchen and i'd sit in the kitchen and i'd sit in the kitchen and i'd sit and look at my phone
 there's a pair of glasses yeah look at my phone and then i started uh for directions on stuff to
 cook i had this time i was like oh no yep yep damn
 yeah i have a pair i have a pair next to my chair and i have a pair next to my bed
 i just have two just just the two around the house well at first uh my and this is really
 fascinating for the listeners but at first like you know obviously reading tiny things was was
 where it started just not being able to look at look at small things um so so did you have the
 same did you have the same reaction that i did when i started to not be able to read my comic
 books i was like what the fuck is wrong with this printing yes uh and the same with like macaroni
 and cheese instructions and things like that i'd be like who is this font for what what lilliputians
 are picking up and i'd be like what is this font for what what lilliputians are picking up and i'd be
 like who is this font for what what lilliputians are picking up these boxes this is ridiculous yeah
 and now the problem might be me you see the tv above my head that's the bet that's the tv in my
 bedroom so my um uh i'm further away from the tv than like a regular tv viewing kind of thing
 uh now i'm having a hard time uh seeing uh the subtitles on shows i'm watching uh from there so
 now the other side's going too so now it's time it's time that's both ends it's time
 uh but i went right after yeah right after this episode i'm running
 over to pearl vision oh nice yeah so they said yes we can help but not today that's right yeah
 that was let's do it let's do a whole appointment we'll do the whole thing
 which gave me uh some time you know give me some time to think about it and so i started uh
 buying a lot of supplements i've uh off of amazon and i think i spent this time trying to cure my
 eyesight train your eyes train your eyes in three days so i can call him back never mind i'm fine
 right as rain
 click i saw some tiktoker he's like problem solved what i tell you about wearing these
 glasses and he's got these glasses that just have nothing but little pinholes in them
 and he's like i wear these and it fixes my eyes i'm like the fuck you do the fuck it does
 you lying asshole the uh you hope it does it yeah i understand that you would like it too
 it doesn't know the idea like look i know medical
 costs and medical care in this country is complicated annoying and expensive and everything
 else but the idea that it's a constant just like no we don't want anyone to know that the simple
 blank exists so that we can just rake in the dough on every single ailment that we've come up with
 it's just it's a little much sometimes yes it is it is i don't want to sit around and defend the
 medical industry but i don't think that the whole eye doctor industry is like shit hope they don't
 figure out pinhole glasses that we're doing like yeah my eyes
 here's how bad the the medical insurance here is my eyes are terrible we've talked about that on the
 show before my eyes are horrible uh you've never seen me without contacts or glasses i can't
 function without uh at least one of those things and uh like if this weren't this century if this
 were just a few hundred years ago i would just be dead in the woods somewhere right remember there's
 an old like back like a decade ago an old netflix show i think it was called godless it was a western
 show and it had a guy his glasses broke on that
 like a on the terrain and he's yeah and he spent the rest of the series like not able to see and i
 was like holy shit yes i was like oh my god i didn't you don't think about that like my worst
 fear on vacation like if i leave town if my contacts or glasses get fucked up yeah i can't
 do anything yeah i'm just i'm just done no you would cut pinholes and two pieces i would cut
 yep you'd fashion a mask
 out of it like a placemat maybe fashion a mask you would tape it to your head that's right that's
 right man just pinhole your way around portugal and i'd be fine then i'd be fine but no our our
 insurance is so bad uh like i i have good i have good insurance i have good health insurance i've
 good uh medical and vision insurance and all that kind of stuff there is a surgery that could fix
 my eyes because my eyes are so bad i'm not going to be able to see my eyes because my eyes are so
 bad i'm not going to be able to see my eyes because my eyes are so bad i'm not going to be able to
 see my eyes because my eyes are so bad i can't do like the lasik
 thing and so the surgery is basically a cataract surgery where they they take that lens out and
 they put a corrective lens in in its place and it's just an implanted contact lens is basically
 all it is probably safer than lasik maybe i have no idea who knows uh but i i do know what it does
 is is it keeps you from getting cataracts later in life it's also it's also a preemptive surgery
 for cataracts preventative because you're doing the cataract surgery before you have cataracts
 smart with my astigmatism i'm very likely to have cataracts they will not pay for that surgery now
 until they will pay for cataract surgery until you get they will not it's not they will they
 will not pay for the surgery that would also correct my vision because that's uh that's an
 elective surgery even though i will almost certainly get cataracts in the future and
 then i'll have to have the surgery anyway yeah it's fucked it's really this is so stupid it is
 it's stupid it's awful i mean well and this is the the kind of obstacles i faced as a man of size
 uh trying to address my hip issue for years you know and just being basically you know dismissed
 out of hand by the first guy i went to because the doctor didn't have the appropriate eye
 prescription and couldn't see you well oh he could see me and he was like oh he was like look here
 fatty and i was like motherfucker put these put these pinhole glasses on and you can only eat
 things that fit in the eye and you can only eat things that fit in the eye and you can only eat
 this pinhole i just i'll never get over i'll never get over the glory hole diet the the the
 actual guy that actually helped helped me and fixed my leg and the fact that when they got in
 into my hip socket they were like it was basically deteriorated into fragments and dust yeah we're
 really surprised how you were walking on that as am i assholes i told you this for you it's fucked
 if y'all listen to him bitch about it for the whole time you wouldn't be that surprised buddy
 yeah jacob
 and i were not surprised yeah it was terrible it was terrible if anything it was better than what
 we thought it was gonna be but this is the same thing like why the fuck don't i just you know and
 it's it's worse for women i know that too like it's one thing to be a heavy dude but but if you're
 a woman forget it my god the shit the fucking and that is the only aspect where it's harder
 to be a woman than a man but yes thank goodness only applies in the medical field oh yeah yay
 just aggravating as fuck well hope everybody has a good day i'll keep you posted um well jacob do you
 think there's any way that you could possibly rectify this because i know that there has
 recently been a kerfuffle on tiktok i don't know what other social media sites you frequent or are
 party to but there was a guy on tiktok i'm pretty much just i'm pretty much just tiktok paul i just
 i just do uh lots and lots of tiktok well he needed he needed a liver transplant right okay and the
 the insurance would not cover it they would not go through with it he was ready to do it and you
 know he he was gonna die and so he raised a bit of a stink on on his uh tiktok page and it went
 very viral and what do you know sure enough they turned around and they did the surgery and he's
 gonna live but it takes a couple of million strangers screaming at these mega corporations
 to say hey help this person it's fucked up i'm the same way i won't i won't do that i won't help
 anyone until there's millions of people experiencing intermittent outrage i would also like a liver
 though so uh if everyone could please raise a lot of outrage get jacob a liver i don't want i don't
 want any surgery i just want the liver um put it on ice by the way it's a little update on the old uh
 duolingo um i've after what i was suggested to be friends with my dead friend i since i've got a lot
 of scoops and other people follow me on duolingo i'm following everybody back um i think it's gonna
 be really funny if my most popular social media outlet is duolingo um i am eating apples i am
 drinking water i am you know uh eating pan i'm asking people if they speak english or espanol
 i'm on a roll i'm on a roll yeah uh but but in terms of like hey do does your phone listen to
 you do apps listen to other topics and try to compete with each other my instagram apparently
 was very jealous of duolingo uh-huh so that they gave me not one but two friend suggestions for
 two people who were dead they two dead friends they offered me
 to follow back two dead friends just one and two right there first so many dead friends you can
 follow what is happening why why would you compete with this yep i think actually matt you have
 inadvertently subscribed to cul-de-sac which is the new app that just has you trapped in a
 circle of dead friends and you can't escape uh yeah
 i'm downloading i have a lot of friends on seance have you guys downloaded seance
 that's good that's good
 you wanted you wanted to say spanish you got the seance you wanted to say spanish yeah that's right
 that's right uh chaotic points out in chat that my duolingo streak is better than my dead friends
 so there you go you got that going for me those are wins wins or wins might not have made the
 milers club but god damn it that streak is on no problem no problem what are we getting buried with
 our phones what's the plan here what are we doing with our what are we doing with our phones i don't
 know wait wait wait what what's the hypothesis that made that what's that how does that answer
 a question i don't know i'm just thinking like maybe you keep it plugged in throw some kind of
 bullshit ai on it and let it keep chirping and chipping away at people long after you're dead
 and be like hey man what's up you know it's like wait i thought you're fucking dead yeah i'm dead
 i got this ai running my running my shit it's just paul having weird dark thoughts over here i'm doing
 fine that's precisely like that i can't think of a more tech bro idea than being like wouldn't it be
 great when you as your ai self can let other people know you're dead so they don't have to
 find out from anyone else yeah i mean i mean your brain knows for like six minutes or something like
 that they say so hey yeah great yeah uh phones are waterproof now so it doesn't that doesn't
 mean i can't tell you that you're dead so it doesn't mean you're dead so it doesn't mean you're dead
 and i can still it's basically i'd be talking to you from the grave and a submarine it's like the
 same time well now the only the only challenge is keeping it powered that's the challenge is how do
 you keep the battery going hey how you doing this is the ai jacob how are you i hope you're doing
 well jacob is not doing well at all he has passed away i am really sorry to be the one to tell you
 about this i am 100 sorry that jacob has passed away and i am 200 sorry to have to be the one to
 tell you about it haha yes of course you're sad yeah you're a good friend and jacob wants you to
 know that really good job would you like me to break down three different ways for you to pay
 homage to jacob in a way that might fit your comfortable lifestyle i know you don't like
 mushrooms wink wink i like it i like it yep
 this is this is gonna be a new thing it's definitely gonna be a new thing uh yeah yeah
 well i mean there's plenty of gravestones with qr codes and shit on them and that stuff's not
 gonna stay around forever it's just weird i don't know grave gravestone qr code is actually
 that sounds better to me than what we just came up with that seems like a lot of fun oh how so
 the idea of just strolling through a graveyard and scanning qr codes is both uh beautiful and
 you can do it right now there's plenty of graves with qr codes you can scan it up it'll bring up a
 little memorial and pictures and videos and stuff yeah that's what i want i want people on their
 phones you know like i really want people just to be in tech just in their day-to-day shit
 grieve through the screen grieve through the screen put these vr glasses on and grieve give
 me your grief in ai ai grief
 uh so my oldest kid's a spoiled brat he's this this this week ends with him going thank god you
 figured it out first this this week ends with him going to the sphere with his schoolmates to see
 wizard of oz which we still haven't seen uh-huh and then the next day uh they go to disneyland
 with the show choir that's that's his thursday friday this week tough tough days but uh uh
 the uh message we got for the sphere was hysterical okay so like one is that we have to
 fill out photo and press releases for our children in order for them to go you can't go unless you
 fill out a photo release because both the sphere and the school need to publish to publicize the
 event they're having school kids visit the sphere okay what's what's going to be shown is i've got a
 they show in the big nature film wizard of oz yeah no one cares about nature anymore paul
 that was when the sphere opened i don't think they even do the nature film anymore
 and then uh uh lauren shreve is uh it sounds expensive it is uh we we fundraise throughout
 the year you know it's it's death by a thousand donations with schools they just keep beating
 you with the same fundraisers i have no idea how much money we gave to make this happen but i know
 in like several several increments of time do you think that you gave more money to this than
 you would have given if you just paid for the kids to go to these events well certainly disneyland
 because their grandmother has a pass so all right yeah certainly yeah so more than free more than
 free uh you should have been like yeah yeah you can take my kid to disneyland hold on i'll set
 up his ticket then the sphere had a breakdown that was like hey
 there'll be no book bags or any kind of carrying permitted into the sphere not even water bottles
 you can't bring water bottles or anything into the sphere nothing your children will come in
 as they are dressed that's it okay and we will not sell any food or beverage to anyone while
 they're in the sphere this is the second point no this is no this is i get this because you get
 one peanut allergy and it's all downhill
 bottles of water no you don't want nothing it's the desert look give them some water go get your
 own camel back or whatever kids aren't camels fuck that this is the first line of the sand i've seen
 with anyone with school kids and their access to water because one thing kids have just been able
 to be fucking nuts with is that they must have access to these crazy oh my god they're so hydrated
 these children nowadays so hydrated mark gates is no peanut water peanut water
 there's a market salty and delicious peanut water my waffle house bug hey look at that is that
 official waffle house merch it's official waffle house bunk yeah did you buy that at a waffle house
 i bought it off the waffle house website because i was raving about waffle i just send me send me
 waffle house uh stuff and i was like what there's nothing here i will reusable coffee mug
 yeah look at that i like that it wasn't the yellows this is the blue one
 that is a classy subtle waffle house and uh but yeah so so the kids can go there they're they may
 starve while they are in there but that's what's gonna happen they go in there and they have no
 evidence that they were ever there ninjas they must come in and leave without a trace there's
 just gonna be a whole sphere filled with starved and desiccated children stuck like mummies to all
 the little chairs just i just want to know what the sphere is gonna do when a busload of kids
 shows up and they're all carrying water bottles like yeah what are you gonna do it really feels
 like like whoever's running the actual like boots on the ground part of the sphere doesn't have kids
 and like for like eight meetings they're like and there's a we have another request from school
 they're like jesus christ but these school kids want to come here god yeah and so i was like well
 it might be good pr all right they better sign photo releases they better have no evidence they
 were ever fucking here they better not fucking pee or eat or drink or not like i want to it's like
 it's just someone yeah tell them the bathrooms will be closed up tell them we pulled the
 bathrooms out there aren't bathrooms anymore we will bring them in through a series of locked
 chambers it's a bad idea i think it's a bad idea to bring them there yeah any of it yeah yeah
 i think that i think this fear is making a drastic error how about that
 uh do your kids are your kids familiar with the wizard of oz yes okay i wonder at what point
 well what point will we get to the point where people haven't seen the original wizard of oz
 enough to get what's going on at the sphere yeah i don't know i mean you know the whole thing is
 that the wicked wicked creates this extra more current curiosity for the original that's true
 yeah if anything
 couldn't couldn't have thought that this was that
 this was going to happen with that of all the you know quote-unquote ip the wizard of oz like you
 know that's a crazy it's a crazy ass weird psychedelic the guy who wrote wicked or the
 guy who wrote wizard of oz wizard of oz yeah the person who wrote the original yeah the wonderful
 world of oz and all that stuff yeah that um that's uh frank bomb right i think so bomb sounds right
 yeah so what's fascinating about him is that he's not a wizard of oz he's not a wizard of oz
 is that his wife is a woman of some renown who's now flying out of my head um one of the suffragettes
 or she can fly no no no i'll fucking find it but uh yeah his whole family situation was really
 really interesting and that's a big part of why he put women forward in much of his work
 because he's a woman of some renown and he's a woman of some renown and he's a woman of some renown
 he he and his family especially his wife are in the forefront of feminism in that time oh wow
 oh and it worked women have it so easy now yeah no good job everybody no but it's great i didn't
 realize that and it's good it's good that it's good that it just puts women forward and i don't
 necessarily make it like oh it's a pro-woman thing so it's good oh pro-women oh pro all right
 yeah so i still haven't gotten anything in the sphere so my kids will my kid will beat me to
 the sphere experience there do you have a a desire to do you have anything you want to go see at the
 sphere i don't have like an 800 desire yeah it's just the price point thing like even even the
 movies like yeah because because i'm not gonna see wizard of oz by myself so i think that's like
 200 something dollars right right but it's still a hundred dollar day if i take the fam right sure
 so that's like it's just it just it just doesn't add up or
 whatever yeah our pal lewis was looking out for me for a little while for first fear stuff that
 was popping up he runs that liquor distribution company oh right okay uh but still the spheres
 it's tight it's a tight ticket it's pricey it's a tight it's a tight ticket well uh if nine inch
 nails ever plays a sphere that will prop that that could very well get me to vegas they did
 uh metallica the metallica thing is like that's that but that's gonna be pretty great that's gonna
 be i bet
 i bet i'll see that one money so much money it'll be i think it's gonna be a lot of money and and uh
 but if i ever get the opportunity to i would go see the metallica the sphere that's for sure yeah
 are people making films of these concerts yes uh several of them yes okay i know there were
 films of the u2 one well i know see that's the thing like trent resner was working very closely
 with um james cameron at one point to put together a tour film and it just
 fell apart at the 11th hour but i would love still love to see all that um i still have
 i just realized i haven't i still haven't sat down and watched uh ozzy osbourne's last concert
 that that big huge concert they did shortly before he died that he actually performed at so two things
 from that you guys have both gotten really kind of contemplated or beating yourselves up for not
 seeing stuff it's really kelly has turned into a scarecrow and jack was just on uh tv talking about
 how the benefit money was way over inflated i guess they they had claimed like 190 million
 dollars or something like that for ozzy's concert yeah remember the giant big time money that was
 supposed to be coming in i don't remember hearing anything about the money but i believe it yeah
 this latest interview jack was like no it was like 10 million dollars yeah it's like it wasn't
 190 million dollars but then part of me goes oh wasn't it jack
 oh really mr runs the till
 yeah as far as i know we donated i don't think we got any money our way
 all the money went out no i've got a lot of expenses here if somebody could reimburse me
 that'd be that'd be really great exactly exactly so i don't know i don't know uh yeah so my kid
 my kid will do that and then i'll i'll go i'll actually take all of the school to metallica
 that's what i'll do
 good man that would be hip as shit well for your for your next kid's birthday you could have uh
 five of their friends uh show up they could learn to play all of the metallica music on uh real
 instruments and then you could book the sphere for them to open for metallica before metallica
 sphere concert you could do that and then the next day you could throw a birthday party for your kids
 and wanted me to tell you matt and wanted me to tell you i don't know if you know this matt but
 there is a thing about metallica that i don't know if you know this but there is a thing about metallica
 you could do for your kids and their friends relatively inexpensively if you wanted to show
 up like a boss uh starbucks has just unveiled a mr beast drink oh yeah that's smart of starbucks
 you could take the kids to starbucks for a mr mr beast pick me up i think that would be like number
 one uh on the kids list like if i if i if they could meet a celebrity i believe both my kids
 would choose mr beast really really yeah
 damn that's sad huh i know i started watching much less obtainable for them than audio guy for a podcast
 i uh yeah i mean they we just started watching beast games too the second season of beast games
 came out this is admittedly not as psychologically torturous as the first season so far i've only
 watched the first two episodes lessons have been learned there's been lawsuits have been settled
 not just a bunch of people being terrible right off the bat and just making everyone cry
 there's been a lot of tears in this first two seasons um and it actually is much more tears
 and actually much more of like competition stuff which is which you feel like legit things happen
 with winners and losers so i do think they've learned something from the first season which
 wasn't like go in a room until one of you has a psychological breakdown and then you lose
 it would have been difficult for them to i i
 how hard would it have been for them to just recreate that first season
 oh if they if you're just like do exactly the same thing here's the new people
 yeah you would have been like fuck no yeah i can't yeah it'd be if they did it again it'd be a felony
 no i thought it was so funny because he's he is remarkably uh not empathetic uh and he hosts like
 his authentic reactions of what he laughs at or like what gets him like uh a little a little
 stirring is always like wow he just has no room for him to do anything he wants to do
 uh another human heart in there just not right not in there um and uh there's one game where
 they had to wear circles on the colored circles on the back of their head and there was uh different
 circle colors on the floor and within 10 seconds you had to run and be in the proper color okay
 that matched the back of your head so it means you had to ask uh the person next to you what
 color is in the back of your head or whatever and so you quickly looked around to see who you had a
 line with and you had to ask the person next to you what color is in the back of your head
 and it would be truthful to you and in this particular round everyone was truthful with
 one another no one wanted to fuck anyone over oh nice and so everyone kept going to the proper
 colored circles and he kept being like if this is supposed to be a bluffing game and if no one
 plays the game then we have to find another way to eliminate people and you will not like it and
 he had to like admonish them for not fucking each other over and it's sure enough they did
 they just started drawing people at random and eliminating people uh because everyone's
 being truthful and even after the first rounds of that happening it never got the bluff game going
 they just eliminated people arbitrarily until it got down so that game was just people well you know
 that gives me a little hope that creeping fascism might have some speed bumps along the way oh no i
 think i think that is a i'm i'm not even terribly surprised to hear hear that honestly i've seen
 several things now uh like reality tv games i go down weird rabbit holes on these reality tv game
 shows especially uh foreign-made games and i'm not even surprised to hear that honestly i've seen
 some of the foreign-made ones yeah and uh i just got done with a korean one called something like
 the it translates to something like the devil's game yeah and it is not a well-made show uh but
 the game that they that they built to to build to to film the show around is a fascinating game
 and it was there were people who were doing kind of what you're talking about matt there was one
 guy specifically he was like i'm gonna try and play this game where nobody gets eliminated until
 the final episode we're just i want
 to play this game where no one gets eliminated and we just play for the prize at the end and
 that's it wow and it didn't work out that way but like he had real momentum going and just like
 kindness and working together is definitely something that is in in the face of shitty
 people doing shitty things is definitely something that is making a resurgence i mean i think people
 recognize that it's a needed commodity and and they're filling a void i think yes and i mean
 it's a good point that should be represented in those kinds of
 more uh exciting or mainstream or attractive kind of media ways people are generally good
 good like like the problem yes the problem is that what makes the news is very right now we're we're
 living in an unprecedented era of blatant power grabs by very powerful people right right and it
 used to be even the power grabbers would have to pretend to be altruistic or pretend to be you know
 uh caring in some way they had to do at least one press conference where it wasn't just about the oil
 could you imagine if you know as uh elon musk keeps winning court cases of anyone trying to be in the
 way of him becoming the most obscenely rich person on earth right and he keeps winning these court
 cases and tesla keeps battling to pay him the most amount of money possible and the thing that i find
 generally baffling if i were a major tesla shareholder i would just be furious yeah all the
 time and it's this it's this tech bro like messiah culture where they just make anyone who's come up
 with a good idea and got fucking really lucky um yeah become the most you know worship person on
 earth and therefore these things can't exist without the worship person being a part of it
 and uh it's really strange but could you imagine if he said hey if you if since everyone's since
 i'm making all this money i've decided to make dedicate blank of my income to go to these other
 people but he doesn't right i mean look there are plenty of examples of people who who have
 you know uh like right bloomberg soros there are plenty of people who have made sure uh that bill
 gates has spent a lot of his money and influenced with altruistic endeavors so it's not it's not
 without examples that uh that exist but it's just not the culture it's just simply not the way it's
 it's going and so right now we have an era where very few people are being blatantly greedy
 for both money and power and going out of their way to affect people's lives that have nothing to
 do with it right and this is yeah this is a weird thing and those people are inviting other people's
 kids to come to these weirdly elaborate birthday parties for their kids just to entertain it's not
 it's not free for the other parents i mean they have to do they have to spend the time and the
 with their children uh the parent did uh offered to reimburse anyone for expenses for for uh ready
 supplies and begged them not to spend more than twenty dollars so uh but but but it's interesting
 the thought did cross the mind obviously for that yes of course
 oh uh but yeah well but i i think the majority of people are still good and the majority of people
 are empathetic and look out for each other and i do too and we see it with people putting together
 like for example even the crazy ass liver story that you told paul millions of people did rally
 right yes like you know like yeah you know it's like we we we do look out for for people all the
 time i did you see the uh the field doctor pepper thing uh i have a lot of friends in minneapolis so
 i'm haphazardly now uh donating to numerous couples who are trying to get their loved one
 out of uh detention from uh ice agency although they are citizens so yeah uh
 well matt i'm glad that this has i'm glad that all these people's discomfort has provided a way
 for you to feel a little bit better about yourself i'm a good person so yeah yeah no you're doing
 great matt yeah i mean you can't have my liver but other than that you're good we're fine what
 about part of it all right let's talk all right all right all right it grows back what's the
 doctor better friend do that i had a friend do a live uh donation live liver donation oh wow
 because your liver is one of your only organs that
 does grow back yeah it regenerates yeah yeah i mean yours yours is a strong term for you jacob
 but like the general one's liver can grow back yeah yeah a liver can grow back a liver can go
 back there's this creator on tiktok who uh she was like hey i got a jingle for dr pepper she's like
 dr pepper baby it's good and nice do do do and people just glommed onto it kept sharing it and
 doing remixes of it and full instrumentation everything dr pepper finally ponied up some
 dough to her and they've used it in a national commercial oh nice it's probably gonna be a super
 bowl ad yeah yeah it's a very viral fun and i would like to take this moment to encourage that
 person to go over to preachingfund.com with your new windfall of cash head over to preachingfund.com

 be a whole thing so i'm with plan b a reboot please enjoy this completely fresh take on a
 stale concept that i'll keep rehashing long past its overstayed welcome and that is from keister
