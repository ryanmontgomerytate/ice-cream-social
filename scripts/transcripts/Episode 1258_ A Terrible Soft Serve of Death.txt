 We're about to set up our trick-and-treat
 Deal as soon as we wrap here. We'll be going outside the city of our house here. Yeah, same here and
 I
 Well, we did a test run last night basically Ryre Applethorne built me a
 Disguised jack-in-the-box giant jack-in-the-box. Yeah, uh-huh. And so yesterday was trunk or treat
 Over at the school and so everybody had these ornate
 You know trunk they set up their car trunk designs
 Yeah, they do like full-on decorations on their cars and everything, right?
 Yeah, it's a trunk look like a monster mouth or all kind of stuff like that
 Yeah, and my wife signed signed me up for it, but we
 We've been crazy busy. And so I basically had
 30 minutes to run home and put stuff in my car to make trunk or treat happen and then back to the school
 I had the Halloween parade that I had to teach a theater workshop to the kids there and then trunk or treat was right after
 And so I rolled up in my Corolla
 Yeah
 put down a blanket the skeleton a couple a couple skeletons and
 then I gave the controls over to my youngest son who scared the shit out of everybody with a jump scare and
 With with
 With with with basically no decorations. We got third place in the trunk retreat because we were scared
 Yes
 Ryre Appledorn coming through baby. Well, poor Ryre Appledorn. I have to get him on the phone
 The prop did not hold up to the stress test of a repeated truck or treat thing. Oh really?
 How many how many reps did the Brock get last night I mean
 50 60 reps. Yeah, you know, I don't normally perform that trick 60 times in an hour
 Interesting interesting
 Will that my now my son to to his content is the the front door broke off completely and okay
 Then the fish that the clown was holding snapped out of his hand
 And then the finger got of the one clown got caught and something on one of the reloads and snapped a finger
 It was a real
 And I was also relying on that tonight today so I'm gonna get my neighbor Gary to see if we can fix the front door
 On the on the clown now the clown with a snap finger and a couple of broken things doesn't hurt the
 Doesn't hurt the bit at all. The vibe is still there for the scare. Yeah and
 To Ryre's credit he I for no reason he added two giant loud horns to the prop when I didn't ask for that at all
 And it absolutely makes it and my son was way on top of it
 Just blasting people with the horn on the jump scare and just really good really crushing it and so perfect
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but yes, this is indeed
 See if I can put it to put it back together for the for the for the
 Tonight Donnelly the perfect reading. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
 Paul you're already dressed for trick-or-treat you got your you got your Ninja Turtles hat on there
 This is actually a winter to that. I just sport when it gets cold. I was outside doing some chores today
 It's freezing out here. It's in the 40s. You're full on Ninja Turtles hat. I'm sorry. It's not a costume
 It's just your regular hat. Yeah, it's just a regular hat. I wear my phone. Yeah, of course
 I mean I wore Ninja Turtle pants on the airplane for years
 That's how that's how I roll. I'll give shit
 Yeah
 No, somebody was just asking me if I would open up my own comic book store at some point
 I don't think I want the hassle. It's too much hassle. Well, my guy my guy is in a new location now and
 It's just been challenge after challenge for him getting it all squared away
 It's a great new space but just brick-and-mortar retails thriving like no other time in history
 Right. No, you know what comic shops are actually doing better this year than they have in a long time. I
 Think they're up something like 30 sure. No, seriously. It's a really believe you but I'm
 That's a not a great comparison to what comic book shops a few years ago weren't doing well at all, right? Uh
 Yeah, I mean, yeah, they've certainly had their ebbs and flows. Yeah, that's all I mean, but they're yeah, I guess that's true
 I mean, there are a lot of them in town now that you're right there. I've seen a lot of them just pop up
 Anecdotally across Vegas. Yeah coming up coming up from the bottom, but it's a it's a you know, relatively inexpensive form of of
 entertainment and
 Every comic book shop has always been a labor of love. There's nobody for sure
 That is nobody open the comic book shop being like and then and then I'll buy my island
 More the more the point when did comic book shops become the collectible shops as well late
 Seven when we were kids, they were they were just comic book shops, right or were they were they already not late 70s?
 As far as we mean like when it became
 about collectibles about the collectibles now they've got like all that all like the
 Toys and gimmicks and who have the toys from the different things and there are the collectible toys and the and the Pokemon cards
 And all the things don't make me start listing things. I just sound like an old man
 There are still some comic shops that are very purist and and really hold mostly
 Books and there are the other things like those toys and things have a good margin on them
 So yeah, everybody kind of felt fair as it out. Yeah
 I'm holding the mug from the wedding the wedding favor mug for the people who nice. Oh nice
 Yeah, Jake, I just got out of there. You went you gotta get it. Yeah
 Yeah, I have they sent me this one. They sent me this non-descript plastic cup that I'm drinking out of. Yeah
 but yeah, we went and
 Anne and I had a
 Day to go and just kind of do a few little things together
 she's been working like crazy and
 so we went to get some food at Applebee's and then we went to the comic book store and
 then we went to try out this new ice cream spot that we have in town and
 It was great. This new ice cream store is great. And yeah, it's called
 Crispy cone and what really what's your go-to order at an ice cream shop? I'm usually chocolate
 You're just a scoop of chocolate usually but this time the way they do it
 I usually just rob them. They just say give me all the money in the register
 Smart smart. It's very different
 This this place very fancy crunk. Oh, no, he's out there got ice cream shops working for him
 My default is probably chocolate chip cookie dough. That's hands. That's what Anne likes
 Yep, that's what you got. Go to order is a shake
 Okay, shake. Yeah, I want to I want to no labor. No labor for you. Just went down get it done
 No, no, I want to I want to take it. I want to I want to be able to walk and sip
 Enjoy my shake shakes are so good
 And then I feel so terrible with myself after I have them and I don't know why
 Big one. I I see people order like the huge ones at everything. I'm gonna you are a crazy person. That's me
 I love me a big big chocolate milkshake. I just want I want a little like hand-sized
 You know, just a little little little shake little little chocolate shake or maybe a vanilla or something like that
 I don't have restraint if I get a shake. It's gone. It's gone
 I yeah, it is it is a it is a two-minute treat and then it is I'm with you on that
 I have no ability to like casually take a cup. You do have to pace yourself on the old shakes a little bit not me
 Now they could take it down
 That not only will not pace himself on the shakes, but they I got one that was
 What he caught cheesecake, oh
 Yeah, so they put chunks of cheesecake all on the sides of it and then drizzled strawberry syrup all over it
 Really really fucking good. It sounds like a mess
 It was it was really hard to get home and it was really tricky to juggle
 But it was delicious. You must have been an Ann's car. No, we were in my
 That you would have taken that into your own car I
 Know I was like, uh, I had well, here's here's what happened
 Paul does not like taking food into his car. I don't we're in we're in the ice cream shop
 And I start to get gurgle belly
 And I and I know
 That time is of the essence
 The clock has started and we we not only got we each got an ice cream and we got hot chocolates
 So I'm sipping a little bit of hot chocolate eating a little bit of ice cream
 Mixing temperatures should really help really help soothe that belly. Well
 I get in the car and we're and as soon as we're driving I'm like and I
 Got a bucket of prunes. I got some stuff going on things are things are happening and she's like you're gonna make it
 You're gonna make it. I'm like, I think so she says are you gonna shit in your cars? I'm not gonna shit in my car
 I just cleaned this car. I spent three hours the other day cleaning and detailing my fucking car
 Good. I'm glad that factor because if you hadn't clean your car, it would have been an option
 Not an option. I haven't cleaned my car in months. I might shit in my car. I don't know I don't know I
 Don't know because here's what happened. We got home. I
 Was in dire straits. I got out of the car. I
 came around the car
 Into the house as I'm coming around the side of the car and says are you okay? Are you shitting yourself and I go
 Oh, no
 As soon as she said it
 I
 Did she jinxed me and I said, oh no
 She is happening. She manifested it. She dream boarded it. She straight up. This is an impression of me
 She's doing impressions of me all day. She goes it's happening. Oh, no
 And I go running up the stairs
 Filling my pants. I'm throwing my jacket away
 Ripping my belt off trying to save my wallet and keys
 I can feel it ripping out through my underwear into my jeans
 I'm like, this is going to drip on my stairs if I don't get upstairs
 Run up the stairs run up the stairs
 I'm not doing that to my downstairs bathroom. I get upstairs
 Get this moment. I am going to the closest bathroom. I get upstairs. I throw my
 Hands off. I throw everything over to the side. I
 Completely have ruined my pants my jeans my underwear my socks
 Everything I sit on the commode and the commode is just the sides are now just
 Terrible terrible soft serve of death
 And it's just like the stench the stench. I'm like, I know I'm sorry. I can't control
 Matt Matt checked out Matt has left the zoom
 And is laughing and of course at the same time saying I'm sorry
 I know I know I shouldn't be laughing but you're too funny when you're doing this stuff. You're making me laugh. You're killing me smalls
 And I did I made her laugh through the whole thing even though
 Most women would just leave that's what I tell her straight up
 I'm like this is not the first nor the last time I've shit my pants. You haven't just left me. So it's fine
 So yeah
 Got through all that laughter. It's just it's just gonna be stuff going to a suitcase. Yeah, that's the trouble
 Yeah, that's gonna be the bad time, but it was fine
 It took me about an hour to get everything
 So real quick Leon Kasab in the chat just got back in. Hey guys, I just came back
 Should I recommend this episode for an obelisk?
 Sure
 It sums us up it appeals to a certain demographic I
 Guess I mean, I'm just I'm just being honest. I'm just being honest
 It was a rough night anyway
 but
 Finally got everything settled down and then yesterday. I cleaned the bathroom top to bottom
 So, you know, I did my part to fix everything. I cleaned the bathroom that day and then I cleaned it again yesterday
 So, yes, I did need the muffler
 I did not have my muffler muffler would have saved but what a muffler have even would have but a muffler have slowed this down
 Yes, this sounds like too much for a muffler. This was pretty intense. I have to say
 Bourbon barrel like every really
 What are we doing yeah, yeah, I don't know but
 It was just crazy how she was like she seriously was like
 Are you shitting yourself? And then sure enough I was like, oh god, I am
 Wasn't before I wasn't before and now I am and I didn't make it and it was just hell on earth
 Hell on the car is fine
 Cars fine. I was clear from the car
 Everything's fine
 Everything's fine now
 Well, no, no some underwear got thrown away. Yeah. Yeah. All right and some socks and
 Well, no, it's not a good story. It's a nice thing. It didn't get to my socks, but
 The socks is an unrelated side effect and some carpeting. No the socks. Here's the sock story
 So I have socks on where I have socks that I've probably been wearing for like ten years some of them and now they're getting
 real rippy. Holy and so
 I
 Was a terrible wrestler in the seventies
 anyway, rippy, holy
 I Bought a bunch of new socks. And so I was like, well as I go through and I find my rippy
 Holy socks, I'll just start throwing them away because I've got a bunch of new socks and
 Just so happens this coincided with me wearing some rippy. Holies for their last time and then and it was so bad
 Taking off everything in such a rush that the top ring of the sock stayed on my foot like a
 Rippy holies. I was trying to get out of my poop filled clothes
 You have tear away socks
 So then I use those socks to start the cleaning process somewhat and threw them away. Oh my god
 Yeah, okay. It was intense. It was an intense afternoon
 It was a heavy heavy day. It was a lot
 So wait, wait, so then was the this Cheesecake Sunday in transit with you while this was happening? Yes
 Yes, I said it on the roof of the car and just left it ran
 Didn't even get my hot hot cocos till like an hour later. They were not hot by that time. They were delicious
 So yeah
 yeah, and and got the sundae and put it in a bowl and put it in the freezer for me and then the hot cocos just
 Sat in my car till I was able to come back downstairs and get my hot cocos out of the car
 It was a you know else event for the love of God needs some roughage and that is the following sponsor
 today's show that madly ice cream social is brought to you by the soluble fiber provided by
 Sloppy knobby the official glory hole of pot therapy conveniently located in the Hobby Lobby. It's lobby

 JD III heard I heard you were coming today. So when I went to do my job

 It did feel like home. Yeah next time if you could coil a rusty old spring on your tongue
 That would just really put it put it over the edge rusty spring my tag team partner
 He's right here if rusty spring and Rippy Holy, I mean always loved you guys because you did remind me of the old furniture
 I used to have sex with
 Don't get me in a goodwill that place would get wrecked
 Jacob did you see yes springsteen delivered me from nowhere. I
 Attempted to oh and then found out that it wasn't streaming anywhere. It's only in theaters. Oh
 Yeah, you thought you're gonna watch it at home. I sat down last night to watch it and went to pull it up
 It was like oh, it's not streaming here. Oh, it must be on a different service
 I thought I was gonna have to pay for it. I thought it was I thought it was new
 Yeah
 I have not seen it that puppy needs theaters my friend
 That thing needs to blossom slowly
 In the seeds of the tens of 12s of people that are going into theater after theater to see a sin of magic
 I did watch an extended trailer of it last night and I and I listened to
 Nebraska in the count Basie theater
 I'll tell you that the extended trailer the extended trailer is probably as good as the movie
 Did genuinely make me want to watch the movie? So I think you might be right. Yeah
 When we saw the movie Paul was a Paul was respectful
 We got the car and he's like are we waiting to get on air to talk about this and I said
 No, we can talk about the car. We just rehashed it on there. Yeah. Yeah, and he goes well, you're the springsteen fans
 I I'll let you talk first
 You should start Paul said and with this conversation I defer I defer. Yes, I yield the floor
 To the gentleman from New Jersey. So I'm willing to have this conversation
 I'm gonna need you to set the tone first of all spoilers
 Let's just yes set that out here now spoilers for deliver me from nowhere, which I can't believe that fucking subtitle
 It is meaningless
 Meaningless
 It's a lyric reference, but besides that it is meaningless. Yes
 Here's the thing that really sums up this movie for me
 I'm watching the film and I'm getting you know as emotionally invested as one can when watching the boss
 Deal with this stuff
 He's got this long time relationship
 multiple-year relationship happening on screen
 With this woman and her child and he's very much been to become like a father figure to this kid here and there and you
 Know all this kind of thing and also just might be to say that that actor Odessa figure the last name is
 She's Australian
 She kills it. She steals the movie as far as I'm concerned. Yeah, she was great and I was like, okay Matt
 So who was this lady?
 Why didn't they stay together what what's what's that? What's the fallout from that? Oh, that says
 She's a composite character of multiple ways
 This movie forever then yeah, yeah because he doesn't even come off that nice to a composite of his
 When out of its way to fictionalize Springsteen leading on a woman with a child and ditching her that's
 It is the oddest shit the choices they make are just like if I'm gonna submit my legacy. It's a superstar
 I should put out a movie where I'm absolutely
 Atrocious. Yeah the most sympathetic people in the world a single mother a single working mother in a diner
 Like somebody said somebody in a writing room somewhere said like no
 No, we have to we have to do that like he was convinced to keep that bit in the movie
 I'm sure I don't know man. It's so weird movie
 Right if you just was just old-school movie making
 Right, right. You are supposed to ride the dip of that and then that person is supposed to evolve and come back to being a better person
 and
 There are scenes that set it up
 Dramatically so where they follow all the rules of film writing right up to that that that cliff
 Where the house supposed to turn around and do make the better choice
 It's like nope. Anyways, he went on to go do some concerts. Yeah, it's the craziest thing
 He he what happened to that mother and child who knows who knows he meets up with her at a diner where she's been working
 Has this big heartfelt conversation was she the best he had ever had not even close. She cries and
 Says she's a heartfelt speech like just pierces right through all of his bullshit
 Like I hope you find what you're looking for and he's gone. That's it. He never even talks to her again the rest of the movie
 She never shows up again. He leaves her he leaves her crying next to a dishwashing machine. That's it. It's over
 That's the last thing she said. There's a scene later
 The movie is that scene like 90 minutes left. Yeah. Yeah. Oh
 Yeah, it's almost over
 Like he's just like well, it's a build-up to this moment and this moment is where that
 Should make him break down and make the right choice, right? And it's that it's like but that's not what happened in real life
 So goodbye and then
 Sure, let me composited this together. He even has this epic road trip, which is which is hysterically
 Factual and that spring she never drove so someone had a drive to California
 Springsteen and Copperfield are two two huge celebrities who just never really drove
 and
 Like muddling in the diner with his food in the middle of like, you know El Paso or something and he's going like she's right
 She's right
 But he doesn't act on it
 Moves on as though she had never spoken. He doesn't even move on. It's he is absolutely
 Just feather on the wind
 He does not do anything he directs little anything in this film
 Aside from recording an album in his bedroom
 That's the only thing that he really does and then that same that same moment of him being out in this
 Road trip the guy after he's seen him get all upset with his food
 gets on the horn to the manager and
 Comically, it's the springsteen is like five feet away from
 He's like, I don't know he's gone off the deep end
 It's the dumbest thing you've ever seen
 It's like they want to talk about all the the the darkness in his soul, but it never really it's just I mean
 They they delve into his childhood abuse
 okay, but
 It's just it's just
 abuse in a way that is like if we if you and I went to film school and we're like
 How how do we want to want to show you boost?
 Let's cut to black and white and do the most like standard bad dad
 Scenes you've ever seen in your and the bad dad
 His bad dad is a character actor who's been in a lot of stuff and most notably
 He plays Italian gangsters and he played Capone and I want to say boardwalk Empire
 I could bone and also in adolescence. He's the tough dad and
 Adolescence the oh is a big hit the big hit on Netflix that for okay
 So he's very pigeon-holed like you see him and you're already like oh
 His father was Al Capone. Okay bad guy bad guy
 and
 Yeah, it's weird. It's weird. I would say has a breakdown at an amusement park. It's
 Like you know even Graham is that actor's name. Yes. He's great
 Stephen Graham he was really good
 Look, you know like he put out he put out this big autobiography and there's a big deal
 He does one person show on Broadway and where he was more candid than he'd ever been about his childhood
 and this is you know, he was he is the child of an abusive father and
 You know as a rock star, you know that obviously has a different, you know, weird weird way of sitting with people
 but uh, you know, I
 Said to Paul I said basically if you took
 Like this moment, right? This is a moment basically like spacing is finally which with the mood is get into but he's passed his lawsuits
 He can finally put out music again
 He can finally tour again puts up the river the rivers huge and they're begging him to like come back with another killer album
 And he instead takes this artistic right turn puts up the brass gal and all that stuff is true
 And it's crazy. And so like that is a weird turn and like and I said to Paul like anytime
 Springsteen fans talk to non springsteen fans, and they say he's just a cheesy rocker
 Most the first words out of most springsteen fans his mouth is something about Nebraska like that album is this totally different turn
 With with beautiful storytelling and songwriting in it that's not pop, right?
 and and so
 You know to tell that story as a moment of triumph, you know
 artistically is maybe fascinating and kind of like basically then you pit yourself against the record people and the pressures and all the people want
 To be super famous that feels like more of like a typical story and then he's battling depression during this time
 That feels like that would be like an underlying kind of B story, right and instead this movie makes the
 artistic choice to put up the Nebraska album against all the pressures of fame as this kind of
 Dragging B story while we watch this very in-depth arc of depression in the Jersey Shore
 Where the only solution is to run away and move to California forever and like she and like that's not a movie anybody wants
 to see about anyone
 Right. Yeah, so that's that's that's my sum up of it
 They flipped the a and the B stories in a way that was so strange
 It's just it's it's a weird movie. It's not a bad movie
 No, but it's not a good movie. No, it's a problem
 Another thing we said in the car was was like it's as if like a bunch of actors got together and we're like
 I want to make a movie where all of us get scenes where we get to act our faces. Oh, man
 It is acting happening in those fucking moat. Oh my god. Yeah, there's some people just really acting hard
 acting
 Well, I feel bad for the you know, the bear Jeremy Allen white or whatever like, you know
 You know your your basic book on screenwriting is in the scene a character should feel different
 Than it does in the beginning of a scene, right?
 So it starts off feeling one way and by the end of scene it feels another because that's how we're watching that interaction
 That's that's we're watching
 Situations where people can possibly change right? That's what makes compelling voyeuristic
 Scenic acting movie making work and there are so many scenes where
 Bruce's the same exact mood at the start of the scene at the end of nothing changes nothing changes in the same
 So nothing affects him. No
 But I did just find out that
 Matt did you know that the Nebraska and in cold blood were about the same events? Yes, I
 Think I think am I the only one who didn't know that I think that common knowledge as a matter of fact
 I believe if you listen back to our Halloween episode Jacob just the last episode when Truman Capone stopped by I did indeed ask him
 About that he did
 It's the start. It's the Starkweather murders. Yeah, it's clear that I wasn't listening at that moment of the last show
 You're juggling. You're juggling characters popping by the doorbell. I get it. I'm just letting you know that
 Karen and Georgia evidence. I just found that out this week
 I didn't I didn't know that Karen and Georgia on my favorite murder just recently covered the Starkweather shit. It's awful and
 Yes for a lot, but for a long time it was framed as this sort of Bonnie and Clyde type situation
 Yeah, all right sure more and more we're learning. This was a 13 year old girl who watched her parents murdered in front of her
 Yeah, not like she really had a choice, but to go with the psychopath. Oh, no. No, it's it's horrible. It's dark
 It's dark shit, but but I mean it turns out that story of murder is a bad story well, but
 But the fact that we lumped a poor little girl in on it
 This country's just fucking dumb
 Look at all the things that make this country
 It wasn't the Starkville murders
 Stark weather murders that they didn't just blame him a 13 year old dragged along for some murders. I think we have indeed figured it out
 I think we've righted that wrong ball. I think that's maybe maybe I guess I don't know
 Paul Paul Paul I got you the country is in trouble and those murders were horrible. Yes, those are both true
 Okay, they might not be related
 I don't know it feels like in a lot of ways it feels like he's just misogyny all the way down
 That's what it really feels like I went to I told you guys a couple of months ago. I went down to
 Prim to look at some of the casinos down there
 Just so we can just kind of walk through some of the casinos down there before they shut down right and one of the casinos
 Down there has the Bonnie and Clyde car. Yeah, where they were where they were shot to death and
 You know, it's got all the bullet holes and everything and it's a tourist attraction and I just stood there and looked at this thing
 I was like this this car
 was
 two people's death site
 the evidence of them of them dying is still here and
 They they killed people and they robbed people and they hurt people and they and they did all these things
 This is not this is not a nice story
 And I and I just kind of stood there being disgusted that this car was on display for people to come over and look at
 That's me with the Mob Museum people love going to my museum
 there's a little like a little little like a mini doc that runs throughout the whole time and there's one words mafia guy is
 is talking about being a consultant on a De Niro movie and
 They're reenacting the murder and he's describing like how the murder went down and they're like, oh, they're like, oh man
 It's got the way he's describing. It's like he actually was there and it's like, oh, isn't that awesome? No. Yeah, it's fucking
 Yeah, he was actually there. He was there and he committed fucking brutal murder. I don't know why yeah, that's a
 I don't know why that's a taint tickler for you. Oh because Matt, it's the it's the fedora
 If you're wearing a fedora
 Cosa Nostra, that's right. That's right. Oh, and he's not black. It's those it's those two things put together. Oh, man
 Speaking of Vegas icons
 Sarah has to Ross was filming a music video and
 Yeah, yeah, and I was asked if I would play
 Not Elvis. This is key, but a Fremont Street Elvis impersonator. That's that's the key there
 Oh, yeah, that is. Yeah, there's a degree in casting there
 And if you need an Elvis Matt Donnelly is not your guy if you need somebody on Fremont Street impersonating Elvis Matt Donnelly
 so I
 My wife
 Mistakenly thought I still had this Elvis outfit that I used to have
 But it eventually just like weathered away became, you know, I feel like she wore it out
 Honestly, if we if we're just telling the truth, it's like she just she just fucked the shit out of
 Well, I'm gonna call I'm gonna screen it but
 My friend Jeff calls it's Nevada Day
 here, that's right and
 My friend Jeff knows all the words than the Nevada Day song the Nevada the Nevada anthem
 Any calls every single friend who still lives in Nevada every Nevada Day and sings the entire song into their voicemail
 And so I have that that's what's happening right now. It's my favorite thing
 One of the more fun things about Nevada is that became a state on Halloween. Yeah
 Anyhow, so
 So I went down to star costume and I was like this is actually is nothing to do with Halloween
 I need I need an Elvis costume
 and so I look and
 In in my sizes they had this really nice red one, it's really nice red one say, okay
 That looks really sharp. It was it was a little pricey
 But I've been asked to dress up like Elvis on multiple occasions and I don't know if it was figured
 You're gonna get another run out of this. Oh, this was a purchase not a not a rental, right? This is a purchase because also
 When I did Virgin Voyages and I hopefully that went well enough that they'll invite me back
 They do a thing called scarlet night where everyone dresses in red
 And I was like, wait a minute
 One I can wear this. Yeah
 On the Virgin Voyages represent in Vegas. That'll look yeah. Yeah
 and so yeah, I bought myself a nice Elvis outfit and then went down to
 Fremont and I was like, hey, you guys are just shooting on the street, right? She's like, yeah
 Like so there's no like dressing area. She's like knows like so basically I should arrive as Elvis
 They're like, yeah, okay
 so
 Me which coincidentally is the same note that every person who hires Matt to do any gig tells
 I knew to ask I knew
 It's so common. My my my tear my tear of
 Acting is so familiar that I know be like no dressing rooms, right? No makeup
 Right is an AAE actor is what they call it arrives as Elvis
 I
 was just walking up and down Fremont Street dressed I had to tow his Elvis and
 Anyone look at you twice?
 No, people were loving it
 Loving it. And so then I did this at this bit of a Sarah that when the music video comes out
 I think it's gonna look great. So I won't spoil it, but it was super fun and
 As I'm walking back to my car a guy literally goes like hey
 Are you?
 Are you like doing stuff here? And I was like, no, no, sorry
 I'm just I just actually just got a music video and I'm just walking back to my car. He was okay
 Um, can I take a photo of you anyway?
 Sure and he's like you like gets down like it's a good angle or whatever. Yeah, it's like
 Sorry, I mean, can I do is like a self selfies? Okay, is this selfie? Okay, and I was like, yeah, let's let's do it man
 We took a nice selfie whatever and he was like I got to give you some money
 This is you better say
 You've had a wonderful person I was like
 Did you take some money? I hope you took some fucking money. This is the thing
 I told the story to Sarah and she goes how much you make I said I said no, no, I'm okay
 I want to just want to get home to my kids, you know and
 Uh
 Sarah was like you you're a fool. Yeah
 And I was like, I know I'm dumb every person I talked to it has been like
 What was gonna give you it? I was like, I don't know. I don't who knows you probably get a hundred bucks
 I doubt it, but you never know man. People are crazy out there. No Jordan Campbell says this is how Matt started on his only fans
 Jordan this did feel
 It did feel like a moment of like I often gonna rack my brain if I could like make extra money or whatever
 it's all the idea if I could just get on a free street just like
 It felt like too easy like that's it was like I literally was like trying to not do it and then someone stopped and like
 Made sure they are funny and I was getting a lot of attention
 You know, I was walking with purpose to like not get stopped, but I was causing a lot of attention walking up and down
 Pretty much three dressed at the toe is Elvis. Yeah, so real talk
 I think you might be able to make some money doing this especially in like the earlier hours on Fremont Street
 Not like 2 a.m. But like the 10 p.m. Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm thinking like 9 or 10
 I'm thinking like early early night time and but when the families are still out
 Yeah
 Because the people the people taking pictures with people on Fremont Street
 If you don't want someone to be naked in your photograph, you're out of luck
 Like you're just you're just out of luck. Yeah, or if you don't like palm
 Crucifixes palm crucifixes are naked people like you do often crucifixes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
 So everybody's down there though. I did stop and watch a street magician
 How was it form for a few minutes? He was really good. He was really good. Well, that's good news
 It's after some money in his bucket. He was great
 It's hard because there's there's music playing at all kinds of volumes the entire time. Yeah, sometimes it's super loud. Sometimes it's just loud
 This guy was a genius. I thought about that while I was watching him. He did it most of it
 He did silently right? That's that's what it would take. Yeah
 I saw a guy doing that that kind of like over there. They're all silver and money moves them kind of oh, yeah
 Yeah with a magic trick kind of attached to that and I was like, yeah, that's all we can do down there. But yeah. Yeah. Yeah
 So, yeah, I don't know
 Just the second time just to see what it's like to actually give it a shot really
 I think I also want you to go down there without getting a spot reserve for yourself
 And I want to see if you get some shit for not having a reserved spot
 You probably will if you that's the thing if you do it with the intention of getting paid you won't get paid
 right people talk about it all the time like when when when folks hit the skids and
 They're out on the street begging for money like the first day they feel like oh
 We're gonna be alright here. And then after that is this weird beginners luck thing and it just gets really hard
 Yeah, yeah, that is a lot of stories. That is a lot of people's stories. You're right. It's all attitude
 I think it's all the attitude
 I think I think people can I don't even know how to say it because I don't know what it is
 But but I think that people can
 Sense that what the one thing is soon as you are desperately as soon as you're actually desperate
 That's that rippy holy energy. Yeah
 I'll tell you who else has got that rippy holy energy and that's the following sponsor
 Today's show is brought to you by the squirrels guide to breaking into podcasting. That's right. This is from cup of scoop in 2025
 That's a squirrels guide to breaking into podcasting
 Hey
 My name is nutso nutso the nutty squirrel
 Yeah, and I'm gonna teach you all about breaking in a podcast and
 Hey
 Say there Matthew, I got a question for you
 Do you enjoy fast food I
 Have been known to indulge from time to time. Yeah, you're like a baconator
 Yeah, I used to do some of the baconator just for the so you like Wendy's nuts in your mouth
 You got me good on that one squirrely you got me good
 I would normally cut the ad off here, but squirrely actually paid for five minutes
 Jacob I heard yes early. I heard you're a connoisseur of fast food eateries as well. Sure. Yeah
 Enjoy a vanilla frosty once in a blue moon. I do yeah. Oh, so you like Wendy's nuts in your mouth
 Say hey, hey, hey Matt. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know you like a lot of different fast food restaurants
 You I do go to the Golden Arches once in a blue moon. Do you oh McDonald's? Sure. I don't oh, yeah
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so you enjoy Big Macs
 No, you just get you know the regular cheeseburger the plain one
 Okay
 I
 Really sucked him on that last one there Paul Chamberlain just left the room. It was an unintentional Wallachian impression
 I did well, I guess while Sean is just a squirrel
 I did sound remarkably like all
 I've never seen one Sean and a squirrel in a room together. So I can't I can't say for sure that he's not a squirrel
 I was trying to surprise you did play to my recorder
 So Jacob is this already played to my recorder, but I was playing the home is Nevada
 They think this big if I get them both my mics here
 Who's that singing Jeff my friend Jeff well done Jeff. Yeah got some pipes on him
 Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah
 Oh
 Go ahead Jacob. Oh
 I was just gonna tag on to the end of Fremont Street. I did see a
 While I was down there the other day. I did see a
 Parent who was watching a performance
 Whose child I would guess?
 Six or seven was just sitting on the on the ground at Fremont Street
 While the parent was watching something kind of over there, you know a couple of feet away. Mm-hmm
 It's the first time I've ever wanted to call CPS on any wait now. Oh
 The parent was letting your small child just sit on the on the on the street on Fremont Street
 That's that's already disgusting. Yeah, pretty gross
 Yeah, I was I was not okay what captured their attention so much. Was it one of the giant gorillas?
 No, it was just one of the bands. It was just it was just music going. The band was great
 But you see any of the giant gorillas while you're down there, man
 No, that's any giant girls. There really it really wasn't actually a lot going on. I know I
 Haven't been down there in months without seeing at least three or four giant gorillas. I wasn't I was surprised at how little I mean
 We were there. It was a you know, it was I was there from around
 Like 330 to five maybe it's like 530
 I
 Surprised how little was going on?
 Like I said, there's a lot of a lot of unhoused people just sitting in the spots that were designated for performers
 Yeah begging and then some some some some some crucifixes and then the one guy painted in silver
 His bit. Oh
 This was also a Tuesday
 Maybe don't wake up till later. That's probably that's I mean, that's very possibly true. Yeah, also
 I also went to disco the other night
 Oh nice and drove down and not since I moved here in 2008 where I stick those back roads to paradise and Koval to get
 down to the Venetian
 Boy, no one just absolutely no cars. Just driving around absolutely nothing
 I've never seen the streets so empty. That's nice. And then I pulled right into the link and
 Got in the very first row of self parking just a space wide open for me at seven o'clock at night
 Rumors are true Vegas is dead
 Or everybody is avoiding Matt
 No, I don't think that's it. I could not believe how little
 There was anyone around in Las Vegas. That's so like I drive down those streets all the time and they are packed all the time
 Yeah, yeah
 I have to go down there to fucking the flamingo which has gotten even harder to get to now, which is crazy. I
 Should note that they did start building the f1 track. So it could just be a lot of people just avoiding
 But that might be it
 But also yeah, there was that I mean I walked up and down the link
 I was very surprised that that just kind of that's kind of crazy, man. Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of crazy. It was weird
 It's anecdotal, but it's weird. Sure still
 Still I'm gonna go see disco tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it. I haven't seen it since since the revamp
 Oh, I think yes, I think you'll dig it. I'm looking forward to it. I'll tell you though. He recently added
 our friends D and
 Great grace
 Created these clown characters to perform around the venues that are around disco not in the venue itself
 The two other people were doing their bit
 where they're just oh, yeah, two giant disco balls wearing capes and disco mustaches and
 They were killing it. I didn't know I didn't know these people were which is weird
 I'm surprised. Oh good. There's two people that were just being that I need to find out who they were
 But they were being hysterical so people came out of I always get nervous when people create bits like like Dean Grace did and then
 Kind of hand them off, right? The handoff always makes me nervous. I'm glad to hear that. It's going really well
 Yes, and so they were just doing a thousand bits and that people nice falling over laughing and I was like, this is great
 I'm really looking forward to it. This is gonna be great. Yeah, it's a fun show. I really like that show
 It's so different and but it's really cool now. It's super it's super streamlined and it just goes and our friend
 Eli is the host
 and
 He's just so funny. He's just a funny like a full person. Yeah. Well, that's one reason I'm going tomorrow is
 Our another friend of ours. Nick is in for Eli. I've seen Nick do it. Nick's great at it. Nick is great at that
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, Nick from banana fame at scoop fest. Yes will be in disco tomorrow. I drank his milkshake
 You did you drink it up? I
 left a little on the floor for Jonas's wheel, but
 a little surprise for Jonas later
 Surprise
 But the answer is yes, I'll be dressing up like Elvis tonight for my trick-and-treat I'll be Elvis in my neighborhood and yes
 I was just about to ask you how long are you because I know what time your trick-and-treat is starting today
 I saw your wife last night and she said that you guys are starting at 3 p.m. Today
 Well, how late are you planning on going?
 We usually go to like 9 or 10. Usually the streets get pretty empty at 9
 Okay, and then I just run in a front yard party until until until the streets get rolled up
 We have a set time here. It's it's 6 to 8
 Yeah, yeah, that's something the high mark, but people come early some people have little kids they go early
 Well, it's the light out and then also just you know teenagers and all these other kids that go late and for me for the trick
 And treating I like the teenagers. Yeah
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 for
 Magic trick purposes not for yeah. Sure. Yeah
 Yeah, it's better to deal with I don't know why Matt thinks I mean something else. I'm talking about his magic trick
 No, he's teenagers. I love his magic. I put an audience and we disappear
 You want an audience that has grasped the concept of object permanence? That's right before you perform magic. That's correct
 Matt's baby magic didn't go well
 Yeah, and my my my my big ringer when should I fix the clown in time for it to be a jump scare?
 That'd be great. And then I
 Got a duck a wooden duck that whoa pecks at cards and and snatches your card out of a deck of cards
 Oh, that's pretty good. Whoa
 Is it like one of the one of the happy bird? Yes. Well, no, no, no nice
 It's like it's like a wooden it's like an ornate wooden
 This isn't you'd see it like a kitschy like like a cracker barrel lawn decoration, right?
 but it has it has a
 Mechanical neck so you push the okay you push the duck's head down and it's just and it just
 Opens beacon snatches a card out of a deck of cards. Oh, I wish my wife had that
 What it's a what it's an old it's an old it's an old old magic prop. I just bought one. Oh, it is. Okay
 Yeah, it's a known thing that the done. Yeah, the duck card picker it be duck. I think it's called. Yeah
 Yeah hippie duck dip dippy duck dippy duck dippy duck. That makes sense. Yeah. Hippie dippy duck is a whole different thing
 Yeah, you guys want to lose scoop mail, yes, please let's go let's do a little scoop mail
 From winter scoop, this is something I've been wanting to talk about for a week
 Now the jewelry heist at the Louvre has my brain screaming
 The guys use the construction ladder to access a balcony to bypass the front doors
 They were work vests and helmets and stole the jewelry after the place opened up guests watched them do it and nobody said anything
 They just assumed that they were guys. They're working doing their job the balls on those guys. That's from winter scoop winter scoop
 I'm genuinely concerned that the robbers of the Louvre are scoops. I
 Have been advocating bring a ladder for years that you can get in anywhere. These people just took that to the nth degree
 So I heard also apparently that that kind of apparatus that long ladder
 Hooked to a little scooter cart kind of deal is a lot more commonplace out in France because the buildings are so old
 That they don't have proper places for you to unload cargo in a lot of these places
 Sure. Sure. So it's not like in the states if you saw somebody with a ladder up to a window you go
 Wait a minute
 right, maybe I
 Tell you how you I'll tell you I'll tell you you need
 One thing to make it where people don't give you that look in the states when you're when you're doing that and that is an orange
 Road cone next to the ladder. Yeah, you're right
 I mean that you put a single orange road cone next to the ladder
 You're done. The safety vest thing really does a lot does a lot of work. Yep
 And if you got a radio like you can just flush this whole thing out. I
 Think this could happen all the time. I'm really surprised. This doesn't happen more often
 Like you just fit in you just fit in and go do whatever you want
 Let's see we got one I
 Know people that in magician's world who are thinking that it's a it's secretly a ploy to advertise now
 You see me the new now you see me movie coming up. Oh
 Could be
 That's an elaborate
 Well
 Was Gabriella one of the Louvre robbers
 Jesse Eisenberg is donating a kidney as part of his promotional work, I guess
 What? Yeah. Yeah, Jesse. Eisenberg is donating kidney to a stranger and
 The bit is they stole his kidney. No, he's just big and what is it with these magicians and donating blood Matt? What's going on?
 Does playing with cards enough make you just say that off got way too much blood in me
 I'm blanking on her name. She made a documentary about this basically like how it's been it's difficult
 Some very healthy people have two functioning kidneys and if you are a very good health
 you don't need them both so to speak right and there are a lot of people who need kidneys and
 Just did the one on the Satanic temple
 Oh, you know what Penny Lane Penny Lane Penny Lane that did a doc on this
 She found it very difficult to try to donate your kidney to a stranger. She I remember her doing this doc
 I never got to see it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She did a doc about about like rent not even random donations
 But like random anonymous donations of organs, right?
 Yes
 So basically like a lot of times you can put out calls if you need a kidney then then your friends and neighbors or friends
 Or friends you put a campaign to do it and that's how right most kidney donation works
 But when it comes to just saying like hey, I
 Have an extra kidney find someone who needs it for me that that operation wasn't streamlined
 But that has improved over the years and so now
 People who just kind of are you know, if you're generally, you know, like I said, you don't drink
 You don't really do too much crazy shit and you can just be a healthy person
 You can go go without go without one of those kidneys. No one has ever asked me for one of my kidneys. Oh
 No, I don't know why it's never come up yeah one of your marinated kidneys
 Ten scoop in the chat mentions. It's even harder to donate if you bring it in a cooler
 Mine I've been sitting on this thing for a week. Come on
 YouTube tutorials and now
 You made me fill my bathtub up with ice for nothing
 Cost me like $23 to get all that ice
 We got one from pigases hey Matt Paul and Jacob, thank you guys and especially all the safety cones helper scoops and performers
 For putting together another incredible scoop fest. It was amazing seeing so many weird and wonderful scoops
 There is a great mix of new and old
 Older scoops that hang out with and go on adventures with it's incredible how you can not see a scoop for 18 months and pick
 Right back up where you left off from the last scoop fest podcast trivia battles and variety shows
 Especially Hollywood squares were some of the very best ever
 Although I'm going to try to avoid being conned into sitting in the front from now on
 Quick scoop vest that basically proves that I'm a potato
 Sunday night after scoop fest I was in an elevator at the Orleans when two very friendly and drunk women hopped on
 They noticed my hot dog necklace right away said how much they liked it and we chatted a bit between floors
 They were on vacation and clearly having a great time while I stood there being well me when I got off the elevator
 I ever heard one of them say to the other it's okay
 I guess he doesn't want a party
 It wasn't until much later at McMullin's that I realized what was actually happening in that elevator
 I just thought they were being polite. I'm already looking forward to the next one
 It was great meeting so many new scoops and reconnecting with returning scoop
 Thanks again for all the hard work you do to make scoop message a unique and fun gathering
 Pegasus will fly again fucking you in the face. That's Roger aka the nest scream our nest creamer aka Pegasus
 All right. Thanks Roger sounds like you saved yourself about six to eight hundred bucks, buddy
 It's really true. It's probably like you all know you probably were almost about to get rolled
 You never know in Vegas, and you know, I think Orleans. It was 350. I thought well, I think I think I
 Know for myself just come on
 You just kind of default to the no way. This is not happening. This is some candy camera bullshit. I
 Have had multiple friends think that they were doing very well with women
 Then to realize on their own that they were talking to prostitutes
 That's happened to multiple friends of mine and they're sad every time it happens
 They still pay for the sex and everything. They still do that
 It's a blow to their ego first
 It's a blow to their ego that it's a boat
 Good day. Good deal fair. Oh
 Let's see, oh there's another scoop me or another
 What does it think we do scoop fest no I don't need to do the scoop best email right now from bear scoop
 Hey, Matt Paul and Jacob in the same vein as the he did what and other tales
 I decided to write in with my story of it's actually what a
 Time well one of many when my sheer stupidity revealed itself in true glory
 For context I live in a somewhat big city not far from Vancouver BC and for years
 No decades my commute to and from work
 I would routinely see a box truck think a u-haul like a three or four ton with words
 diamond delivery
 Plastered on the side and back which of course was of course a picture of a huge diamond in the middle now
 I don't know if I was just in the monotony of my commute every time I saw these trucks
 But I always assumed that I made up a story that of course these trucks needed to be this big
 they were delivering diamonds throughout my 1 to 2 million population bustling metropolis and
 The safe the safes used to do this probably take up most of the back of these trucks
 That was until my early to mid 30s when I saw one of these trucks parked in my townhouse complex outside another unit
 I found this odd as why would a residential customer be having diamonds be shipped to them
 Oh dear God as I see them taking plants furniture another crap out of the back of the truck
 Diamond delivery is a delivery company not a diamond delivery company
 So anyway, that's my it's actually what story fucking with the face. That's a bear scoop
 Thank you bear scoop. Yeah, I
 For a little while when I was a kid. We used to have Schwann's did you go? Yeah Schwann's meal delivery?
 Yeah, yeah, the refrigerated trucks and everything. I thought it was delivering swans
 I thought these people are getting are getting geese
 Swans delivery service. Yeah. Yeah
 People used to eat swans, right? That's a thing. I guess you could eat a swan. Why not?
 I mean, you did anything with the right attitude
 We are one from slurping time motherfucker greetings face fuckers
 I'm writing in response to a conversation at scoop fest about bits and how this community attracts people with a fervent love and
 Commitment to silly bits. Yeah
 It's it's one of the best things about our community
 One of my favorite things this year was being privy to scoops sharing their personal bits with each other giggedy
 So that we could all go home with fresh road tested material that our spouses and loved ones would still not appreciate
 This jogged my my memory of a genius bit
 My high school friend Nicole invented that I think some scoops will find useful in their everyday life
 Here is what she would do
 In the middle of class Nicole would tilt her head up crinkle her nose and say mmm. Did someone just microwave popcorn?
 Then seconds later everyone sitting around her would start dry heaving and coughing uncontrollably with laughter
 While some managed to choke out a faint fuck you
 Let me explain
 This is a bit Nicole and her older sister perfected in a prank war as kids
 When one of them had a rancid silent, but deadly fart and they wanted to trick the other into smelling
 Through many iterations. They found the foulest trick was priming each other from
 Microwave popcorn scent as it lowered the victims defenses and when one's olfactory is expecting a sweet buttery scent of microwave
 Popcorn the juxtaposition of the actual scent of a putrid ass gas kicks in bad
 There is also a delay
 So the victim will have taken a full-throated drag and had their lungs filled with the flatuous
 Before their senses could smell the the rocket actually been cooking no
 That's the result of the prank this is
 It's a war crime. It's a hell. I hate I hate what I'm listening. That's a hell of a move
 I don't this is actually this is worse than what the u.s. Is doing out in the pacific. Oh
 Bung rip a break coughing and retching from my classmates Nicole gave and still gives zero fucks as she did this popcorn bit
 Every goddamn time she farts and it was truly one of the funniest things to watch once you're in on the gag
 However, she did it to me so fucking bad with this the first time she did it to me
 What I was ten years ago that till this day I went when I walked through an AMC movie theater
 Feel free to use this bit at your own risk PS. I'm curious what other bits scoops might have to share
 And if they could be so good to share them in a fucking scoop mail format
 Figgy fucking your olfactory glands. That's slurping chi a motherfucker
 That's really funny that that's commitment. I mean that is that is commitment for sure
 That is like Geneva wants to have words with you
 That's that's just cruel. I mean just do that once is genius to really commit and do it all the time. That's crazy
 Yeah
 How are you guys on fart humor
 Well, I'm very happy with fart humor when it is the the sound of the fart and and the funny like oh
 This was this was a fart thing. Yeah. Yeah, this is great as soon as I smell something just rank I
 Stop thinking it's funny. So quickly there is there is a my favorite murder animated a letter that somebody wrote into them
 About this guy he was working at a post office and he let a fart that was so stank
 That the post office had to be shut down and the fucking bomb squad got called
 Because they thought it was some kind of chemical contaminant coming in through the mail
 It is wild
 Wow
 Yeah, I never was like all that stuff was farting
 It feels like in the in the in the vein of like like bag tagging or like drawing
 Yes, if someone falls asleep all that all that kind of stuff puts me in a weird place. I don't like it
 I'm with you Jacob. I think the noise is where the funny is the machine. Yeah, make the sounds and all that are great
 But like didn't they just have a teacher get arrested for putting fart gas on his students all the time
 What? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
 There's a story about
 to the internet Jacob
 When I typed in teacher arrested the autofill was for fart spray. Okay, this was it so share with it
 I don't know the exact what what happened, but let's see when it comes to the smell stuff. That's when it starts to get
 criminal a
 32 year old assistant teacher in West Florence High School in South Carolina was arrested for spraying a foul-smelling
 Substance through the school's ventilation system his actions which occurred nearly over nearly a month long period
 led to six to six students and over
 $55,000 in damages to the school's air conditioning system Lewis face charge of disturbing schools and malicious intent malicious malicious injury to property
 I
 Questioned the quality of that AC system
 Fart spray takes it out
 Yeah, that's not HEPA approved. That's for sure
 This was and that have you seen the the the cruel thing that the people do for the people who are in the inflated costumes
 Yes, because you got a little you got you fart into the fart at the vent
 Are you put something at the vent and they're just stuck?
 Can you imagine just fart not somebody's vent and it's just like
 People take like a fish bait and just throw it up against the fan
 My favorite example of that comes from the Harlan Williams
 Rocketman movie. He does it he's connected via a tube to another astronaut
 That's a part and there's this whole back and forth where they're stuck in there with the fart. Oh
 it's funny when it's on TV and it's a sound and you can't smell it, but I think you're right Jacob when you smell it it's
 Just I just don't know shit. Yeah. This is why I don't hang out in Paul's bathroom
 Yeah, just don't want it just don't want it. What were you about to say Matt?
 That I was at a kids Halloween parade
 Yesterday where I saw a lot of the idea of seeing these adorable children being assaulted with farts is really just not comforting
 You saw a lot of inflatable costumes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
 So if you yeah, you're gonna get them just hit them with a little fart spray right on the
 They're done. Just do it the old-fashioned way and fart on them
 Just go in there and fart on them
 Let's do a little jock vs. Nerd
 I'm on the hunt for balls
 The hunt for balls
 Explosion up the stairs. Oh, no, it's happening
 We got an old-school jock vs. Nerd coming to us today from King scoop King scoop has sent us a timeline jock vs
 Nerd, I think he sent us another one of these a long time ago. This one also might be from a long time ago
 I didn't see what the date on the email was
 but this is I'm gonna give you an event and then I'm gonna give you two other events and
 Then you're gonna tell me which of those happen closer to the primary event. Oh, right. Yeah, these are interesting
 So the first one and he made this so I can't see the answers. Okay. I like them too. So I can play it too
 So these are head trippy
 Yeah, so the first one the first San Diego comic-con took place. That's the main event
 That's the primary event is that closer in time to the Berlin wall being built or the fall of the Berlin wall?
 Ooh
 Paul you want to go first on this one you seem like you got a sure some kind of handle
 Does anybody know when the Berlin wall was built?
 Well, it came down in the 80s so before that I
 Asked when it was built. Yeah, it was built before that
 But it's like the 90s or right out. It was not built in the 90s. It got built in like
 In like the 50s, right
 After the war right
 Oh
 Boy, it's gonna be close
 Close close close. I guess I'm gonna say it's closer to the building of the wall
 Do you know when the first comic-con was?
 78 I think oh
 Well, then I would also say it's closer to the to the building of the wall
 Matt, what do you think? So I have to get which event is closer to the wall or comic-con
 Yeah, it's comic-con is the is the primary event
