 We're not but we're about to be because I forgot to here we go. Hey Johnny
 Do you want to go to an ice cream social? Yeah, I'd love to great. Let's go
 Ice cream social sitting over in Pittsburgh. It's Paul Mattingly sitting in Las Vegas. It's Matt Donnelly
 The audio guy we're preaching fun preaching fun. That's what they say everybody. That's what they claim
 That is what they claim fun preaching
 the fun all the time
 You guys read the story about they're going nuts that a wolf figured out how to pull in a crab trap. Have we seen this?
 Yes. Yes
 This is great. So tell us a wolf has
 Basically saw a wolf saw humans set a crab trap into a lake and then and then when the hunters went away or the
 Hunt the hunters. They use the great crab hunters
 Their cage of little meat there's a there's a bar right on East Sahara called the great great crab hunter
 The bar in front of the flamingo was called the crab hunter if you ever
 The crab pot would be a great name for a bar at the flamingo back in
 Basically when the when the crab trap setters walked away
 the wolf went over and then started pulling in the rope and brought the trap up and then
 That was set inside the crab trap. Oh
 Some scientists are going nuts being like this is a wolf using tools
 Right, and I was skeptical about this being significant news
 until
 My cat Shmi ki
 Figured out how to open the cat door that we close at night the dog. Oh
 Yeah, so like we put a little slide down the thing to seal off the
 Cat door. It's really a doggie door, but we've repurposed it for cats by not having dogs and having cats
 calling it a cat door by having in a cat store and
 We were hearing this noise or whatever we thought was just playing for something downstairs getting fixated on something, you know
 Like the like cats do
 No, Shmi ki had figured out how to push up the the seal on the cat door enough to speak out
 middle of the night
 To kill birds probably to kill birds and it was not yeah in the chat. They're asking that you sure wasn't Shmookie
 That's that's the hard part. If my money would have been on Shmookie
 She's the more devious ninja of the cats. She's certainly the most lethal of the cats
 but no is a
 Shmi ki want to go outside and so
 Now it's all right Shmi ki. Yeah, and so now I'm thinking between that wolf story and my cat story
 Maybe our time as as as apex predators on this planet is is is you know, there's one time we weren't right, you know
 Right historically our species would hang out and wait for the bigger predators be done
 Then we'd go in and pick the bones and drink the bone marrow of leftover victims and then and then we figured out tools
 And now oh wait, is that what we're supposed to be doing waiting on to suck the bone marrow?
 I think about that all the time. You know fancy steak house all these homeless dicks for no reason
 You totally misinterpreted
 Completely
 Boy, is there egg on my face? That's I think about that whenever you're at a fancy steakhouse they offer that marrow
 Like a marrow and bread appetizer. Yeah
 I'm like man, what would like hundreds hundreds or maybe I guess it's thousands of years ago
 What thousand years ago just think about like here we are like almost like laughing at the fact that this is all we used to do
 Yeah, now it's just an appetizer. We dip our bread in
 over fancy clothes
 Bone marrow
 Anyways, I think these cats I think I think animals are just gonna start figuring it out. Yeah, we've had a good run
 We can be done with this I'm for when I'm ready push eject. Yeah, let's uh, let's run for the hills
 What would be the best new apex predator or raccoons best apex animal on the planet raccoons raccoons?
 I was good love
 Would love it. I love it raccoons cuz they're almost there. Their hands are almost there. Yeah, very close
 They're getting domesticated as we speak. I can easily see
 Raccoons like you know, just a raccoon city
 That you don't want because that leads to Resident Evil
 Manatees that's where that's where it all goes down in raccoon city. Oh, yeah
 Don't you know your Resident Evil lore
 Sadly, I'm lacking. Oh man
 Resident Evil was it that was it? God damn when that game came out
 Oh, and then you had to get the second version to do with the dual stick. Oh my god. Oh, oh, oh
 Every time I see the videos the video of somebody like handing a raccoon cotton candy
 And they wash it stream and they wash it it goes away. So say breaks my heart every time
 It's the saddest thing ever and but you gave that raccoon some some food that can be washed
 Yep, shame upon all those people that do that. We had to lose a tree yesterday. Oh
 Yes, I see it. Well, I thought it was in the yard and then all of a sudden and like it just no
 We had lawn service come out because it was starting a suckle took our tree
 It was starting to crack and get real rotty
 It was already rotty and we knew it was gonna go at some point but also it was already dead
 But yes, but at the last last couple of months it started to straight-up crack up top
 Yeah splint and if that thing would come down on a pooch. I'd never let myself
 forgive myself, so
 We got the pros in to come in and do it and we left a four foot tall stump
 Or so four foot tall stump so we can fart around and put birdseed on top of that or maybe a little oh you
 You left that on purpose on purpose. Yes, we left a four foot and we left all the wood
 so we've got logs and logs and logs and sticks and twigs and
 Ted is having a field day and he's out there getting a new chew toy every every all the wood precariously on a shelf
 That's rickety that could collapse and kill one of his dogs. Yep
 All the logs are safely on the ground they're farting around with them though
 but now we're gonna use that to
 Re-border the garden in this springtime and
 we're gonna chop up the twigs even more for mulch and for birdies to use and
 Then the little sticks we're gonna figure out other uses for it
 But it's great and the fact that and so into the gardening stuff
 We could just have them leave all the wood and not just chuck it in their truck and chip it
 Yeah, just leave it. We're fine. So do you have a fireplace or a fire pit or anything like that?
 we don't but our
 Relatives do so if we wanted to if you set that wood on fire, you could you could have one done
 We could just set it on fire and burn a patch in the yard and done and done
 We could do that. I don't trust my dogs not to
 Burn themselves. They're dumb jump into the fire
 I wouldn't jump into the fire, but they would fart around with it and they get in trouble
 One of our dogs is fascinated by fire
 Look our little lily dog is fat
 Like I will have a fire going and she will just sit and watch it. She will get close to it
 She won't she won't like get get dangerously close to anything
 But she will just sit and watch it with this fascinated look on her face
 That is some that is some ancient breeding in there, right? Like like how many out of me? Well, I mean, that's it
 How many generations?
 Lily's been going the dispensary when Jacobs not home
 Getting that sticky like look inside the flames
 Speaks to you
 Wolf cuz I'm a dog Lily is that girl with the balloon at the concert
 He's gonna be holding the balloon in her mouth
 You know what I'd be in I'd be in so yeah, there was a fancy
 Starbucks barista cup that came out. I
 saw this I have already lodged a
 Formal complaint and since cease and desists to all Starbucks good. Yeah, cuz our IP
 Not our IP our our IP should stand for something
 All right, our IP basically. Wait, what is that? What is it called? It was a barista. It's a glass
 Cup that's a it's like it looks like a honey jar
 Mm-hmm, but then it's got a little beanie hat on top and a straw
 This thing sold out immediately. I think it was 30 bucks
 Okay, of course going for like multiple hundreds online already collector people are insane. Yeah, as they were very
 Shortly stocked right, of course
 engineered scarcity is the new normal in the dying days of capitalism here and
 so
 As you can imagine
 That's it. I
 Don't think it was the one with the sombrero
 But it was one of the beanie hat
 but as you can imagine
 people being people don't understand that
 Workers at the Starbucks don't really have any control over how many or where or who has bought the bear already. Ah sure
 So people and I will keep this I will keep this as vague book as possible. Okay, but I will say that within
 The tri-state area an incident occurred
 Where a woman?
 Physically attacked a store manager for not having the bay. Oh
 my god
 Pushed her against some fucking shelves and shit like out-of-hand bullshit behavior from this customer
 Yeah, we got sorry just carry more tasers on us I think just making that more common
 Something man. It's just getting stupid. Well, I mean
 Forget your hands to yourself
 It's just yeah, and then the manager
 Bear cuffs and keep your hands to yourself. No Leon
 They did not retaliate as is the way and we can't really it's just awful. Yeah
 Anytime I hear those stories. I try to picture that person
 Telling like they went home that night right or they went and met a friend later, you know
 And maybe like like you think they have friends. I don't think they have friends
 What I'm trying to get it. It's like what the hell is that person's version of that story where they're like, what's right Starbucks?
 And then they have the nerve to not have a grizzly barista mug
 And so I attacked her so I attacked it's like good for you, man
 Stand up for yourself
 like the only thing that I see that's similar is the magic and Pokemon card stuff working retail now and
 That's just the craziest. I
 Was lucky
 They would we got a restock and I was able to grab a couple of booster packs to like a normal human being and that's
 The limit you're supposed to be able to get and you know
 The new Pokemon cards came out and I grabbed a couple booster packs and then you know the next day everything's gone
 you know hundreds and hundreds of cars everything but it's it's all scalpers they just come in and grab it all up and
 Hock it on the internet for crazy money. It's just nuts
 Briarhorse fans. They don't just fight they joust they actually will take up a long
 Spear from the ends of the room and they will gallop towards one another and fight. That's right fight for Briarhorse
 Now the Briarhorses are the little miniatures, right? Yeah, the miniature the collectible miniature horses
 Yeah, they don't have they don't have horse beans. They have little horse English peas
 Mushy peas, that's right. That's right. Look at the horse beans in this one's cock. I'll pay $50, please
 Yeah, so I'm not knock scoop is saying I saw a pic of someone weighing Pokemon packs
 I guess depending on the weight some are more viable than others
 yes, that is what it's come to the scalpers go into the stores and they weigh the individual packs to see which ones are heavier because
 That indicates a you know a coating of some kind with a metallic shine or something like that
 And that's how they get the greater value cards for what they're buying man
 When I was a bartender people asked for like all drums or all wings for their buffalo wings. I would get pissed at that
 I can't imagine
 Forget it forget it and that's just it like retail don't pay enough for people to be babysitting these 40 year old motherfuckers
 A guy got in the habit of coming in asking for all drums and like we didn't know what to do
 So we kept accommodating him and Billy Tierney was in one night. He goes. Wait, are you the guy ordering all drums?
 He goes he goes no stop. We can't do it you get whatever we get
 It's done. Hell. Yeah, and I was like also he's my hero
 There are arguments to be made that flats are superior to drums. Yeah, well, I do like a flat
 Well, we knew the person was a you know, a knuckle-dragging ogre. We knew that already
 No taste
 Right, right, right, but
 Yeah, I did get a nice card out of one of my packs which was cool. I got a
 The managers of that store. So this guy has a scale has to be like get out
 Yeah, no
 No, they should be is what he said but but no but who cares
 Ultimately, who cares if they're buying this shit? I mean, it's it's frustrating. It's awful, but it's the end of the world man
 All bets are off
 Nobody's got it. No, who's got a dog in this fight?
 You're gonna stop this guy from earning an extra $20. Fuck it, man
 If that's what he's chosen to do if he's really chosen to go, you know what you know what I'm gonna do
 I'm gonna fuck over every kid and collector that I know
 and I'm gonna get $5 or
 $20 for all this headache and bullshit. I'm gonna go to how do they do it?
 If you said that there's a limit on how many they can buy
 How do they how do they go in and buy a bunch of transactions Jacob multiple transactions?
 What yep different cards different shit they just
 Shed on my point and being like no, you can't do that. And then you just went off about how these people are dickheads anyway, which one is there?
 Are they this should we should?
 I'm saying they're dickheads. Anyway, it is not in your favor to try and stop their dickish behavior. I don't think yes
 It is in my store. It is I don't want to say dickheads. I want to store. Okay. Okay, man
 You're saying you're saying in your store. What is this your store you're talking about?
 Collaborate your store. Tell me thank you for asking and I'm glad you guys could all be here
 I know that Pokemon cards are a six billion dollar your industry and sharks you can get it on the ground level
 With I what I call house of shards house of shards is my card store. All right house of shards
 Yeah, and and basically in there everyone has to get be I have a good attitude in the store
 Or I punch them in the intestines until they shart in a game of death in the doorway, so it's fair
 So it's a gentleman's game
 We're all in for a gentleman's game in the store. Great. Okay in your store
 Yes, you have the ability to say fuck you get out of here behave yourself
 Don't be but also I promise you all of your product is behind glass and weigh the fuck away from their fingers in
 Always that what's gonna have to happen
 Are these fucking cards gonna have to get put in the glass cases and many are already open them up many are
 Of course they are and most of them are spiderwebbed up with those, you know magnetic steely deelys
 Oh, so they can't pocket them. Yeah. Yeah, and what well in the end all kind of stuff and they got you know security stuff
 but the stuff is going for crazy money out the gate now anyway, like even just basic basic prices for bundles or get are
 getting very close to $100 for a box and
 certainly a over a hundred for a box of
 Packs, but even just a basic box with like nine packs in it is like eighty five ninety dollars. It's nuts
 so what you're saying is that this is happening at like Target or
 Walmart Walmart. Yeah, that's where it's really happening. Walmart's really cracked down
 My Walmart has everything behind a register like there's one register at the end of the wall and it's like tobacco products
 You mind register porn magazines trading cards. That's it. It's all the very
 Porn magazines behind those registers
 The day baby, we have eight dollar long sleeve fake Budweiser t-shirts go steal those get out of here
 Over there
 so much
 So much better stuff to be stealing. It's just terrible. It's just terrible. It's also so the experiences I walk into a Walmart
 They've now put these cards behind glass. I have to like push a button for one of the Walmart workers to come over with a key
 Oftentimes, yes, it is oftentimes and even then that person with a key they go hold on. I'm actually gonna weigh them before I
 Sometimes these motherfuckers are trying way. I'm yeah. Yeah, and then
 If you're the guy with the key you have to just say like no here you're here you're too. That's if that's what you want
 That's what you gotta get. That's what they try and they try and do that somewhat
 But also I went to my Walmart with a bathroom scale and I asked the person opening the glass to step on the scale
 And he said you you misread the article that you read sir
 You're you're not supposed to weigh me. You're supposed to weigh the packs of cards
 So that's what you see you have him stand on the scale and hold his hands out
 Just hold so I gotta get a good read here, you know, they bring the little the little you know iron chef
 I should have brought a digital bathroom. That's what they have this analog bathroom scale is not working
 Well, they have the tiny little iron chef. I thought I brought a seesaw and some dumbbells. This is really not the way
 Justice scale I'm gonna stand here blindfolded holding this thing out. You tell me what the two sides are
 Yeah, you're gonna just do two packs at a time and see which one's heavier and and then keep going on and on and on
 Ridiculous, yes chaotic points out chat that I used to do a trick with weight
 And I was clearly just trying to find the holographic audience members versus the regular audience members
 Need those hollow foils, baby, you know eat them we need them
 Yeah, but I pulled a $25 card just grab me a couple packs. I wasn't you know, looking for anything. You're rich
 You're always exactly you're always looking for stuff, but you know, just grab a couple but whatevs it's crazy
 The whole thing's crazy, but I have a box of a figure like a rich person of Pokemon and magic cards
 Is there someone who like who like who like you follow on Instagram because they take their jet
 Is is there a Warren Buffett of Pokemon cards? Yeah, kind of Logan Paul
 Okay, have you seen his entrance? I was okay with the question. I'm disappointed with the
 When he was doing his boxing, I guess his brother has continued with it more
 But when he started off with his boxing and stuff and his entrance stuff, he had a oh, that's right
 He had a first edition Charizard on a gold chain around his neck
 His big fucking flex the other person I get such on the magic side Paul brothers
 Feelings you say they're so funny. I think they're so evil, but
 That's really funny to come out with Charizard. It is funny and then they're good at being the bad guy wrestlers in real life
 I guess when I say I'm conflicted by the Paul brothers. I mean starting now starting this okay, right?
 There's the first thing that I was like, oh, that's actually kind of funny. Well, you know post Malone
 Does something funny he's a giant magic head. Did you know that I did know that yeah
 He bought the one ring from the first Lord of the Rings
 Special set that came out. Oh, man. He spent like two million dollars to buy that fucking card
 Then that's a card. Yeah, I thought you meant like he bought a movie proper. No, no, no, no
 they made one card of the one ring some guy found it in a pack and
 Oh, they only made they only made one because it was the one ring and they only made one card of that whole set and
 Post Malone was like I'll take that please and he bought it. So he owns that he is crazy, but posty at least
 Plays there's a lot of there's a couple channels
 easier time explaining to SJ that you spent two million dollars on the card or
 You beat up a manager at Starbucks because they didn't have the mug you're trying to buy which would be the manager the manager
 Nope, the manager would be a much easier explanation to SJ
 Should be like you're an idiot and you're and you're gonna go to jail for like 30 days now
 I'll see you when you get out and you're still dumb if I did the card thing
 I think she would be so confused while she was divorcing me
 Like
 Does that person feel like they were like this the manager secretly had it was hiding it from them
 Like like like they know you've got more of these cups like taking a person like oh you won't sell me the barista
 You're waiting for the the nice. Yeah that or they think that the employees get first dibs or some shit
 it's fucking crazy, which they do but
 But they're not gonna know but they're not gonna spend
 Two hours worth of pay for a fucking bear cup most of the time, right?
 I remember a certain collector shit came into the Starbucks. I worked at we actually couldn't get it
 We actually weren't allowed to buy stuff or we went on to buy it with a customer discount. We had to buy it right price
 Yeah. Oh, I see. Yeah, there's all kinds of rigmarole around it. It doesn't it's not enticing for
 Employees to nab the super juicy exclusive. That's why I had a house of shards
 You'll see a specific section of Starbucks collectibles fantastic behind the glass obviously
 Always and I won't let anyone who is more than 200 pounds go into that area
 Justice is happening
 I'll tell you who else loves a good house of shards and that is the following sponsor today's show is brought to you by

 There you go
 American Thanksgiving American Thanksgiving Canadian Thanksgiving. That's a good November 27
 You have to sign up by November 26th
 Hey
 That's how they work. That's how them dates work. What what?
 15,000 is the number of reports that went into the Nevada DMV
 Snitches line. Oh in the first month
 Of the website being active. So people who don't know Nevada DMV has a snitch page on their thing
 If you see a car without a registration or without current registration, you can report them
 You can report your friends and neighbors
 I know this is not this doesn't tie into any history at all. Just report snitch on your friends and neighbors our friends
 Multiple news outlets are reporting of this so they're getting the stats out
 But they are not saying what's driving it like I they need to find some snitches and interview them
 I need to know what is driving the snitchery?
 Because here's the other thing that people don't know about Las Vegas. We're famously we don't have
 High taxes, you know, no income tax that kind of stuff
 So the only way the state makes money is off the DMV. So our our our registrations are super expensive
 crazy high and so
 But our personalized license plates are cheap. Yes, that's true. That is true
 I tried to get one out here and I was like sticker shock. No, thank you
 So this is basically like a citizen driven tax hall for the state
 Yeah, this is the weirdest thing. Oh
 Ten scoop in the chat says to be fair
 14,987 of them were just him fucking with me
 That explains all of the certified letters for example all of the
 downtown Las Vegas parking is
 Already up on this like if you go into a parking garage and your cars are registered you would
 Someone from the city will come into that parking garage and ticket you
 Within within a half hour. It's some bullshit and like
 That's basically how I get my $75 reminder that I haven't forgot to renew my car
 Registration once every so often and it always happens by going downtown to do something or see something
 Yeah
 It's always going to the bucket showed at the majestic realm. I do a bucket show and cost Matt 75 bucks
 Yeah, that's all we don't do them every week anymore we can't do we cannot do a bucket show every week
 I can't it's a loss leader and that's yeah, I can't do it
 I
 Ran it to our friends Scott and Hazel the other night
 No, no scooper Nova girl. It's not $75 for the registration the ticket that they give you is $75 and then you have to go pay
 For your registration. Yeah, the ticket saying hey, you're not registered. I'm like a new car
 If you get like a new car, it's based on like how old your car is and how valuable it is
 Yeah, but a new car in Las Vegas will be like five or six hundred dollars for a registry
 Oh, no, it's more than that. That's going up. Yeah. Yeah when we got because we got two new cars
 This year. Yeah, it was about two thousand dollars to register both of them
 Each of them
 All right, no for both of them. Okay, it was about it was about a grand a piece
 Yeah, it was it was like six hundred something for the van when we got the van but yeah for the for just the year
 Just a year. Yeah, just regular registration
 That's oh, no, it's crazy. That's why it's such a drive
 That's I'm saying like that's what that's what in terms of people listening to the story when we talk about it
 Like what is driving? This is that this is how Nevada makes money
 This is not that a this is how Nevada makes up for its taxes. This is a Nevada tax
 Yes is what the DMV registration is. Yeah
 So, uh, I went to the party in Las Vegas, oh good
 So
 Speaker world's newest show is over at the Casa Politan and it's just in what used to just be the walk-in bar area of
 opium
 little
 the little side restaurant area in between the old showroom and the superfico restaurant mm-hmm and
 They have put together this really cool dinner and
 It's a three course for course tentatively for course you can't bread and olives, of course, and that's you know, that's my favorite course
 Why wouldn't I count it?
 No, no bone marrow with their bread and olives. No boat. No, it's an upgrade. It's an upgrade. You got to get the upgrade
 But if you're at House of Sharks, the charcuterie board just comes with bone marrow. It's included boy your store
 Your store is on his top-notch
 It's a nice store. Yeah, I really want to go to this store
 And everyone is just so nice
 You know, it's like we set the bar things cheaper I think and
 It's about it's still like, you know, it's 150 bucks, but
 You pay that for tickets on this town most things anyway without food
 Yeah, yeah, and honestly, it's the other part where you pay that for food in this town without it, right?
 Yes, so you're getting one of those things at a deep discount. Yeah, and so it's this really intimate space
 I think the place holds maybe like 60 people and it's all yes
 I like that
 I think it's like dinner is and it's all like little little tables and booths and I was sitting at the bars one little bar
 area and
 The stages is like right there. I love this stage. Actually, it's like it's like heightened and right on the top there. Yeah, and
 and
 you see like
 eight variety acts and
 You get a three course meal and it's like super casual
 Like it's actually like that you you actually get break
 You're getting breaks with both right you stop watch entertainment then you give food and you have friends there like we had other friends
 We're just oh, that's cool
 We were just you know each course so you could talk in between and then shut up while the show's happening back and forth. Yes
 That's great. That's great. That's smart, especially nowadays, right? Give them a minute. Talk about it. Yeah
 yeah, like it was very much like it but it was funny was so we went and saw it and
 You know it's speaker world
 so does access some of these amazing acts and so the first two acts was the
 This great bubble act that's famously been in their shows for forever
 Where they have a person blow all kinds of different kind of crazy bubbles and make different shapes with smoke and stuff
 And it's beautiful. It's beautiful
 Heart-touching act and then our friend Lindsay Benner. Oh, I think it's Howard Noddy. I think it's Howard Noddy's
 Or one of it one of his students kind of brought to Spiegel world
 Tin scoop reminds us that $150 is the price of a tuna sub at this subway in Orleans
 These are that is a party sub though, that is a party sub
 So you get to wear a hat while you eat it
 It's your version of a party sub
 It's a regular foot log, but it comes with a hat and a hat says I spent $150 on a tuna sub
 so
 Next up was Lindsay Benner who headlined our VIP night at course doing a shorter version of that same act a book of love
 It's remarkable at it, right and especially she juggles the balls in the dark to that beautiful piano music the whole bit or whatever
 So these are both nice acts very nice partner in it as well still no
 No, it's just it's just in the short version. It's just Lindsay. Okay. No, Gary. No, Gary
 And
 So then the next course came out was a little break and the mater dee I guess sensing that we was
 Entertainment people were something
 Or he says this to everybody
 But he's like, oh, don't worry. It gets weirder. It gets crazier
 Which so that was like such a bizarre warning
 Was like wait what but he wasn't kidding
 He was correct, okay have a drag act of a person dressed as a sexy cow
 Yeah, and then the cow does a full on
 Like dance throughout the entire room and then does an elaborate
 striptease of
 slowly
 Revealing its utters
 What are they sick what are they sequestered under like like like like like lace like lingerie and then like first like a like like
 It was just looks like a regular like it looks like it's one piece like it's one
 It's like utters that are are in like spandex or something like that
 But the spandex comes off and they're like a lacy utter on the cow
 And then boom it's revealed the
 Four otters and people just you know know how to cheer for burlesque so the people place goes wild when the otters are revealed
 Yeah. Oh, yeah, and then he shoots
 milk
 You all over the like just start shooting milk all
 And at one point singles on a guy just like blasted into his mouth for like 50 seconds. Oh my god
 It's milk leg all over again
 I was dying laughing. I thought this is there. That's great. This month is hosted by Eddie's
 She's filling in for the main host and
 One point she just
 Walks around with an accordion asking people for her vices and just does crowd work and just basically
 Just narrates all the sexual tension in the room with everybody and their tables
 Singing a song to an accordion and I just was like I love this act. She could do this anywhere
 She could do this everywhere. I
 Just was like get get get scoop fest tomorrow. Let's go with yeah
 Accordion just walking on the strolling accordion fucking with people and it was like my favorite thing
 I'm one of my favorite things of the night very Judy Tanuta
 Yes, our IP. Yeah. Yeah
 Well, that is the thing like there are people that we know there's there's several different acts that we could point at that
 We that we know of over the years where the act is just the excuse for this talented person to be on stage
 Yes
 We just we just need this talented person to be out there with a microphone on so that they can be out there and do things
 We need a reason for it. Here's an accordion. All right now go
 And in this tiny room, they were very inventive with like finding a way to put like an aerial act in it
 But they use like a side of the floor instead of the stage for it
 But it's still like well lit and compelling
 Cool our friend penny is in it and she does this penny wren penny wren
 There's the fabulous penny wren who I always knew was a comedic burlesque artist. She does a very not comedic a very intense
 Dance burlesque number in it that I was like, wow, this is a different side of penny. It was really compelling really cool
 Penny is an excellent burlesque performer. Yeah in all in all
 Types of it and like I think I don't want to speak for her. I think that she enjoys the comedic side of it
 Maybe more than the kind of the classic side of it, but I mean she's got those classic chops for sure. Yeah
 It is also just like I was like this is one I laughed because being around speaker world in the in the
 2000s and the 2010s
 Boy, did the CEO really love the idea of dinner being served with acts like just kept finding every different anniversary
 Some kind of celebration need be like, why don't we bring in chefs?
 Yes, like get me food with entertainment, please and so I cannot this entertainment is great, but my fingers aren't greasy. You know, I
 Can't feel like this is just a dream come true for him
 But I actually love it like I think it's so smart for Vegas to have something like this
 It is is everything everything that looks like it needs to be there's a couple things happening
 I was like, oh these are things to note for like surviving the modern Vegas landscape and this is one of them
 Combining the dinner entertainment experience in a place. That's the price that you would have paid for one of those experiences
 And and then what happens is I guess the main host who at least is filling in for
 Actually meets everyone before the show like hosts everyone in the little room pants out champagne and actually memorizes everyone's name
 So throughout the show that's a gimmick
 She just turns and will while she's doing an act like actually say the person's name like in you Tom
 You know like and just talk to people
 And I was like, oh wow, and then also our friend gypsy
 walks around with these like cards that make people ask personal questions to each other as couples during the dinner parts of the
 Show great and I was like again, just that's it. That's a small thing
 but it's a huge thing and that like we don't get to focus on ourselves during a show and this is you are making that happen and
 Those are two things with this happening. I was like those two small touches
 I think need a lot for how to differentiate itself from well from Las Vegas and that is
 Part and parcel to the modern media landscape and the attention span scape and all that kind of thing
 You know, we're all we're all dipping into our phones every five minutes. I'm as guilty of it as the next person and
 This lets you do it. Well, I'm not being rude to everybody phone dip
 My phone's not even turning on what the hell
 Oh, there it goes. Yeah
 I've got a couple of new emails
 None of them look important. Okay, I'm back
 Alright, I got a message from Brogan that I'll have to get back to them
 Leaving it on read
 Another thing I'm very curious about because it's way outside of my taste
 but I get it is
 The Vanderpump casino
 What a focus. Yes. Yes. See the Cromwell is turning into the Vanderpump
 Really? Yeah, holy shit
 and I'm curious if it will work because for instance, one of the things like
 Vegas has been notoriously dead. It had a big spike this past weekend because of Bravo Con. Oh
 Yes, so all those shows that are on Bravo they had a gigantic convention in town and a lot of people came to town for Bravo Con
 It was really was like one of those
 Newer conventions that took over the town. Oh cool. And so like I'm curious if
 like niche
 Fandom like niche community fandom
 Can fill hotels on a regular basis instead of a convention like right?
 Right is the Vanderpump reach
 Such that those people will like to because basically treat themselves to the experience in the hotel
 And of course the Vanderpump will be at the hotel, you know, like will that be enough of a niche thing to?
 Fuel because it's the only innovation I'm seeing in the casino space
 I mean that one specifically might be because they're they're already I think three or four
 Large Vanderpump bars in casinos. There's one in Caesars. There's one in the flamingo
 That one in Caesars has been there forever and it is always busy
 Yeah
 It used to be a different thing and now it's been Vanderpump for quite a few years now
 And yeah, I mean even just this like yesterday when I walked past it
 There was just a giant line out the door of people waiting to get into it. Yeah, it is not slowed down
 There's one in Paris as well
 So I mean there are a couple of those and I know they're always busy
 So it really might be and and the brand is just kind of like nice decor and good food
 Good drinks and luxury. Well, what a brand what niche products do you think could bolster a full casino, Matt?
 What niche fandoms do you think could hold up a whole casino like that?
 I mean, I'm telling you right now
 If magic the gathering is popular as it is and post Malone is as popular as he is
 If post Malone were to somehow do one of these like David Blaine like residencies
 and
 Tie that in with magic the gathering events and you had to just simply come up with events outside of post Malone's weekends
 I bet that would do well enough for a small casino. I should point out that the Cromwell is a small casino
 The Cromwell is on the great location and it certainly could use
 Something the Cromwell was not itself an overachieving casino. It basically was just drays
 There's drays. It just was a nightclub. It was that it was the casino that was underneath drays
 Yeah, yeah, no, San Diego Comic-Con super scuba nova girls mentioning SDCC was thinking of moving to Vegas
 Well, I know Evo thrives in Vegas
 Evolution the evolution fighting championship, you know, that's it. I think I think some kind of if you could properly umbrella nerd dem
 Right because that's actually what you're also trying to innovate is not just going out to Vegas but staying in that space, right?
 But are you looking for a year-round kind of attraction? That's what I'm curious about
 Yeah, stuff makes sense to me as a convention standpoint
 But this Vanderpump thing makes sense for it because the Vanderpumps are always there, right?
 Well, there was that talk of the Atari hotel that fell through right? Yeah
 So something along those lines, I think a video game based
 property could work
 Yeah, I video game fandom like you could be it could be like one floor would be all fighting games
 One floor could be shooters one floor could be competitive COD
 What I'm really kind of poking is like what what that is a great way to buy floors of fortnightly
 Go against the grain of what's currently
 One of the factors is currently hurting Las Vegas, which is people are feeling
 Totally nickels and dimes right price. Yeah, absolutely priced out. They don't feel like the value is there and
 Also, like because we are so feast and famine with these crazy events
 So like if you wanted to say come to Vegas just to check out, you know a couple of you know
 Area 15 a couple of museums or you know meet some friends for a bachelor party or whatever
 And if it's the same weekend as a Raiders game, you're fucked if it's the same weekend as a Taylor Swift concert
 You're fucked because every hotel raises their rates for these marquee events f1, right?
 Like yeah, you you and so now like and people people aren't planning their personal events around those kinds of things
 No one's gonna be like I went to my bachelor party in April. Oh, wait, there's a there's an event. I should move it
 They're gonna go somewhere else. They're gonna say not Vegas, you know, by the way having Monday night football
 Then a week of f1 then a Sunday football game at the Raiders Stadium
 Along with everything else that's already going on is too much stuff
 It's too much stuff. I agree
 We found it. It is way too fucking much. Hey, I'm working for F, you know, I'm working for Spiegelworld for f1 this year
 I'm hosting
 Their ski lodge with Casey Wilson. Oh great into the show. So Casey and I have been hired to be
 hosts
 for the ski lodge
 Which is a an additional attraction within the Mercedes tent for people by the Mercedes experience
 And so we've been working on that all day and I've been I went to the track yesterday
 And I'm going to the track again today and we're commuting from the office to carpool and it's just a nightmare
 And I try to race home and there's a Raiders game and I was like, oh, I'm like really good at finding back roads
 But the back roads were slammed because of the Raiders game and I was like, oh my god this town
 And of course, it's a monsoon this week here as well
 So we were we had to go yesterday for a really? Oh, yeah, it's been hard hard rain for four days
 and
 The the lodge itself is a the attraction is not a roofed thing. It's an open air thing
 So we we we then Casey never confused like no
 They still want us to come in to the track and I was like, okay
 Okay
 And then we so let me have a huddle up in this one area that was still kind of building the whole they're still building the
 Whole thing at one point Emily Wendler who's who's one of the one of the writers on it?
 Was like it feels like the race on Thursday more should be done than what's I'm seeing
 Still very much putting together
 Isn't one of those things where they all come in at the last minute you go
 It's just then they're done
 I think you're confusing it with the pit crew. No, the pit crew is the ones who build the whole thing, right?
 Roadies they set everything up and then find the pit crew comes in and just like oh, yeah, sure
 So we're in this one area and we're working and the power goes out because of the rain is just
 Everywhere and then as we're doing boom like a leak like a big stream of water leak just burst through one of the
 This town
 Time there is a major rainstorm. It is just hilarity. Yeah, and it's not even I would love to say that it's people's fault
 I really don't think it is because it's so dry and so hot here all the time
 So all of the seals like they they dry out and rot and everything
 Yes
 Seal can you hold any water back at all or you to dry it out?
 What happened to his face
 Yeah, no, it's been it's been a lot it's been a whole lot this week, yeah
 But I can't wait. I have more story about wait till after the weekends over to tabulate all my stories for
 It's been a really funny event
 Had some friends outside they've been you know setting up speakers for for the whole event there
 they run the sound systems for for the whole event and
 And yeah, they were I was texting with them yesterday
 They were trying to they had found a roll of clear plastic and they were trying to get their
 Queen okay
 They had found this role of this Queen and they were trying to waterproof their golf cart so they could get from site to site
 Absolutely soaking wet
 So they're like trying to clip up this Queen on the front of the golf cart to be turning it into a winch
 I have doors that yeah, we're leaving the track and then like one of the carts came pulling up one of the guys working
 F1 was like pull up any slowed down and go so don't worry
 I'm not gonna get you wet and then keeps driving and I was like, well you can give us a ride
 You can also not leave us walking in the rain
 Like I'll take you're not splashing us as like a bare minimum courtesy and I appreciate it
 But thank you. Maybe also drive us to the parking lot. Well
 It is Vegas rain is Vegas is snow for sure
 Yes, it is really really crazy. You know who else gets really confused when they get wet. That's the following sponsor
 Hot mud skipper and that's for the mud skipper scoop in 2021 today shows brought to you by hot mud skipper

 It's going around when you hear that. Yeah, it's going around. You don't picture that but that's exactly what everyone's saying
 yes
 it's in their ability to cover their coughs and
