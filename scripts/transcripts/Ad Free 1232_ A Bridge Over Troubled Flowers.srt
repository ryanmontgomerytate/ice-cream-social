 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Hello there, it is my favorite part of the show.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 This is the time when we get to thank you, the ice cream truck drivers.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Who are the ice cream truck drivers?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Well, I will tell you.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 The ice cream truck drivers are the folks who deliver this fucking ice cream

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 straight into your fucking ear holes.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Sorry, I just got distracted by Matt's son signing on to the Zoom chat.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 If you want to be an ice cream truck driver just like these five folks,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 head over to preachingfun.com.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Preachingfun.com is where you want to go to sign up to be an ice cream truck driver,

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 and who knows, the life you save may be your own.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Oh, we don't have a new list yet.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 It's a new month, and we'll get to all that later.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Here's the show.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Hey, Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social?

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Yeah, I'd love to.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Great, let's go.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 And we have a murderous role as old school students in today's Zoom.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Yeah, we do.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Wendy Baumgartner, Delano Speeds, Aliyah.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 People have been around for a while.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 It's time for Matt Mattingly's ice cream socials sitting in Pittsburgh.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 That's Paul Mattingly sitting in California, I think.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 That's Matt Mattingly.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 I'm Jacob in Las Vegas.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 We're preachingfun.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Yes, indeed, my son has entered the chat.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 We're recording in my hotel room, so they might as well hear.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Basically, I have to behave.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Might as well put him in here so you guys have to behave.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 It's basically--

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 No behavior.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 No behavior.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 That'll probably--

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 The gloves are off.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 I've given your son a copy of Powers.

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 It's over.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 He's fully corrupted at this point.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 That's true.

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 We can actually check in with him about that.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Okay, yeah.

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Circles on circles.

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Circles on circles.

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Oh, I guess if you unmute yourself, it'll mess up everything.

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Yeah, yeah.

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Yeah.

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 You have to come over here if you want to talk.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 You can highlight your screen, but you have to come over here to talk into my microphone.

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Let's see.

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Hi.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 So did Paul corrupt you?

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Are you going to bring that dirty magazine to school and show all the kids?

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Are you going to--

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 There's no wrong answer here.

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 I actually haven't read the comic yet.

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Oh.

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 You haven't read the articles?

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 It's that tantalizing, man.

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Just look at the pictures.

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 I know.

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 That's right.

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 That's right.

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 That's not what I mean.

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 I haven't read it.

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 I haven't looked at the pictures.

67
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 In fact, in the car when I was scrolling, I went from back to front.

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 So when Paul picked it up, I was like, uh-oh, wait.

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Did he think I was looking at that?

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 No.

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 And instead, Paul was like, look at that.

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Honestly, I didn't even remember.

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 I was like, oh, crap.

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Yeah, sometimes there's boobs and powers, but it's nothing.

75
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Whatever.

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Paul stands by his decision.

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 I do stand by my decision.

78
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 It's a fantastic comic book.

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 It's by one of the ultimate comic book creators, Brian Michael Bendis.

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 And yeah, I stand by it.

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 You know what Brian Michael Bendis can't do?

82
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Convince young boys to actually read the thing and not just look at the pictures.

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 That's not true.

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 I think he's inspired a generation.

85
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Again, he's the guy behind Miles Morales.

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 He's had more than his share of successes.

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 So yeah.

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 So yeah.

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Well, you know, we're in Arizona.

91
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 We're in Mesa.

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Just Phoenix, Phoenix adjacent Mesa, Arizona.

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Mesa, Arizona.

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 So I took my -- basically, we looked at the cost of the -- my wife is about to help relaunch Disco.

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 And so me being away figured whether we would, you know, hire a bunch of baby --

96
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Do all the child care stuff.

97
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 -- hire a bunch of babysitters or I just take them with me.

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 And so, you know, I did what any dad would do.

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 I would be like, boys, this is the difference between the Las Vegas strip club

100
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 and a Phoenix strip club.

101
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 And I took them out to show them the different ways.

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 But --

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 More hands on.

104
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 So yeah, we road tripped it.

105
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And we came out here to -- it is the -- Paul is holding up his phone that says the comic book

106
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 that we mentioned earlier.

107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Well, people were asking in the chat.

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 I'm just -- yeah.

109
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Just showing people powers.

110
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 All right.

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 This is what -- this is the bonus content you get when you tune into the stream.

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 This is --

113
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 And this is the regular not bonus content that everybody else gets when they don't tune into the stream.

114
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 What do you mean?

115
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 This is incentivizing more subscriptions.

116
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 It's cheap.

117
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Two bucks.

118
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Two bucks.

119
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 You can see my phone.

120
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 It's three now.

121
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 It's three.

122
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Okay.

123
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Three bucks.

124
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Good God.

125
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Inflation.

126
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Inflation.

127
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Never stops.

128
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Three bucks.

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 You can see my phone.

130
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Yeah.

131
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Yeah, yeah.

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 So we road tripped it out here.

133
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 You know, all the times we would bitch about the Vegas heat and then our listeners from

134
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 Arizona would go like, "Ugh.

135
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Whatever, dude.

136
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Check it out.

137
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Check out our neighborhood."

138
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 I used to be like, "It can't be that different."

139
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 It is.

140
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Oh, no.

141
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 They're right.

142
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 It's so much --

143
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Yeah, they're right.

144
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 It is that much more --

145
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Arizona --

146
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 It's hotter here.

147
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 I understand people moving to Las Vegas.

148
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 There is stuff in Las Vegas.

149
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 There are things to do.

150
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 There's work.

151
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 There's jobs.

152
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 There's fun.

153
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 There's all these things.

154
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Arizona doesn't have any of those things.

155
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 They're just hotter.

156
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 It's less fun and hotter.

157
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Yeah.

158
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 We got to -- as my youngest said, it's a free sauna.

159
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Free sauna here.

160
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Yeah.

161
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 One of the most miserable times that I've ever experienced was when we did a Star Trek

162
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 promotion at a Diamondbacks game.

163
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 It was 108 degrees, and we were all wearing our full costumes.

164
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 We're walking around --

165
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 This was like a fan thing happening at the baseball game?

166
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 It was a promotional event for the experience.

167
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 It was like wearing your Star Trek stuff to the baseball game?

168
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Yes, and one of our Klingons threw out the first pitch and didn't attach his gauntlet

169
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 properly and threw his gauntlet as well.

170
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Part of his costume fell off.

171
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 I was like, "Ah, amateur hour."

172
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 How embarrassing.

173
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Come on.

174
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Get it together, Kermash.

175
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Come on, Kermit.

176
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 That's where the expression is toss his gauntlet with his fastball came from, right?

177
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 That's right.

178
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 That's right.

179
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Yeah.

180
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 It's similar to throw out the baby with the bath water.

181
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 It's the same family of sayings.

182
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 But it was crazy.

183
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 After that day of walking around, we were just drenched.

184
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Someone's not muting themselves.

185
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Oh, we got them.

186
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 They're back.

187
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 They're back.

188
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 We were funky.

189
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 It was gross.

190
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 In Vegas, there's the whole, "Oh, you could cook an egg on the sidewalk."

191
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 But out in Phoenix, it's like, "Oh, yeah.

192
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 I can look out the window and see shit melting."

193
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 The traffic lights are drooping.

194
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Have you seen stuff like that, Matt?

195
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Oh, yeah.

196
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 They figured it out.

197
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 They know how hot it is here, so nothing's drooping.

198
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Nothing's drooping?

199
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 They know how to build their things.

200
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Just Matt.

201
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 It was drooping 20 years ago.

202
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Matt's the only thing that's drooping.

203
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 I was not informed that I was drooping.

204
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 In fact, we finished up the show last night.

205
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 I basically want to finish in time to make sure the kids go swimming at night.

206
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Oh, yeah.

207
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 We got a hotel pool.

208
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Nice.

209
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Did you explain that to the audience as you were rushing through all the tricks?

210
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Just pick at the card already.

211
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 All right?

212
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 We got to go.

213
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 We're going swimming.

214
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Tick tock.

215
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 We're going swimming, guys.

216
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Come on.

217
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Panth or no panth?

218
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Yeah, so we were swimming.

219
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Even at night, 10 o'clock at night, the pool was still wicked warm from the days of fun

220
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 out here.

221
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Oh, yeah.

222
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Sometimes it's nice.

223
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Sometimes it's just ...

224
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Huh?

225
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Huh?

226
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Nice, gooey, warm pool for you.

227
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 It just feels ... It just feels like pee.

228
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Gooey warm.

229
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 It feels like pee.

230
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 It does.

231
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 It is like you're in pee.

232
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 It does.

233
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 That's why I like it.

234
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Let me get that pee pool.

235
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 But then you don't get that fun thing of when you pee in the pool.

236
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 I don't know.

237
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 I just want to add to it.

238
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 I just want to feel like I'm contributing.

239
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 You're worried about not feeling the contrast of your own pee in a warm pool?

240
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 That's right.

241
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 That's right.

242
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Swim for contrast.

243
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 I like my pool to be 98.6 so that when I pee, I just have to feel the difference in buoyancy.

244
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 That's the only way I can tell.

245
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Would that feel really, really hot?

246
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 It would, right?

247
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Yes.

248
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Yeah, 98.6 is nice and ... It's real warm.

249
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 It's not hot tub hot.

250
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Yeah.

251
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 My hot tub is at 104.

252
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 We keep the hot tub at 104.

253
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 96, though.

254
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 It's pretty hot.

255
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 We actually dared ourselves to go into the hot tub so the pool would feel cool.

256
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Oh, smart.

257
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Even though it was hot out, we went into the hot tub and then went into the pool and then

258
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 the pool felt refreshing.

259
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 They had the hot tub on.

260
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 They did.

261
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 They did.

262
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 Wow.

263
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 That is surprising.

264
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 I agree.

265
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 August in Arizona.

266
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 It seems like a waste.

267
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Well, it's 110.

268
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Let's fire her up.

269
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Hey, some people still have bad backs.

270
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 All right.

271
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 You do you.

272
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 You do you.

273
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 I do sit in my hot tub because of my bad back.

274
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 I do get it a little bit.

275
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Yeah, exactly.

276
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Exactly.

277
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 I did see a fellow trying to beat the heat on the Las Vegas Strip the other day during

278
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 my walk.

279
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 I don't remember if I told you guys about this guy.

280
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 I don't think I did, though.

281
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 He was wearing no shoes.

282
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 I started at the bottom with him and worked my way up just just observing this person.

283
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 He was wearing no shoes and mismatched ankle socks.

284
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 And he was wearing a pair of Super Mario Brothers boxer briefs in lieu of pants.

285
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 I haven't told you guys about this guy, right?

286
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 No, but so far all Paul heard was Super Mario Brothers.

287
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 And he was like, yay, I'm wearing this shirt.

288
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Paul is currently matching this person.

289
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 I got my crocs on.

290
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Well, you're already beating him then because he did not have shoes.

291
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Okay.

292
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 He was wearing he's wearing socks.

293
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 He was not wearing pants.

294
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 He was wearing a pair of Super Mario Brothers boxer briefs.

295
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 He was wearing a tank top with one arm.

296
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 He had one of his arms through the head hole of the tank top.

297
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 So he's wearing a tank top, but it was like an off the shoulder number.

298
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 It was kind of kind of nice.

299
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Don't think he was having a day.

300
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 He was just he was punching bricks left and right, hoping a mushroom would pop out of the top of it.

301
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 You have no idea how right you are, Matt Donnelly, because on his left hand, he was wearing one blue boxing glove.

302
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Stop it.

303
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Hundred percent socks, no shoes, no pants.

304
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Super Mario Brothers underwear tank top with his hand through the arm or through the through the head hole and then a boxing glove.

305
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Scullywalt says, so a 10 p.m.

306
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Walmart shopper.

307
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Yeah.

308
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Yeah.

309
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Basically, that's this was this was at about six p.m.

310
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Walking down the Las Vegas strip.

311
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 And I'll tell you what.

312
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Six p.m.

313
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 And you know how when you are walking near a person who is let's say has different sensibilities than than the average average people.

314
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 I mean, they're high.

315
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Maybe they're high.

316
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Maybe they're homeless.

317
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Maybe they're a little off kilter.

318
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Maybe all of these things like you see these people walking and you kind of you kind of clock them.

319
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 And because they they have kind of a manner about them that suggests even without the clothing, it suggests that they are a little a little off.

320
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Maybe maybe they're not entirely based in reality.

321
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 Yeah.

322
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Beating their own drum.

323
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 There you go.

324
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 That one of the most disconcerting things about this man is he was walking along seemingly just fine.

325
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 If it weren't for his appearance, the manner that he was walking, he was walking as though he had somewhere to be.

326
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 He wasn't in a terrible hurry, but he was walking with some purpose just heading down the street.

327
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 I think I know what happened.

328
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Is it possible he was a refugee from a Mr. Beast contest?

329
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Oh, that's possible, Matt.

330
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Matt, what's your theory?

331
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 That is possible.

332
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 I was going to say I think what he happened was he found that invincible star where he would do it.

333
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 And he just went all over the place.

334
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 And then the star ran out.

335
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 And that's what he looked like when the star finished.

336
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 And he was like, oh, he didn't realize how much damage he was doing to himself with the invincibility.

337
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Exactly.

338
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Even though he was invincible.

339
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 So he was invincible, but his clothes weren't.

340
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 His clothes were.

341
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 His clothes took a beating.

342
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 He was fine, but his clothes really took a beating.

343
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 I think there's a new Mr. Beast coming out tomorrow, so I'll see it.

344
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Oh, there is a new Mr. Beast episode coming out.

345
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 All right.

346
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Hot drop.

347
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 We can find out if Paul's take is correct.

348
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Look into his sweet dead eyes and obey.

349
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 That guy's a fucking monster.

350
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 Our pal Neil Fisher just wrote a book on that monster.

351
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Just put out a book.

352
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 I can't wait.

353
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Oh, nice.

354
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 I can only imagine.

355
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 He sent it to me.

356
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 I should send him an email properly, but why not use the podcast to thank him?

357
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 My kids were very happy.

358
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 It is fascinating.

359
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Yeah.

360
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Mr. Book.

361
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Oh, by the way, we talked about this book on the show several weeks ago.

362
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 If you haven't started reading Cults Like Us by our friend Jane Borden, it is so fucking good.

363
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 I'm on the audiobook.

364
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Jane reads it.

365
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 It is so good.

366
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 It is so interesting.

367
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 It's so good.

368
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 I was watching the news Superman and going like, oh, my gosh.

369
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 This is the thing that she talks about in her book.

370
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 I did the same thing.

371
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 From the Puritans, they demonized intelligence, right?

372
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Yes.

373
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 And people who are smarter, freer thinkers.

374
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 I'm so glad we're over that shit.

375
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 No, she's saying it.

376
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 You think of yourself as whatever your politics are, but you think of yourself more as the open-minded politics.

377
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 You don't think you're bought into this.

378
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 But yet, when she breaks down that we just love a rebel, a rule breaker, right?

379
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Yeah.

380
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 Oh, that part hits home really hard.

381
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Yeah.

382
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 And so you're like, oh, every character I like in every movie and TV is the same thing that I'm hating about the current political climate, right?

383
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Right.

384
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 And everything that we do in movies and TV about taking brainiacs and saying they're terrible people that should be ostracized and made fun of and taken care of, you know?

385
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 And it's like, and then freethinkers are not being respected.

386
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 We've lost our complete respect for expertise.

387
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 It adds a layer in that it makes you not care about kind of the current problems.

388
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Yeah.

389
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 Because a strong man, you know, a hero is coming.

390
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Yeah, yeah.

391
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 We've been conditioned to just not even believe, just conditioned to understand that a hero is going to come along and they're going to use some kind of physical violence and they're going to take care of us.

392
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 So I do that. Yeah. So Jane's book's been with me every time I watch TV or movies or book or whatever.

393
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 It is legitimately changed the way that I look at things.

394
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 I put a book last because that's the last thing I'm going to do. Watch TV, movies, then maybe read a book.

395
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Right, right.

396
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 But yeah, and also it's helped me be a better parent as one of my children listens on.

397
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 But like the idea that we teach moralistic storytelling.

398
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Not much better, just better.

399
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Her point that we teach moralistic storytelling and therefore good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people.

400
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 So if things go wrong, you turn in and start hating yourself and blaming yourself versus other cultures that teach, you know, fortune, right?

401
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Like fortune swings both ways. Things go good, things go bad.

402
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 You know, you're not in control of that.

403
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 Life isn't fair, but it is consistent.

404
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Right. And that it's just going to swing both ways, no matter who you are, no matter where you are, it's just going to go. You're going to you're going to live a roller coaster.

405
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 And like that's so much better when my kids experience something bad and then want to beat themselves up.

406
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Like it's really important. So, yeah, her book's incredible. Cults Like Us. Pick it up. It's great.

407
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 It's very good. And it's a very good read.

408
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 And she does her own reading for books on tape. So you get to hear her, her lovely, her lovely, her lovely dulcet tones.

409
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 And I tell you what, I tell you one of the most fun parts about listening to her read the book is all of the little asides because she loves to put the little little comments in on what she's commenting about.

410
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 So she there's there's little like almost kind of the office moments where she turns the camera and goes like, ah, see, but it's all her talking. It's kind of great.

411
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 And so listening to her do the asides on the audio book is pretty fantastic. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

412
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Yeah. And like I said, we she's funny. We did improv back in the day. She was a powerhouse improviser at the old UCB.

413
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 So, yeah, awesome stuff. She's great. So we we drove down here to to to so this is Mystique Dining, but not a traditional location.

414
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 This is a this is a collab with a fever up productions. OK. And they do kind of pop up stuff.

415
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 And so when I got the address of where we were going, I pulled into like this Vegas has a Phoenix and Vegas have a very similar architecture. So if you're into this kind of like sprawling kind of almost like a warehouse feeling thing or like it's just a bunch of little pods of buildings where you have suites one through 50 and then the other one suites 50 through 80, you know, whatever.

416
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Right. That kind of thing. And so pulling I go like there can't there can't be a magic show in here.

417
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Like it's not it wasn't like a storefront. There was no kind of whatever. This is where the props for the magic show gets stored.

418
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 And then we finally my my my son pointed out they found the logo on the door. Like, no, it's there. And I was like, what? Oh, and we pull up and I would find out later.

419
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 They're like, oh, yeah, well, it used to be a church. And I was like, that still doesn't explain it. Like that still doesn't make it. It's a weird spot for a church, too. Exactly. It's just it doesn't it doesn't mean.

420
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 But you know, these are pop ups, right? So they're not looking for these, like, you know, they're going to take over a giant theater space or they're not going to take anything big up. And so makes it kind of cool.

421
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 And so when you do walk in, it is like a crazy its own magic trick. It is an instant transformation. You walk in and it is this ornate, beautiful, kind of like dragon themed bar and lounge with this with this parlor in the back.

422
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 And it's really nice. Yeah, really nice. That's fine. Performing magic parlor. So, yeah, so that part was super cool. The only problem is we couldn't get in when we got there.

423
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 And, oh, you weren't you weren't cool enough. And it was so hot. The guy, Frank, this great guy, Frank, was the easy opener. He's the close up magician and, you know, helper out or person, whatever.

424
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Helper out or person. Well, he he's normally just the close up magician helps work the bar. Yeah.

425
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 And it turns out our house manager, his car broke down. And so he couldn't get to the space. His car melted. So Frank's trying to get things open.

426
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 And I thought Frank worked there and also couldn't get the couldn't get the place open. And I was kind of like, that's weird. But he would never been in this role before.

427
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 But again, it was so hot. I went to talk to him. He goes, no, no, no. He weighs me off. And he goes back into his car, turns on his air conditioning and he points to his phone. He's like, I'm not standing and eat.

428
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 We're going to talk air conditioned car to air conditioned car right next to each other.

429
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 That's that Arizona shit right there. I thought you were going to say that Frank invited you to sit in his air conditioned car with him and you can chat. I know he's not letting some hot man come in and take his air.

430
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 You crazy. He's on this giant thermal force. Enter that. He's not. He's no idiot. He knows. I'm happy to talk to you as long as you sit in your car. Your carbon footprint is far too large for the occupancy of my vehicle.

431
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Get the fuck out. Stay the fuck out. So he, uh, uh, so he's having trouble with the door code, but I actually was like, oh, I, I did the San Diego location. I'm well aware of the weird key pad, uh, logistics of going inside.

432
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 You know, uh, you knew the lock. Yeah. So I was like, oh, let me give it a shot. So I get it open and we go inside and, and, and it really took me a minute, um, to figure out that Frank was not, uh, uh, a true staff person, but just a magician.

433
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Is he is, he is like, he's getting, he's putting my kids to work right away. He's handing them remotes. He's like, I'll see if this works and see if you can get this works. And I think he's being cute and like taking care of my kids while I set up my show.

434
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 And after this, after it was all over, he's like, no, no, I needed their help. I didn't know how to open this place. And so I was handing out stuff to be like, go figure this out.

435
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 I wasn't babysitting your kids. I needed their help.

436
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 You know, who else needs Matt's children to get things done? That's the following sponsor today's show. Matt Madley's ice cream. Social are brought to you by the fine purveyors makers, outfitters and sources. Uh, a horse is a horse. Of course. Of course.

437
00:22:42,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 Hello. It's me, Michael Crawford from phantom of the opera. And I'd like to talk to you about, Oh, hello. It is me, Dracula. I have killed Michael Crawford to tell you.

438
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 He was low on vitamin C and easy to kill.

439
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Drink your orange juice.

440
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Now here's the thing. I really, I mean it for me, you know, I'm selling this stuff because I do, I want you to get your vitamin C, but more importantly, I want your blood to be sweet and full of Valencia. Goodness.

441
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Pulp or no pulp.

442
00:23:47,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 Hey guys, I just needed a good clean drop of Paul yelling pulp.

443
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Like a vampire. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Now you've got that classic drop of the vampire yelling pulp.

444
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 I don't know what that is. That's going to be, that's going to get that thing. You're going to wear a, wear a hole in that button. Companion piece to cults like us. I would recommend and has been reading this and telling me all about it.

445
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 It is the hot shit right now. Murderland. You guys know about this one. I've heard of this. Yeah. So Murderland is the hot business right now.

446
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 So this is the book. This is all about how in the sixties and seventies, the oil corporations put additives in the gas that they knew were poisoning us and lead and all that kind of thing.

447
00:24:48,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Mostly lead and the smelting places that were processing lead were poisoning everyone around the smelting area and how basically you can trace like people like Ted Bundy and other serial killers to a certain radius of where these places were.

448
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Seriously? Seriously. And also, and just in general, how a generation got poisoned by these gasoline additives that they knew were poisoning people.

449
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Because I've heard, because I never understood unleaded gas growing up as a kid. Right. It's gasoline. Right. I was, I forget what podcast I was listening to, but I never heard the correlation, perhaps not causation, perhaps causation who knows of violence to lead.

450
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Because basically we hear stories of our generation of men older than us, right? Who would, tales of just getting into fistfights, right? Like it became a trope in every movie we see. You go into a bar, somebody just pokes your chest and boom, you get into a fistfight.

451
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 And I just remember growing up being like, that happens so little as a bartender. So little. And then I didn't know that people, some people think that the lead in gas was actually why we were so violent.

452
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Yes. Right. And, and it was- Well, Galatia President Superstar McScoops a lot in the chat is pointing out paint as well.

453
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Yeah. It was in a lot of stuff. All the paint everywhere was all lead paint.

454
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 It was so dumb because the reason they put it in the gas- There was a decrease in violence with the unleading of gas.

455
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 Oh yeah. Well, and there was also an increase in IQ just in general. Like it just dumbed a whole generation down. And here's the worst thing.

456
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Our generation actually got secondhand damage because folks like us who were born in the seventies, our mothers had been exposed to this stuff.

457
00:26:48,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 And it turns out that babies in the womb absorb calcium. They look for calcium from the mother, right? And in the taking of the calcium to- Not me, I look for booze. To build those baby bones.

458
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 You got any booze in here, lady? You look for the booze and the calcium. Those are the two main things. So you're looking for alcohol and you're looking for calcium.

459
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Thank you. I feel seen. The booze and the calcium, the glory are yours now and forever. Amen.

460
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 Amen. But that baby is building its body up from lead-infused calcium deposits and it's basically fucking up the fetus.

461
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 And it's like, you know, I don't have to wonder too hard about my hip, you know, basically turning into mush after a couple of years, you know?

462
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 And I don't know if you guys- Your mom was a huge paint drinker, right?

463
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 Well, no, but I think I've mentioned to you guys before. I had, back when I was a kid, I had straight up Forrest Gump leg braces for a long time when I was a little kid.

464
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 Yes. Yeah. I was very pigeon-toed in my leg. Just recently, my brother found some old home videos of me walking around as a baby.

465
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 I am the gimpiest motherfucker you've ever seen. I mean, I had really deformed ass legs and hips and shit. I'm like, fuck man. No wonder my stuff is broken down. No wonder I was in such terrible pain.

466
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Also, no wonder that they gave you those braces and kind of fixed you. Like, the hip thing didn't happen until later in life and we didn't know you as a gimp-y person.

467
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 So we have to also give some credit where credit is due that they addressed it.

468
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 There was some addressing, but also, but clearly one leg was longer than the other and that's part of what the hip thing was all about and a bunch of stuff.

469
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 But yeah, and that just makes me sad knowing that it's quite likely that some of that was due to environmental, lack of environmental protections on that little baby.

470
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 The demonizing of breastfeeding and moving up into formula. Right, that kind of thing too. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

471
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Flow back and then all of a sudden formula's evil and all that other stuff. Yep. Whatever.

472
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 I mean, people don't remember, when I was a baby, my mom was actually encouraged. They said, breastfeed, breastfeed your baby and everything. So she breastfed me.

473
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 But she would smoke leaded cigarettes while breastfeeding me because that's simply what her doctor recommended that she do.

474
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 She would add lead to unfiltered barbara cigarettes and she would just smoke those.

475
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 If anyone's stink guy at her for breastfeeding, she'd go punch him right in the face. She didn't care.

476
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Of course, our system of whether we do or don't care of healthy products and how that affects our physical health, I get.

477
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 It is strange to me, the idea, like I think of getting in fights, fisty cuffs, as an emotional thing, not a physical thing.

478
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 Do you know what I mean? Like, I think it's weird. Oh, I do. Yeah, I see what you mean.

479
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 That's the distinction I find strange is that like I'm pumping gas and suddenly I go like, what'd you say? What'd you say, man?

480
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 This is what I find strange is that like, like we were getting into fisty cuffs more.

481
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 That's why we got an electric car. So I wouldn't have to get in as many fights.

482
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 I just my body just can't take it anymore. I'm getting older, Matt. I just can't fight twice a week every week.

483
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 I need recovery time. You need me to fight once every two weeks.

484
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 I'm there, but this is the frequency at least for another 10 years.

485
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 I've got I've got to fight a week in me. Yeah, I find it. I find it strange.

486
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Well, I will say on the positive side of nature is healing, perhaps somewhat.

487
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Anne and I last week went to a flower festival, the Freedom Farms Flower Festival.

488
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 This is the hippiest bullshit I've ever heard of in my life. Well, I don't know how hippie.

489
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 I guess it's kind of hippie. No, no, no, Jacob. You get in one Autobahn society and you have to go to these events.

490
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 Is that what it is? They're keeping score, right? Oh, you didn't go to that flower festival.

491
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 I thought you were a member of the Autobahn Society. I was a little trepidatious because it was Freedom Farms.

492
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 And any time anything comes with the moniker of freedom or liberty or anything like that, my alarm bells just go off.

493
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 Because as we all know, whenever a bill is passed in this country, that's something like the Child Protection and Free Cotton Candy Act.

494
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 It explicitly somewhere in the bill states all children under 13 should be executed and cotton candy should be banned.

495
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 Right. It's like it's always the opposite of what they're saying.

496
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 After this recording, I'm taking my kids to Cracker Barrel for breakfast. Good, good.

497
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 I just found out they just put legislation to rename it America Barrel. America Barrel.

498
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Yeah. OK. I just thought they were going to rename it to a white people barrel. Just barrel. Just barrel.

499
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 It's always just been a barrel. Why do we have to qualify for who eats there?

500
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 I mean, Honky Barrel kind of rolls off the tongue, right? We can work with Honky Barrel.

501
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 It's definitely a self-selecting sample already. Oh, it's so. I mean, I do love that food.

502
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 Honky Barrel was my college band. We were Honky Barrel.

503
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 Did you open for Hootie? Yeah, yeah, yeah. After we won the Battle of the Bands, we got to open for Hootie.

504
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 You know, Honky Barrel is what Bozo the Clown used to call those little cups that you throw the ping pong ball into.

505
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 And if you get up to 13, you win the prize. The big prize.

506
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 Yeah. So you went you went to OK, it's a flower festival.

507
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Freedom Farms Flower Festival. Yes. Oh, the classic FFF. Yep.

508
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 The Quad FFF. Fantastic Four.

509
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 Whose idea was this? You or Anson? I'll give you three guesses and the first two do not count.

510
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 So it was Paul's idea. It was Ant's, but Paul's and Target on Instagram.

511
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 Honey. Look at this. Put your shoes on quick.

512
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 It's a flower festival. Holy shit. In the middle in the dead middle of summer.

513
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,940
 summer, one of the hottest days. Let's fucking go. Calm down.

514
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:48,900
 Anyway, it was cute. It was kind of cool. You drive up. It was

515
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,840
 adorable. It was adorable. It was pretty adorable. So we went

516
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:57,600
 on the first day. So we got good pickings because this is the

517
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,560
 thing. They have rows and rows of flowers just growing out

518
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:08,080
 there. And you can just go and pick flowers. As many as you

519
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:12,920
 want. 20 bucks. Get all the flowers you want. All the

520
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,480
 flowers you can eat within reason all the flowers you can

521
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,080
 eat. There were sunflowers. So I suppose you could eat some of

522
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:23,120
 that. They say this is one of the last all you can pick flower

523
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,520
 festivals. Most of our retro, you know, going retro and

524
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,760
 they're becoming flower halls. They're really the flower halls.

525
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,880
 That was a really clumsily constructed joke about Las Vegas.

526
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,920
 Getting rid of all the buffets and replacing them with food

527
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:44,920
 halls. Oh, I was spelling it h a u l. That's what I was thinking

528
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,400
 too. Flower hall. I'm gonna I'm gonna go to Cracker Barrel. I'll

529
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:48,880
 see you guys.

530
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:58,640
 All right, Matt's gone. So you get on a little tractor. And

531
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,800
 it's got they've got it. It's fancy like the tractors pull in

532
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,860
 these fancy people wagons. It would be a really cool little

533
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,620
 hayride kind of thing. So we do to do to do up to the up to the

534
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,880
 place. And up top they've got like I said, rows and rows of

535
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,280
 flowers that you can just go through and pick. And then they

536
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,600
 had some live music playing. They had farm animals you could

537
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,200
 go and check out. They had some food places that really good

538
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:31,400
 barbecue, pardon me, barbecue, and like crafts.

539
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:36,120
 We have a barbecue place who's trying to figure out who's got

540
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,200
 the friendship where they figured out how to like, you

541
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,640
 know, this, you know, this flower festival needs some

542
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:46,520
 barbecue. It was called F and good barbecue. Oh, good. The F

543
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:51,840
 also they stuck with the F F dash F and good barbecue. And

544
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:56,920
 their mascot is a like looks looks basically like a wild

545
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:04,460
 boar as the grim reaper. So by way of my understanding, this

546
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:09,560
 that a reaper more this pig reaper God is slaughtering his

547
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:17,880
 brethren to provide us with with hog meat for eating, which

548
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,000
 I'm cool with. I think there's something there's something

549
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,160
 interesting in there with like, oh, wow, this shit must be real

550
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,080
 good. This guy knows his pig. He is a pig. You know, even the

551
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,080
 pigs eat it. Like you go to a cannibal restaurant, you want a

552
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,480
 guy who actually eats there. Yeah. You know, I mean, you

553
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,120
 don't want to just go, you know, you enjoy those flowers. Can I

554
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,800
 interest you in some human ribs?

555
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,840
 Well, I don't know. Are you are you eating them? I am. Oh,

556
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,960
 then yeah, if you're if they're good enough for you, I want

557
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,280
 their damn good falling off the bone. Oh,

558
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,000
 again, we are we're we're making fun of the almost conflictive

559
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,080
 nature of this barbecue place being at this flower festival. I

560
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,200
 just want to know how that friendship was made. Like, I

561
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,040
 don't know. I think I think it's a combination of proximity

562
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,680
 thing. How does Darren from effing barbecue kind of meet

563
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,000
 Cynthia from the flower festival and go like, right, I'll bring

564
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,200
 my brisket. It names are Frederick and Francine. It's a

565
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,960
 proximity thing. I think it's mostly proximity thing because

566
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,840
 you had that you had like this really great kettle corn that I

567
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:32,720
 got. Okay, I do like a good kettle corn. Holy fuck the best

568
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,680
 kettle corn I've ever had. And then to top it off, how much

569
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,320
 are you eating kettle corn? Do you want like the big the big

570
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,480
 package of it? Because I want like a handful of it. And I'm

571
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,560
 really happy with about a handful of kettle corn. No, no,

572
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,560
 no, no, no, but the two bucks, you're just worried about what

573
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,080
 kettle waste? Is that what your concern is? I bought the medium

574
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:58,280
 back. There it is that ranch slunk has got it there. Pig

575
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:06,280
 grilling out for Richard scary. The has an awesome image. The I

576
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,960
 bought the $8 medium bag. And after I was after I was home

577
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,240
 eating this freshly popped stuff, I was like, I should have

578
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,400
 bought the giant bag. Because this is it wasn't enough. This

579
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,880
 is the best. And and I was saving half for Anne. So I was

580
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,360
 just like, I'm tearing through this stuff. So oh, I'm seeing

581
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,960
 Malia saying she she asked her husband to go to the flower

582
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,640
 festival last weekend. This is Pennsylvania. Interesting.

583
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,800
 Surprise, surprise. Interesting. Can you believe it? Can you

584
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,600
 believe it? Anyway, it's probably it's probably fairly

585
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,640
 well picked over at this point, as they say. But no, the big

586
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,560
 topper, the big topper. Her husband said no, by the way.

587
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:58,160
 Matt has more willpower than I what can I say? Malia's husband

588
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,240
 and I would get along just fine to tell her about the

589
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,360
 barbecue. What happened? Well, there's that and the big topper

590
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:12,280
 Amish doughnuts on site. Real deal Amish doughnuts to the point

591
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,920
 where there were little Amish kids running around Rumspringer

592
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,360
 style chasing building little barn chasing the tractor. Just

593
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,800
 giggling, talking in whatever language they speak. What do

594
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,920
 they say? Yeah, Pennsylvania Dutch, right? Yeah, I was gonna

595
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,640
 say it's a Dutch lot of Dutch. I'm just just like, they're just

596
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,760
 running around giggling in Dutch. Well, I don't think it's

597
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,280
 Dutch. I think the people who speak Dutch can't understand

598
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:41,200
 them. I sure as fuck. Yeah. And you don't even speak that. I

599
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,640
 don't even speak Dutch. Yeah, so I don't know, which is really

600
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,880
 German. Yeah, exactly. Turn the page. Turn the page says it's

601
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:52,400
 German. Yeah. It was it was fantastic. Just seeing all this.

602
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,720
 Germans. It's a version of older German. Yeah, it's like ancient

603
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:05,480
 German. The language of the Druids. So I am, I am more

604
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,440
 excited for the sequel to spinal tap than I want to be. What are

605
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,200
 we talking about here? Cinnamon sugar? What are we doing? What

606
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,360
 are we doing on these doughnuts? Name, name your desire. Boston

607
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:22,120
 cream. Done. Everything under the sun, man. They had so many

608
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:26,680
 donuts. Yes, I was shocked. Shocked at the variety made to

609
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:30,320
 order. Or were they were they? They were well, they were making

610
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,480
 them fresh on site. And then you could just pick up. But I mean,

611
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,880
 you're you're standing three feet from the the donut boiling

612
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,360
 vat. They're doing it. Yeah, they're just making it, man.

613
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,080
 They're just cranking out the cranking out the fucking

614
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:48,560
 donuts. And it was so good. It was so good. I'm just picking

615
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,480
 myself like laid out after a belly full of brisket and like

616
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,680
 11 donuts and be like, I'm so glad we came to the flower

617
00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:00,960
 festival. This flower festival was so worth it. This is what

618
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,560
 country fairs are like, man. That's what that's what ham

619
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,800
 days is like you go and you get the pancake breakfast in the

620
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,840
 morning, then you get the ham in the afternoon, and you get the

621
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,000
 barbecue at night. It's just, it's just all food. How many

622
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,760
 people are here? It was just like, is this is I'm gonna say

623
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:23,000
 there were probably Well, there was Paul, there was an

624
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,400
 Malia wasn't there. So that's still just two boys speaking

625
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,520
 gibberish. I'm gonna guess there were three to 500 people bopping

626
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,120
 around. So you're part of some big grass lot, big, big lot of

627
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,320
 parking a parking lot, big parking lot, and then they had

628
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,680
 some overflow parking and then everybody just walks up to the

629
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,680
 tractor and then zips back. They had two tractors and all

630
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,360
 these people like roller coasters and shit. They're

631
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:50,960
 trying too hard. Flower festival. Yeah. I mean, there's a

632
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,720
 field, there's some flowers, there's some barbecue and some

633
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,080
 donuts. What else do you want? It's it was really easy. Oh,

634
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:00,440
 there's a somebody's magic shells tell me about a long

635
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,960
 Johns. Oh, in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. It's worth the

636
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,280
 five hour one way drive. Okay. All right. I mean, they're up in

637
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,560
 the chat there. They were talking about the Pennsylvania

638
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:15,200
 Dutch. And I never I never knew this turn the page was saying in

639
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,760
 the chat and og scoop was was chiming in as well, that it's

640
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:24,240
 misheard. So the the Dutch is apparently a bastardization of

641
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:29,720
 like Deutsch. So it's it's speaking Dutch or something.

642
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,240
 It's all German. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. While we're putting

643
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,960
 out things in the chat, I'll just point out a scoop bearded

644
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,680
 on says, it always amazes me that Matt and Jacob look like

645
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,200
 their bodies match their voice. And then there's Paul, it always

646
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:51,280
 shocks me. Wonderful people. I don't know what that means. My

647
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,920
 body doesn't match my voice.

648
00:42:52,920 --> 00:43:00,200
 Wait, do you want to describe? I guess I'm curious. Well, I'm

649
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,600
 describe who you expect. I sound like a thinner man. Yeah, do you

650
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:09,240
 sound like a nerdy? I sound like a thinner guy. I have to put on

651
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,320
 my full Ludmilla to to get people to understand my girth.

652
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,560
 Are you? I was confused by that post as well. But not because of

653
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,840
 any of that. Because they called me Jake.

654
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:24,440
 I sometimes still call you that once in a while. And I don't know

655
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,440
 why. I don't know what creates the Jake comes out every now and

656
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,280
 then. Yeah. Before to type it, you need to type it.

657
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,080
 Scoop beer. Now. Are you able to unmute yourself? Or no? Are you

658
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,040
 at work or something?

659
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,840
 No, no.

660
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:49,920
 Oh, well, you sound so different than I expected. What did you

661
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,000
 think Paul would look like by his voice?

662
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:00,120
 Well, it took a while before I saw him in pictures. I heard him

663
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:04,800
 bunch of times before I started looking up how you guys looked.

664
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:13,600
 And I thought he was more fit. Yeah, more fit. He sounds like

665
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,480
 a more fit person.

666
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:20,920
 Well, I mean, you sound like a really fit guy trapped in the

667
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,640
 not so fit guy's body.

668
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,720
 That's essentially what I am. That's what I am. Yeah, no, no,

669
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,120
 honestly, look, look, look, seriously, I've been working at

670
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:32,680
 the target. I got some serious definition happening suddenly.

671
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,600
 Guns. I got them guns, man. I got these traps, these traps.

672
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,120
 Ain't no joke. You will get caught in these traps and you will

673
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:40,800
 not escape.

674
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:47,080
 Okay, go for the pen diet and keep it for like four or five

675
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:47,280
 months.

676
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,720
 No, they don't lose the traps.

677
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,280
 I know. I wouldn't lose the traps. No, it's always a trap.

678
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,760
 I'll just say this. Scoop beer nun just turned on his camera and

679
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,360
 he does look how he sounds.

680
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:01,360
 Yeah. Oh, no, I'm not surprised by how he looks at all.

681
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,760
 I can see myself. So, but where are you?

682
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:11,520
 Almost eight o'clock in Sweden, Gothenburg, uh, the barbecue

683
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:11,880
 going.

684
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,520
 Oh man, that looks amazing.

685
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,680
 Ah, it just looks like perfect weather for it too.

686
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,720
 Living better than I am. I can tell you that.

687
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,080
 The only thing that would make it better is if you pushed out

688
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,560
 your Amish donut kit and roll that up next to that.

689
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:28,880
 I see the barbecue. I don't see the flower festival.

690
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:34,040
 Well, beer nun, I appreciate that you think I sounded

691
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:37,600
 healthier. I think I, I don't know. I think that's true.

692
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:41,160
 I think I'm just a fairly healthy guy with a little too

693
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:41,960
 much weight on me.

694
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,200
 You don't eat vegetables.

695
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,840
 I don't eat vegetables. I hate them and I am an emotional

696
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,880
 eater. I'm an emotional eater, have been since I was a kid.

697
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,920
 That's kind of the thing, you know, I don't eat cause I'm

698
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,760
 hungry. I eat cause I want, you know, I eat cause it makes me

699
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,280
 feel, uh, less nervous and upset. I don't do drugs. I don't

700
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,320
 drink. So I guess that's kind of the thing. Uh, I don't know.

701
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,400
 All I know is scoop beer nun's wife or girlfriend or someone

702
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,360
 came out and I turned it off like that.

703
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:14,000
 I don't want you to, uh, show off our house, uh, for some

704
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:14,960
 fun or something.

705
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,760
 We got to keep it safe. We got to keep it safe.

706
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,520
 All of our listeners that can easily stalk Sweden for its

707
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,360
 different locations.

708
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:28,120
 Yeah, but beer nuns right. Our show is infamous. Our show is

709
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:31,200
 infamous for people casing houses to rob in Sweden.

710
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,040
 We have a lot of geo, what's it called? Geo sluts or whatever

711
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:35,560
 it's called.

712
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,760
 If anyone comes here, if they can chase that.

713
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:43,360
 What are you making? What are you making on your grill?

714
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:49,640
 Uh, well, uh, some sausages and a club steak that's not unwrapped

715
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:55,640
 yet, but, uh, some carrots, uh, some, uh, what it's called, uh,

716
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:00,200
 well, don't sleep on it, Paul. Don't sleep on a carrot.

717
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,400
 Sounds like a solid, beautiful.

718
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,440
 Well, you guys have a nice little feast going on out there.

719
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,960
 I'm trying to do the last, uh, day of vacation.

720
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:17,560
 Oh, I hope it's a good back to work, huh? Oh, sorry.

721
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,600
 What do you do out in Sweden?

722
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:24,040
 Uh, I am an electrical engineer, a consultant working for an oil

723
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:24,560
 refinery.

724
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:28,040
 Working for a while refinery, an oil refinery.

725
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,640
 All right. All right.

726
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,560
 Wow. That's, that's important.

727
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,440
 Yeah.

728
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:39,920
 People like gas and diesel and stuff. And, uh, we just, uh, did,

729
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:46,480
 uh, expansion for bio, uh, fuel. So,

730
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,240
 bio, uh,

731
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:57,640
 biofuel, like, uh, like liquid, like fats, uh, from, uh,

732
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:04,080
 uh, uh, uh, what do you call it? Uh, plants and, uh, animals.

733
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,760
 Oh, really? Ah, great.

734
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:15,000
 And make, uh, jet fuel, uh, diesel, uh, regular gas and, uh, well,

735
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,760
 does ethanol fit in that?

736
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,080
 Is that, oh, propane.

737
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:24,360
 Uh, no, no, no. They, they had, uh, an, uh, ethanol plant, but, uh, it wasn't,

738
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:28,120
 uh, didn't make money.

739
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:31,400
 Is ethanol is mainly a U S thing, right?

740
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,480
 Does anyone else really do ethanol?

741
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,400
 Did any other countries really do a lot of ethanol?

742
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:41,640
 We have our, uh, first primaries in Iowa just to make sure that we keep ethanol

743
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,720
 as a subsidized thing in America.

744
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,320
 So, yeah.

745
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,440
 Yeah, for some reason we love ethanol here.

746
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,760
 That's what they failed to do in Sweden.

747
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,520
 They failed to leverage it politically to make it to that's what it was.

748
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:56,400
 Well, everything's political, but, um, still.

749
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,800
 Yeah, I understand that I was also going to start being the first primary for

750
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,040
 Sweden. I think that'll be a nice change.

751
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,200
 I'm not sure they're welcome.

752
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:13,520
 The Swedes famously hate Iowa.

753
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,000
 No, no, we can visit.

754
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,480
 How long, how long have you been there?

755
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,240
 That's a company.

756
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:25,800
 Oh, well, I started my company five and a half years ago.

757
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,780
 Okay.

758
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:31,520
 Uh, has a lot changed in that industry over the last five years?

759
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:38,280
 Um, well, there was a lot of more money made in, uh, the.

760
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:47,200
 In, uh, carbon, uh, or fossil fuel, uh, businesses, uh, starting from around.

761
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:48,700
 Yeah.

762
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:53,960
 Corona and, uh, going through, uh, the Ukraine, uh, thing.

763
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,160
 That makes sense.

764
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:55,700
 Sure.

765
00:49:55,700 --> 00:50:01,240
 So it's, uh, pretty much the same through Corona.

766
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,600
 Uh, when I started, I got in there in 2019.

767
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,860
 Okay.

768
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:13,440
 And, uh, then, uh, they started the big, uh, bio refining thing and, uh, well,

769
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:20,480
 putting got a bit too, uh, grabby and changed the whole world.

770
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:27,360
 And, uh, then, uh, the, the crude oil markets, uh, and, uh, the

771
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,600
 fuel market, uh, bumped a lot.

772
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:41,640
 So it was like, uh, a good, uh, a good margin was, uh, around four or

773
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:46,920
 five dollars per barrel, and then it swooped up to 30.

774
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:55,760
 So they made, uh, the, the, the refinery made, uh, around, uh.

775
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,440
 So I know, I know there's a language, I know there's a language barrier, but, uh,

776
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,440
 so, but, but I think it's fair to say you're a fan of Putin and what he's

777
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,720
 done politically, it's helped you out.

778
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,360
 That's what I'm here.

779
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:13,000
 Well, uh, in the same way that you hate, uh, your home states and everything

780
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:20,640
 around you and, uh, children, your wife and, uh, parents, and you don't have

781
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,600
 any difficulties, uh, coping with your mother.

782
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:28,760
 That's how they say yes in Sweden.

783
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,040
 So in that way, yes.

784
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,280
 Thank you for coming on and I appreciate it.

785
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:37,880
 Thanks.

786
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,280
 Thank you guys.

787
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,120
 I will try to live up to my, the sound of my voice.

788
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:46,680
 I will, I will endeavor to, uh, to, to, to lose, to lose some

789
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,800
 foundage who you sound like.

790
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:55,240
 There was a time, there was a time way back in the aughts that I wasn't, uh, I

791
00:51:55,240 --> 00:52:00,720
 got really focused on my health and I dropped to write it like 205 and that was

792
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,840
 the skinniest I've been in a long time.

793
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,320
 That was good, took a lot of effort.

794
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:09,760
 I could do it again, I suppose, uh, probably should, maybe I will.

795
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,280
 How do you go?

796
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,760
 It's a firm, maybe let's take it from here.

797
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,560
 Uh, I won't be thinned by scoop fest though.

798
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,320
 You're going to see big old scoop fast.

799
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:22,000
 Whenever I talk to other podcasters, I always say the mistake that I've made over

800
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,760
 like the, whatever we've been doing this for like 12 years or whatever, that's

801
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,680
 on the school 13 years, 14 years, whatever is like, uh, basically you, you tend to

802
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,000
 only hear from the people who complain about little things.

803
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,400
 You don't know when, no one ever just takes time to write, like enjoy

804
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,840
 today's pod signing off.

805
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:40,880
 In fact, one of the cool benefits of doing these new zoom episodes is seeing

806
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,600
 people laugh and enjoy it in the chat and that kind of stuff.

807
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,160
 But it's, it's very helpful to it.

808
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:50,840
 And I always say, what happens is you end up podcasting to those voices.

809
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:57,680
 You end up talking like you're trying to avoid the nitpicking little things that

810
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,160
 come your way, that kind of just bother you throughout the day.

811
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:00,680
 Right.

812
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,000
 Right.

813
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,120
 Um, and then when I go out and do magic shows, I get to run into listeners.

814
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:06,560
 Right.

815
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,320
 And I always find that refreshing because then I picture those are the people I'm

816
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,480
 talking to when we're doing our podcast.

817
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:11,760
 Right.

818
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:17,360
 I never been picturing a fit Swedish dude over a grill

819
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,720
 with sausages and carrots.

820
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,240
 That's not something I'm thinking about.

821
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:20,600
 Right.

822
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,520
 You think he's outside our demographic.

823
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,400
 That is clearly our demo, man.

824
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,320
 That is a very different things.

825
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,640
 That's all I've been picturing the whole time.

826
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,320
 I would be, it would be good if we did.

827
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:32,560
 Right.

828
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:35,920
 I feel like I find it so reassuring that we have listeners like beer, none.

829
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,040
 Uh, he can't be the only one.

830
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:38,720
 So that's great.

831
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:42,400
 Anytime we have listeners in other countries, you know, you know, Wendy's

832
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,280
 up in Australia the whole time.

833
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,480
 Like we're so awesome.

834
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,040
 Yeah.

835
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:50,520
 But yeah, did a guy listen to us at his grill in Sweden.

836
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,640
 It's pretty cool to think about as a podcaster.

837
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:58,600
 It's what I love about our international listeners is that we get to have them

838
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:03,640
 tell us how bad it looks from the outside and get to empathize with what we're

839
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,440
 going through as a country, which is nice.

840
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:10,520
 Uh, and, and, and they still listen to us and they realize that we are

841
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,880
 stuck here with this bullshit game that's being played.

842
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:14,280
 Yeah.

843
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:14,760
 Thank you.

844
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:15,760
 Uh, thank you, Bassie.

845
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,360
 We support you.

846
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:21,400
 Uh, yeah, no, it's, uh, it's reassuring to have, uh, outside, uh, of

847
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,920
 the state's, uh, listeners as well.

848
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:28,320
 I'll tell you who only pictures fit Swedish men grilling.

849
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,640
 Oh, and that's the following sponsor.

850
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:36,080
 Today's show is brought to you by the prequel to the famous Paul's guide to

851
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:39,760
 being a dead horse series, Jacob's guide to murdering horses.

852
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,320
 Hey, I'm Jacob.

853
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,280
 You want to kill a horse?

854
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,120
 Here's what you do.

855
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,840
 Just go ahead and build yourself a cliff.

856
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:49,960
 You build a cliff, build a big old tall cliff, maybe about 30 feet high.

857
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,320
 And then what you do, you go ahead and whip that horse, whip it, whip it, whip

858
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,440
 him and ride him right to the edge of that cliff.

859
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,320
 Then jump off the horse right as he's going over the cliff.

860
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,840
 You tell him Jake, get him Jake.

861
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:00,880
 That's right.

862
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:01,640
 That's right.

863
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,320
 I'm Jacob.

864
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,200
 Take him, take that horse off the cliff.

865
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:04,600
 Whoa.

866
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,440
 There you go.

867
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,840
 Dog food.

868
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,000
 Oh, well 100%.

869
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,320
 100%.

870
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,360
 Oh, 100%.

871
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:14,880
 Oh, for sure.

872
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:20,040
 When was the last time you and SJ went, uh, picking flowers together?

873
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,280
 Oh, all the time.

874
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:27,160
 We go in our backyard here with our fake grass.

875
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:32,960
 I got to say, you know, Anne has made a list of things for us to do around PA.

876
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,320
 And she does come up with these things like the flower festival and that kind

877
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:42,080
 of thing, and I can be a little bit of a curmudgeon from time to time, but I'm

878
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,640
 trying to break myself for that a little bit more and just go for these things

879
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,480
 and do it and I almost always enjoy myself.

880
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,640
 And I really, I did enjoy myself at the flower festival.

881
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:50,920
 No lie.

882
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,080
 So your wife takes you to flower festivals.

883
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:57,440
 Uh, my wife proposes that I do things, uh, at the house.

884
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:02,720
 My wife adds on honey do lists.

885
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:07,640
 So, uh, we, yeah, we had a guy coming out the other day, uh, yesterday

886
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:11,440
 as we're recording, uh, had a guy coming yesterday to, uh, to look at part

887
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,480
 of the backyard to put some new fake grass in, uh, some additional

888
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,360
 fake grass in to, to our yard.

889
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:21,800
 And right before he gets here, SJ announces that she has a new

890
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,400
 idea for part of the backyard.

891
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
 And it affects part of the grass, but it affects part of the fake grass

892
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,720
 because, uh, where she's talking about, uh, it's kind of takes up the same space.

893
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,760
 And I want to know if, uh, if your spouses have, uh, ever asked you

894
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:41,520
 for something like this, my wife looked at our backyard and said, do you know

895
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,880
 what we need in our backyard?

896
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:47,280
 And I think we can put it right in this area, right over here.

897
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,080
 She motioned towards, uh, towards an area.

898
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:53,040
 Uh, she said, I think that we need a stage.

899
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,120
 A stage.

900
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:02,320
 My wife is proposing that I build us a stage in my backyard.

901
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,880
 Wow.

902
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,560
 And I'm kind of along for it.

903
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:09,560
 So can I make an added suggestion?

904
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,440
 Go ahead.

905
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,480
 You might as well.

906
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,800
 I've already built in a fucking stage in my backyard.

907
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:19,720
 Can I recommend that the stage double as a gazebo?

908
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:23,040
 You can recommend that.

909
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:23,240
 Sure.

910
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:27,080
 And the guy goes to one flower festival and he's suggesting you

911
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,840
 add a gazebo to your backyard.

912
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,640
 He learned the word gazebo.

913
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:36,200
 Make the gazebo the stage, you know, have a, have a pergola roof on the

914
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:40,480
 gazebo so that it's some, some shade.

915
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,520
 You can maybe string lights up there at night.

916
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,040
 Yeah.

917
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:44,960
 Yeah, I could do that.

918
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,600
 I could just see a band playing inside the gazebo.

919
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,760
 Let me ask you this, have you ever been asked to perform inside

920
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:50,840
 a gazebo as a stage?

921
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,400
 Uh, yeah.

922
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,200
 So have I, it sucks.

923
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,440
 It sucks at the stage because you, those are terrible stages.

924
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,120
 Yeah, yeah.

925
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,560
 We're not going to it's theater in the realm, but it's not really

926
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,680
 watching everyone to watch you through a fence.

927
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:08,040
 It's like every show's a neighbor across, across the way.

928
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:11,960
 I'm not saying the gazebo has to be a traditionally built gazebo.

929
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:15,640
 You could just make the roof connected by like five main tiles.

930
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,760
 Oh, a non-traditional gazebo.

931
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,120
 Yeah.

932
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:22,520
 More like a, more like a traditional, a non-traditional

933
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,440
 gazebo, more stagey.

934
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,800
 This is not, this is not your mother's gazebo.

935
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,160
 This is not your mother's gazebo.

936
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:34,160
 No, no, that gazebo would be a terrible stage.

937
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,560
 Paul's non-traditional gazebo.

938
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:44,360
 However, Paul, you do have a very elite barbecue every so often in your

939
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:46,520
 backyard, so a stage makes sense for your backyard.

940
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:50,360
 Uh, no, a stage is not the dumbest idea that has ever been

941
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,640
 proposed for my backyard.

942
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:52,720
 I think we're going to do it.

943
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,000
 Where are you going to do it?

944
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,160
 Well, I, that's part of it.

945
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:00,600
 I think that last night I was, I was taking a stroll last night.

946
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,440
 SJ was in California on a gig.

947
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,040
 So I was at home last night by myself.

948
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:09,680
 Uh, so I took a little stroll and I think I, I think I've given an A plus note to

949
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,640
 where, uh, SJ was talking about having it.

950
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:15,560
 Oh, cause she was talking about having kind of in the back of the backyard.

951
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:19,760
 And I think we're kind of going to kind of move it over to the side a little bit.

952
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:25,640
 And, uh, you know, the rock river, I think it's going to cover part of the rock river.

953
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,480
 I think it's going to be over the top of that rock river.

954
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,160
 So when water flows through it, it'll flow out from

955
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,840
 underneath the bottom of this stage.

956
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:33,720
 That's pretty cool.

957
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,280
 Give it more of a gazebo vibe.

958
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,280
 Yeah, I'll give it more of a gazebo vibe vibe.

959
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:37,640
 Sure.

960
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,040
 A non-traditional, a non-traditional gazebo.

961
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:43,440
 A river doesn't run through a traditional gazebo already.

962
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,920
 Either of you, have either of you ever really wanted something for your backyard?

963
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,960
 I'm like, what?

964
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,640
 I'm laughing because literally my wife and I were in the middle of it, having

965
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,440
 like a very serious, not a serious discussion, like we were just having a

966
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:00,880
 deep conversation and she just looked at the backyard and immediately changed the

967
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,840
 subject to something she wanted to change in the backyard.

968
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:06,000
 And I was like, we're really just switching gears.

969
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,200
 All my wife does is want us to, we've actually already, we actually have.

970
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,480
 You've done a lot of work on that backyard.

971
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,080
 I was going to say, Jay, you haven't been over in a while, but if you would,

972
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,840
 you wouldn't, you actually would be surprised in our backyard right now.

973
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,640
 We've had so much work done back there.

974
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:18,600
 Oh, nice.

975
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,960
 Uh, so Matt, can I ask?

976
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:21,560
 Two full-time jobs.

977
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,720
 She decides to get them some things changed in the backyard.

978
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,840
 Can I ask you Matt about your, uh, your backyard?

979
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,800
 Is this too sensitive a topic from the 4th of July?

980
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,360
 I know there was a fake grass incident.

981
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:36,920
 What's the, what's the status?

982
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:42,400
 Uh, I, I, so this is a sensitive topic.

983
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:42,800
 I know.

984
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,640
 Keeler's weighing in.

985
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:54,720
 We had everybody over the 4th of July, you know, all the things that we were

986
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:59,600
 buying for our kit, uh, for our, for our backyard, we bought a new fire pit.

987
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:04,040
 Cause the, the, the chimney that Jacob delightfully lent us so many years ago,

988
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:08,520
 uh, has been destroyed by, by the sun and weather and, and, and, and became

989
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:11,000
 an, an, a non-functioning chimney.

990
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,160
 Yeah.

991
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:12,960
 Can I get that back?

992
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:13,720
 Yeah.

993
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:19,560
 You get it back from whatever neighbor term is over, whatever neighbor took it.

994
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:20,800
 We put it out for bulk trash day.

995
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,000
 You get it back from them.

996
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,240
 Good, good.

997
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:24,080
 I'll go, I'll go get it.

998
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:27,680
 And, uh, so I bought, we bought like a new little, like, you know, quick put

999
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:32,040
 together a fire pit type of thing we can put in the backyard and then the kids

1000
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,240
 wanted s'mores on 4th of July.

1001
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,320
 So I quickly built the fire pit.

1002
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,000
 I put it together.

1003
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,480
 Right.

1004
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,480
 This is after I put together all the new furniture in the backyard in 40 hours

1005
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,560
 before the cookout as well.

1006
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,600
 We had, we put brand new furniture outside.

1007
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,080
 Everything was my bite.

1008
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,320
 When I bought this one kid, it was all Allen key.

1009
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,400
 The entire thing was Allen key.

1010
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:59,280
 And I like my hands hurt for days, but they built so much

1011
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,080
 furniture on those, on those.

1012
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:05,880
 The days before 4th of July, when I came over to Matt's entire, the entire

1013
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:11,760
 living room was covered in these, uh, seating, uh, pillows that were expanding.

1014
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,080
 He'd left them out to expanding.

1015
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:17,440
 But also Matt had all brand new wood flooring throughout the house.

1016
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:17,880
 Yes.

1017
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:20,880
 So I came in and the first thing I said is, Oh, this looks really nice.

1018
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:21,920
 And he's like, fuck you.

1019
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,680
 I'm like, what are you talking about?

1020
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:28,360
 I was just making fun of my pillows all over the front cover.

1021
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:32,240
 I'm trying to make a nice backyard.

1022
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,680
 I don't care about your messy thing.

1023
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,160
 I'm talking about your nice new floors.

1024
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:46,160
 So, uh, I built a gym and they, uh, uh, both a fire pit.

1025
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,040
 Um, and you're saying build it.

1026
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,880
 You're talking about like one of those fire dish things and it's on a little

1027
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:56,600
 stand and yeah, giant black bowl with a screen, with a screen on top of it.

1028
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,240
 And so we built it.

1029
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,960
 So the kids made s'mores in the front yard and then, and then the party's over.

1030
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,160
 So we're trying to wrap it up.

1031
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:06,520
 And so, uh, Keeler got a water gun.

1032
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,560
 We started spraying out the fire.

1033
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:11,000
 They started smoking like crazy.

1034
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,520
 And then I'm trying to put everything away.

1035
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:17,920
 And then I have all these neighbors that come by and the user, uh, with

1036
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,640
 their dogs and use our front yard as a toilet.

1037
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:20,680
 Uh huh.

1038
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:23,680
 And so, uh, I was walking around cleaning stuff up and someone,

1039
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:27,120
 so be clear the dogs are using your yard as a toilet, not the neighbors.

1040
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,400
 I don't want to be that clear.

1041
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:28,880
 I don't know.

1042
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:29,600
 Okay.

1043
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:29,880
 Okay.

1044
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:30,200
 I don't know.

1045
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:34,160
 So I, uh, the woman is, oh good.

1046
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:34,720
 I'm glad you're out here.

1047
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:35,480
 I saw that smoke.

1048
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:39,480
 And I was like, oh, people are making a big deal about this smoking fire thing.

1049
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,400
 So I move it into the backyard, but I don't want to put it too close to the house.

1050
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:47,040
 So I don't want the smoke going up the side of the stucco on the side yard.

1051
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,960
 Our side yard is fake grass.

1052
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,080
 Right.

1053
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:54,240
 And even though we put the fire out, the bottom of the fire pit was

1054
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,600
 still a very hot, uh, instrument.

1055
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:00,760
 And even though it has little pegs holding it off the ground, it wasn't high

1056
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:07,400
 enough off the ground that didn't melt a square foot patch of fake grass, uh, to,

1057
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,600
 to, to hard plastic ruin.

1058
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:17,440
 And, uh, my wife was not happy with me about my decision to move the fake fire pit.

1059
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,200
 So all, again, all I was trying to do is keep everyone happy.

1060
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,040
 And what happens bites me in the ass.

1061
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,240
 Yeah, that's right.

1062
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:25,760
 That's why more interesting.

1063
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,560
 And that's it.

1064
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,720
 It basically was like, can these guys play on a barefoot or is that a hazard?

1065
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:31,040
 Basically I just needed to figure that out.

1066
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:34,120
 And so I sent the children out to play like play.

1067
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,840
 And if you don't come back bleeding, I don't have to fix that little patch.

1068
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:41,200
 But if you come back to grinding, I do, I think you can fix this.

1069
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,000
 I think this is, I think you, you take a, uh, an exacto knife or a, you know,

1070
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,200
 a box cutter, cut a, kind of big square out of this, go get you some new fake

1071
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:53,560
 grass, just get some cheap fake grass from like home Depot or something like that.

1072
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,280
 You nail it down in there.

1073
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,120
 Bob's your uncle.

1074
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,080
 So this is a good, good talk, Jacob.

1075
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:00,600
 And this is what I looked up and I said that and I said, oh, maybe we can fix it.

1076
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,840
 And Sarah said you can't, you can't fix fake grass like that.

1077
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,440
 I said, well, I just looked up on the internet and the internet says you can,

1078
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:07,640
 but the internet says all kinds of things.

1079
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:10,200
 Yeah, I bet you can do it.

1080
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,040
 I bet Jacob's right.

1081
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:14,600
 And that was my first, the internet says that step-siblings are

1082
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,120
 fucking each other left and right.

1083
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:23,680
 I mean, there's no evidence to the contrary evidence for none against.

1084
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:31,000
 So, uh, we hope that I also really, I could see Matt's son on camera right now.

1085
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,360
 I, I'm uncomfortable with how quickly he got that joke very quickly.

1086
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:37,240
 Yeah, I don't like that at all.

1087
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,120
 I feel old now.

1088
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:40,680
 The internet is not a mystery to 11 years old, to 11 year old.

1089
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,320
 I feel old now.

1090
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:43,120
 I don't like it.

1091
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:50,880
 So, um, so the question is the, the burnt thing, which you can only

1092
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,600
 see when you go up close, you can't really like when you look across the

1093
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:56,160
 earth, will it looks fine from a distance?

1094
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,920
 Will the exacto patch stick out more to my wife's gaze?

1095
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,600
 That's the issue.

1096
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,480
 Yeah, no, you gotta, you gotta do some serious color matching here.

1097
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:08,200
 That's the hard part because possibly because it's been weathered.

1098
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,560
 It's been the sun for years.

1099
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:10,120
 Yeah, exactly.

1100
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:14,040
 So there's no, there's no way we're going to find an actual matching patch.

1101
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:16,520
 I have to wait, have done the right thing.

1102
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:17,720
 Maybe just buy some spray paint.

1103
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:21,880
 Is the, when, when they, did you put the fake grass down?

1104
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:22,800
 This is a silly question.

1105
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:25,440
 Did you put the fake grass down or did you hire somebody to put the fake grass?

1106
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,760
 Uh, uh, go ahead.

1107
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:29,080
 I'll give you three guesses on the first, you don't count Jacob.

1108
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:29,760
 Okay.

1109
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,680
 So Matt hired people to put the fake grass down.

1110
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:40,720
 If they did the ground prep under the fake grass, it might be easy to pull that grass

1111
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,560
 up and just put new grass down and redo the whole thing.

1112
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:44,240
 That's what I was.

1113
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,680
 That is actually what I was thinking.

1114
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,880
 It might be, it might be pretty easy to do the whole thing.

1115
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,640
 If they did the ground, the ground prep.

1116
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:50,400
 Yeah, they did.

1117
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:50,760
 They did.

1118
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:53,640
 They did the big sand, big sand, man, all that stuff.

1119
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:54,000
 Yeah.

1120
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,000
 So yeah, I basically thinking like down the road, it's probably like a new patch

1121
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,920
 of grass is probably like a five to $700 expense for that space.

1122
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:03,920
 Maybe not even that much.

1123
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:08,120
 You might be able to just buy some, buy some roles of the whole thing.

1124
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,800
 Well, Matt has kids now.

1125
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,920
 His kids are going to do sure.

1126
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,520
 They can open up a, a weird hole in the wall factory magic place.

1127
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,440
 They can, they can, they can roll out the grass.

1128
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,880
 But yeah, I just call the company.

1129
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:23,520
 It was funny because when we got that installed right before the pandemic, right.

1130
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,560
 And it was like, foolish was where we're right in the middle of foolish.

1131
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:27,400
 Right.

1132
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:31,680
 And I bought a basketball net, a recliner and those fake grass.

1133
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:34,400
 And then all of a sudden we're like, oh wait, we don't have jobs anymore.

1134
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,680
 And I was like, wait, I can't afford to hit this stuff.

1135
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,000
 We tried to cancel all of it.

1136
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
 And for the grass company, they're like, well, we already cut the thing.

1137
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:44,840
 We just haven't installed it.

1138
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,760
 So the only thing you save on is labor.

1139
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:51,240
 Like you're still going to get charged for the creating of the entire thing.

1140
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:51,720
 Right.

1141
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:52,080
 Yeah.

1142
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,400
 So you just had to go for it.

1143
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:58,120
 You know, the sand was piled up, uh, not, not, not put down with bags of sand.

1144
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:01,240
 And I just was like, yeah, we just have to eat it.

1145
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:04,080
 We have to be even more, we're just doing it now, but we have to finish it out.

1146
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:04,720
 Yeah.

1147
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:05,800
 We have already done this now.

1148
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:06,800
 It's, it's past tense.

1149
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:07,600
 Might as well keep going.

1150
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:08,640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1151
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:09,280
 Yeah.

1152
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,080
 We did that with the, uh, with our windows.

1153
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:13,680
 We bought new windows for the whole house.

1154
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,640
 10 scoops is just put a garbage can over it.

1155
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,720
 Oh, terrible idea.

1156
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,920
 Or just put a fire pit over it.

1157
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:22,920
 Make that the fire pits.

1158
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:25,800
 Well, I will make this suggestion, Matt.

1159
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:26,080
 Yeah.

1160
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:31,120
 I was asking you guys if you ever wanted anything in your backyard, because

1161
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,960
 I want something in my backyard very much.

1162
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,600
 I've always wanted, and I keep.

1163
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,640
 Oh, before Paul says that, I'll tell you out of the Twitch chat that, uh, uh, fifth,

1164
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:44,400
 fifth, Leah, maybe, uh, suggesting you just put a gazebo over it.

1165
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,160
 There you go.

1166
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:48,120
 So you have your nice little bird to spot.

1167
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:50,800
 Gazebo, not a traditional gazebo.

1168
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,200
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

1169
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,280
 I think we're past traditional gazebo at this point.

1170
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:59,800
 An 18 inch hexagon with lattice work in a roof.

1171
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,840
 And then you can be like, look, we put a stage in too.

1172
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:06,680
 It would look like an 1800s phone booth.

1173
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:12,560
 You could put it in a phone booth.

1174
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:16,000
 You could just set a phone booth right there at your side yard.

1175
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
 Canadian scoop.

1176
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,600
 Crystal suggested a wishing well.

1177
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,640
 That's not a bad idea.

1178
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:20,840
 Oh yeah.

1179
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:21,280
 Yeah.

1180
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:25,240
 Which reminds me of that hilarious Mr.

1181
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:28,640
 Show sketch about the wishing well, which is if you haven't seen it, scams and flams.

1182
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:33,840
 Uh, no, I have always wanted, I keep giving Anne the guff.

1183
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:36,200
 I want a Chinese bridge in our backyard.

1184
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:40,360
 The kind that has a really big arc, you know?

1185
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:40,760
 Okay.

1186
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:41,240
 Yeah.

1187
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:42,520
 That's what I want.

1188
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:44,440
 And she's always given me guff.

1189
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:51,400
 Sorry, Colton, Colton, Samurai either either went through AI or their do

1190
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:56,200
 sell children's gazebos, but it just put a photo up of a mini children's

1191
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:57,880
 gazebo that's very funny looking.

1192
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:01,360
 Oh, it's a sandbox, a gazebo sandbox.

1193
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,120
 Yeah.

1194
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:06,240
 That is what you would call not your traditional gazebo.

1195
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:09,240
 And Jay's box was my wrestling name.

1196
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:13,920
 I would say, uh, Matt, if you didn't have cats, that might be a good idea, but

1197
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,840
 that's going to just become a big old poo poo hole.

1198
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,920
 We used to have said in our backyard and we had to get rid of it because

1199
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,040
 it did become a cat poo poo hole.

1200
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:20,760
 Yep.

1201
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:25,000
 That's the cats like to poop in sand.

1202
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:25,560
 It turns out.

1203
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:29,080
 Oh, where would you put your bridge in your backyard?

1204
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:33,080
 Well, so again, like it opens up the Pandora's box of needing a water

1205
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:37,040
 feature kind of thing, which we don't have, and that would be a lot.

1206
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,200
 Not impossible.

1207
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:41,440
 How would this affect Anne's ranking in the Autobot society?

1208
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,000
 Would it probably take it up?

1209
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
 It would take it up a little notch because, uh, a bigger water

1210
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,560
 feature is something that she could add.

1211
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:49,560
 Honestly though, she's knocking it out of the park.

1212
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:53,680
 The only thing that they had against her was it wasn't quite big enough.

1213
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:58,880
 She needed 800 more square feet of habitat, which she could do if we

1214
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:02,640
 just trick out the front yard with bushes and shit.

1215
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,040
 You should trick out the front yard with troubled water.

1216
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,400
 And that way you can make a Chinese bridge over troubled water.

1217
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:12,600
 Like a Chinese bridge over troubled water.

1218
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,840
 Oh, that's so much better than what I was afraid.

1219
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:18,960
 I was afraid that he was going to do it in a Chinese accent and just do it in

1220
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,200
 bridge over troubled water in the Chinese accent.

1221
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,280
 I said dim sum.

1222
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:22,640
 Yeah.

1223
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,000
 I didn't do the Chinese accent.

1224
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:24,880
 I'm thrilled.

1225
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,880
 We've progressed as a, as a podcast, right?

1226
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:28,720
 I mean, we're growing.

1227
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:32,000
 I like you just put the bridge over a flower field.

1228
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,800
 That's exactly right.

1229
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:37,160
 That's exactly right.

1230
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,560
 That's flowers over there.

1231
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:45,080
 No, instead of water, donuts next to them, instead of water, you put flowers and

1232
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:50,640
 make the flowers look like a flowing water, uh, water thing, kind of.

1233
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:50,920
 Yeah.

1234
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,440
 So that's, thank you, Keeler.

1235
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,440
 That is exactly what we were considering.

1236
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:58,640
 And we still might at some point, uh, we'll see, but yeah, that's the,

1237
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,960
 that's my dream is to have a Chinese bridge.

1238
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,360
 And Anne's just like, we don't need a fucking Chinese bridge.

1239
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,480
 But I'm like, I want one.

1240
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:08,640
 Is she okay with other nationalities of bridge?

1241
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:16,040
 Oddly, oddly, she got really angry when I suggested a Spanish bridge.

1242
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:19,440
 Like she got mad.

1243
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:23,640
 I have always suspected that Anne is racist towards the people of Spain.

1244
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:24,840
 What is going on?

1245
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,520
 Uh, no, no, not at all.

1246
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:31,960
 Uh, who knows, um, you know, she's got some cool water features.

1247
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,600
 She's got some really nice little fountains and stuff.

1248
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,680
 We might do a bigger one.

1249
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,200
 We'll see.

1250
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:36,720
 We'll see.

1251
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,840
 All right.

1252
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:43,080
 Well, good luck with your Spanish tile Chinese bridge over, over

1253
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:46,200
 Veroma's waters of her troubled flowers.

1254
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:49,160
 Like a bridge over troubled flowers.

1255
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:52,640
 Let's do a little jock versus nerd.

1256
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:53,720
 And he's right.

1257
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:54,640
 Your wife is a Bridges.

1258
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:03,280
 It's simply a bridge too far for her.

1259
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:23,440
 Oh, hey, I have a revelation that came straight from Anne that you and

1260
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:27,160
 the scoops may be interested in a revelation to Paul.

1261
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:29,560
 She listens to the podcast religiously.

1262
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,280
 She listens to every episode.

1263
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:36,760
 She just informed me that sometimes she has to fast forward my

1264
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:44,800
 commercials if they're gross jokes.

1265
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:49,080
 Sometimes she has to fast forward it cause it makes her gross out.

1266
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,880
 So checks out.

1267
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:54,480
 Well, you couldn't, you couldn't pay my wife to listen to the show.

1268
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:55,960
 So still, no, I know.

1269
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:58,480
 I mean, I, I, I'm so, I, I thanked her again.

1270
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,360
 I was, I, I, I don't mind.

1271
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:01,360
 I get it.

1272
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:05,880
 As they say, you know who you married and you know, the jokes, the kind

1273
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:06,760
 of jokes and the sense of humor.

1274
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:10,800
 She's like, I know, but sometimes you get really gross on those, those

1275
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,360
 commercials and I just have to fast forward a little bit and I'm like, okay.

1276
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:17,520
 Every now and then my wife will listen to the show.

1277
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,440
 It is, it is rare.

1278
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,600
 I mean, it's, she's in the same boat as Matt's wife.

1279
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:26,520
 And, uh, and I mean, when she does, it is so surprising to me.

1280
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:27,840
 Every time it just shocks me.

1281
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:32,640
 She showed up to scoop fest last year in a, in a costume.

1282
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:33,640
 It was like, what?

1283
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:36,040
 How did you do this?

1284
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:38,560
 Oh my gosh.

1285
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:39,080
 Yeah.

1286
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:39,600
 And he's right.

1287
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,480
 Think of the sponsors.

1288
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:41,320
 What about the sponsors?

1289
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:42,640
 Paul, think about them.

1290
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,480
 Do they happy with their gross portrayal?

1291
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,560
 Of course they are.

1292
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:46,920
 They paid for the gross stuff.

1293
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:49,400
 They pay for that foul stuff.

1294
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,320
 That's what they come.

1295
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,800
 We got a scooper to come in as the day from silver fist scoop.

1296
01:14:53,800 --> 01:15:00,440
 The categories are Oprah Chopra, Oprah, Ikea, Crimea, gonorrhea,

1297
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:04,640
 Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, or which Prince.

1298
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,320
 All right.

1299
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:07,080
 It's me first.

1300
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:08,560
 I'll try which Prince for 400.

1301
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:09,720
 Fascinating topics.

1302
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:12,440
 This man was born in 1958.

1303
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:16,200
 Is it Prince Andrew Prince William or Prince?

1304
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,800
 Huh?

1305
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:19,320
 Okay.

1306
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:23,080
 So I think Prince Williams out Prince Williams.

1307
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,120
 One of the, like the princes now, right?

1308
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:25,640
 Yes.

1309
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:26,520
 Yeah.

1310
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:26,760
 Yeah.

1311
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:27,400
 So he's right.

1312
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:28,040
 He's right out.

1313
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:29,520
 Prince Andrew.

1314
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,040
 I think 58 is too young to be Prince Andrew.

1315
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:33,680
 I'm going to just say Prince.

1316
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:35,120
 I think the purple one.

1317
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:37,600
 It is Prince.

1318
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,240
 Good job.

1319
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:41,200
 Did my math out loud and everything, Matt.

1320
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,960
 Well, he died right at 50, right?

1321
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,400
 It was something.

1322
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,080
 It was right around there.

1323
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:45,400
 Yeah.

1324
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:46,960
 Oh, you die in '09.

1325
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,000
 I'll do which Prince please.

1326
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:55,360
 Which Prince for 800 made an honorary fellow of the society of light and

1327
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:59,680
 lighting in 2016, Prince Andrew Prince William or Prince.

1328
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:02,160
 I'll go with Prince William.

1329
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:03,360
 Okay.

1330
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,640
 It's Prince Andrew.

1331
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:06,160
 Really?

1332
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:08,240
 They're still giving that guy awards in 2016, huh?

1333
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:11,600
 I don't know what the society of light and lighting is.

1334
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,840
 So, uh, who knows it's give him awards or give him children.

1335
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:15,400
 One or the other.

1336
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:19,080
 He, you know, you gotta, you gotta pick your poison there.

1337
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:20,600
 I think he accepted from Epstein Island.

1338
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:29,400
 I will go with, uh, Ikea, Crimea, gonorrhea for 400.

1339
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:33,640
 You can find, uh, cor, cornea here.

1340
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:36,600
 Is it Ikea, Crimea or gonorrhea?

1341
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,280
 I'll go with Crimea.

1342
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:40,880
 I mean, that's, it seems like a proper noun.

1343
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,040
 It is.

1344
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,720
 Oh, it's the cornea river.

1345
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:46,600
 Cry me a river.

1346
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,600
 That's me.

1347
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:52,920
 I'll try, um, let's try Jupiter, Saturn or Uranus for 400.

1348
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:53,400
 You would.

1349
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:56,480
 This is the fifth planet from the sun.

1350
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:59,000
 Jupiter, Saturn or Uranus.

1351
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,560
 Jupiter.

1352
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,880
 Yes.

1353
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,000
 I had to count on my fingers.

1354
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,360
 Jupiter.

1355
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:07,760
 Matt.

1356
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:12,240
 Uh, I'll take, uh, Ikea, Crimea, gonorrhea, please.

1357
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:14,520
 Daily double.

1358
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,680
 All of it, Jacob.

1359
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:19,320
 All of my negative one, negative 800 points.

1360
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:24,200
 This was featured in a song by little Wayne and Drake in 2010.

1361
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:27,640
 Is it Ikea, Crimea or gonorrhea?

1362
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:30,600
 I really hope it's Crimea.

1363
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:31,200
 Honestly.

1364
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:34,120
 I really hope that little Wayne and Drake did a song about Crimea.

1365
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:36,760
 I don't even, I, let's see.

1366
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:40,640
 Um, my guess was gonorrhea.

1367
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,800
 Um, all right.

1368
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:43,520
 I'll go Crimea.

1369
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:52,240
 Oh, it's gonorrhea, gonorrhea, cha cha cha, gonorrhea, cha cha cha.

1370
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:55,720
 A Prince died at 57.

1371
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:56,080
 Thank you.

1372
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,440
 Ted scoop for that information.

1373
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:58,520
 I thought it was just 50.

1374
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:00,120
 That was MJ the data 50.

1375
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:02,560
 Uh, so he died in 17.

1376
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:03,560
 Right.

1377
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:05,000
 Or 19 or whatever.

1378
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,800
 16, 16, I think.

1379
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:07,080
 Okay.

1380
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:08,200
 Or 15 anyway.

1381
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:13,040
 Uh, but, but, but, but, but I'll do Ikea, Crimea, gonorrhea.

1382
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,360
 All right.

1383
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:17,960
 Again, you can find Clippin here.

1384
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:23,440
 K I K L I P P A N is that Ikea, Crimea or gonorrhea?

1385
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,720
 I'm going to go with Ikea.

1386
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:25,760
 Yeah.

1387
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,000
 Let's try Ikea.

1388
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,160
 It's a sofa.

1389
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:33,360
 Ah, Clippin our vice president's favorite item at Ikea.

1390
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:41,520
 I'll close that Ikea for 2000 sold the Russia based mega family shopping center

1391
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:46,120
 chain to Gazprom bank in 2023.

1392
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:48,160
 Is it Ikea, Crimea or gonorrhea?

1393
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:50,440
 All right.

1394
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:51,800
 I'm just going to do the math here.

1395
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:59,800
 Did gonorrhea sell the Russian based mega family shopping center chain in 2023.

1396
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:02,200
 You don't know gonorrhea is life.

1397
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,520
 I don't.

1398
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,120
 All right.

1399
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,800
 I'm going to say that it's not gonorrhea.

1400
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:13,200
 Uh, I don't know enough about the political socioeconomic structure of

1401
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,800
 Crimea to be really sure about this.

1402
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:22,160
 Does the country of Crimea own things like, like a shopping center

1403
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:25,520
 chain that they can then just turn around and sell, or is this a

1404
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:28,520
 subsidiary of a subsidiary of Ikea?

1405
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:28,920
 Yeah.

1406
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:33,440
 I'm going to say Crimea.

1407
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,120
 All right.

1408
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:36,280
 Shit.

1409
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:36,720
 It's Ikea.

1410
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:38,600
 Scuba.

1411
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:40,080
 Flip the coin.

1412
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:40,800
 Got it wrong.

1413
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:41,320
 Matt.

1414
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:44,200
 You, I just, cause I was the only one who got anything wrong.

1415
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,400
 And I was really get my butt kicked.

1416
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:48,080
 Um, let's see here.

1417
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,400
 I have 1600.

1418
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:50,080
 Uh, let's see.

1419
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,400
 I'll go with negative 1600.

1420
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,480
 I go with Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus for 2000.

1421
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:56,680
 All right.

1422
01:19:56,680 --> 01:20:03,200
 In mythology, this God was both the son and the husband kinky of Gaia.

1423
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,920
 Is it Jupiter, Saturn or Uranus?

1424
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:09,160
 Oh, I don't think it was Uranus.

1425
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:13,320
 You don't think so?

1426
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:17,160
 Wait, now that I, now that I pronounce it the right way, it might be that.

1427
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:23,160
 Jupiter is a, Jupiter is the God I know reference a lot in Shakespeare and stuff.

1428
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,160
 Okay.

1429
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:25,960
 Saturn.

1430
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:29,160
 Jupiter is the Roman counterpart of Zeus.

1431
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:29,800
 Yeah.

1432
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:34,440
 Jupiter, of course, famously where girls go to get more stupider.

1433
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,600
 Um, right.

1434
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,560
 And Saturn sets the pattern.

1435
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:40,680
 Yeah.

1436
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:43,840
 Uh, my gut was going Uranus is inflamed.

1437
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:44,760
 I'm going to go with Jupiter.

1438
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:45,840
 Okay.

1439
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:46,200
 Okay.

1440
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:46,680
 Let's see.

1441
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:48,040
 It is often it's Uranus.

1442
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:52,080
 Oh, it was always Uranus, Matt.

1443
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:57,600
 Paul, you put Uranus on the line.

1444
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:04,360
 Uh, I'll try Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus for 800.

1445
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:06,840
 Boy, we're all steering away from the Oprah category.

1446
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:10,280
 This planet has the second largest moon Titan in the solar system.

1447
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:12,320
 Is that Jupiter, Saturn or Uranus?

1448
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,120
 Uh,

1449
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:22,120
 this plan, I think that's Saturn moon Titan.

1450
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:23,600
 You think it's Saturn.

1451
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,680
 It is Saturn.

1452
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:29,200
 All right.

1453
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,440
 To me, I'll close out Uranus for 1200.

1454
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:38,520
 This God was the parent of Pluto.

1455
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:41,120
 Is that Jupiter, Saturn or Uranus?

1456
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,640
 Uh, let's see.

1457
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:47,880
 Pluto is Hades, right?

1458
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:52,600
 I thought Hades and Zeus were brothers.

1459
01:21:52,600 --> 01:22:00,960
 Well, if that I thought hasten Jupiter, but I also, but isn't because Poseidon

1460
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:05,640
 is Saturn and Zeus and Jupiter Poseidon.

1461
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:08,920
 We're also brothers and Jupiter is Zeus, right?

1462
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:10,960
 And Jupiter is Zeus.

1463
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:14,080
 So I think I guess it's Uranus.

1464
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:15,360
 I'll say Uranus.

1465
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,480
 That's Jupiter.

1466
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,160
 Oh, man.

1467
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:21,280
 I don't fuck it.

1468
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:29,000
 Paul, Paul's running away with us and not in the usual way, not because we loaded up

1469
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,200
 on nerd questions and he's crushing it, but, uh, Jacob and I have buried

1470
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,120
 ourselves in this one.

1471
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:33,560
 Yeah.

1472
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:34,360
 Yeah.

1473
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,000
 Uh, Matt, you're up.

1474
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,920
 Fucking, uh, Oprah, excuse me.

1475
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:40,160
 I'm cursing for my kids.

1476
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:42,160
 That's how you know how much I'm enjoying this right now.

1477
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:47,320
 Let's do which Prince for 2000.

1478
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:48,560
 Which all right.

1479
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:52,160
 Has a BA in geography at the university of St.

1480
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:55,520
 Andrews is that Prince Andrew Prince William or Prince?

1481
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:01,280
 This is the first one where I've, I've sincerely felt like

1482
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:02,400
 it could be any of the three.

1483
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:03,680
 Yes, exactly.

1484
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:05,440
 It could be.

1485
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:09,720
 I mean, uh, St.

1486
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:11,080
 Andrews, of course, in Ireland.

1487
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,800
 I'll go with, uh, Prince William.

1488
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:14,840
 Good guess.

1489
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:15,400
 All right.

1490
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:18,280
 It's Prince William.

1491
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:29,840
 I'll try some Oprah Cobra Oprah.

1492
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:30,360
 All right.

1493
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:32,600
 This person was born in January, 1954.

1494
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:37,520
 Is it Oprah Winfrey deep pop Chopra or, or, uh, Oprah or an

1495
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:45,080
 Oprah Oprah born in 54, probably.

1496
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:48,280
 I don't know for sure though.

1497
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:48,920
 I'll pass.

1498
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:53,960
 Uh, let's see that passes to, uh, me.

1499
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:54,560
 Oh shit.

1500
01:23:54,920 --> 01:24:01,520
 Uh, I have no idea, but I have to guess anyway.

1501
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:09,120
 I will say that that was, uh, Deepa Deepak Chopra.

1502
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:10,920
 It's Oprah.

1503
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,440
 It was Oprah.

1504
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:15,040
 Now I'm just getting more buried.

1505
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:15,880
 It's me.

1506
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:19,680
 I'll, uh, which Prince 1200 daily double.

1507
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:22,240
 Good.

1508
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:24,320
 That's what I need to get me in less negative points.

1509
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:28,640
 What I was quoted as saying the internet is completely over in 2010.

1510
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:31,000
 Was that Prince Andrew Prince William or Prince?

1511
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:35,600
 Oh, again, this two of these is very possible.

1512
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:36,480
 Yeah.

1513
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,080
 I'd be really surprised if it was Prince William.

1514
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:44,760
 Uh, boy, I kind of think it was Prince.

1515
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:45,560
 I'm going Prince.

1516
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:45,760
 Yeah.

1517
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:47,280
 It was Prince.

1518
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:47,800
 Yeah.

1519
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:53,680
 Uh, Matt, you got, uh, Oprah for eight, 12 or 2000.

1520
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:57,480
 The only way I can get into positive points is 2000.

1521
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:59,080
 Yes, that is true.

1522
01:24:59,080 --> 01:24:59,960
 Okay.

1523
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:00,640
 All right.

1524
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:01,280
 Don't blow it.

1525
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:07,400
 This person launched Virgin comics in 2006 with Richard, with Richard Branson.

1526
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:10,720
 Is it Oprah Winfrey Deepak Chopra or an Oprah?

1527
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:17,000
 These all feel like the wrong answer, right?

1528
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,920
 I don't see a comp, a comics company.

1529
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:23,920
 I don't see Oprah doing that, but I certainly don't see deep.

1530
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,960
 Oh wait, Deepak Chopra comics might make sense.

1531
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:29,400
 Cause it's like a deep thing.

1532
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:33,200
 Uh, I'll go with, I'll go with Deepak Chopra.

1533
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:34,720
 Okay.

1534
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:36,240
 It is.

1535
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:36,840
 Yeah.

1536
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:37,920
 Yeah.

1537
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:38,200
 Yeah.

1538
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:41,560
 All right, Matt, listen to his son and didn't screw it up.

1539
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:44,160
 We got 800 or 1200 either way.

1540
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:44,880
 Paul's going to win.

1541
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,320
 Good.

1542
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:49,040
 Uh, I'll try the 1200 then.

1543
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,280
 Why not?

1544
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:53,600
 This person was sued for copyright infringement for a book they wrote in

1545
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:54,600
 1993.

1546
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:56,920
 Is that Oprah Deepak or an OPA?

1547
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:01,000
 Uh, who's an OPA?

1548
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,080
 I, you know, everything that I do.

1549
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:06,880
 I'll pass.

1550
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:07,320
 I don't know.

1551
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:09,320
 Uh, it's me.

1552
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:11,760
 I'll say, um, Deepak.

1553
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:14,400
 Yeah.

1554
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:15,080
 Sue him.

1555
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:16,960
 Get him lost.

1556
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:17,520
 Get him.

1557
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,760
 And I'm closing out the category and the game.

1558
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:23,000
 If I get this correct, I will be tied for second place with

1559
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:23,840
 Matt Donnelly.

1560
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:30,720
 This is a deeply kneeled, laterally compressed, discoid fish.

1561
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:39,480
 Deeply keeled, laterally compressed, discoid fish.

1562
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:40,440
 Stay down Oprah.

1563
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:44,840
 Is that Oprah Winfrey, Deepak Chopra or an OPA?

1564
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:46,120
 I love that.

1565
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:47,720
 That's just a straight up answer.

1566
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:48,360
 That's just great.

1567
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:51,120
 I'm going to, I'm going to say D, your mom.

1568
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:51,880
 Oh boy.

1569
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:54,280
 I believe that'd be an OPA.

1570
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:58,320
 It is an OPA and that is the game.

1571
01:26:58,320 --> 01:26:59,920
 Paul wins with 2,400.

1572
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,720
 Matt and I are tied at 400 a piece.

1573
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,040
 And that's from silver fist scoop.

1574
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:04,320
 Thank you.

1575
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:05,160
 Silver fist scoop.

1576
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:08,920
 If you want to send us a scooperty or a price of Skryte jock versus nerd or an

1577
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:12,960
 obelisk jock versus nerd, head over to HeyScoops.com.

1578
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:13,480
 That's where you can go.

1579
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:15,200
 HeyScoops.com right there on the homepage.

1580
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,280
 Make us one of those jock versus nerds.

1581

 Send us some scoop mail, buy your tickets to scoop fest.

1582
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:24,400
 Do all the things right over there at HeyScoops.com.

1583
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:28,840
 I believe for scoop fest, we are now officially sold out of

1584
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:30,440
 the Jacobs whiskey barbecue.

1585
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:30,920
 Okay.

1586
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:35,280
 However, now with gazebo now with more gazebo.

1587
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:42,800
 However, I don't think we're going to have as many of our guests, uh, coming

1588
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:46,360
 to the barbecue this year, as we've had in years, I just don't think we have as

1589
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:48,640
 many guests, uh, that are going to be in town for it.

1590
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,440
 So, uh, if you are wanting to come to the whiskey barbecue as part of scoop

1591
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:58,720
 fest, hit me up, uh, hit any of it's up, honestly, uh, but yeah, we'll, we'll

1592
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,000
 figure out a way for you to come.

1593
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,120
 Uh, because I think that we can make it work.

1594
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:06,240
 So, uh, from, from here on out, uh, it's just a catch a sketch can on the whiskey

1595
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:10,280
 barbecue, but we can definitely squeeze some more people in limited exclusive

1596
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:12,960
 tickets still available through directly.

1597
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:13,720
 That's it.

1598
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:15,880
 Just, just hit us up and we'll, uh, we'll figure it out.

1599
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:16,680
 We'll get you on the list.

1600
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:19,800

1601

 on your budget, uh, for the regular scoop fest, go to scoopfest.com.

1602
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:30,040
 We are at that point where we can basically, we think we will be able to

1603
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:34,720
 accommodate everyone, uh, with the scoop fest bags because of sizes and stuff.

1604
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:40,200
 At this point, we can't guarantee your size, um, for the, that we're selling.

1605
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:44,320
 We'll have stuff, but, uh, you know, at this point, if you buy a ticket, we will,

1606
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,120

1647
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:59,160
 We'll take it.

1648
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:04,440
 Um, so the people have been love, uh, been so lovely to join us on our zoom.

1649
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:09,360
 If you have a minute to go over to the bucket show.com, if you get a free Amazon,

1650
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:12,360
 if you're an Amazon member, there's a free subscription button there.

1651
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:16,840
 Uh, and if you can give us the Amazon subscription that, that gives us a few

1652
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:20,800
 dollars, uh, that are at, not out of Amazon's pocket, not yours.

1653
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,240
 Um, so it's a huge help to us.

1654
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:25,320
 So if you take a second, just go over to the bucket show.com and check that out.

1655
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:30,720
 Um, and, uh, for everyone else, you know, uh, if you want to help us out without

1656
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:34,640
 money, but you want to help out our show, participate in our obelisk scheme,

1657
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:37,840

1659
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:43,040
 No, that's a really, really helpful.

1660
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:45,800
 Don't try to get five people do it and get those five people to do it.

1661
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:46,760
 That's a pyramid scheme.

1662
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:48,240
 That's a pyramid.

1663
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:49,360
 False promises.

1664
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:51,600
 Please just choose one person and one person only.

1665
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,760
 There is a very small pyramid on top of the obelisk.

1666
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:57,400
 We don't mention that we don't even talk about it.

1667
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:57,960
 Weird.

1668
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:59,280
 It's really even brought up now.

1669
01:31:59,280 --> 01:31:59,960
 All right.

1670
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:01,040
 Uh, thanks for everybody.

1671
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:01,920
 Stay safe out there.

1672
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,200
 We love you and we'll see you soon.

1673
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:13,800
 Oh, I recently guested on a podcast called creators cafe out of Los Angeles.

1674
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:17,760
 It's a podcast where the, uh, host Jessica Payne talks to different

1675
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:20,760
 creative people and, uh, and show business all over the place.

1676
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:21,640
 Really fun.

1677
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:24,760
 And, uh, I had a nice long conversation with Jessica over there.
