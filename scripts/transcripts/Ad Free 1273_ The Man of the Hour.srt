1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,280
 Oh hello there, I am so glad you are here because I want to thank you the ice cream

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,280
 truck drivers.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,200
 Thank you so much ice cream truck drivers.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,320
 Right now I'd like to thank Bearded Scoop 3, Blue Line Scoop, Chasing the Dragon Scoop,

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,880
 Christine Elsesser, Christy Salinas, Darren Cunningham, Darth Scooper, David Walker, Ted

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,800
 Laszlo, Dirty Old Scoop and Dr. Scoop Little.

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,720

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:48,560

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,440
 Here's a show.

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,880
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social?

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,360
 Yeah, I'd love to.

13
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,360
 Great.

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,360
 Let's go.

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:10,480
 A man was arrested in New Jersey recently for a road rage incident where he shot a woman

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,480
 in the face.

17
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,120
 She's fine, but he shot her in the face.

18
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,120
 She's fine.

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,120
 Yep.

20
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,120
 It's time for Matt Mattingly's Ice Cream Social.

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,480
 Sitting over there with a confused look on his face, that's Paul Mattingly.

22
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,840
 Sitting over there with an understanding look on his face, that's Matt Mattingly.

23
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,840
 We're preachingfun.

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,960
 I'm taking him to Las Vegas.

25
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,920
 I just saw this.

26
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,120
 Apparently he's a Sopranos guy, a couple other.

27
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,240
 He's a bit actor.

28
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,800
 His role on The Sopranos, his character name on The Sopranos was Thief.

29
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,280
 Oh.

30
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,140
 Yeah, yeah.

31
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,960
 He's a Sopranos actor the same way that the guy who walked in the back of the scene is

32
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,960
 a Sopranos actor.

33
00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:02,000
 Right, but to say she got shot in the face and is okay, that's not right either.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Right.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,240
 It apparently raised her nose, hit her in the nose, but it went across her nose.

36
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,000
 She went to the hospital and everything, but she was not in any-

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,480
 Full recovery?

38
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,560
 I believe so.

39
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,080
 I don't believe there was any life-threatening injury.

40
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,360
 It was a flesh wound, as they say.

41
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:30,200
 Yeah, but he is facing 31 counts in connection with the violent rampage, including first

42
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:37,160
 degree attempted murder and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

43
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,600
 Apparently they were both trying to get into the same lane at the same time.

44
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,000
 She absolutely had the right of way.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Yeah, right.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,880
 And he got just enraged and shot a gun out of the window of his car.

47
00:02:51,880 --> 00:03:00,160
 Which just goes to show you how advanced Matt Donnelly is for a New Jersey driver.

48
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,840
 Just calm, mellow.

49
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,920
 The amount of people that'd be surprised if my death or someone else's death involved

50
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,280
 my road rage would be zero people.

51
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,280
 Zero.

52
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,040
 It would be sad.

53
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,040
 Just not surprised.

54
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,040
 Not surprised.

55
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,520
 I'd say it's the one benefit probably, I don't know if it's even a benefit, of the surveillance

56
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:28,040
 state that we live in, is that they're going to have plenty of footage of this from the

57
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,040
 cameras everywhere.

58
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
 Oh yeah.

59
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,520
 I got into an Uber the other day and the Uber driver pointed out the inside and outside

60
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,160
 cameras to me as I got in and he definitely did it.

61
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,160
 Oh, he was letting you know.

62
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,440
 Yeah, he definitely was doing it in a way to be like, "I've had trouble in here before,

63
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,800
 here are the cameras, please don't be an asshole."

64
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
 Yeah.

65
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
 Oh God.

66
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,800
 I'm a Las Vegas local, I'm just going to my house and he was like, "Oh thank God."

67
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,280
 Please ignore the hair.

68
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,280
 Yeah.

69
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,000
 Oh boy, what a hassle.

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,480
 Well, I'll pile on the bad, sad, I don't know if you guys heard about this, noted YouTube

71
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,960
 vlogger Adam the Woo passed away.

72
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,960
 Oh goodness.

73
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
 I did not.

74
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,160
 What was he known for?

75
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,960
 He was known for Disney parks reviews and haunted attraction reviews and he did a daily

76
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,980
 blog, daily vlog and he was good friends with a lot of other creators that I'm interested

77
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:27,900
 in like Jacob the Carpetbagger and a couple other people and yeah, he went to all kinds

78
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,260
 of theme parks and stuff.

79
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,800
 He even did Paris Disney recently.

80
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:40,480
 He was very prolific with his work and just apparently natural causes, almost exact same

81
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,280
 age as me, bit the dust.

82
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,780
 Probably a heartbreaker, yeah, everybody's really sad about it.

83
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:55,200
 It's one of those deaths that makes me look at it.

84
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,280
 You look at the breadth of his creative output and you look at the reactions from the creator

85
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:08,600
 community as well as the fans and you see a person who lived their life well.

86
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:15,720
 You see nice results from their life.

87
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,560
 And if anything, lots of positive things, fan interactions, people, you know, he treated

88
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,240
 everyone very kindly, remembered people, like he would go to many of these fan events over

89
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,640
 and over again, these horror nights and horror conventions and he would see people who go

90
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,760
 to the horror conventions regularly and he could recognize them in costume and stuff

91
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,760
 like that.

92
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,760
 Oh, that's great.

93
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:44,280
 You know, just seems to be, seems to have been a general all around good guy.

94
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,840
 Good news though, Paul, I've looked him up here, he's actually going to be now haunting

95
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,120
 the Disney parks so people will be able to do his style of show now about him.

96
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,560
 So it's the circle of life.

97
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,560
 There you go.

98
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,240
 Well, there are suggesting that he be buried or at least have the funeral ceremony somewhere

99
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,480
 near the Disney parks as that was his favoritest thing.

100
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,480
 So who knows?

101
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,840
 You know, Disney, Disney don't get into that shit.

102
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,160
 Well, Disney is, Disney's like, if you want to do that somewhere on private property and

103
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,960
 say that it's close to our place, that's fine.

104
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,000
 If you want to do that shit on our property, you can go fuck yourself.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,160
 You know how many people that, how many times they've had to clean up human remains out

106
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
 of the haunted mansion?

107
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,160
 Oh yeah.

108
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,680
 Because I think that's the entire reason that they don't want to fuck with their cremated

109
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,680
 loved ones and dump them in the, in the dune buggies.

110
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
 Yeah.

111
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,680
 Yeah.

112
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,800
 So don't do that, it's a public service announcement for the 19 year old that has to clean up your

113
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,240
 loved one's remains.

114
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,720
 Please don't dump their ashes on the haunted mansion ride.

115
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,320
 It's a ride.

116
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,240
 We are advocates of the Throshen option.

117
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,640
 Throshen.

118
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,640
 Throshen is the best.

119
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,640
 Throshen is out there.

120
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,440
 It's the most environmentally clean option if you're not a fish.

121
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,320
 People keep suggesting that Throshen be the best option for the current resident of the

122
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:05,480
 White House as otherwise talk about cleanup services being required.

123
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,880
 No, I'm sure it's all fine.

124
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,400
 Well, regardless, uh, yeah, just tragic.

125
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:19,040
 You know, the other, the other side too, uh, when I would go to Kings Island as a kid,

126
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,240
 this was still rural Ohio back in the day.

127
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,760
 It's been somewhat more developed as it goes along, but it was still, you know, country

128
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:34,680
 ish and there was a, there was a tiny graveyard just outside of Kings Island.

129
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,980
 As you were walking towards the front gates and even in the parking area, you could see

130
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,000
 a small graveyard.

131
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,720
 These were the people that died on the beast.

132
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,820
 I don't, I don't know who, who exactly, well, I should look it up.

133
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,200
 It's a known thing.

134
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:54,080
 It's a bunch of gravestones and grave markers right outside of Kings Island and, um, I always

135
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,520
 thought what a great place to be buried because I loved Kings Island so much as a kid and

136
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:06,600
 even as we know, Annie is a listener of the podcast, so take some notes here.

137
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
 Yeah.

138
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,440
 Um, I mean, I, you know, I, maybe it's a little arrogant to assume that Annie will outlive

139
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,640
 you, but I don't know if it's very arrogant to assume Annie will outlive you.

140
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:22,120
 I would just have to, oh no, Ann's already got us grave plots secured.

141
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,120
 Does she have one for both of you or just you?

142
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,440
 No, both, two of us.

143
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,440
 Yeah.

144
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,840
 Well, I mean, she's not going to bury you at Kings Island then?

145
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,160
 She's not going to bury me at Kings Island, but I've told her I don't want to burial.

146
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,000
 I'm going to get cremated and then, you know, whatever.

147
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 I don't know why I was calling her Annie.

148
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 I was calling her Annie because we're waiting on an email from our Annie.

149
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 We're thinking about Annie.

150
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Yeah.

151
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Thank you, Ann.

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,320
 I think Ann should take note that you want to be buried at Kings Island.

153
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,320
 She knows.

154
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,960
 The cemetery outside of Kings Island known as the Dog Street Cemetery is a historic but

155
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,560
 forgotten burial ground.

156
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,560
 Not forgotten.

157
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,560
 We're talking about it right now.

158
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,200
 Well, the people who are in it.

159
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,720
 No, people don't know, I guess, the people who are in it.

160
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,720
 Yeah.

161
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,160
 I think it's the dead people who have been forgotten about that.

162
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,160
 Oh, got it.

163
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
 Got it.

164
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
 Got it.

165
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,160
 So are the graves unmarked in that way?

166
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,160
 At least hard to read the name.

167
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,680
 They're marked, but they're marked with things like Missouri Jane.

168
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,680
 Ah.

169
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,680
 Okay.

170
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,680
 Yeah.

171
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,560
 And it still sits quietly within the park's property near the main entrance.

172
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,560
 Yep.

173
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,560
 No.

174
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
 You'd walk by it every time.

175
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:27,120
 And apparently it was, the cemetery itself was forgotten about and was rediscovered in

176
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,120
 the 1890s.

177
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,120
 Okay.

178
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,120
 Yeah.

179
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,120
 You can't miss it.

180
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,240
 So they found an overgrown cemetery that had been reclaimed by the woods and everything

181
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,240
 in the 1890s.

182
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
 Yeah.

183
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,080
 You can't miss it when you're going into Kings Island.

184
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,920
 It's kind of a nice little memento mori, you know, it's like, because not everybody survives

185
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,980
 the bat.

186
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,760
 Not everybody makes it off Top Gun.

187
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,760
 Yeah.

188
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,960
 Lindsay and Chad says, go ahead and dump me in the Haunted Mansion.

189
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,960
 Don't cremate me.

190
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:59,360
 Just, we can have Bernie's meat through the park and dump me there.

191
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,720
 Just remains.

192
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,280
 Not cremated remains.

193
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,280
 Just remains.

194
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,680
 What would be the legality?

195
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,680
 And what would be?

196
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
 It's not.

197
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,680
 It's not legal.

198
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,680
 No.

199
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,680
 Hear me out now.

200
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,680
 Hear me out.

201
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,680
 I believe it falls under an illegal dumping statute.

202
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,680
 Okay.

203
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,680
 Yeah.

204
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,480
 I'm not talking Disney anymore.

205
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,400
 Let's get away from the Disney affiliation.

206
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,680
 How much would it take?

207
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,160
 What kind of legal red tape, given that we are in the Wild West again, as far as you

208
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,480
 got the money, you can do the thing.

209
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,900
 This has probably been done.

210
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,800
 Now that I'm saying it, this has probably been done.

211
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:39,960
 But you could have people who are horror fans volunteer to have their corpses utilized in

212
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:47,560
 a haunted attraction and you could just go through on a little scooter and see rotting

213
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,680
 dead people, maybe put some animatronics in them, maybe make them jiggle around a little

214
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,680
 bit.

215
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,720
 This next body is actually Zach Baggins.

216
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,360
 He founded this museum back in the 2000s.

217
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
 Right.

218
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
 I mean, if Epstein-

219
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,640
 Scoop Jesus is talking about how bad it would stink.

220
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,640
 Yes, Scoop Jesus.

221
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,640
 Yes.

222
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,780
 It would stink.

223
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:10,700
 If Epstein was as enthusiastic about haunted houses as he was about child rape, then it

224
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,160
 would have already happened.

225
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,800
 It would have already been happening.

226
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
 It would have been already a feature of his island.

227
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
 I'm thinking-

228
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,560
 To be fair, we don't know for sure that it's not, unless, oh, Matt, have you been to the

229
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,560
 island, Matt?

230
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,720
 Are you at the island right now?

231
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,400
 I'm glad we're recording on a Tuesday because you do not want to record with me on Thursday.

232
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,080
 I'll tell you that much right now.

233
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,120
 Those files come out.

234
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,160
 Just one very small haunted hole on Jeffrey Island.

235
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,440
 Just a small haunted hole.

236
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,240
 Calls it his boo cave, he does.

237
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,840
 Don't go to the boo cave.

238
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,160
 That's worse than the Tickle House, y'all.

239
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,960
 Stay the fuck out of the boo cave on Epstein Island, the haunted hole.

240
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,660
 I figured out how to get Trump's name off of the Kennedy Center.

241
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,400
 Have I told you about this?

242
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
 Oh, no.

243
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,400
 How you do it?

244
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,160
 All you have to do is show up with an even larger Donald J. Trump sign, and so when you

245
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,400
 go to take the one off, they'll go, "Hey, you're not supposed to take that off."

246
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,680
 You go, "No, no, no.

247
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,160
 The president said his name wasn't big enough," and then that'll allow you to get it off because

248
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,960
 everyone will believe you that he wants a bigger name.

249
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,960
 Oh, that's true.

250
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,960
 Yeah.

251
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,960
 That's true.

252
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,360
 If Vandals showed up with a giant Donald J. Trump sign, no, no, we're going to put this

253
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,560
 one on after we take this one off.

254
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,560
 That's it.

255
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
 And then you're going to clear it.

256
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
 Everybody would leave you alone.

257
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,680
 This is the ultimate wearing blacks and carrying a ladder.

258
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,680
 See you tomorrow.

259
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,680
 Yeah.

260
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,680
 Right?

261
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,680
 And then, boom.

262
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,080
 I look forward to seeing this new, enormous Donald Trump sign tomorrow when I do my rounds.

263
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:46,360
 Oh, that security guard is going to be embarrassed.

264
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,520
 But he'll say, "They said they're going to put a bigger sign up."

265
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,520
 And everybody's like, "Ah, makes sense, Terry.

266
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,520
 So sorry, buddy."

267
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,480
 Oh, I would have fallen for it, too, Terry.

268
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,480
 That would have gotten me.

269
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,480
 That really sucks.

270
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,920
 And they were in like coveralls, huh?

271
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,080
 Oh, yeah, yeah, no, they were wearing coveralls.

272
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,940
 In hindsight, they definitely got those at Walmart, but they were, they looked really

273
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,940
 official.

274
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:13,360
 They had a wagon, a big wagon, a ladder.

275
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,440
 He said he was a big fan of that, that Kirk guy.

276
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:23,720
 I figured that just means he was okay.

277
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,040
 Paul wasn't our friend, Missoula pointed out that the Arizona Cardinals haven't won a game

278
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,200
 there since they did the Charlie Kirk Memorial.

279
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,400
 Yeah, that's, I mean...

280
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,880
 They've won away games, but not any home games.

281
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,720
 It's a unique way to look at it.

282
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,640
 The Cardinals aren't very good at football, so it's not the hardest thing to stretch the

283
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
 truth on.

284
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,640
 That's it.

285
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,640
 Yeah.

286
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:53,800
 But, Jacob, I saw that you had an actual vacation.

287
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:59,960
 I mean, in the sense that we went places out of town, it was a vacation.

288
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,600
 Oh, heavens, what happened?

289
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,520
 In the sense that it was relaxing in any way at all, it was not.

290
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,520
 Oh, no!

291
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,140
 It wasn't bad.

292
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,240
 It was just so fast paced.

293
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,580
 We went down south.

294
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,660
 We went all over the place.

295
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,840
 We flew into Austin, Texas.

296
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,840
 We saw some of Estre's family.

297
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
 There's your first mistake.

298
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
 Yeah, exactly.

299
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,560
 Saw some of Estre's family outside of Austin, went farther east in Texas and saw some more

300
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,520
 of her family and then drove to Louisiana and saw some of my family.

301
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,160
 And then we flew out of Jackson, Mississippi.

302
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,840
 So we did Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.

303
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,320
 Oh, goodness sakes, that's a lot.

304
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,320
 And I think we did it in four nights, five days.

305
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,320
 No, no, no.

306
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
 That's okay.

307
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,880
 But we saw the whole family, we had Christmas every day in a new location with the kids

308
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,280
 and the family members in that location.

309
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,480
 So it was really nice.

310
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,880
 It was a really nice trip.

311
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,200
 We were just fucking exhausted.

312
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:03,040
 One of the more embarrassing things that I've had to do happened on the flight back as well.

313
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,040
 Oh, no.

314
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,760
 Are we going to get into situational awareness territory?

315
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,880
 No, no, no, no.

316
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,880
 Thank goodness.

317
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,560
 That is not where I'm going.

318
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,480
 All of my pants are fine.

319
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,760
 All of my clothing is not in the garbage.

320
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,420
 It's just folded up.

321
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:25,200
 So we had a layover in Nashville and the Nashville airport, if you've never been through that

322
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,160
 in Nashville airport, it's really cool.

323
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:32,640
 They have a bunch of live music stations set up all over the place.

324
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,200
 Like in the gates and everything, they'll just have little stages ready for somebody

325
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,000
 with a guitar to sit there and sing some stuff into the microphone there.

326
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,320
 It's really nice.

327
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,880
 And so we were hanging out.

328
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,480
 They have an Ole Red, an Ole Red bar in the Nashville airport there.

329
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,040
 So we said, oh, we'll go get some dinner in Ole Red.

330
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,640
 We'll sit there and we'll listen to some music before we get on the flight back to old hometown

331
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,640
 Vegas.

332
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:03,240
 And so we're sitting there at the bar in the restaurant and we're listening to the live

333
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,240
 music.

334
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,240
 It's really good.

335
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,240
 It's really tender.

336
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,240
 Everybody's really nice.

337
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,480
 And this fella comes and sits down at the bar stool next to me, you know, asks if anybody's

338
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,480
 sitting there.

339
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,480
 I say, nope.

340
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,480
 And that is the extent of our interaction.

341
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,080
 I said, no, no, it's all you.

342
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,680
 I had a bag that was kind of in the way.

343
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,680
 So I moved from a bag.

344
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,080
 I said, no problem.

345
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,480
 You enjoy it.

346
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,040
 And then we sat there and we did not interact anymore for about an hour.

347
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:32,240
 And then he turned to me and he goes, so you're a podcaster, huh?

348
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,800
 And I went, yeah, yeah, I am.

349
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,440
 Yeah, that's right.

350
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,880
 And now we, I'm sitting there racking my brain, did SJ and I say anything?

351
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,520
 Like have we been talking about the podcast?

352
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,520
 I don't think we have.

353
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,240
 I don't think we've mentioned anything about any of it.

354
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,640
 Turns out he thought I was a different podcaster and just asked me if I was a podcaster and

355
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,280
 I said, yes.

356
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,840
 And then he realized that he was talking about a different person entirely that he thought

357
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,840
 that I was.

358
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,560
 There's a couple of us now.

359
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,800
 He thought that I was, uh, Theo Vaughn.

360
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,040
 Get the fuck out of here.

361
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,120
 I mean, I can see it.

362
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,160
 This man believed that I was a podcaster, Theo Vaughn, hilarious.

363
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,240
 At which point I had to explain to him that I was not Theo Vaughn, just a different middle

364
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,600
 aged white guy with a podcast.

365
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,600
 Right.

366
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,600
 Yeah.

367
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
 Did you give him a chip?

368
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
 Is that solves it all?

369
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
 Jacob.

370
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,600
 I didn't have a chip.

371
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
 I didn't have any bags with me.

372
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,200
 So I did not have a chip.

373
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,680
 But, uh, I believe that he is, I believe that he is a new scoop now.

374
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,680
 We did chat.

375
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
 We had a real nice chat.

376
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,680
 I hope so.

377
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,560
 Well, I keep, I think he said his name was Dave.

378
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,640
 So shout out Dave from old red at the, at the Nashville airport.

379
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,760
 I keep two chips in my wallet at all times.

380
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,120
 As last year, I don't carry a wallet.

381
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,920
 What the fuck is going on?

382
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,680
 I have like the little card holder that I keep in my front pocket.

383
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,680
 And that's it.

384
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,580
 Well, you wear jeans, right?

385
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,360
 With the little front Lippity upper to pocket.

386
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,360
 All right.

387
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
 Suppose I wear pants.

388
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,440
 Well, like a little Lippity up in a pocket, a chip fits perfectly in the Lippity up in

389
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,440
 her pocket.

390
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,300
 Two is great too.

391
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:14,760
 So I would just suggest tuck one in between cheek and gum for emergency situations.

392
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,320
 But, uh, well, good.

393
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,560
 I hope we did get a, uh, an obelisk off of that.

394
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,960
 I think I, I think I'm over the course of an hour, obelished one person.

395
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,960
 Great.

396
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,600
 We're not an efficient system that we're not.

397
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,840
 We're not an efficient system.

398
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:34,080
 I'll tell you who else does not have a very efficient system that they run on.

399
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,120
 Uh, and somehow they also base their entire business model off of it as well.

400
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,400
 And that is the following sponsor today's show.

401
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,960
 Man Manley's ice cream social is brought to you by the wearable blanket, a blanket with

402
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,560
 sleeves so you can nap better on your couch.

403
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,520
 That's from Smitty scoop in 2025.

404
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,680
 Hey everybody.

405
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,680
 It's me.

406
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,680
 What's up?

407
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
 I'm crunch.

408
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,160
 I'm here to advertise a wearable blanket.

409
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,240
 I don't know what I would like.

410
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,040
 I like a blanket with sleeves.

411
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,720
 It lets me eat my cereal and warmth and contentment and keeps me away from the soggies.

412
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,720
 Those motherfuckers.

413
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,800
 They're always ruining my fucking cereal.

414
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,880
 God damn it.

415
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,840
 Eat my own asshole all the way you soggy fucks.

416
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:22,600
 Now you can't get to me because I've got a wearable blanket on and if I drop my milk

417
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,240
 on me, it doesn't matter.

418
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,240
 Soggies can't get me.

419
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:32,640
 You know, the horrible thing about my existence is I can't live without the soggies and I

420
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,480
 need my milk on my cereal, but I hate them and they try to destroy me on my product at

421
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,720
 every turn.

422
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,560
 But they're a necessary evil if I want to have my cereal eaten.

423
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,560
 Oh boy.

424
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,520
 Look, catch 22.

425
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,120
 Fuck these bastards.

426
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,480
 I hate them all.

427
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,600
 If I catch them on the open seas, it's on International waters.

428
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,480
 I got love to see on my side, bitches.

429
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,120
 And that was how Captain Crunch became a pirate.

430
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,920
 Look at me, soggies.

431
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,120
 I'm a captain now.

432
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,880
 That's captain with an apostrophe in.

433
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:20,640
 S.J. had a show at the Silverton the other day.

434
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,480
 We had a fun Taylor Swift show the other night and a big free show.

435
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,960
 They did it as part of the rodeo and boy, was it fun watching all these little kids

436
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,800
 up there dancing around.

437
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,240
 It was so good.

438
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:40,200
 I was exhausted by the end of it, just running around talking to people, just kind of socially

439
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,560
 exhausted by the end of it.

440
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,560
 Sure.

441
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,560
 Walk through Silverton.

442
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,560
 There was a Johnny Rockets.

443
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,560
 Oh, yeah.

444
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,560
 Motherfucker.

445
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,560
 Did you want a chocolate shake?

446
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,560
 I was like, Johnny Rockets got the shakes.

447
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,720
 A Johnny Rockets shake.

448
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,280
 I'm going to go get me a Johnny Rockets shake.

449
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,440
 So I go up to the Johnny Rockets counter and say, I would like one chocolate shake to go

450
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,440
 please.

451
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,320
 Because everybody else was going over to a restaurant to go meet up after and I said,

452
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
 I'm going to go.

453
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,800
 I'm going to show up with a chocolate shake.

454
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,160
 I'm not eating anything.

455
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,240
 I'll have some beverages and my chocolate shake.

456
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,160
 This is going to be great.

457
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:19,120
 And the guy at the counter told me how much the shake was.

458
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,240
 And he said it was $13.22.

459
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,480
 What?

460
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,920
 $13.22.

461
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:29,680
 Where was this?

462
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,680
 The Johnny Rockets.

463
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,680
 Yes.

464
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,680
 In the Silverton casino.

465
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,320
 Oh my god damn.

466
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,680
 I mean McDonald's shakes are $5 now.

467
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:47,560
 I exclaimed for a moment and said, that is a very expensive chocolate shake.

468
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:53,200
 And then he handed it to me and I took a sip of it and that is very good.

469
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,240
 I don't know if it's $13 good though.

470
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,960
 And he said, well, he goes, it doesn't matter.

471
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,200
 You already paid for it.

472
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
 Oh Jesus.

473
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,200
 And I said, what?

474
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,160
 And you instantly tapped your phone on the thing because I was standing there thinking

475
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,160
 that I hadn't paid for it yet.

476
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,760
 And I had just completely spaced and without meaning to had just like just did my phone

477
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,400
 on the little card reader and be like, yep, there we go.

478
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:20,800
 You had a very, I was still complaining about the price having already paid for it.

479
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,800
 Yeah.

480
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,800
 Very pulp fiction moment there.

481
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
 Yeah.

482
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
 Yeah.

483
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,040
 And that was the $5 milkshake where everybody's like, what the fuck, $5 back then it was five

484
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,200
 at Jack rabbit slims.

485
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,200
 Holy shit.

486
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
 $5.

487
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
 That's outrageous.

488
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,200
 Yeah.

489
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:42,360
 Well, you know, the, uh, you know, being able to like bring, uh, uh, the dairy cows in Montana

490
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,320
 down cause of drought now and stuff like that, you know, milkshakes have gotten very expensive.

491
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,520
 Well, that's the fucked up thing within our lifetime and ain't getting cheaper for a milkshake.

492
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:57,960
 So drink them up now, boys, enjoy them, enjoy them now and chocolate cows are harder to move

493
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:05,640
 to.

494
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,400
 I did a corporate show in, uh, Sexton, Missouri.

495
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,280
 Oh, this is the, this is the one, right?

496
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,960
 Two hours outside of, uh, St. Louis.

497
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,640
 This was the, you had to jump away from your regular gig.

498
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,640
 Yeah.

499
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,640
 Got it all cleared.

500
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,640
 I had a load into Chicago.

501
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,320
 Do my first show in Chicago, pack up, go to the airport, fly to Missouri to show Missouri

502
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:32,640
 pack up, fly back to Chicago, load in again and finish up my run in Chicago.

503
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,800
 This was pound of flesh.

504
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,480
 This was not, uh, not going to be easy as per your management.

505
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,480
 Yes.

506
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,000
 Possibly this was for drunken businessman was the pitch.

507
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,320
 It was, and it was not that I, that it was, it was mispitched that way.

508
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,320
 Okay.

509
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,480
 Cause they, the guy that booked you told you this was going to be blood money.

510
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,480
 Yes.

511
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,880
 This was going to be a real pain in the ass.

512
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:04,720
 Um, it was, it was, it was a Christmas party for, uh, a company that specializes in like,

513
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,440
 um, uh, basically like a gas tank, uh, compatibility.

514
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,240
 So whether you have like ethanol or butane or whatever, like, uh, it basically is like

515
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,160
 a, a tank company, like different types of gas tank company.

516
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,160
 There was a family Christmas party, so it was all the workers and their husbands and

517
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:29,880
 wives, uh, and it was held inside that paintball, uh, place, uh, like kind of like amusement

518
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,880
 park area.

519
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:38,840
 This town, this town was small, like it drove through town, no, no lights, no traffic lights,

520
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:44,980
 you know, no sidewalks, you know, uh, literally had one gas pump or like the gas station had

521
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,980
 one pump.

522
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,980
 Oh shit.

523
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:52,120
 So, uh, it was, uh, you know, like that's a small town.

524
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,160
 The firehouse had like a little Christmas tree outside of it decorated, you know, that's,

525
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,040
 that's the little activity scene.

526
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:05,120
 That's the, that's it's Christmas time and, uh, inside it did, it had, it had, you know,

527
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,040
 uh, you know, everything's for a dollar else.

528
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,560
 The freshmen stand at the, at the, uh, it wasn't open.

529
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,660
 I was there for a closed event, but you know, like I was like, oh, they still sell sodas

530
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,480
 and water for a dollar and snacks for a dollar in places.

531
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,480
 That's cute.

532
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,440
 It was very nice.

533
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,440
 Yeah.

534
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:29,000
 Um, but no, uh, they, uh, they just don't go to shows often.

535
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Right.

536
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,400
 So the idea of like putting on a show was just something that was kind of like, okay.

537
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,320
 Now the funny thing that happened was the woman who was supposed to do my intro, like

538
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,960
 she went over all the intro with me and I was like, yep, that's the intro.

539
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,780
 And then, uh, they had to show a video and then break down the screen and take everything

540
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:55,660
 off stage to make room for me, uh, after the intro, well, this is it.

541
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,000
 So I thought my intro would be after the breakdown of the screen.

542
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 Oh no.

543
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,040
 The video finishes and she just calls from the, from the audience, not from stage, from

544
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,040
 the audience.

545
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,040
 Just turn to the microphone.

546
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,720
 It goes, uh, the man of the hour, Matt Donnelly.

547
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,720
 Just like that.

548
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,720
 Yeah.

549
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:19,640
 Man of the hour, the man of the, the, the event was there to honor you.

550
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,280
 You didn't know this.

551
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,280
 That's what I mean.

552
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:27,600
 Like man of the honor, as you're like, Oh, uh, I don't know, a man of the honor, like

553
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,600
 man of the hour.

554
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:35,760
 I mean, like what, like we're not there for me, his retirement from magic.

555
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,000
 This is his last show.

556
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 Everyone.

557
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,640
 Mr. Matt Donnelly, the mind noodler, that's the, that's the comedian coming up and go,

558
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,360
 you guys ready to laugh?

559
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,360
 Yeah, exactly.

560
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,360
 Exactly.

561
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,080
 Oh my, what a great prank.

562
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,800
 How about some fantastic jokes, everybody.

563
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,240
 It's giggle time.

564
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,240
 If we gathered everyone, Matt, take your ear, take your earphones out.

565
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,240
 Okay.

566
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,240
 All right.

567
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,240
 So here's what we're going to do.

568
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,880
 We're going to, we're going to gather everyone that has been important in Matt's life and

569
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,740
 in his professional career.

570
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:09,480
 And we're just going to put together a last retirement show for Matt, but he's not going

571
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,480
 to know about it.

572
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,480
 We're just going to hire him.

573
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,440
 He's going to come in, it's going to be billed as Matt Donnelly, the mind noodlers last show.

574
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,440
 That's the way to go.

575
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,440
 People are going to get speeches.

576
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,440
 It's going to be great.

577
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,000
 Lonnie Hammelgren out in Vegas, the brain surgeon.

578
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 Oh yeah.

579
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,360
 He had a crazy house that you could tour for a while.

580
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:32,160
 I got to go one time just, you know, no, nothing even remotely close to an HOA.

581
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:39,320
 He had crazy shit in there and he planned and held his own funeral and you want to hear

582
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,320
 what people said about it.

583
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,440
 Fuck yeah.

584
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,680
 And I think he's still kicking.

585
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,360
 He did this several years ago and he's still alive.

586
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,440
 So I believe so.

587
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,440
 Yeah.

588
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,440
 So good for him.

589
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,440
 Yeah.

590
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,360
 Uh, I guess that's what Matt's going to do to Matt, but it's good, but he's not going

591
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,360
 to know about it.

592
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,800
 It'd be great if Richard was a, ladies and gentlemen, the man who will do about an hour,

593
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
 Matt Donnelly.

594
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
 Yeah.

595
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,800
 Yeah.

596
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,800
 That's what you needed.

597
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,800
 The man who promised to do an hour comfortable for an hour ish.

598
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
 It's Matt.

599
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,840
 It's that uncomfortable intro.

600
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,520
 How did things pick up during the show?

601
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,440
 Well, I had to wait for them to break down the stage.

602
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,720
 Oh, they weren't done.

603
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,720
 No.

604
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,120
 So the video finishes, she introduces me.

605
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,520
 This is great.

606
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,520
 This is great.

607
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,000
 Three or four minutes of total silence as they break down the screen and move everything

608
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,320
 off of the stage.

609
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:33,080
 Well, you can't start your final show while they're still breaking down, right?

610
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,440
 This is the way you do it, man.

611
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,440
 You ice them.

612
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,440
 Yeah.

613
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,440
 Ice them cold.

614
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,960
 And I literally just went over to the side of the stage where she had moved to and said,

615
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,560
 "Are you going to introduce me now?"

616
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,560
 Again?

617
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,560
 Yeah.

618
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:52,840
 She goes, "Oh, no, just no."

619
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
 Just go.

620
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,840
 Just do it.

621
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,840
 And I go, "But that's it."

622
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,840
 So I go, "So then I go out on stage right now and just start."

623
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,840
 She goes, "Ah."

624
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,840
 You just want me to do it.

625
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,840
 Yeah.

626
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,840
 Yeah.

627
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,840
 Yeah.

628
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,840
 Yep.

629
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,840
 Yep.

630
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,840
 Perfect.

631
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,720
 Perfect.

632
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,960
 One gas tank, everybody.

633
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:18,720
 I went out and I started the show, and honestly, people weren't heckling me.

634
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,760
 A lot of people were like, "No, I don't want to go on stage," which is annoying.

635
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,760
 Sure.

636
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,760
 Okay.

637
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,640
 And it wasn't like a lot of people were clapping.

638
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,640
 A lot of people were laughing.

639
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,640
 I was getting to my stuff.

640
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,280
 It just felt like I was doing one magic trick after another.

641
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,280
 It didn't feel like a show.

642
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,280
 Do you know what I mean?

643
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,280
 Yeah.

644
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,280
 I got you.

645
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,280
 I was like, "I'm just going to keep going."

646
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,280
 And I got another one.

647
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,280
 There was another Diddy.

648
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,280
 How many were in the room?

649
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,280
 Yeah.

650
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,260
 I hate that your last show was that bad.

651
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,260
 About 150.

652
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,260
 About 150.

653
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,260
 Okay.

654
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,260
 Yeah.

655
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:50,280
 But I went out doing what I loved, and I had to call Chicago Magic Lounge and say, "Sorry,

656
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,280
 this is it.

657
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,800
 This is it."

658
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,760
 How did the trip out to the random gig went well and everything?

659
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,800
 There were no hiccups in the travel?

660
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,800
 Funny.

661
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,280
 You should ask.

662
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,760
 I get there, and I take my little shuttle to ... Okay.

663
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:12,160
 So do you have any ... What is your tactics for renting a car when you travel, Jacob?

664
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,100
 I usually pre-book before we get there.

665
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:20,760
 If I can check in before getting to the rental car place, if I'm able to check in before

666
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,080
 getting to the desk, then I will.

667
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:30,120
 And hopefully there is just a key pickup spot somewhere, or the keys are in the car, and

668
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,400
 we load up, get in the car, and head right out.

669
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,480
 This is where I need to get more savvy.

670
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:43,120
 I'm not good at figuring out how to be one of the guys that walks past the counter directly

671
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,080
 to where the cars are.

672
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,600
 The only tactics I have been using, and this used to be very successful, and now it's not,

673
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,960
 and I'll tell you why.

674
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,880
 I used to book the third or fourth cheapest option, because it's usually a difference

675
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,880
 of $5.

676
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,040
 So I would choose that because basically sometimes there's a rush at one rental car counter

677
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,720
 when you get there and the line's out the door.

678
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:13,780
 And so I always book the third or fourth cheapest rental car, because usually that means I won't

679
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,520
 be on that same line.

680
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:23,040
 And this used to be a successful tactic until now ... This happened with Paul and I when

681
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:29,100
 we went to Jersey, and this happened now when I came here, all these rental car companies

682
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,520
 are now just run by the same people.

683
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:37,920
 When you get to the counter, everybody works for all three rental car places at that counter.

684
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,920
 Right.

685
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:43,880
 Like Budget, Thrifty, and Avis, I think are all the same company.

686
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,320
 They're all just ... No, there's no merger.

687
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:52,920
 They're just running the ... Yeah, it's just like the guy at the desk at Thrifty, if there's

688
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,740
 nobody at the desk at Budget and he doesn't have anybody in line at Thrifty, he just stands

689
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,700
 up and moves over to the desk at Budget.

690
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,200
 It's budget cuts.

691
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,680
 So he's only getting paid one salary and working three jobs.

692
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,680
 That's right.

693
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,760
 Fuck man.

694
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:12,120
 I don't know how that guy is being paid, but yes, he's definitely working three jobs.

695
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,360
 He might be making $700,000 a year.

696
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,360
 I don't know.

697
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,360
 I'm guessing not.

698
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,360
 Probably not.

699
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:23,800
 If I made $700,000 in one year working for a rental car company, you would never see

700
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,560
 me at the rental car company again.

701
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,560
 Yeah.

702
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,560
 That would be it.

703
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,840
 I'd be there until they figured it out.

704
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,840
 Are you kidding me?

705
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,840
 This guy.

706
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,840
 This guy.

707
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,920
 This guy's been working here for 28 years.

708
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,400
 He is a rivaling Elon Musk and his billionaire status.

709
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,040
 Jacob has a higher threshold for pain than I ever will.

710
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:47,760
 If I saw $700,000 in my bank account today, I would disappear.

711
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,760
 Disappear.

712
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,760
 Poof.

713
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,760
 Gone.

714
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,760
 Without a trace.

715
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,600
 I'd keep doing this show.

716
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,640
 This is where we find out that Paul and I are different people.

717
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,720
 Fair enough.

718
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,120
 So I get there and the line is out the door.

719
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:11,720
 I am the 40th person in line and there's two people working there.

720
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,880
 One guy's wearing a Santa Claus hat to be festive because it's a Christmas weekend.

721
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,960
 I was like, "Yeah, it's a freaking Christmas weekend.

722
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,560
 Maybe I have more than two people at the rental car counter, huh?"

723
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,560
 For sure.

724
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,560
 No.

725
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,680
 He's like, "Absolutely not."

726
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:35,700
 So I am nervous because I'm supposed to be there at four, and I didn't account for an

727
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,720
 hour of waiting for the car.

728
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,120
 No.

729
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:45,440
 I sarcastically brought up Netflix on my phone and started watching the new Knives Out movie

730
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,480
 being like, "I'll never get through this."

731
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,480
 Because it's 240.

732
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
 That's a long...

733
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,480
 And I was like...

734
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,480
 Because I basically was like...

735
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,480
 So I was timing each person.

736
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,720
 I was really getting myself really angry and anxious, and I was like, "I need to check

737
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,720
 out.

738
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:05,000
 I need to be gone, and podcasts are not doing it because I'm still looking around."

739
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,280
 So I started watching Knives Out.

740
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,960
 It took me an hour and 15 minutes to get my car.

741
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,960
 That's a bit of a wait.

742
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
 Holy shit.

743
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,800
 It took me an hour and 15 minutes to get my car.

744
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,120
 That's a wait, baby.

745
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,120
 That's crazy.

746
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,120
 Yeah.

747
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,120
 It was maddening.

748
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,120
 It was really maddening.

749
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,120
 And what airport was this?

750
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,120
 St. Louis.

751
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,880
 It's a major airport.

752
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,880
 It's a major airport.

753
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,320
 Not the smallest little podunk airport that you've ever seen in your life, yeah.

754
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,320
 No.

755
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,320
 And like...

756
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,320
 It's because it's run by those St. Lunatics.

757
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,320
 That's right.

758
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:43,000
 And, you know, they had enough desks for eight people to work.

759
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,880
 Well, that's it, Matt.

760
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,560
 They spent all their money on desks.

761
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,400
 They can't get desks and employees.

762
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
 I got through an hour.

763
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,800
 Someone's asked me if I finished the film.

764
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,880
 I haven't finished it yet.

765
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,840
 It seems to be the better one of the Knives Out movies.

766
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,440
 It seems to be like the best one.

767
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,440
 Really?

768
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,440
 Oh!

769
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,440
 We should watch it at Scoop Fest.

770
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:13,360
 For people who don't remember, we tried that at a Scoop Fest one time.

771
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,360
 Didn't work well.

772
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,360
 No.

773
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,360
 We did a different...

774
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,360
 We had Murder on the Orient Express.

775
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,720
 It was my call and it was the wrong call.

776
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,160
 It was your call, but we were all excited about it.

777
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,320
 You had the idea, but all three of us were very excited about it.

778
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,320
 Yeah.

779
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,160
 And it was a bad idea.

780
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,160
 Yeah.

781
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:36,360
 Anyways, I ended up getting late to the gig, which is not great, but it ended up being

782
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,360
 fine.

783
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:42,680
 We had rental car trouble in Austin as well, but different type of rental car trouble.

784
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,080
 We breezed through the line.

785
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,320
 That wasn't an issue.

786
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:50,560
 We got in the car and went to drive away, and SJ was driving, and she goes, "Oh, there's

787
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:56,400
 a tire pressure warning light on."

788
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:02,040
 And sure enough, the passenger front tire, according to the car, was supposed to be 38

789
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:10,360
 pounds per square inch, 38 PSI, and it was at 16 or 17.

790
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,360
 It was quite low.

791
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,760
 It was quite low.

792
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,880
 Whoa.

793
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:20,440
 So we went back into the office, and we're like, "Hey, the car has a low tire light on

794
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,440
 it.

795
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,920
 You all want to do something about that?"

796
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,640
 And she said, "Shit, you not."

797
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:30,160
 She goes, "Oh, well, you can feel free to fill that up at like a gas station or something

798
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:40,360
 after you get the car out, but if the tire has a leak in it, then I'm in more trouble

799
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,360
 than I am now."

800
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:45,040
 She was like, "Oh, it's just the cold weather."

801
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,260
 I was like, "No, no, no, the cold weather knocks it down like five or six or seven PSI.

802
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,640
 This is like 20."

803
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,600
 The possible flat.

804
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,120
 Yeah, like it might just be going flat.

805
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,280
 If you're telling me it's fine and just need some air in it, then put some air in it and

806
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,880
 I'll take it out and I guess we'll deal with it, but we were going out into the country

807
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,760
 to visit my in-laws.

808
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,600
 I'm not trying to have a flat tire out in the fucking woods somewhere.

809
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,600
 No.

810
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:20,160
 So finally, they go, "Well, you can do a ..." Because we had paid for it with points.

811
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:25,680
 So we had gotten the premium level car or whatever.

812
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:32,280
 And so she goes, "Oh, well, you can take this other, basically just the low level, the budget

813
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,280
 car."

814
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,280
 We were like, "Oh, well, okay.

815
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,880
 That's fine, but do we get a refund on ..." No, no, there's no refunds.

816
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,160
 And so that just went back and forth for a while.

817
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,940
 And finally, I was like, "Just ..." Because she goes, "Oh, well, you can cancel the reservation

818
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,940
 as well."

819
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,940
 Oh, boy.

820
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,240
 What do you mean we're here?

821
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,240
 We have to have a car.

822
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,400
 I'm waiting here to see where you can get me a car with all four tires.

823
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,400
 That's all.

824
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,200
 I was like, "You guys don't have an air compressor?

825
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,080
 You don't have just somebody that can come out and put air in the tire and check the

826
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,080
 tires?"

827
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,080
 You would think someone does a check, right?

828
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,560
 Don't they do a check on the cars as they're cleaning them up and whatnot?

829
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,920
 Yes.

830
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:14,920
 And then she goes, "Oh, well, we can get you a different car, but it's going to be a big

831
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,920
 car."

832
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,920
 And they finally give us a nice ... A big car?

833
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,920
 Like a Tahoe.

834
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,560
 Oh, that's a big car.

835
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,640
 Something that if the three of us were going somewhere and I had rented a car and I rented

836
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,240
 this, at least one of the two of you would be like, "Jacob, why did you rent such a big

837
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,240
 fucking car just for the three of us?"

838
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,240
 Yeah, we'd be laughing.

839
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

840
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,240
 Exactly.

841
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,240
 Yeah, yeah.

842
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,600
 This was like eight people could fit in this thing plus luggage, and yeah, it was stupid.

843
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,920
 It was very nice though.

844
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,520
 Or you can have whatever's in this box and just put this box up on there, give it a tap.

845
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,280
 Or you're going to ride on this goat.

846
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,440
 Ride this goat all the way through the country, it knows the way.

847
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,440
 Ride this goat!

848
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,440
 Ride that goat!

849
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:57,120
 And when you open the box, there's just a dildo inside that said, "Go fuck yourself."

850
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,120
 Woo!

851
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,120
 Oh, boy.

852
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:03,400
 It was such a pain.

853
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,680
 It was so weird, and we were both on no sleep at all.

854
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:10,480
 I think I had slept for maybe an hour and a half the night before, and SJ was on literally

855
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,480
 no sleep.

856
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,480
 What a load of baloney.

857
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:19,520
 I'm just standing there in this car rental office with that sleep-deprived confusion.

858
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,520
 Yeah.

859
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,520
 Yes.

860
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:27,280
 I'm like, "No, I don't understand why we don't have a car and why we aren't leaving

861
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,280
 already.

862
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:33,520
 We have so many cars here, and the one you gave us has a flat tire."

863
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,520
 So dumb.

864
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,520
 What?

865
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,520
 So dumb.

866
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:42,520
 And then when she goes, "Oh, you can take this Tahoe," and I go, "Great," and they

867
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:49,040
 tell us the parking spot, and we go out to it, and there is a large Tahoe-type SUV in

868
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,600
 the parking spot, but it says Denali on it.

869
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,040
 And so I was like, "Well, is that a Tahoe?

870
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,520
 I don't know if Denali is a Tahoe."

871
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:03,280
 And so I go back in, and I was like, "Hey, the thing in the spot there, it looks like

872
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,440
 a Tahoe, but it says Denali on it."

873
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,920
 And she goes, "Yeah, that's the type of Tahoe it is.

874
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,920
 It's a Denali.

875
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,920
 It's a nice one."

876
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,920
 Oh, okay.

877
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,920
 I was like, "Okay."

878
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,920
 I was just asking.

879
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,440
 I was making sure we were taking the right fucking car.

880
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,800
 Don't yell at me.

881
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:25,400
 She went back to blowing up your other tire by my mouth, like a clown with a balloon animal,

882
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,400
 just like ...

883
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,400
 I will tell you-

884
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,920
 That's a living.

885
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:36,800
 I will tell you one of the things that I do really love about living out here in old Western

886
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,040
 PA.

887
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,680
 I can drive to the Sheetz gas station.

888
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,720
 I can pull up next to an air compressor machine.

889
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:50,000
 I can push that baby to where I want it to go pressure-wise.

890
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,440
 I can stick that tube on my tire and go and then be done, all for fucking free.

891
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,440
 Done.

892
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,960
 None of this charging bullshit.

893
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,960
 My God.

894
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,960
 I had-

895
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:07,040
 Then Paul pulls out his dick and pisses all over it so that no one else will be able to

896
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,040
 enjoy it.

897
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:14,040
 I had to have three different locations in Vegas because either someone would rip the

898
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,520
 fucking nozzle off and steal the copper-

899
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,080
 Gas uses are a disaster here.

900
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,080
 They really are.

901
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,080
 Yeah.

902
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:28,320
 Or they would tear up the e-reader so you couldn't use the machine or it was only quarters.

903
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:33,600
 The only place you ever still had to use quarters was that fucking air compressing machine.

904
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:38,000
 Of course, as I always said when you did live here, I said, "Paul, when you're at my house,

905
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 just tell me.

906
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,960
 I own an air compressor and we can put air in your tires."

907
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,160
 Never did that though.

908
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,160
 We never did.

909
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,160
 Just carried around quarters.

910
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,160
 We never did.

911
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,400
 I just kept carrying around quarters because it doesn't happen when I-

912
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,560
 When he goes to the Sheetz, he finishes off with a happy ending.

913
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,120
 He suitcases it at the very end.

914
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,560
 There's a little- right at the keister.

915
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,560
 Just wakes it up.

916
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,560
 Yeah.

917
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,560
 Just wakes it up a little bit.

918
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,560
 I offered that.

919
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,560
 I offered that.

920
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,560
 He didn't take me up on it.

921
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,000
 My happy ending at the Sheetz is a fountain drink for Anne.

922
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,920
 That's what that is.

923
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,800
 She loves a Sheetz fountain drink.

924
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,800
 I can't blame her.

925
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,800
 They're quite good.

926
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,980
 I got to take a Sheetz fountain drink to Anne McFeeters.

927
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,520
 You better have a poncho on.

928
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,680
 I got some diet Pepsi fountain drink for her the other day.

929
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:28,080
 It was primo, top notch.

930
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,600
 Sheetz is pretty good.

931
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,440
 I got to give a shout out to Anne.

932
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,440
 Poor thing.

933
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,440
 She's trying to get home.

934
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,460
 She's supposed to be off today.

935
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:39,760
 She worked a 14 hour day yesterday.

936
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,760
 She's supposed to be off today.

937
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,360
 She's been at work since six o'clock.

938
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,160
 It's a nightmare.

939
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:51,000
 People just keep calling off and she's too good to not just let the place burn in hell.

940
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,440
 It's not something terrible happening, it's just people calling out and just calling a

941
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,440
 schedule type stuff.

942
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,440
 Yeah, it's bullshit.

943
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,440
 It's bullshit.

944
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,440
 Yeah.

945
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,440
 But she's supposed to be off.

946
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,440
 But anyway.

947
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,440
 It's not like the milk frothing machine is raging out of control or anything like that.

948
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,440
 Nothing like that.

949
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,440
 Nothing terrible.

950
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,400
 But she's been putting out fires for weeks now and it's just a bunch of bullshit and

951
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,960
 I hope things clear up soon.

952
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,720
 I'm going to give a shout out to the people of Chicago.

953
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,800
 I had a blast at Chicago Magic Lounge this weekend.

954
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,200
 I had really fun shows.

955
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,200
 It was really great.

956
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,400
 I love Chicago audiences.

957
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,400
 I always have.

958
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,320
 It was before Magic, it just took improv in Chicago.

959
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,600
 I just have always loved doing shows in Chicago.

960
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,240
 Good theater town.

961
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,340
 And good entertainment town.

962
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,840
 They know how to behave in a show.

963
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:42,000
 I went to a show where a guy was just messing up and I was starting to get frustrated in

964
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,440
 a way that everyone thought was funny.

965
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:50,240
 He was on a really hard time giving me straight answers and then finally I did the whole think

966
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,840
 of any animal and he said, I want to go see that.

967
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,840
 He goes, what is he?

968
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,840
 He goes, seven.

969
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,840
 What was it?

970
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,840
 Was he on something?

971
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,840
 Was he just playing?

972
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,760
 Was he just pulling your leg?

973
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,080
 He was not sober.

974
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,080
 He was not sober.

975
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,080
 Okay.

976
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:10,760
 But this is when I love Chicago audiences where I go like, what is happening?

977
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,760
 What world are we living in?

978
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,760
 Did I enter a vortex?

979
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,520
 You know, whatever.

980
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,240
 And I just turned and I was like, I got to find somebody else and I was like, you, what's

981
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,240
 your name?

982
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,240
 He's like, Dan.

983
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:27,880
 I was like, Dan, are you an asshole?

984
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,440
 And everyone laughs, including the guy.

985
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,440
 Yeah.

986
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,440
 The guy goes, I don't think so.

987
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,440
 And I go, good.

988
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,440
 Name any animal.

989
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,440
 And he's like, squirrel.

990
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,440
 Good.

991
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,440
 Good.

992
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,440
 I did boom.

993
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,440
 Pulled out a fish as a squirrel.

994
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,360
 And I said, just see how hard that is.

995
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:49,920
 It's so good though, when the, when the drunk guy laughs along, he goes like, I'm sorry.

996
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,360
 And I was trying to explain this as I got through the whole weekend with Mike Mills

997
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,360
 and Mike Mills.

998
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,360
 I'm about to go out with jokers of magic.

999
00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:00,160
 And as I explained to him, I was like, you know, my clips that do best on my Instagram

1000
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,800
 feed and stuff like that and tick tock and all that stuff are ones where I am frustrated.

1001
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,720
 And the problem is the comments in the thing are some of them are like, boy, this guy's

1002
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,720
 an asshole.

1003
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,720
 Right?

1004
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,720
 Right.

1005
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,720
 And it's hard to explain.

1006
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,720
 It's like, no, no, no.

1007
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,720
 Like from your family.

1008
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:25,720
 And I was like, you know, the firehouse could still use volunteers and

1009
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,140
 like everybody was laughing.

1010
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:30,040
 I was frustrated, but jokingly frustrated.

1011
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,600
 Like I was playing it up.

1012
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,600
 Right.

1013
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,280
 And the whole audience was laughing, including the guy who I was messing with the whole time.

1014
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,280
 You know, right.

1015
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,280
 Oh, it's the best.

1016
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,640
 And I was like, but, but if that clip on social media, like they just be like this magicians

1017
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,200
 being a dickhead.

1018
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,200
 And so it's really hard.

1019
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,960
 Even the one that's the most famous for the more is really busting the guy's ball and

1020
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,760
 threatening to leave and that kind of stuff.

1021
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,960
 We hung out after that show and talked for 20 minutes.

1022
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,280
 We, we, we, he was happy, he was happy, you know, he was happy with his show experience.

1023
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,280
 Yeah.

1024
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,280
 And so it's just hard.

1025
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,280
 It's just hard.

1026
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,280
 But I had a blast in Chicago.

1027
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,520
 It is always weird.

1028
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:07,000
 I see, I see people doing this, not just on your social media, but on many of my friends,

1029
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,640
 me and my performer friends, social media, people will critique the, you know, eight

1030
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,240
 seconds of performance that they saw on this slip.

1031
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,720
 I'm like, guys, this is not, I know it's hard.

1032
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,720
 This is not what this is.

1033
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,560
 And on the other hand, I'm going to put it out, right?

1034
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,960
 Like it's really, it's really hard.

1035
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,960
 It's difficult.

1036
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,440
 I can't pitch too much because I scoop is making the announcement.

1037
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:29,560
 That guy is Matt's apprentice now.

1038
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,040
 I do the bit, uh, scooping over glass.

1039
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,680
 If I do a six, seven joke, I had it in my show briefly because I always say what's our

1040
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,840
 connection on the scale of one to 10.

1041
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:43,000
 I pull a number out of my pocket and I can pull it out and it's six, seven.

1042
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,800
 It's a really polarizing, polarizing joke.

1043
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,320
 It's a polarizing joke.

1044
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,320
 Some people really love it.

1045
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,120
 And some people go like, Oh God.

1046
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,880
 And then I hate that.

1047
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,720
 It's the devil makes my children say that.

1048
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:01,200
 And the risk is that I look like an old guy trying to look hip.

1049
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,920
 That's why I do it.

1050
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,280
 I was about to ask if you like that joke.

1051
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,280
 I could give a shit.

1052
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,280
 Cause I don't.

1053
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,280
 Cause yeah, exactly.

1054
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,640
 I mean, you don't care about that joke.

1055
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:14,400
 No, look, I got soccer jerseys made for my kid and for this Christmas tournament.

1056
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,560
 And uh, uh, uh, boy, we didn't talk about that.

1057
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,800
 Did we end up, no, we didn't talk about your kids, Christmas soccer tournament, the three

1058
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,800
 on three.

1059
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,800
 Oh, I feel bad.

1060
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,800
 Cause I'm one.

1061
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:24,800
 I don't know if everyone listens here.

1062
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,680
 This is a Penn Sunday school, but I have this conversation at Penn Sunday school, but you

1063
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,680
 guys react quickly.

1064
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,680
 Then Penn does everything.

1065
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,680
 So it's, it's fine by me.

1066
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:35,240
 Uh, but I got shirts made up for it, you know, my brother designed a logo for the jingle

1067
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:43,440
 ballers and uh, I had everyone's Jersey number six, seven, uh, and uh, every kid was loving

1068
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:48,040
 as we walked by in our shirts with a six, seven, because I was amongst children and

1069
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,840
 that's what the joke is for.

1070
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:50,840
 Yes.

1071
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:55,560
 Um, but uh, uh, yeah, so in the show, I don't do it cause it just looks like I could look

1072
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,880
 like an old guy trying to look hip and that that's dumb.

1073
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,120
 And it also slows things down.

1074
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:04,220
 It's a, it eats the cause it's the number joke is a quick bit that leads to the fish

1075
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:05,500
 reveal.

1076
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,500
 So it kind of really clunks it up rhythm wise if it takes up to say, cause then you have

1077
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,800
 to get back and do the actual joke and then yeah, yeah, yeah.

1078
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,720
 So it, it reads as a recovery and that's not funny.

1079
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:25,960
 But uh, yeah, guys, hey, uh, uh, you are talking to a now retired soccer coach, uh, just in

1080
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:26,960
 and out.

1081
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:32,000
 I, uh, you know, I, I gotta, I gotta go out on top, you know, you're going out on top,

1082
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
 huh?

1083
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,520
 Uh, look, let's just say mistakes were made, uh, for the three on three.

1084
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,520
 Yes.

1085
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,480
 Did, did the, uh, did the athletes on the field not follow your instructions to, uh,

1086
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,340
 the point that they should have, uh, thus losing the game, uh, via no fault of yours

1087
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,340
 coach?

1088
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:53,760
 No, it's not even, we're not even like, we're not even, it's not even, I wish, I wish that

1089
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,760
 was the problem.

1090
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,020
 Oh no.

1091
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:00,040
 The mistake I made was you could check a box, you either be recreational team or competitive

1092
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,040
 team.

1093
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,400
 Oh, okay.

1094
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,400
 You check competitive.

1095
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,400
 Correct.

1096
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,720
 Cause my kids have been playing together for seven years and they had a really good coach

1097
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,160
 and they're going on.

1098
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:17,000
 And so we go off our first game and we crushed the other team, five, nothing like really,

1099
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 really great.

1100
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
 Like great.

1101
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
 We're riding high.

1102
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
 We're feeling good.

1103
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 Sounds like Donnelly's on the sideline.

1104
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
 You're guys.

1105
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
 I checked the competitive box.

1106
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,640
 How come you're not bringing me competitive teams and even the old coach whose kid is

1107
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,680
 on our team showed up and he was like, Hey, maybe we'll do a barbecue at my house when

1108
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:32,680
 this is all over.

1109
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,280
 Like we're feeling good.

1110
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,000
 All right.

1111
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 It's an all day event.

1112
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,280
 So we've got to wait like an hour and change between each game and the next game we go

1113
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,280
 up against the games.

1114
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,080
 The games are really quick games are like 12, 12 minute halves.

1115
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,960
 Uh, the whole thing's over an hour.

1116
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:48,960
 Yeah.

1117
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:49,960
 Oh, that's fun.

1118
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:50,960
 Oh, okay.

1119
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:51,960
 Yeah.

1120
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:52,960
 Yeah.

1121
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:59,120
 And so you do first thing first batch around Robbins and then you do a semi-final and

1122
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,880
 final of the best teams from the round Robin.

1123
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,240
 Okay.

1124
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:10,360
 So then we go up against, uh, a team that is the, uh, yeah, it's, it's, it's the split

1125
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:14,640
 team of the traveling team in town, like the main traveling team in town split into different

1126
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:20,840
 teams and we're playing one of the, one of the very Brazilian national team.

1127
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:25,520
 They beat us eight nothing and, uh, and it was hard.

1128
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,520
 They scored fast.

1129
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:31,000
 They're, they're up for nothing like very fast and same age as, as your team.

1130
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
 Right?

1131
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
 Yeah.

1132
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,240
 Same ages, same ages, but just, you know, these are guys are practicing year round three

1133
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,240
 times a week.

1134
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,240
 They're going at it.

1135
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,240
 They're going at it.

1136
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,240
 Yeah.

1137
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,240
 Yeah.

1138
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,240
 Playing well or playing dirty.

1139
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:44,440
 Uh, oh, uh, so good point, Paul.

1140
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:49,160
 So it turns out we play in the rec league when you play club team, it turns out a physical

1141
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:56,480
 contact is not a refereed as closely as recreation rec, a lot of shoving and a competitive, uh,

1142
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,840
 uh, uh, travel teams.

1143
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,640
 They allows, they allow a lot more contact.

1144
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,640
 So yes, indeed.

1145
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,000
 My kids are actually getting pushed around and then it's hard to watch.

1146
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,080
 That's what I figured.

1147
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,080
 And they want to complain.

1148
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,240
 And I'm saying like, he got to just play through it.

1149
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,240
 Right.

1150
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,780
 Now here's the problem.

1151
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:13,560
 This whole thing, you can't do that in, you can't do that mid game.

1152
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,520
 You can't, you can't shift that, that thought process.

1153
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,520
 No, no, no.

1154
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:20,760
 And that's why I know this like my only thing is I just try to like not raise my voice and

1155
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:21,760
 just like, we got to keep playing.

1156
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,760
 We got to keep going.

1157
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,520
 All you can do is be the calm example at that point.

1158
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:32,920
 This whole thing was because my youngest kid had a nightmare soccer season because what

1159
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:36,920
 happens when you play rec is that the, the, whatever core group you have will stay together,

1160
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:41,800
 but you always don't have, you know, it's rare to have like 12 core group people.

1161
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:48,200
 And so you get five or six new kids each season and this particular season, my kid got a bunch

1162
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:53,640
 of kids who didn't show up one kid like broke his arm and like, uh, and we just lost.

1163
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,440
 So we were playing luckily at soccer.

1164
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,440
 So you don't need your arm.

1165
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,360
 We were playing short handed the entire season.

1166
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,000
 My son had to play the entire game of every game.

1167
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
 That's right.

1168
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
 Yeah.

1169
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
 Yeah.

1170
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
 He was just out there all the time.

1171
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
 Yeah.

1172
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
 And sometimes one kid short.

1173
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,600
 So they're getting their butts kicked by, by, by playing, you know, seven on six or

1174
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,600
 whatever.

1175
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,600
 Right.

1176
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,600
 Yeah.

1177
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:18,080
 And so I just want to one last fun event for these kids to like not have it so hard and

1178
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,760
 then I've marched them into a buzz saw.

1179
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:21,760
 Yeah.

1180
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,840
 You should have gone home after the first game.

1181
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,840
 Exactly.

1182
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:26,840
 We should just, well, we won.

1183
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,640
 We should have a barbecue.

1184
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,640
 Let's go.

1185
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,640
 Yeah.

1186
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:31,640
 Barbecue sounds great.

1187
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,640
 That's the plan.

1188
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:37,040
 So because we beat that other shitty team, five, nothing, we get extra points higher.

1189
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,040
 Yes.

1190
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,040
 Extra points for a shutout.

1191
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:43,480
 So you're going against the gods.

1192
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,480
 Yep.

1193
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,320
 That's why for the finals and it's three of the travel team teams and our team.

1194
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,040
 So you played a third game?

1195
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,040
 Yes.

1196
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,960
 Because we're the number four seed round Robin.

1197
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:55,960
 So it goes into a quarterfinal.

1198
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,160
 It's one versus four.

1199
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:04,120
 So we have to play an even better team than the team that just kicked our ass ate nothing.

1200
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:08,360
 You had to keep playing with this Paul again.

1201
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:12,760
 You think you're just bringing up a philosophical point and you're reading the story.

1202
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:18,280
 So this next team just destroys us.

1203
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:22,960
 I mean, just like it is 16, nothing in the first 12 minutes.

1204
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,760
 And it literally like a minute into the second half, like this, you know, 14 year old kid

1205
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:27,760
 walks over to me.

1206
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:33,920
 He's the ref, you know, no, this is going to hurt down.

1207
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:40,800
 We'll just be the usually he's like, he's like, there's a mercy rule.

1208
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:47,680
 You can just call it, you know, and I was like, and no, I'm not calling.

1209
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,680
 I'm not calling.

1210
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:49,680
 Oh no, Matt.

1211
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,680
 You've got to call it.

1212
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:54,520
 You've got to call it.

1213
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,520
 Did you ask the kids?

1214
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,960
 Did you, did you propose it to the kids at all or no, no, cause they were, they would

1215
00:53:58,960 --> 00:53:59,960
 just confirm it.

1216
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,320
 Like, like that's, that to me is more demoralizing.

1217
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,320
 You think, okay.

1218
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,320
 All right.

1219
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:08,160
 I mean, you're having the option for the mercy rule is a demoralizing moment.

1220
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,960
 It is a demoralizing moment, but if the ref is telling you, Hey, we can, we can put a

1221
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,000
 gun to this horse's head.

1222
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
 Yes.

1223
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,720
 I take that option, but I mean, that's me, but you're not out there playing a rec league

1224
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,440
 soccer game in the first place.

1225
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,560
 I just wanted my kids to score.

1226
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,560
 I want to see it.

1227
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,680
 I want to see if my kids could score another goal or something.

1228
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:33,100
 I just want to see if they could just find something, some fun moment or whatever.

1229
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:37,040
 And they weren't getting shut out in the, in the, no, no, we scored a couple of times.

1230
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,360
 We scored nice, we scored on them.

1231
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:41,400
 We actually scored first, which got things way too exciting.

1232
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,360
 We were, we were, we were briefly up one, nothing.

1233
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:52,200
 And then down a lot to one, uh, which is a terrible, cause it even gave a moment of false

1234
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,200
 hope.

1235
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,200
 Sure.

1236
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,200
 Right.

1237
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,200
 Like, Oh, maybe we are good enough.

1238
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,440
 We're not.

1239
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:05,360
 It's more self-examination that you don't want now, as you know, this, this, uh, this,

1240
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,200
 this show is familiar with the term Italian air show.

1241
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,200
 Sure.

1242
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,200
 Yeah.

1243
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,200
 Yeah.

1244
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,280
 So worst to worst.

1245
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,400
 So the Italian national team showed up.

1246
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,960
 This is where, this is where we, this is where, this is where we take my Italian soccer team

1247
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:25,820
 to Romstein and, uh, so I, I look on my app, like there's a giant thing that's taking place

1248
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:28,880
 all over the field with all these different age groups and everything else.

1249
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,760
 And so every time you go to the desk for help, they're like, look at the app, look at the

1250
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,880
 app, look at the app and the refs just record the scores and the, and the, and the app naturally

1251
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,600
 populate your next matchup.

1252
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:43,000
 And I see on the tournament thing that after underneath the finals, it says consolation

1253
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,600
 game.

1254
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:49,640
 So I assume that that means that the loser of the two finals teams play a consolation

1255
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:50,640
 game.

1256
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,120
 That's the way it looks like on the app.

1257
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,120
 Okay.

1258
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,120
 Yeah.

1259
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,120
 Like a third place game or something.

1260
00:55:55,120 --> 00:56:01,140
 So after we lost, I don't know a million to two, I'd be like, Hey, this is where I do

1261
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,140
 offer the mercy rule.

1262
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:06,960
 I'm like, Hey, according to the app, we can play one more game, but it's against the team

1263
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:12,400
 that we, you know, we two games that we lost two, two games ago or whoever lost to them,

1264
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,220
 but it's another club team.

1265
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:16,720
 My son is out.

1266
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:21,680
 He's like, no, yeah, he's like, no, I'm done.

1267
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:22,680
 And I was like, yeah.

1268
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:30,160
 And I'm, I have like, I hear you, I hear you and the other four kids say, yes, no.

1269
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:37,640
 And then I'm looking at the thing and it says, did you give your son an opportunity to talk

1270
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,960
 the other kids out of it?

1271
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,400
 Did you squeeze into the tightest Jersey fit you've ever done?

1272
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:48,120
 I'm a jingle baller.

1273
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:57,120
 If that were the end of this story, it'd be if you, if you shaved and put on like a beanie

1274
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:02,120
 and did a dwarf, did a dwarf on your knees out to the field thing and been fucking hilarious.

1275
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:08,360
 No, my kid and I have a very emotional conversation where he's mad because he doesn't want to

1276
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,360
 play, but he can't quit.

1277
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,360
 He won't quit.

1278
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:14,840
 And so if his kids are in, he's in, but he has to play.

1279
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:18,720
 And I'm saying you can go home if you want, don't worry about it.

1280
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,240
 And he's interpreting that as like me, like admonishing him.

1281
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:25,480
 And I'm like, no, no, this is not like a sarcastic or teachable dad moment.

1282
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,120
 For real, if you want to go home, it's fine.

1283
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,120
 Dad agrees.

1284
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,120
 This sucks.

1285
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,120
 If you want to go, go.

1286
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:35,000
 I'm only finishing my obligation as coach to these other kids.

1287
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,400
 And we don't have this obligation.

1288
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,400
 I do.

1289
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:40,680
 You can leave, but he doesn't have much of a choice there.

1290
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:41,680
 He can't leave.

1291
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,680
 No, it sucks.

1292
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,680
 It definitely sucks.

1293
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:44,680
 It just sucks.

1294
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:48,000
 And in my head, I'm like, I want to be like, buddy, I already failed.

1295
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,080
 Like no matter what this day is a fucking failure for what I wanted to have happen today.

1296
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,080
 It's already gone.

1297
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,880
 I don't even have a silver lining for what today is.

1298
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,840
 Not a single part of this went according to my plan.

1299
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:02,040
 I was trying to put an extra little pep in the step of your five core players that you

1300
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,080
 committed with for seven seasons.

1301
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:09,500
 And all I did was make you just put an exclamation point on the shit that was this season.

1302
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:14,760
 That's all I did was facilitate an extra hundred kicks to the balls, right?

1303
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,560
 Like what the hell?

1304
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:17,880
 I'm just feeling like a terrible person.

1305
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,320
 I would also like my day to end.

1306
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:25,160
 I sure would like to go home to these other kids want to keep playing though.

1307
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,600
 So I have to stick around, right?

1308
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:30,820
 I misread the app.

1309
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:34,000
 The constellation game is for the winners of the losers.

1310
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,720
 So all the losers that didn't make the final tournament went to their own bracket, a bracket

1311
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,960
 I'm sure we would have loved to have been in.

1312
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:41,960
 Sure.

1313
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:46,600
 And so the what they called the fun bracket, the two winners of the losers got one last

1314
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:51,520
 game on another field and I had to then turn around after all of that fighting.

1315
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:55,040
 I just did with my son and all of the, all the pep talks, all the Paris escape to their

1316
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,120
 other kids and go, just kidding.

1317
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,120
 I misread the app.

1318
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,120
 There's no game.

1319
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,120
 Go home.

1320
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:08,200
 Uh, what a headache on the text thread like, are we still doing a picnic?

1321
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,200
 Right.

1322
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:16,400
 So barbecue, barbecue motherfucker, let's rain check on this one and we'll do it some other

1323
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,400
 day.

1324
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,400
 Yeah.

1325
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:24,400
 It's been a day trying is the first step to failure.

1326
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:36,880
 Oh, that's awful, dude, I'm sorry, sorry, but kids into the holiday spirit though.

1327
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,720
 Maybe a good lesson in sports bullshitness.

1328
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:45,640
 Um, well I found myself like going through all these things in my head, right?

1329
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:49,680
 And then I've, I was reminded of America's got talent where like, uh, when I crashed

1330
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,200
 up on America's got talent, I kept being like, oh, if I ever do this next time, and then

1331
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,840
 my brain kept going like, there is no next time.

1332
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,440
 And then I would still swim and swirl and beat myself up and stuff.

1333
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:02,040
 And my brain would go like, you're never going back.

1334
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,240
 And so that's what's happening here.

1335
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,200
 I keep like, oh, if I next time we'll do the recreation league, there's no next time.

1336
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:11,680
 We're not rallying this back together again, we're not getting the old gang back together

1337
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,680
 next year.

1338
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:15,920
 I'm like, I'm not going to call these parents again.

1339
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,760
 That tournament we played last year, you want to do that again?

1340
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:22,480
 But when you put your trust in me to march your kids to an awesome afternoon of soccer

1341
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:30,760
 and I just got there, it was more of a death march.

1342
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:35,760
 I was like, I saw, yeah, all these adjustments in my head, gave me your kids and I got up

1343
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:36,760
 these really cute jerseys.

1344
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:40,280
 They said six, seven, the jingle ballers was a whole thing.

1345
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:45,960
 And then the other team made them dig their own graves before shooting them execution

1346
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:46,960
 style.

1347
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:47,960
 Yeah.

1348
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:52,240
 We'll call them all next year in December and be like, are your kids feeling a little

1349
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:55,800
 too arrogant or cocky?

1350
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,200
 Could they use another lesson in humility?

1351
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,880
 How are your kids doing?

1352
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,880
 They need to get knocked down a peg?

1353
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,880
 Send the link for the three on three.

1354
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:04,880
 Boom.

1355
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:05,880
 Let's go.

1356
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:13,560
 Get on board the humility train, get on board the humility train.

1357
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:17,720
 It's the opposite of like a ropes course where they build kids' confidence up over, you know,

1358
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:18,720
 whatever.

1359
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,360
 It's like, you call me like your kids are arrogant.

1360
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:21,360
 Don't worry.

1361
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:24,160
 I will sign them up for a three on three soccer team.

1362
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,640
 No, no, no.

1363
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,640
 You're not so great.

1364
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:28,640
 12 year old.

1365
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:29,640
 Oh man.

1366
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,880
 Like, you know, we're sitting around before the games.

1367
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,640
 So this kids are just playing soccer with other random kids and just, you know, playing

1368
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,640
 on random, you know, just, just fucking around, right?

1369
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:37,640
 And playing.

1370
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:38,640
 Yeah.

1371
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:42,200
 And so I guess other kids that were on that team that, that beat us, eight, nothing.

1372
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,920
 We're like playing around with them and literally like was like, Oh, we're playing you guys

1373
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:45,920
 next.

1374
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:46,920
 And then one kid was like, Oh, we're going to beat them.

1375
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,360
 Like, and they, and so like, you want to be like, Oh, we'll show them.

1376
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:50,360
 And then they did.

1377
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:55,520
 And then just as like, Oh, it's like everything from a terrible movie and there's no, there's

1378
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:56,520
 no second act.

1379
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:00,320
 It's just, it's just the first act of the terrible movie.

1380
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:06,520
 It's a more realistic movie where the, where the rich, tough team comes in and just beats

1381
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,400
 the shit out of the upstart team.

1382
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,080
 But you're done coaching now.

1383
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:11,080
 That's cool.

1384
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,080
 That's great.

1385
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,080
 That's what I said.

1386
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:17,500
 I said, if you want to, I said, if you guys want to start an improv group or play basketball,

1387
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:18,500
 you let me know.

1388
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:19,500
 There you go.

1389
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,300
 You're done until then leave me alone.

1390
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:23,840
 Are you done walking yet?

1391
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,880
 What you like in general?

1392
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:38,820
 The milers shit, an intervention from Paul, any kind of physical activity, bail on everything.

1393
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:41,280
 It doesn't lead to anything positive.

1394
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:46,640
 It just doesn't give him one hip replacement.

1395
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,540
 He's like, quit walking, knock it off.

1396
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:52,900
 This is my strutting around cock of the block.

1397
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:53,900
 Here I am.

1398
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:56,080
 Ambulatory as fuck.

1399
01:02:56,080 --> 01:03:03,080
 Look at me, dude, to do, to do the castle, both legs are workings.

1400
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,080
 Both legs have worked.

1401
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,640
 Oh, are you guys talking about Matt Donnelly?

1402
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,040
 You talking about the guy that walks?

1403
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,040
 Yeah.

1404
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,240
 Fucking walking guy.

1405
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,440
 The ambulatory flex is annoying, right?

1406
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:16,720
 He can't even get to a thousand miles.

1407
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:17,720
 Dip shit.

1408
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:18,720
 He can't count.

1409
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:19,720
 He can.

1410
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:20,720
 He can walk.

1411
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,720
 We can't fucking count.

1412
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:24,720
 Yes.

1413
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:25,720
 Kids can count.

1414
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:29,320
 They can do well, but that one, it was my failure.

1415
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:30,320
 Not theirs.

1416
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,320
 They achieved their goals.

1417
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,320
 Right.

1418
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:34,800
 And so it was like a joke in the family for my kids to make fun of me failing.

1419
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,640
 So I got to really lean into that and own that.

1420
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,640
 And that was kind of fun.

1421
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:38,640
 You just kind of had to eat shit.

1422
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:43,040
 You don't feel like you're going to lean into this one in the future that's going to come

1423
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,320
 up on new years as a big funny joke.

1424
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,320
 That's what I mean.

1425
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:51,360
 Jacob is like everywhere I look at, I'm like, no, it's just an L. It's just a total fucking

1426
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,360
 loss.

1427
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:53,360
 It's just a total.

1428
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:55,600
 I just, I failed and it's over.

1429
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:58,600
 Like there's nothing, there's no way to poke at it.

1430
01:03:58,600 --> 01:03:59,720
 There's a silver lining.

1431
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,080
 Here's the silver lining.

1432
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,240
 Oh, okay.

1433
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,240
 Those jerseys.

1434
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,240
 You got them.

1435
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,240
 Yeah.

1436
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,240
 With the six, seven gang.

1437
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,240
 Yeah.

1438
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,960
 Every time they hear the six, seven shit, now it's going to be like, Oh, fuck that.

1439
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:15,920
 So you may have started a kind of a underground rid of the six, seven, six, seven, at least

1440
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,760
 for them, at least for your kids are not going to enjoy it.

1441
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:21,480
 We have neighbors who are more religious.

1442
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:25,120
 They really do think it's some kind of devil practice.

1443
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:26,120
 And they did.

1444
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,120
 They said this.

1445
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,480
 I wasn't joking when I said it's a devil ritual.

1446
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:33,720
 That's what these fucking people think they're crazy as fuck.

1447
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:37,760
 Their kids have said to our kids, like, can you not make six, seven jokes around us?

1448
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,280
 My parents say it's satanic.

1449
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,920
 So fucking stupid.

1450
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:46,080
 This country is getting what it deserves.

1451
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:51,440
 And I am like, do they really believe that or do they just hate that joke so much?

1452
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,820
 They want it to stop.

1453
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:53,820
 They believe it.

1454
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:56,920
 If it's the second, then I'm with them.

1455
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,560
 This is one of those things I'm all for.

1456
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,920
 I'm all for lying to children.

1457
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:04,400
 If it accomplishes getting rid of a joke, that's really annoying.

1458
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,720
 No, this is, this is the dumbest thing it is.

1459
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,200
 It is the same as rock and roll.

1460
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,820
 It is the same as underground comedy.

1461
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:19,500
 It is the same as anything that the younger generation has ownership of and understanding

1462
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:23,640
 of that the older generation can't comprehend fully.

1463
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:28,000
 And nothing makes the older generation go crazier than when their kids are doing something

1464
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,200
 that they don't understand.

1465
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:38,080
 And I've told you that K-pop, K-pop in general makes me feel old and out of touch.

1466
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:39,080
 And I love it.

1467
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,080
 Anytime I see.

1468
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:41,080
 No, I love it.

1469
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,080
 It's great.

1470
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:46,600
 But like every time I see or hear anything related to K-pop, I just feel old.

1471
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,160
 Well, I feel old and out of touch.

1472
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,160
 And you should.

1473
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:50,160
 We are.

1474
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,160
 I think it's just correct.

1475
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:56,760
 I think it doesn't mean the devil made it to poison and kill your children.

1476
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,060
 It's the dumbest shit.

1477
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:02,400
 It's all, it's all just, and it's all just, I don't think K-pop is of the devil.

1478
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,400
 It's all control.

1479
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,460
 I do believe that six, seven is.

1480
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,460
 It's all control.

1481
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:06,460
 It's all misogyny.

1482
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:07,460
 It's all racism.

1483
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:12,760
 It's all tied together in this bullshit that this now constantly now probably fine countries

1484
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:13,960
 have to be fine.

1485
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:14,960
 It's good.

1486
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:15,960
 Sure.

1487
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:16,960
 It's nailed it.

1488
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:20,000
 I'll tell you what else is brought to you by racism and massage.

1489
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
 No, no.

1490
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
 And that.

1491
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,840
 The United States of America.

1492
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:36,080
 Today's show is brought to you by Yeti brand ice creams, sitting cones, Yeti brand, Yeti

1493
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:39,080
 brand ice cream, sitting cones.

1494
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:41,040
 This is a, this is a real thing.

1495
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,040
 Who's this from?

1496
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,320
 This is from the micro scoop in 24.

1497
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,320
 Micro scoop.

1498
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:49,960
 So this is from an, a classic episode of the electric company.

1499
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:50,960
 Oh.

1500
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,000
 Have you seen this?

1501
01:06:52,000 --> 01:07:00,000
 So it's a Spider-Man episode where there's this Yeti running loose in New York and Spidey

1502
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,720
 has to trap him.

1503
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:07,880
 So what he does is he buys ice cream cones cause of course the Yeti is attracted to cold

1504
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:15,720
 and he makes this trail of ice cream cones and the Yeti incredibly suggestively sits

1505
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:24,200
 on every ice cream cone as he follows the trail of ice cream cones to the trap that

1506
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,040
 Spider-Man has set for the Yeti.

1507
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:32,920
 So I don't even know micro scoop what commercial I can do here that comes close to just telling

1508
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:41,560
 people to go on YouTube and look up the Yeti episode of Spider-Man from the electric company

1509
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:49,840
 and watch the Yeti suggestively keister a ton of ice cream cones up its ass.

1510
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:54,200
 It's, it's beyond disturbing.

1511
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:59,680
 And when it does it, it makes like a, a hiss sound, you know, like when you, when you throw

1512
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:08,280
 a hot, hot liquor, a little bit of water on a hot griddle as that's the Yeti hot griddles

1513
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:16,520
 all these fucking ice cream cones and just psst, psst.

1514
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:17,520
 And like-

1515
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,520
 And her hay scoops to check out.

1516
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:19,520
 Really loves it.

1517
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,120
 Like the Yeti, the Yeti really loves it.

1518
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,120
 Yeah.

1519
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:28,440
 So go watch the Yeti get off on sitting on a bunch of ice cream cones.

1520
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,320
 Oh God, there it is.

1521
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:35,640
 Speaking of getting off, you're about to be getting off with some jock versus nerd.

1522
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:36,640
 Oh no.

1523
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:56,640
 Ladies and gentlemen, it is time, time for jock versus nerd.

1524
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:05,440
 Explosion of sexually gratified Yetis.

1525
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:06,440
 It's live action.

1526
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:07,440
 You're like scooper Nova girl.

1527
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:08,440
 Thought I was animated.

1528
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:09,760
 No, it's live action.

1529
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:15,240
 And the live, the guy who played the live action, Spider-Man just passed away, uh, like

1530
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,240
 a week ago.

1531
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,240
 Toby McGuire?

1532
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:21,880
 No, this was technically the, he was a Henson guy, I think.

1533
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:29,640
 I don't remember, but he, uh, he was the technically the first live action Spider-Man and it's

1534
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:30,640
 really, yeah.

1535
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,640
 Kind of sad.

1536
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:36,000
 I wanted one more quick little announcement of what I did last week.

1537
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:42,440
 Uh, Matt and Malia are, are my dear Pennsylvania scoop friends were kind enough to invite me

1538
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:49,880
 out to Christmas vacations put on by the bricolage, uh, production company.

1539
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:52,320
 They did a midnight radio kind of thing.

1540
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:59,960
 They do a radio play version of national Lampoon's Christmas vacation with tons of Pittsburgh

1541
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:00,960
 references in it.

1542
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,100
 Oh, that's fun.

1543
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:03,100
 It was kind of cute.

1544
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:08,400
 So lots of Foley work going on through the whole thing and them just, and so you just

1545
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:13,480
 sit and you watch performers standing and reading through the script, but doing all

1546
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:15,240
 kinds of Foley work at the same time.

1547
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:16,600
 It was really funny.

1548
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:20,200
 Uh, a couple of things went over my head cause I haven't been out here long enough to know

1549
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:23,480
 all the, uh, the ins and outs.

1550
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:26,840
 Oh boy, I got it.

1551
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,520
 But um, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1552
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:35,440
 Well, we've got a scooper to come and ask today from rune scoop, uh, who sent a nice

1553
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,880
 email to about, uh, seeing Matt at the Chicago magic lounge.

1554
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:43,520
 So, uh, the room scoop really enjoyed Matt's performance at the Chicago magic lounge.

1555
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,160
 Uh, so you got that going for you, which is nice.

1556
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,160
 Yay.

1557
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:54,600
 My last shows, the retirement shows, it was great.

1558
01:10:54,600 --> 01:11:02,800
 The categories are every breath you take, un-camouflaged animals, 50 50 and run it back.

1559
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,280
 Oh, and let's see, uh, team sling here.

1560
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:08,040
 I hear your fresh stats.

1561
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,720
 Matt has 2,800 all time.

1562
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,520
 Jacob has 2000 all time.

1563
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,640
 Paul is in the rear with negative 2000.

1564
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:14,640
 I'm always in the rear.

1565
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,560
 So that's, that's on the rune scoop games here.

1566
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:23,160
 Every breath you take is a category all about the police's every breath you take.

1567
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:28,120
 Uh, I loved the concept from Eric Dittleman's, uh, of, uh, camouflage animals.

1568
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:31,200
 So I present that to you with my own twist.

1569
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:36,080
 Un-camouflaged animals, uh, find the animal 50 50 where the odds are forever in your favor

1570
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:41,400
 and run it back questions from my last scooper D. Uh, Paul, you're up first.

1571
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,400
 What do you want?

1572
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,400
 Okay.

1573
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,840
 Uh, I'll try un-camouflaged animals.

1574
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:55,840
 One for 200, three, two, elephant blast off.

1575
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:56,840
 Un-camouflaged animals.

1576
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:57,840
 Right?

1577
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:58,840
 Uh-huh.

1578
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:00,520
 Three, two, elephant blast off.

1579
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:06,880
 There's a number three, a number two, the word elephant and blast off.

1580
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:14,360
 Three, two, one?

1581
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:21,060
 I mean, goodness, my dog is over here just going crazy about something.

1582
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:22,060
 I'll be right back.

1583
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:23,060
 Talk amongst yourselves.

1584
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:24,060
 The dog is like, it's obvious.

1585
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:25,480
 The answer is obvious.

1586
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:26,480
 Right.

1587
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:34,760
 Well, what one as like the answer as a, I don't know.

1588
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:35,760
 What do you think, Matt?

1589
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,520
 Three, two, elephant blast off.

1590
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,640
 What's the category?

1591
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:45,600
 Un-camouflaged animals.

1592
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,720
 I wonder if it's just elephant.

1593
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:48,720
 Trunk?

1594
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:52,240
 Oh, you might be right.

1595
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:53,240
 There you go.

1596
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:56,200
 I think it's a give me, it's a give me a thing.

1597
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:00,840
 I think he's making fun of the Dittleman category instead of, you know what I mean, where like

1598
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:01,840
 all the names.

1599
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:02,840
 Now I get it.

1600
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:03,840
 Now I get it.

1601
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:04,840
 You're right.

1602
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:05,840
 That's exactly what it is.

1603
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:06,840
 Yeah.

1604
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:07,840
 Elephant is the answer.

1605
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:08,840
 Oh, shit.

1606
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:12,560
 It'd be weird if this was the time where Jacob's dogs decided to take over and eat him.

1607
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:20,080
 I don't know if anybody saw the follow-up that Dittleman posted on our Insta, but he

1608
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,040
 would have given me credit for Rue.

1609
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:25,120
 And it would have not given me credit for Holy Cross.

1610
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,160
 So I should, you should have won and I should have lost.

1611
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:30,960
 I should have won, but hey, water under the bridge.

1612
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:31,960
 All right.

1613
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,600
 Jacob's back with a pupper.

1614
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,560
 Now our views are going to go up.

1615
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:36,840
 Views are going to go through the moon.

1616
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,680
 So it's elephant, Jacob.

1617
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:39,680
 It's elephant.

1618
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:40,680
 That's, we figured it out.

1619
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:45,320
 It's a, it's a play on, on Dittleman's game of hiding the, the names.

1620
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:46,320
 There's no hiding.

1621
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,320
 So it's elephant.

1622
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:48,320
 Yeah.

1623
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:49,320
 So you think the answer is elephant?

1624
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:50,320
 They think so.

1625
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,320
 Yeah.

1626
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:52,320
 There we go.

1627
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,320
 It is elephant.

1628
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:54,320
 Matt.

1629
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:58,960
 I'll do un-camouflaged animals for 800, please.

1630
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,280
 Let's try it.

1631
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:04,320
 Your left shoe is plotting a coup against reality.

1632
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:05,760
 Oh, he did it.

1633
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,400
 It wasn't, it wasn't going to be that fun.

1634
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:08,400
 Okay.

1635
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:09,400
 Okay.

1636
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:10,400
 I got, I got Dittle.

1637
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,840
 Let's see here.

1638
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:24,240
 Oh, or left, uh, left, shh, shh, shh, shh, yes, but.

1639
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:27,160
 Your left shoe is plotting a coup against reality.

1640
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:28,160
 Damn it.

1641
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:29,160
 I don't see it.

1642
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,160
 I'll pass.

1643
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:31,160
 Passes to me.

1644
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,960
 I don't, I don't understand what's happening in this category.

1645
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:33,960
 What's the category?

1646
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:41,440
 This is the, the Dittleman one, the un-camouflaged animals.

1647
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:44,760
 I had a delivery come to my house and my dog is furious about it.

1648
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:53,400
 I get a, huh.

1649
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:54,520
 What do you think?

1650
01:14:54,520 --> 01:15:00,400
 I, I feel like pigeon, but I'm going to pass because I don't know.

1651
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,440
 All right.

1652
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:02,500
 There is no animal.

1653
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:12,520
 It's just a sneaky, sneaky, uh, he promised me it would be unhinged and he is delivering.

1654
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:13,520
 All right.

1655
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,520
 There you go.

1656
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,720
 I'll do un-camouflaged animals for 600.

1657
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:20,920
 The chef told us that we wanted to be average to work elsewhere.

1658
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,360
 It's B average.

1659
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:33,760
 The answer is Beaver.

1660
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,440
 B average together.

1661
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,440
 It's Beaver guys.

1662
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:39,280
 Beaver is what I'm going with.

1663
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:40,280
 Beaver.

1664
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,280
 Beaver.

1665
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,280
 Beaver.

1666
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:43,280
 Boy.

1667
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,880
 I'm glad I got that one right.

1668
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:46,880
 Paul.

1669
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:50,080
 Every breath you take for 800, I'm going to shoot the moon.

1670
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,080
 Ooh.

1671
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,760
 It's all about the police.

1672
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:57,040
 This is where I next saw you a venue.

1673
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:03,160
 Oh my goodness.

1674
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:07,540
 This is where I next saw you.

1675
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:10,200
 See now this is clearly one that I needed to do in order.

1676
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,200
 Paul.

1677
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,200
 I'll pass.

1678
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:13,200
 Clearly.

1679
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:14,200
 Uh, Matt.

1680
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:15,200
 Pass.

1681
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,200
 Pass.

1682
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:19,400
 The Turner hall ballroom jokers tour.

1683
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:20,400
 Okay.

1684
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,580
 That's who's going to see me next.

1685
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:31,560
 See, see if I'm sitting near you, go to jokersofmagic.com, uh, un-camouflaged animals, 400.

1686
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:32,840
 Daily double.

1687
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:33,840
 I bet it all.

1688
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:34,840
 I have zero points.

1689
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:35,840
 I bet it all.

1690
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:36,840
 Hey kids, quit monkey in a round monkey.

1691
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:37,840
 Ooh, it is monkey.

1692
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:38,840
 It's in monkeying.

1693
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:39,840
 You probably couldn't see it.

1694
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:40,840
 The word monkey is hidden cleverly inside of the word monkeying.

1695
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:53,900
 Pretty fucking sneaky.

1696
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:54,900
 It's me.

1697
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:57,540
 I'll try 50, 50 for 200.

1698
01:16:57,540 --> 01:17:07,240
 The odds you get this question right are 50, 50 true.

1699
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:10,760
 So now wait, that's, I'd say the odds are a hundred percent.

1700
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:11,760
 Yeah.

1701
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:15,560
 Well, I guess I, if I picked false, they wouldn't have been.

1702
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:18,240
 This is that riddle of the twins at the window like that.

1703
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,240
 Yeah, exactly.

1704
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:23,200
 Everything I say is a lie and you can't believe anything I say or something.

1705
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:24,200
 I don't know.

1706
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,200
 Yeah.

1707
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:26,200
 Yeah.

1708
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,200
 Uh, I only tell the truth.

1709
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:28,200
 I only tell lies.

1710
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:29,200
 Right.

1711
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:33,200
 Uh, run it back for 200.

1712
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,920
 What is my favorite word?

1713
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:35,920
 Hint.

1714
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:40,400
 It's six letters, three of which are Y definition, a conjunction or opposition, especially of

1715
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:45,880
 the moon with the sun.

1716
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:50,080
 What is my favorite word?

1717
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:52,520
 Six letters, three wise.

1718
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:53,520
 Wow.

1719
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:54,520
 Why?

1720
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:55,520
 Why?

1721
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,520
 Why?

1722
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:57,520
 Yeah.

1723
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:58,520
 Yeah.

1724
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:59,520
 Conjunction.

1725
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:00,520
 Yeah.

1726
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:05,200
 Uh, conjunction or opposition of the moon.

1727
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:07,920
 Uh, yeah.

1728
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:08,920
 Moon.

1729
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:09,920
 No, what's that called?

1730
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:17,400
 It's not an eclipse, not an eclipse, not a ellipse.

1731
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:18,400
 I'll pass.

1732
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,400
 I don't know.

1733
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:20,400
 Matt pass.

1734
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,400
 Pass.

1735
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:27,800
 Uh, Y Z Y G Y.

1736
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:28,800
 Sidgey.

1737
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:29,800
 Sidgey.

1738
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:30,800
 Sidgey.

1739
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:31,800
 Sidgey.

1740
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:39,880
 Um, uh, I'll do 50, 50, 400.

1741
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:43,720
 The odds you get this question right are one in 25.

1742
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:44,720
 False.

1743
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,960
 It is false.

1744
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,440
 Well done.

1745
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:50,440
 Knock that math out of the park.

1746
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:52,200
 I'm going 50, 50 for 800.

1747
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:53,560
 I'll take the burn this time.

1748
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:54,560
 Whoa.

1749
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:58,000
 The odds you get this question right or one in 100.

1750
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,280
 All right.

1751
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:00,280
 Let's see.

1752
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:01,760
 I'm going to say false.

1753
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,940
 Oh, it's true.

1754
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:05,160
 It's either right or it's wrong.

1755
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:06,160
 Oh man.

1756
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,160
 What?

1757
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,160
 Wait.

1758
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:13,960
 The odds you get this question right are one in 100 true.

1759
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:16,040
 It's right or it's wrong.

1760
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:17,880
 I don't get that at all.

1761
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,160
 I don't get that at all.

1762
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,160
 Somebody explained that to me.

1763
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,080
 I got it wrong, but somebody explained it to me.

1764
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,080
 Yeah.

1765
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:24,080
 Paul.

1766
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:27,080
 Uh, run it back for 400.

1767
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:28,080
 Free square.

1768
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,080
 Yay.

1769
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:35,080
 Uh, reaction or response must feature a reference to bingo to get points.

1770
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:36,080
 Oh no.

1771
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,080
 Oh wow.

1772
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:38,080
 I said yay.

1773
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,760
 I thought yay might be enough.

1774
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:41,760
 It wasn't.

1775
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:42,760
 I'm sorry, Paul.

1776
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:43,760
 You got that wrong.

1777
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:44,760
 That's fair enough.

1778
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:45,760
 Matt.

1779
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:46,760
 Oh man.

1780
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:51,160
 Now I'm trying not to step in a landmine.

1781
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:54,320
 This is a sneaky, this is a sneaky fucking scooperty.

1782
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,680
 Every breath you take for 200.

1783
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:57,680
 All right.

1784
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:01,040
 Uh, this is where I first saw you on platform.

1785
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:07,860
 Um, uh, uh, also this is just a police style.

1786
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:10,680
 Every breath you take category just to Matt.

1787
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:11,680
 Stalking you.

1788
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:12,680
 Yeah.

1789
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:13,680
 It's got to be fool us.

1790
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:14,680
 Right, Matt?

1791
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:15,680
 No, no, no.

1792
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:19,080
 He came and saw me live and he told me when I saw him and I'm trying to remember, I think

1793
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:24,560
 it was when I was opening for PIF in Chicago, I think it was in Chicago when I opened for

1794
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:25,560
 PIF.

1795
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:26,560
 Do I need to know the name of the club?

1796
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:31,080
 I, I thought this was going to be like, I thought the platform meant like Twitch.

1797
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:34,080
 Oh, I'm just wrong on all of this.

1798
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,080
 I think.

1799
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,080
 I don't know.

1800
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,080
 Okay.

1801
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:38,080
 Let's see.

1802
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,080
 Yes.

1803
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,080
 There you go.

1804
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,080
 That's the solve.

1805
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:42,080
 That's all right.

1806
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,080
 Let's see.

1807
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:44,080
 Where did Rune scoop first see Matt Donnelly?

1808
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:45,080
 Um, fuck it.

1809
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:46,080
 Twitch.

1810
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,080
 YouTuber Twitch.

1811
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,080
 Look at that.

1812
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,080
 Yes.

1813
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,080
 Good job.

1814
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,080
 Good job.

1815
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,080
 Jacob.

1816
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,080
 You got it right.

1817
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:54,080
 Good.

1818
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,080
 Yeah, I got it.

1819
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:56,080
 It's me.

1820
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,080
 I'll try.

1821
01:20:57,080 --> 01:21:01,560
 Um, uh, run it back 600 to protect his new wealth.

1822
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:05,960
 A young, uh, oh, the Greek freak Janice.

1823
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:09,360
 Uh, I'm not going to try and say his last name.

1824
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,360
 That's it.

1825
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:19,520
 Captain kept in the NBA, kept in the NBA, kept his money at the FDIC limit in this mini

1826
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:20,520
 banks.

1827
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:25,120
 Hint plus or minus, uh, plus or minus two.

1828
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,040
 It's the first year of his rookie contract.

1829
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,680
 Oh, wow.

1830
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:33,800
 So he just owed money insured up to the FDIC amount in every many banks.

1831
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:34,800
 Wow.

1832
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:35,800
 Oh, I see.

1833
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:39,760
 So how many, how many, I mean, well, first, how, how much is FDIC insured?

1834
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:43,520
 Well, I believe that is the, uh, half of this entire question.

1835
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:44,520
 Okay.

1836
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:45,520
 I don't know that.

1837
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:46,520
 And I don't know his rookie contract.

1838
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:49,800
 I'm telling you that there are two halves of this question.

1839
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:50,800
 I don't know either.

1840
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,800
 Well, educated guesses.

1841
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:58,080
 How much do you think banks insured 25 K?

1842
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,080
 I think it goes higher than that.

1843
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,080
 I think.

1844
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:04,160
 No, it's going to be, I would think it's million, no, at least a million.

1845
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:09,040
 Would you pass your Jacob that passes to Paul?

1846
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,120
 Okay.

1847
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:15,800
 I'll guess, uh, I'll guess four.

1848
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:16,800
 Nope.

1849
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:21,200
 I'll guess 25 banks, 25 banks.

1850
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,200
 Let's see.

1851
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:23,200
 Seven.

1852
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:28,480
 Seven is the answer and does it make more sense?

1853
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,760
 This time, Paul, did it make more sense?

1854
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:31,760
 This time?

1855
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:32,760
 Nope.

1856
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:33,760
 All right then.

1857
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:34,760
 Paul, you're wrong.

1858
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:41,000
 Run it back for eight Hondo.

1859
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
 Expand the window.

1860
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:49,000
 As you read from the category, see here, hold on.

1861
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
 Can I do this?

1862
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,720
 What do I have to do here?

1863
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:58,000
 Uh, from the category, this expand this window, the thing.

1864
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,720
 This is truly outside the box.

1865
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:04,440
 The category spaces category, spaceless potpourri.

1866
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:06,920
 Oh, it keeps going.

1867
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:09,080
 Oh, here we go.

1868
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:16,220
 Although owned by the Mars corporation, M&Ms were co-invented by the son of the president

1869
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:23,680
 of this chocolate company and filled with their chocolate owned by the Mars corporation.

1870
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:28,960
 M&Ms were co-invented by the son of the president of this chocolate company and filled with

1871
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:29,960
 their chocolate.

1872
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:31,960
 Uh, gotta be Hershey.

1873
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:32,960
 Let's try Hershey.

1874
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:36,800
 Oh, man, this is off the rails.

1875
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:37,800
 I love it.

1876
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:38,800
 Man, it is Hershey.

1877
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,680
 Hey, I'm back to zero.

1878
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:41,680
 Fuck.

1879
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:42,680
 Yeah.

1880
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:43,680
 Uh, Matt, you're up.

1881
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:44,680
 Back on the board.

1882
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:46,200
 Oh, I can't see it anymore.

1883
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,200
 I can't see the board.

1884
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:51,120
 No, uh, I will take, uh, every breath you take for 600.

1885
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:52,120
 Daily double.

1886
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:57,640
 Now it's for 800.

1887
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:59,760
 This is where I third saw you.

1888
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:00,760
 The venue.

1889
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:01,760
 Chicago Magic Lounge.

1890
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,160
 It's the Chicago Magic Lounge.

1891
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:05,600
 Nice one.

1892
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:06,600
 Was that this time?

1893
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:07,600
 This was the third?

1894
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,600
 That's correct.

1895
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:09,600
 All right.

1896
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,520
 Uh, score check with two questions left.

1897
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,040
 Matt now has the lead with 1600.

1898
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:14,120
 I'm in second with 200.

1899
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,520
 Paul's in third with zero.

1900
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:16,760
 There's no more daily doubles left.

1901
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:19,920
 There's an every breath you take for 400 and a 50/50 for 600.

1902
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:25,080
 I'm going to do that 50/50 instead of trying to figure out where Rune Scoop saw Matt Donnelly

1903
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:26,520
 at different times.

1904
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:28,560
 That is game Paul.

1905
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:32,040
 Is that squirrel in your background?

1906
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:34,320
 Is that the squirrel in your background?

1907
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,580
 No, Paul.

1908
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:38,800
 Is that the squirrel in your background?

1909
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:39,800
 No, thank God.

1910
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:41,840
 I'm going to say yes.

1911
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,040
 Okay.

1912
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,040
 Points of Paul looked.

1913
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:46,040
 Did you look Paul?

1914
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:47,040
 Nope.

1915
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,040
 Did you see me?

1916
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:49,040
 I didn't see you look.

1917
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:50,040
 That's why I asked.

1918
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:51,040
 No.

1919
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:52,040
 Jacob got that one wrong.

1920
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:53,340
 Paul closing out the category.

1921
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:55,240
 Every breath you take for 400.

1922
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:56,240
 This is the game.

1923
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:59,340
 This is where I second saw you.

1924
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:03,840
 What venue did Rune Scoop see Matt at the second time he saw Matt?

1925
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:04,840
 I will pass.

1926
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:05,840
 I don't know.

1927
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:06,840
 Oh, interesting.

1928
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:07,840
 Matt, that passes to you.

1929
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,680
 I am trying to remember.

1930
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:15,280
 He told me when I say opening for PIF, though, I don't think that's right.

1931
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:16,280
 Okay.

1932
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:24,440
 I think maybe he came and saw a foolers tour show.

1933
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:28,680
 I forget though, pass all that passes to me.

1934
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:34,440
 That would be Matt's house through the second story window at Matt's house that Rune Scoop

1935
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:35,440
 was looking through.

1936
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:36,440
 Oh no.

1937
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:37,440
 It's the Paps.

1938
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:38,440
 Yeah.

1939
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:39,440
 The fooler store.

1940
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:40,440
 There you go.

1941
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:41,440
 I got that one wrong.

1942
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,080
 And that is the game.

1943
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:44,880
 Matt wins with 1600.

1944
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,680
 Paul is in second with zero and I am in third with negative 800.

1945
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:49,800
 That's from Rune Scoop.

1946
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:50,800
