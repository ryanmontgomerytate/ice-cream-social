 Hello s Jacob and I to watch the
 Masters of the universe movie trailer. That's right
 This episode is all about the new Masters of the universe
 We're preaching fun preaching. Yeah, we got are we twitched up. We're twitched up
 Matt is still freezing his took us off over there in Indiana is me too
 You're recording this on a Monday my feet are a little chilly. It's it's just shy of 70 here and
 I am a slightly uncomfortable. I have my house shoes on there. They're taking care of most of it though
 So don't worry about me. Did you get a snow measurement Matt?
 Is that this at 20 20 to 24 inches fell here? Oh my goodness. That's double what we got. That's crazy. Yeah and
 Because of that they don't serve breakfast anywhere
 Very long a long walk with Mike Mills and our tech guy scooter
 we were inept but it changed our opinion of where we were staying so
 We were finishing up our show. We just show let's say, Kentucky. They made two shows in Cincinnati and
 We're supposed to go at the Bloomington and do a show that was canceled and then we're heading to Chicago
 But it's another show being produced out here
 by
 Mike Mills and so
 We were going to come out here to see a preview of that show anyway
 I don't know if it's public yet, so I can't say which show it is
 It's a tradition that okay people may or may not have heard of but
 so we're deciding whether to snow ourselves into Cincinnati and
 Then just see if the roads are good to come out Monday to watch the show. Yeah, they go to Chicago after that or
 Snow ourselves in Indiana you're at and be right there and then just be here for three days and that'll be fun
 And so we we voted for going to Indiana
 So we finished our show and it was already snowing when we were packing up our van. Yeah, it was really exciting
 And then we did you have that like that that that feel of like we got to get the fuck out of here or we're not
 Gonna yes. Yeah. Yeah, and and so off we went
 I don't like that feel at all off we went hit the snowy roads driving at a brisk 40 miles an hour
 Good as we head out through the snow and we're in a big spreader van. It's nice and heavy
 So we're not worried about we were feeling good. We weren't slipping and sliding
 Last like hour of the trip. It was supposed to take like an hour 45 minutes took three hours three and a half hours. Yeah
 And we were following a snowplow which is one good because we're we're driving on a plowed street
 But plows go about
 15 to 20 miles an hour. Yeah, they're not they're not known for their quickness
 No, don't you do so we were just like it was a crawl
 To the to the place now
 we're staying at this spot called the Grant Street in here in Bloomington and
 We called ahead twice to be like we might come out late tonight. Is that okay?
 And then we're definitely coming out late tonight. Is that okay?
 And so we pull up and the Grand Street is actually like three houses converted into a hotel
 So okay you check in the main house, but then you get sent across the street to the other house
 So we pull up at about three o'clock in the morning
 Mike goes in and we hear nothing for like ten minutes. We're just taking three and a half hours here
 we're finally at the place we want to be and now we're just sitting in the car and then Mike says
 You guys might want to come in or whatever
 We couldn't find anyone
 At the hotel and then finally someone woke up and came our way and said oh gosh
 I don't even have the passwords for the computer. I don't think I can check you guys in
 York's
 Right
 This is things like Mike Mills
 I've had him on an abracadabra. I should have him on here. It's very funny guy also
 Calm like a jacket again. Oh shoot. You're clipping on us
 Calm guy. Yeah
 Like and all this is what time though. This is what time in the lobby of the hotel 3 3 15 in the morning
 Yeah, and you've been and you've been driving behind the snowplow for how long about an hour and
 I asked him to chat earlier
 Who who drives who was driving?
 Initially, I was driving as I picked up the car in Cincinnati
 And I drove it to Lexington and I was trying to drive and Mike Mills does so much for the tour
 I produce it and also does all of the you know logistics and stuff
 So I thought I would drive but because it was snowing and he lives in New York and I live in, Nevada
 He thought he was maybe a little more qualified to drive in the snow than me
 He's at least a recent practice most likely. Did you tell him?
 Jersey born. Yeah. No, he's aware. He's aware
 Don't have an argument about it though. Yeah much like springsteen
 People know where I'm from
 They figure it out
 Yeah
 So we go
 So so your dreams so right where he's from like well, we got to stay here
 I guess like in the main building like at least you got to have at least in the lobby
 No, but like a key to open up some room somewhere like they have something right? Yeah. Yeah, that's right
 so
 She says yes, and so we start opening the van. It's still snowing right? This is this is the start
 This is the start of the god. Yeah
 so we're unloading all of our stuff and then one of the really funny things that happens that both Mike and I have
 tricks that involve
 Liquids cans of stuff. Oh
 Yeah, okay, we can't leave that in the van old. No, we bought we bought enough for the whole tour
 So we had to like haul every all of our liquid props
 flats of
 Cans of water in yes, so to unload everything and we get halfway through unloading our vans
 Oh, no, I figured it out. We can get you guys checked in across the street. No problem. Oh god damn it
 So then we pick up all of our stuff and load it back into the van I
 Again
 Mike
 Mike when he came out explained this he was like I can't fucking believe this right like he occurs
 He never curses he's I can't fucking believe he's he's shoveling snow off of the thing because he hasn't told us yet
 I've got to unload our van, but he's clearing the way as he's cursing to let it like he's clearing a path
 So I try to like do an end around and I grab the shovel and I run across the street to like pre I start shoveling
 The other house out so that we can load stuff into the place that we are staying gotcha. Okay, you're thinking ahead
 Yeah, the van
 Can't get out of the parking space that it's in because of the snow
 It's like we're doing the wibbly wobbly, you know rack rocket back and forth thing trying to get some grip
 You know, and we finally get loose it goes up. It's 330 in the morning
 We finally get loose and it's a we're on a one-way street and it's snow covered, right?
 So it's definitely one way street one lane one way down
 And we get to the middle and we're about to unload our stuff and just another car just pulls up behind us
 Oh shit
 It's four in the morning, yeah
 Mike drives around the block, right? It takes like five minutes like that. I
 And I'm like just shoveling away. I have no gloves. It's 15 degrees and
 I'm just shoveling away waiting for the van to return
 Luckily you're only 19 years old
 Fiercely shoving away. It's still snowing like a mother and
 And then he pulls back around yeah, we open the door and another car pulls up
 Also this area really is a grid right like it's not complicated like you can go around us, right? Yeah and
 Then so Mike pulls up and he actually pulls up just so we can get the car out of the way that reverses back
 Yeah, do it and we unload half of our van
 into the through the through the through the path I've shoveled into the into the house that we're staying at and
 Halfway through a car. I can see it coming from blocks away. Our hazards are on is a giant Sprinter van
 The doors are open. We are moving in a chain of four people unloading. There's clearly something happening this thing happening and
 A car it just eases right up behind us and stop
 And I just said we're finishing the unloading and I yell at the team and I shot the dirtiest look to the person
 You can literally right now reverse 50 feet. Yeah and drive left and just go a different way. Yeah
 So they waited better than where I was afraid the story was going. I was afraid the story was going like I saw the headlights
 He was coming ran right into the van. Oh my god. Yeah
 But so yeah, so we loaded in
 Scoop says good thing know there when they change in your pocket
 Right, right. Right. So anyways didn't have the password text to the wrong place
 like we were pretty kind of a we were making fun of this hotel for a
 Minute, you know, right come with it. So
 Look at us. We're still doing it got the two mornings later
 We said we're gonna try to get breakfast now, you know, famously
 There's a restaurant here called the runsable spoon, which I have loved visiting here
 I've talked about the runsable spoon runsable spoon is what it's called. What's that mean? Who knows?
 What's the word runsable the runsable is the word?
 What's that mean and we looked it up before but it was unmemorable because we've had this conversation before but
 I cuz I came here when I came I played
 When I played Washington, Indiana
 Aces bar grill. Uh-huh. I know that we've had this conversation before because there was it was
 Google remembered it. Yeah, I cuz I call I call me Jacob
 It's a nonsense word invented by Edward Lear
 Most famously from owl and the pussy cat. Okay, great. Yes. He will never remember that again. No, we won't forget next time
 But it's a it's a nonsense word. Oh, it's like a Jellico cats
 Yeah. All right. Great, but even dumber and I came here
 I said I said it was like it was like it was like all the waitress were like different Manson girls
 Like that's what it was like college. Oh, yeah. Yeah, whatever and it's
 Walls I remember that part. Yeah, exactly. Well, that's what we all remember. That's why we all want to go back
 right
 So runsable spoons still not open for the blizzard didn't recover it 24 hours
 No dice. Oh man, we walk out and about
 To all of all of Bloomington and all these restaurants are still closed this morning. Yeah
 we came back into the the host house of our three house hotel to get coffee and
 Very kind host who wasn't the guy who was up at 330 mornings. Like you guys do it. All right, you know
 We're like, ah, well, we just try to take a walk and we didn't make breakfast here this morning because we thought we're gonna walk
 Somewhere else for breakfast, but every place is closed or whatever. He goes
 Oh, oh, well, let me see if I can get some at least get some like fruit stuff together for you guys
 Some vittles rustled up. Oh
 And he goes downstairs and he comes up because you know, the cook hasn't left and we still have eggs and bacon
 You guys want us to make you up some eggs and bacon?
 Yes, yeah, they went out of their way and gave three of us like an amazing
 Immaculate breakfast. Wow, and I was like we and I just turned to Mike. I was like we are eating our fucking words
 We've been trashing this place for 24 hours and they totally outclassed us
 They turn today and they were just everywhere. There was an
 Incredibly nice it went above and beyond and so I have nothing but amazing things to say about the Grand Street in
 Right except that maybe they should have that past check-in process is a little
 Taped to put a post it know with a password somewhere that everyone knows, you know, so
 Password password who cares?
 We were just pissed about driving, you know
 42 to 15 miles an hour for three and a half hours, but you had also called ahead and now giving them the heads up
 That's it. That's a lot of you gave them the heads up a couple of times
 That's something that is something I'll tell you who else is something these folks really are something and that's the following sponsor
 Today's show is brought to you by
 Go go phone go
 Michael Jackson's my skulls Jack's son head exercises for dancers
 My skulls jackson head exercises for dancers
 Hey everybody, I just want everyone to know that I have opened a whole new store
 It's called Michael Jackson's my Jack's on skull
 exercises for dancers
 And many of you don't ascribe to phrenology, but that's ignorant. That's just ignorant
 Phrenology is key when it comes to dancing the way your heads aerodynamics work with the breeze
 That's if you'd be a better dancer that way
 Are you saying that you that you're a good dancer because of your head shape, that's exactly right
 Michael Jackson's head shape is perfect for being a good dancer. If you know anything about phrenology, then you'd understand
 But you don't know what no phrenology is the study of the shape of the head and the discovery of
 Attributes and traits has been disproven time and again by science but embraced by horrible racists
 for generations
 So, why are we talking about it because that's the only way I can open my school you ignorant you ignorant
 I had to open my school based on phrenology because I'm not a medical doctor
 The only doctor I know gives me mama's meal. Give me milk. Give me some milk. I need to sleep. Give me more milk
 Check out
 I
 Will speak
 It happened ladies and gentlemen
 There is a new Masters of the Universe movie coming to theaters this year June 5th
 Yes
 Are you excited about this? Paul? I'm very excited about this. Okay
 Are you excited about how excited Paul is about this? I know you excited for the inevitable crash. I watch
 Oh, yeah, he's gonna hate the movie
 I don't know. I don't think I am
 So they've been trying to make different master the universe projects for a while and this one finally came to fruition
 Do you know behind that? Well, I mean the other ones have been put on the back burner for several different reasons
 probably because they were shit and
 Mattel didn't want their brand damaged. But here's why I'm hopeful
 the Barbie movie the Barbie movie made a fuck ton of money and was also critically lauded so
 That combo put into Mattel's mind
 Hey, if we put some autours and some actual directors in charge of this stuff and maybe hire some actors
 That actually know how to perform
 We can put a little gravitas or stuff. Yeah
 well, but they got a lot of other really great people in this movie to a lot of really great people in this movie, uh-huh, so I
 Think they've learned their lesson with Barbie that this can be another
 real bankroll move and
 Possible, you know legacy protector if they do it, right? And so I don't think they're fucking around. I
 Know support. What are your thoughts on the trailer? I
 It looks great
 You just think you're just generally excited about it. There wasn't there wasn't a single part of that you really stood out to you
 Nothing. I mean it all looks so like okay. So here's the thing
 I already talked to the scoops about this in the chat before but I'll talk about so
 You've got Marlena Glenn who was an astro a human astronaut from Earth. That is Queen Marlena
 Adam's mother right and the trailer focuses on her talking to him as a child
 Sending him away to earth for protection
 because
 likely because
 Adora had been captured and war was continued. That's all that's all real story. Yes. That's all that's all lore
 What's the word cannon? This is cannon? Yeah, this is legit. This is why I'm excited is because the real ones know
 No, I assumed watching this trailer that this was
 Made up something like this this whole premise of like sitting to earth and then and then no protecting all this stuff
 Now that never happened that never happened
 however
 Adora did get stolen away by Hordak and it would make sense for Marlena to want to protect
 Adam as the last heir to the attorney. It's really hard to take you seriously with their names like Hordak involved
 Tell you how it went down Hordak stole baby Adora. It's pronounced sex worker Dak now
 Pimp deck for those who know he keeps that pimp deck hand strong. I
 Mean Hordak's not even in the movie is he's even he's even higher up than Skeletor
 He's the one that trained Skeletor. So, you know, this is gonna be they're leading
 It's gonna it's gonna end up leading to like sequels, which is gonna be really cool. But no, this is legit
 Marlena is from earth. Uh-huh. He man is half earthling half Eternian. That's part of the lore
 That's part of why he is magically imbued. That's part of why he is this
 You know character that transcends world or just fuckable Mormon. I
 Mean now the blonde hair and all that that's an unfortunate side effect from hey, we have to make this unique IP
 Conan doesn't have blonde hair. Let's do that because another the origins of the Masters of the Universe toy line are
 Steeped in a lot of weird shit, but not least of which
 Mattel was in talks with the Conan movie guys to possibly do a movie line, right?
 Yeah, and so there's some of that then they had to really deflect hard
 So they made it sort of sci-fi a little more spacey a little more weird a little more fantasy even than Conan and
 Changed the look of he man drastically to keep him away from the Conan comparison. Oh, yeah. Yeah
 No, he man and Conan could never
 They change it super drastically
 One of them is a mostly naked dude with a big fucking sword and the other one's your mom
 Absolutely, it's absolutely
 From Conan. Let's let's don't get it twisted. I know that I know where that stuff like yeah
 But Fisto shows up in the trailer, which is fantastic Fisto's in there spy cores in nor in there or deck man
 There's no hordak in the trailer, but Fisto's just just a coincidence in the IP. I'm sure Fisto's in it, but it's great
 I mean they start off with showing Adam in on earth and he's working for HR and they pan over his desk and it says
 Adam Glenn, which is you know, his mom's last name and
 It's got the he him pronouns on there, which is a hilarious joke. Of course. He's he him. He's you know he man
 Just fucking hilarious. Oh, so hilarious. I laughed so hard when it's
 Not only was it funny, it's also a litmus test
 How much would Paul hate that joke in any other movie? No
 It's a litmus test for people who can't stand pronoun shit
 And if you if you focus on that is like a negative thing and don't get it the joke of it all
 I don't I don't know hope for you. He's called he man. What the fuck
 He is all pronoun
 So then you know he goes into this toy shop
 Somehow he finds out that the power the power was the trailer if you're just gonna walk me through it
 This what we're doing is we're reacting to it
 Have you not watched any reaction videos do you not know how this how reaction and break down videos work
 I didn't know we were turning our podcast into a reaction video to the trailer. Oh, it wasn't what?
 That's what's happening. All right. Well, what do you want to talk about about it?
 My question to you was going to be why did you make Jacob and I watch this? What was your plan?
 You just revealed your plan so we could talk about it. Yeah. Yeah, I had already figured out that that was his plan, Matt
 And so I was about to pivot by saying Matt. Did you have any thoughts on the trailer? I
 Here's okay. Let me just address why I don't think it's gonna do the same thing Barbie did. Okay
 Barbie was a comedy
 Yes
 was like a really
 like fun comedy like Casper like really
 sophisticated comedic performers, right and
 It had a nice kind of feminist anthem and it was coming on with against Oppenheimer, which was incredibly masculine
 So there's a good way for like women to rally
 on opening weekend because
 There's a good any contention that just basically wasn't interested in watching a move a three-hour movie about a guy who invented the atomic bomb
 Was gonna maybe go. Yeah, it go out and have fun
 This I did the Barbie Heimer day. It was a great day. This movie is made for neither crowd
 I mean, he's made for kids. It's made for
 It's made for Paul
 That's what I think. I think it's really made for Paul because Paul you said you can make your kids watch it
 I'm trying to think if watching this trailer whether whether my kids would be into it or not. I'll find out
 I'll find that's what I want to know. That's what I want to know
 I want to know if a generation removed from all the hype has any interest at all if it does it
 Does it look interesting to people who don't already know what it is? Yeah, I'm seeing I'm seeing yes from a lot of people who don't
 Know in the chat tell us it in the chat
 I'm curious if you were not familiar with the he-man IP already
 Did this trailer make you make you want to watch it or
 Continue to not care about it. Mm-hmm. And actually like I I was just trying to make jokes. I mean, I'm not I
 Wasn't like oh what the fuck about this movie? I just was like, oh, this is kind of I basically like I thought the trailer's kind
 Of weird and I was like, who is this for? That's what I thought when I watch. Yeah. Well, I mean here's think
 We don't know
 How it's gonna be and I'm ready to hate it. I'm ready to hate it. I hated the first one. I did not like that
 Paul is always ready to hate movies about things that he loves
 That's what I mean, like I'm not I'm not leave Paul is sincerely prepared to hate this film
 This is a rare is though where I'm optimistic going in even after seeing the trailer. I'm just shocked that your optimistic me, too
 Believe me. I am as shocked as anyone. I was ready to just be like, oh fuck they did it again
 But no, this looks very hopeful to me when you text us last night to watch the trailer
 I thought it was that we were gonna rip it apart. No
 That you can rip it apart if you want to I've already erased my notes once I heard your change of the tone
 I raised my notes. No, do you have a fucking notes?
 My notes
 full of shit
 If there's anything that stood out to you is weird. I mean I was ever taken notes
 It's hard for them to it's hard for them to fight the whole Marvel influence. So that's clearly there
 Yeah, that's clearly there and they and they've definitely toned down the colors of everything
 So it's not quite like it's not that 80s bright
 I'm concerned, but it's also not as dark and dreary as the first movie. It's brighter than I'm first
 about the giant cartoon tiger
 You have concerns about Cringer and battle cat. I have concerns about the giant cartoon tiger and being able to take
 Scenes with the giant cartoon tiger seriously
 I mean see this is another thing that have two options to go with Cringer or battle cat and you insist on saying cartoon tiger
 I do because that's what it looks like in the trailer. He's a giant cartoon tiger. He's a giant cartoon tiger
 I don't know. I I there's something. I mean, I I'm a sucker for that kind of stuff. I'm a sucker for I
 Morphized kind of animals and I did love he man as a kid
 And I did love it because I loved Conan Conan the Barbarian. I definitely did
 Definitely did connect the two and like it. Yeah, accordingly
 And I watched the cartoon and stuff when I was younger
 I say I liked it. I liked the toys. I never really watched the cartoon
 You guys are younger than me. I watched Sierra. Yeah, no shit old man
 I know but you really are I mean I was that thing that fucking show got me right in the zone
 Like it hit me exactly right and I know I'm a victim of the Reaganomics
 Fair broadcast standards
 half-hour commercials
 Fuck every Gen X kid train them to buy shit thing. I know I know I
 Don't know
 I just I really I was impressed with what they're doing with the source material
 I'm pleased to see good performers in key roles Idris Elba as man-at-arms
 that is
 Idris Elba in the movie does definitely that is a
 Check in the plus column for sure. I was a brie is evil Lin. Sure. Alison Brie is awesome
 Um
 And I'm genuinely a bigger Jared Leto fan than you are in general. Well, that's great. And Monarella Buchanan is the sorceress
 in our from Firefly
 Nice like yeah, like that's a great choice for the sorceress
 They've made some really good choice and I don't know who the actress portraying Tila is but she looks wonderful, too
 And you know you talk about the whole feminist thing Matt
 I think not tequila tequila. It's not tequila tequila not get the role. I think you have to remember
 Matt that scoop shooter on the same page that
 Filmation did a really good job
 Of putting female characters forward in the time when that was not common like Tila was right there with Adam and and and he man
 Like she held her own
 She held her own same thing with the sorceress being the key to the whole secrets of greyskull and the leader of the of the whole
 You know good guy forum and then of course she were being the evolution of that and then it being a very female fronted show
 In fact, they hate women
 Who else hates women and that is the following sponsor
 By
 We shouldn't do this one, but I'll read it
 Bill Cosby's guide to consent with a new special forward by Sean pity P. Diddy combs
 That's an excellent joke we're moving on I'm reading that for haiku scoop, but we're moving on
 Yeah, this is much much cleaner
 Gloria's glory hole hand drill from the sound man scoop in 2021. That is
 Gloria's glory hole hand drill keep it clean
 Gloria I
 Heard you got a hand drill
 Drill I heard you use the hand drill
 Weeners ticking through the holes
 You don't have to use it if you don't want to it's fine
 Just leave it all behind
 hand drill Gloria
 Gloria
 Watch out for the wieners
 Gloria
 Here come extra wieners
 Sticking through the glory hole
 Grip them with the hand drill
 Don't touch them with your hands
 Your clients will understand
 Gloria's hand drill glory hole
 And her hate scoops to check out there you go
 No, what I will tell you Matt back in the day the Mattel executives were very upset because he man
 Was cutting into Barbie sales
 Because they had they had some female forward characters and especially when Princess of Power debuted
 You know, that's kind of why they so I hear you know, I don't mean to cut you off in that like I do it
 I didn't know no, no, I didn't process that. I was talking about like current marketing power and
 They have some great females of great prominent roles. The title is literally he man
 It's literally and the Masters of the universe and the Masters of the universe
 Is it what is it called he man in a Masters universe, I think this one might just be another Masters universe
 I can't remember. Okay. I don't know. I don't know
 I don't know who's got top billing. I can't tell you what I'm trying
 This is like that can all be true from a writing standpoint. It's not from a marketing standpoint, right? Like it's just not oh no for sure
 I didn't know it was called Masters of the universe
 Is called Masters of the universe great of the universe and it's femininity like there's nothing nothing about the trailer that I saw
 I was like, oh girl girls gonna love and rally around this that's no powering
 Well in the poster has you know, they do love man facing off against scale tour two dudes looking at each other to fight
 So yeah, I get that but it's not this it's not the same brand as as Barbie
 It's not but this is but this is like, you know when the Barbie I'm more like coming from this with like the Barbie
 versus Oppenheimer thing was such a phenomenon and everyone in Hollywood was racing to figure out what the takeaways were going to be and
 None of it seemed to be that women led things can be funny
 That said it was like we could do more movies with other toys and I don't know if that was the right take away from an executive
 Yes, but learn the wrong lesson or not. They've got good people on the project look
 Now maybe you know it is existing IP that's been out there and those are things that people want to make movies out of and so
 Yes for people like yourself and other people who grew up with him in and yeah
 Maybe my kids will their friends will want to go see it and they'll revitalize the franchise for the kids
 You have to do that. You have to try that. I mean you yeah
 Yeah, and scooper Nova girl in the chat is like what you don't think women won't love a mostly sexy naked man with abs fighting
 of course
 It's not you know, you can put me he meant some serious man candy
 He made point
 You know, so there's something he said there episode title
 He man candy that reminds me of a story I heard over the weekend of your good friend Murray Sawchuck, Jacob
 Yeah, I love Murray
 Guy played over this bit has just morphed into just being Murray just being genuinely good
 He gave me that amazing parking spot at his wedding. That's right
 Oh
 Someone said they're put a college gig and they're like you were so different than the last guy we had and I was like
 It wasn't they go
 They go Murray Sawchuck and he said sarcastically
 Did he show you his abs?
 And they giggled and said we touched his abs. Oh
 No
 Oh
 He does like an app parade
 Big part of his show the app parade you can have his autograph he can rub his abs and make a wish
 Just do it just do a pencil. They come true a pencil rubbing a charcoal rubbing of his abs
 Just you just push it against his abs and rub and get up
 Like like going to the going to the the wall with the Vietnam Memorial Vietnam Memorial. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I get how it goes
 That's crazy. Well
 Yeah, you know, I don't know. I'm just really excited for it
 I watched a couple reaction videos from many of the careers that I follow who are into action figures, of course
 Primarily pixel Dan. I wanted to get pixel Dan's take because I've been following him for decades now. You like talking man
 Pixel Dan is he wrote the book on he man
 He literally has the full compendium of all the action figures and all that kind of thing
 He did or every a review for every figure that came out in the classics line as I was collecting that line
 So he's how I kept up with it and he's got two young boys now himself and they of course know him as a toy
 Enthusiast his
 Livelihood is going to toy shows talking about toys creating toy videos
 So he drags them along to toy shops all the time
 They themselves are not really into he man those two his two young boys, right?
 Ah because that's dad's thing, you know, and that's been right things as he was kidding
 however
 When he showed them this trailer
 Then they asked to get the castles out and they're playing he man again after seeing this trailer
 Like you're right then like as an adult looking at singing is like derivative of Marvel
 But in terms of like what kids are growing up on they're growing up on Marvel movies
 So if it right if it feels like it scratches that it just probably to make kids more interested in seeing it
 Absolutely, and you know he man is a superhero. This is what it's what it's about. It's about empowerment
 That's what the whole superhero thing is about
 it's about empowerment and that's you know, I mean Marvel is no less guilty of going to the
 Lowest levels of marketing research to do, you know, I don't know if you're familiar with secret wars
 You familiar secret wars. Yeah, so that all came from just marketing
 Marketing meetings about what do kids like they love the word
 They love secrets and they love Star Wars slash wars and so they go. Oh, let's just do see
 Department of our government to the Department of War. Oh, yeah, that's what we love. That's what the kids love kids
 Don't that war and now it's a secret war that's going on in broad daylight that we can't really talk about
 So fun, so fun all these secret wars
 Where's the fucking Beyonder to fix this shit? No, he started he started it all we did Adam Warlock. That's what we need
 No, but that's the whole thing of
 Where do you find that say that you have a right to carry a thing?
 But they shoot you because you carry the thing. Do you have the right to carry the thing? I don't know
 Colleges is like
 It's a real head-scratcher there Jacob, yeah, yeah god damn it
 Fuck anyway, that's a part of it too. This is coming out like a week later
 So we should say like who knows what other atrocities have had. Oh god
 Yeah, that's true. We are we are recording this is like a couple days earlier than we usually record it
 So that is one of the two extra days
 Right one other thing about the Masters Universe property and the movie it filled me with some hope
 Which is something we're in desperate need of right now
 It's something what cinema should be focusing on for sure he meant yeah, and he man is a bright spot
 Masters Universe has been a big bright spot in my life and
 You know, I love the mythology behind it and that's the thing
 Like I said, they are adhering to the true lore and mythology. They're playing with it, but that's fine
 That's what it has to you have to do that
 You have to you know toy with it a bit
 But I love the interpretation so far of like the vehicles that I'm seeing
 And all that kind of thing like they've you know, it looks like rotons going through this guy
 But you couldn't have a roton looking like a fucking roton if it looks stupid, but it looks cool. It looks really cool
 What's the roton? What's the roton? The roton is the vehicle that you would push along and had a thing
 It looked like it. Well, it looked like a spaceship with a giant. What is it in the trailer?
 It's the spaceships that have like two a little orb being encircled by
 Got you a spinny big says that because the toy that was the toy with the it was on wheels, right?
 It had a wheel at the base and as you push the saw blade would rotate and it looked like it looks like a saw blade
 Around a car. Yeah, right
 Which as an adult, I recognize isn't terribly practical mark gates in the chat. Yes, you're exactly right
 Roton is the stuff you put in queso dip. Yeah, get yourself a can of roton and
 You are ready you are ready for some salsa
 Yeah, did you see the Superman trailer before the super movie came out? What did you think of it then?
 I did not watch the Superman trailer. I purposefully did not watch the Superman trailer to keep my
 surprise that you were an advocate of watching the trailer because you are
 Traditionally, I usually I know I know but this is so dear to my heart and I didn't want to get you couldn't help yourself
 I didn't want to get inadvertently spoiled. I was like, I'm just gonna go and take it in and I was pleasantly surprised
 You know, I'm just really I'm really enthused about the direction. I see so far. There's every possibility
 It's a shit show. We haven't heard any dialogue
 We haven't heard anything, you know who the fuck knows how the story is gonna play out, but it looks good
 Having Marlena give that gravitas of like we hid you away so you wouldn't be killed by these like there's real threat there
 I that's kind of cool
 You gotta send your child to another planet in order to not have him kidnapped by an evil space dictator. That's kind of neat
 That tells me that they're respecting the fact that adora was kidnapped in the past and that traumatized the fuck out of Marlena
 So she sent her child to another planet. That's big. I
 Don't know I
 Since the last starfighter
 Yeah, what'd you say Matt? Yeah, who are you gonna dress as when you go to see it in the theater? That's a good question
 I've been thinking about it already what I'm gonna do. I'm just gonna put on, you know, my favorite he-man shirt
 That's all I'll just put on my favorite Masters Universe shirt. You're just gonna show up as the OG
 You're just gonna show up and be like I've been here since the beginning. Mm-hmm, and I'm still here. Yeah, I mean, I'm a big guy
 I've always contemplated doing Ramman cosplay would go as orco thirsty scoop in the chat is right. I used to have
 I used to have an orco outfit. It didn't look good though
 It was one of those like hoodies that also had a mask and a silly hat. It was okay
 It just didn't look right. I ended up losing that in the move, but
 Yeah, an orco hasn't shown up yet. So that's another thing that could happen
 But that could be another thing like they might just they might just be pausing that for now. Does that's another whole thing?
 I'm gonna dress as an incredibly angry goose
 Everybody go like oh Fisto. I get it
 How fast I got that
 It is terrible it says bad things about me as a human being how fast I got that
 Pisto the goose. Oh
 my
 Yeah, so I don't know I'll go and then even
 Scooper Dover girl was asking early in the chat about popcorn buckets. I'm like, oh shit. Who knows who knows what kind of pop?
 Oh, yeah, they've had a collectible shit. You're gonna be oh, well, that's the whole thing
 They've already solicited like ten new figures and you know, who knows how long that line already. It's gonna be broke
 I'm already collecting three damn he-man lines as it is, you know
 Calm everyone preaching fun calm to be on the street. Help me afford
 Destitute please. He is gonna be on the street people is I need my plan teaching fun calm
 I need my plastic man McPheeters home
 What does it come out
 June 5th. Oh
 I believe so I'm so angry that it's not until June and we have to hear about this until June. No, no, no
 No, no. No, this was gonna be
 This is the big discussion. I wanted to have and again again
 I just want to lay it out there that I'm very hopeful. I'm very pleased with what I saw so far
 I am ready to shit on it if it turns out to be garbage, you know, I will you know, I hate I know
 You know, I hated that latest Tron movie. I love the soundtrack, you know, there's
 You know, I'm not I'm not partial to my IP. I'm not blind to the holes in my IP
 But that's also you hate things that you love the beautiful thing about
 Masters of the universe is that it really is a tool for imagination and exploration and
 Back when I played with my figures most of my Lord came from what I'd read in the little mini comics
 I I would ignore a lot of the
 Filmation stuff. I loved hordak. I
 Do not care for the filmation depiction of hordak at all. That is that's hashtag
 Not my hordak with that and snorting like a pig half the time. No, thank you. That's not that's not me
 That's just a weird that was a weird choice. So I said good day hordak. I do say good day hordak because he's a cool-looking villain
 So we'll see
 We'll see but I'm I can't wait. I teared up
 You know movie got to me the preview got to me. So, you know, it doesn't take much
 I'm on ice already. Well, the whole country's falling apart and then I see he man come hanging around. I'm like, oh
 Yeah, there you go
 Yeah, that's a really weird thing happened to me the other day. Uh-huh. What's that? I was walking down the strip and a
 party bus like a big limo party bus
 Which is not uncommon comes rolling down the strip right next to and I'm you know, I'm on Vegas Boulevard there
 I'm on the sidewalk walking down the road and
 that this bus has a
 Roll down windows. It's all the windows are rolled down and the whole thing is just filled with what looks like
 I don't know 13 year old girls 12 13 year old girls
 young tween girls and
 They are all leaned out the bus windows heading to the trunk. I'm the only I am the only person on the sidewalk
 Okay, I'm the only person around
 They are all leaned out the window and when they see me they all do the hand thing and yell six seven thing
 Okay, yes, and they keep on driving and I believe that has triggered a full midlife crisis
 They broke your brain I think they broke me I'm done god damn I am out
 This has I I stood there for a minute
 Just going I don't even know just dumbfounded, huh? Should I step into traffic should I?
 Just it's a rap, huh? What should I do now?
 And I'm walking like I am more than halfway through my life I really am
 Like I I have lived more years already that I'm probably going to live
 Yeah, that's that's probably true. Yeah
 That's a that's a way that's a hell of a way to measure it with that with that kind of event happening to really clock
 That but yeah, it's because those those children with their their Terminator vision, which they would have a reference
 To you and said old man engaged six seven him six seven him
 Also, I was like I wanted to go in and stop them and be like hey the six seven thing is out guys
 That's done. I don't know where you guys have been but that's that is simply out. I know that it's weird that you don't
 I'm so sorry Jacob. Thank you. Thank you
 Continues to be dramatic if it's any dramatic if it's any consolation, I think you've lived at least two-thirds of your life, you know
 See this is another thing Jacob
 you know if you were like me and you were obsessed with a childhood toy property for the majority of your existence and
 and and
 You know even when there was lean times even when nobody was talking about the universe
 You were in it in it to win it and now take that away from you
 You know what I mean, but this is the thing back. I feel like Jacob think if they were making an Archie Manning video
 Oh
 Now I get it now I thank you Matt for clarifying that now I understand
 That's what it that is what it does though. It does kind of give you the level of like a Bobby a bear documentary
 The deep cut for you fucking Saints fans out there
 Of
 tweens on a bus yelling at me
 To pass the time we took in a comedy special Eric Dillman recommended his friend Renan Hirschberg on YouTube
 Okay, his newest specials called morbidly Jewish
 And I won't try to do anything but you're too much from it
 But the one thing really made me what lots of made me laugh really hard at it. But what was he goes, you know?
 Harry Potter got in trouble for like, you know having you know
 The people run in the bank or these like goblin people and they were like, oh, that's it. Yeah
 the green gods and that's anti-semitic and he goes
 Isn't watching made-up creatures and thinking they're Jewish stereotypes more anti-semitic than the green gods being anti-semitic
 I put nothing path JK Rowling though. She's right intentions
 Actually, you know, she meant all
 Definitely if you have a chance to got morbidly Jewish on you, that sounds funny. Nice. What's his name again, Renan Hirschberg?
 Ra a na n you say he's Jewish. I
 Yes, okay
 Let's do a little scooperty here we got a scooper here from Smitty scoop here like you know, I'm from New Jersey Paul, right?
 Uh-huh. That's how you'll know that he's Jewish got it. Yeah
 Because Matt Donnelly told you you got it
 Gentlemen, well Matt won the first Smitty scooperty of 2026

 The name of the wife I got to pass. I don't know
 I love that Smitty scooperty is the one thing driving me to finally watch an episode of everyone loves Raymond, but

 Hooray for me. Did you know that or did you guess it's a guess it was either 9 or 12. Oh
 Matt you're up. Oh, yeah, cuz you'd have to hit the triple 20 you have to get just right every time until hitting the until
 Hitting the double bulls. Yes. I guess you'd have to hit the bulls eye at one point. But yeah, whatever
