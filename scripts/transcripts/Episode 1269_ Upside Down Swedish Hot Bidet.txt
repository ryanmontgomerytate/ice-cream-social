 Why does the black flat cap feel more pretentious than the other caps it looks good
 I would say it is no more or less pretentious than your other cap. Thank you. Definitely looks very peaky blinders
 Yeah, that's what I mean. You look like you look like you're you're you're a bit of a patty enforcer
 You are a patty enforcer, man. Hello. This is my favorite part of this show my drag name
 This is the part of this show where we thank you the ice cream truck drivers
 Thank you ice cream truck drivers. I don't have a new list for the month yet
 We want to thank each and every ice cream truck driver
 And we will we will thank each and every one of you by name before this month is over
 If you want to be an ice cream truck driver, maybe you just want to be a patty driver
 I don't know head on over to preaching fun comm preaching fun comm is we're gonna sign up to be an ice cream truck driver
 And who knows?
 Life you save maybe your own
 It's time for a program. Hey Johnny. Do you want to go to an ice cream social? Yeah, I'd love to great. Let's go
 A bunch of where the fuck were you? It's time for Matt Maddly's ice cream social sitting in prison. That's Matt
 Pittsburgh that's called Maddie Lee. I'm Jacob in Vegas
 We're preaching fun fun. So I I know exactly what you're talking about that big
 Nabi thing I have one too
 Yes, so it's the
 Shore the shore little
 microphone connector
 Adapted to an XLR connection is what you're referring to and it gives power right? It gives power to the microphone
 Yeah, the the your your recorder is sending phantom power to it as well, which is I think
 Forty something volts. I don't remember what it is. So I you know pack my heaviest stuff and put it on my carry-on
 To get weight out of my case for when I travel with my magic stuff
 Ah, so one of the items is shackles. They're actual iron shackles
 And then my jar of rings
 My thing of rope and so I got it got pulled out at the Fort Lauderdale Airport
 and I
 You know
 I'm thinking it's gonna be about the shackles which only one time someone was like you can't you can't travel with these and I was
 Like oh, I sure can and for some reason that worked and then they let me go
 Yeah, I was like no I travel with them all the time
 And and all of a sudden he goes. Oh, it's this right here and he pulls out the microphone
 I go what he goes this is this adapter and the x-ray looks like it looks like a high caliber of bullets
 That's it my high caliber bullets is this guy bit x-ray my singular shot my my one
 My one high caliber bullet. I'm taking with me to assassinate the pilot from the back of the plan with my sniper rifle
 back and to the left
 Matt the man with the golden
 Donnelly exactly
 Don't mind me carry just just carries one bullet. Just the jackal making my way through the Florida Airport
 I'm actually shooting my target is at the Miami Airport. I'm that good. I'm shooting high wind
 From one airport to another it's one of those check the wind first. Yeah. Yeah, it's a whole big thing
 It's like one giant bullet will be traveling into a private jet taking out from Miami Airport
 Don't be traveling via private jet
 Yes, and it's not shot out of a gun because I didn't pack that so it's I just I just wheel my shackles like a slingshot
 And they put the bullet in there and I sling it like David and then boom
 And then as long as you do it in the plane
 Then the bullet is traveling at the speed of the plane in addition to the speed that the earth is already rotating
 All the velocity I need just comes from the flight itself. I just have to drop the bullet out the window
 It's like throwing pennies off the Empire State Building
 That's why I always request the seat with the rolled out window that
 the
 proposition that you're creating the
 Strategic crazy scenario you're creating could actually be the plot of an episode of Gogo 13
 Gogo 13, he's an incredible assassin and it one of my favorite anime
 Anime and manga of all time and Gogo 13 does constantly those kinds of
 Impossible assassinations that he's just a gun for hire. He's like this cold
 Merciless killer you pay him enough money
 He will do whatever needs to be done and then the investigators are always this close to figuring out
 But then they're like no fucking way. Could anybody do this?
 Line a lot of other things should use that same plot line and then they go back then they go back and they go
 Oh fuck. He did do that
 Then they show you how he fucking did it and it's like what holy shit. Yeah, go go 13 is
 Unstoppable
 Bossy says I'm actually just throwing it like a dart from the back of the plane to hit the pilot. Just yeah
 The physics physics checks out nobody check it but the physics checks
 All you do is hold it in your body run the numbers hold it in your hand
 While you're landing and then just let go and let let gravity do the work. That's right
 Like don't like my idea is when they jump up and down inside of an elevator. Uh-huh
 Yeah, same same thing. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah
 All right
 Are any of you?
 watching land man
 No, man, I love land man. Okay, we have we haven't started the new season yet, but we burned through the first season
 I hung back until those four episodes and now I'm four episodes caught up with a new season is this who is this?
 Who's the land is Billy Bob Thornton Thornton?
 Demi Moore is in it. Oh, he's fantastic
 Yeah, the whole cast is really killer. Okay, Myron chat. She's not willing to pay for paramount respect respect on that
 There's just there are websites you can go to have to sail the seas
 Now you just gotta start now go the full other direction Myron steal steal the show
 So
 Landman for those who don't watch the show. It's the most popular show on paramount plus and Billy Bob Thornton plays a grizzled
 foul-mouth
 Smoking land man where he is there meaning what?
 So land man are people who own oil fields small smaller oil operators, right?
 I weren't working for the big guns, but they're just trying to get by
 Which is definitely something that Matt and I knew before watching land man. Sure
 What is it? So Taylor Sheridan for whether you want to whether you want to go with cause or symptom?
 He is simply basically between Yellowstone and mayor of Kingstown, you know
 in
 1923 and these shows like he basically
 takes pockets of where white dudes might feel obsolete and
 Gives them monologues and speeches that that kind of build up, you know, these these broken ways of life, right?
 And here's the thing. I
 Actually like at first like used to I feel conflicted about this right here because this is you know
 The way of the way this country is going right now
 It seems like that's that's a big force behind a big imaginary force behind a lot of a lot of actions being taken
 Yeah
 I'm doing a show on the on the cruise ship and I get this guy up on stage and he is
 Basically me like one point five me in size like exact body type just six foot five
 and just a little wider and thick arms or whatever and
 I
 say
 You know, hi, you know, what do you do for a living?
 You know, do you work that kind of stuff and he goes I work in the oil and gas distribution from Texas
 Yes
 Yes, and I say because basis like my dad growing up hated law shows
 See hated the way the law was portrayed
 On television and it made people assume stupid questions all the time
 So I wonder if that's better or worse now or if it's just the same
 For like new legal dramas because I feel like the new legal dramas try to stay more true to the law
 They don't ones do but like they're still ridiculous legally
 Yeah, my dad was just laughs like how quickly they can like get like lab results and stuff like that
 Like he's just like big in lab results like the next day or the same Leon in the chat is saying they are not much better
 Jacob
 Okay. Yeah, right
 Leon is our barrister. He's yes our law he's there Leon. He's our law man
 We need a law man, so I say
 Do you love or hate the show land man
 Good and he like literally turns to me
 Like like doesn't doesn't like he's like we're not having a conversation. He just turns to me and he goes, oh
 That is the most accurate portrayal of the oil and gas
 I have ever seen on TV or movies and he almost has tears in his eyes
 You know now there is fascinating shit in the show there is shit that you do not you never thought about the oil and gas
 industry sure there is like really they really do do a good job of like
 Villages where the where the workers like live like the box house villages, you know things like that
 It's it's really fascinating. It's neat stuff. There's one was like there's an there's an oil
 Area left all alone and therefore there's like a toxicity thing that can happen
 And so they come across dead bodies and then also they go what's going on on the alarms go off on their uniforms and they go
 running
 So they don't die and you're like, oh right. I had no idea no idea that that kind of scenario
 There are electronic canaries in the coal mine now. Yeah. Yeah, they've got yeah
 It's a little like gas meters and by the way the same thing for I think nuclear stuff by the way, Matt
 I know this wasn't intentional, but you just basically told a Trump rally story
 Saying there was big guy big guy came up to me and I turned to him and I said
 Do you like land man or not? And with tears in his eyes big guy big guy tears in his eyes
 I love land man. He tells me let me people are saying people and with that I'll finish out
 He said no one's ever asked me about land man before only you know, I'm joking
 I didn't take the turn. All about no one ever knows it's all about me and how I'm unique
 He looked at me with tears in his eyes and said that is the best question anyone has ever asked me about land man
 Sensational question such a good question giant men who weep
 You asked the best questions Matt not only my noodler. So it's it is teaching you all kinds of
 Actual tricks of the trade within the land man community. It is like any good show and that is a voyeur
 It's a it's a voyeuristic, you know
 Thing where you're getting eating a pocket of the world. You wouldn't normally get a pocket out of right?
 It's still filled with its weird weird monologues, you know and things like that
 The season opens with Billy Bob doing a big monologue about breakfast and like the waitress is the most important meal of day and he
 Just lectures her about who profits from breakfast and blah blah blah blah and it's just Taylor shared
 It just has these monologues that are just atrocious
 and one-dimensional
 But you tolerate Billy Bob Thornton or Kevin Costner doing them, right? It's almost like a challenge, you know, I
 Can do this I got this
 Yeah, all I do watching land man all I do is talk like Billy Bob Thornton the entire time and it makes SJ really happy
 No, but I was trying I was trying to think about my man on the ship and I was trying to think about like
 Even he came up on like my family call like one of my brothers is really into it
 my brother's thinks it's a piece of shit show right and it was kind of like right, you know them fighting words and
 I mean I kind of I get both arguments
 Everyone's right
 but you know we talk on this like these these weird times and I and I and I was basically kind of like
 thinking about
 Basically, it's the word obsolete
 That okay, that is the word like I've been trying to find a way
 to put my
 To encapsulate I think attention that's driving all this shitty decisions
 Like I think like so many things that are shitty about this world are not you know themselves?
 I think caused by one thing. I think they were dominoes were pushed, right?
 Whether we're talking about like trumpism or you know iced tensions that kind of stuff like all these crazy shit that's happening
 Uh-huh, and I think like if I'm trying if it was
 As I go my walks, I was thinking about my friend on the other ship and then my brother's fighting and and I was like I
 think that like part of
 Like AI and technology and basically tech tech has taken all of the money, right and
 All of the talent and now has seized all of the power right like like tech runs
 Washington and Tex runs all of media now, right?
 And the billion and the billionaires are more richer than us than ever
 Right, and then I think like basically like we're all afraid of
 Our ways of life becoming obsolete from one facet or another because of this right? Okay. Yes. I see what you mean now
 yeah, and so like if I feel like shit is on my doorstep and
 You tell me to help other people because they're doing something
 experiencing something less fortunate and
 I feel like no one's talking about what's making my life unfortunate
 Right, like if I feel like I'm cool and not obsolete if I feel like I am thriving and you tell me to help somebody else
 Yeah, I go like cool. No problem
 But if you come to me and say, you know, no one's doing stuff about these poor people over here
 And you're like wait mom about to lose my whole fucking way of life
 Yeah, I just got back from the food bank and you're telling me that this is a problem over here
 And I don't process that tension properly, right? I don't process that like I think my way of life is going away
 Right, you know like even we do on our show we were do we're like, oh, we're just three white dudes talking
 Right and so like we reduce ourselves to be like wait the world should be more diverse. We're not diverse enough
 We're getting older. We're done with mainstream things. We're over here in our little pocket, right?
 like we do to ourselves a little bit, you know, I would say actually Paul's probably the biggest voice that fights against it and
 Like and then you tell us to help go help something else is there's a little bit like I'm trying to fucking hold it down here
 Right, but you don't want to admit that you don't want to admit that I'm trying to hold it down
 You don't want to admit that you're afraid of losing it all right
 You want to have pride and stuff like that. So I feel like this ups and then I think the the
 Lockdown and pandemic just poured accelerant all over this tension
 And I think like it's really hard to shake that feeling
 So like I'm thinking that like I think that's a way
 To fight against what we're doing in a positive way
 I think you have to identify if someone is feeling like they're being made to feel obsolete
 And you have to find ways in yourself and other people make them feel like they can thrive and I feel like if you do
 That that would be the first way to put a some force against what we're doing
 It's a very deep thought it was on my mind
 It is all because I was watching land man and we can we can talk about something else
 I have a very embarrassing story to follow up with this if this goes nowhere, but
 But well, I think you're seeing it now that
 the ultimate solution
 For people in a political place where what they're doing is terribly unpopular
 Their ultimate solution is I'm going to give people money
 But unfortunately that should always be the thing the government should be helping
 the citizenry
 To elevate their standard of living constantly. Yeah, we came up we came out of the pandemic with the wrong lessons learned
 when they did help bolster us and give us what was tantamount to a
 Basic, you know median basic income, right? You know subsidy
 Yes, which we've got and and you spoke by the way. Here's your money back, right?
 But we spoke to pride if that's exactly right Jacob and we spoke we spoke to pride right or you talked about that
 Yeah, we need to look at that in a whole nother way
 We have conditioned a generation to look at any benefit coming from the government as something unnecessary
 shameful and to be repelled
 Right, which is crazy
 Because what are you paying them for then if not not work for you? We're all working together
 They are our society to our our representatives. They are our representatives
 They are to represent our interests and if our interests currently require that we get some kind of financial
 Benefits and incentives to move forward in proper way. Not just certain groups is that's what's happening already
 Farmers are getting a lot of incentives real soon
 Yeah again yet again, and it's still not gonna be enough
 But we don't even have to we don't even have to bag on the farmers
 No, I can just talk about the things we're already talking about. Let's just talk about the people in the oil industry
 Oh, we're just being handed money fucking forget about it. Yeah, exactly
 People who are being handed money for no reason, but when but when little
 People look at the same kind of thing we have we have been
 Socially engineered to be like, oh no, I don't need anything. I don't need help. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's a handout
 It's a handout on the small scale on the large scale. It's capitalism, right?
 Yeah, no, I mean, yeah, it's it's it is strange and complicated are it's bizarre
 And and yet these giant men coming to you with tears in their eyes
 No, I'll tell you who else has giant men coming on them with tears in their eyes all the time wait
 I didn't get that part of the story yet
 That's the following sponsor today's show is brought to you by the fine people providers purveyors and makers of
 Greek yogurt, that's right. It's just a commercial for Greek yogurt for 2022. That's from the scoop Henley
 We're talking about Greek yogurt
 right
 that that it that it that it that it that it that it
 Hey
 bison
 You needed some yogurt. I got you. I got you. What do you need?
 Come on over. He said a good Greek stuff. Yeah. Yeah
 This here yogurt got a little bit of the tomato and a basil, huh? Yeah fresh from the Greek island
 That that that that that that that that that that that hey, why don't you put a little is a Greek yogurt all over your piece?
 of pie
 Over your piece of pie. How about you put a little bit in it inside of the pasta sauce, huh?
 And just a little bit of zest now. That's a Greek
 Hey when you're here you the family
 Extra Greek yogurt everybody with a breadstick. Yum. Yum. Yum
 Hey
 Pasta fazul a Greek yogurt. Mmm. Yummy. Yummy
 Mangia
 Yeah, no, I don't think me it like like basically while I was wrapped up in that beautiful commercial
 Sure oil tree sure the farms sure all of college sure all of medicine sure all like like we have been quietly
 Always training wheels and pushing every industry, right? And so, you know
 We have never the successful industries, right?
 And so like we have never
 Been a purely capitalistic thing but as soon as we want to point at something and say stop doing that we say like see
 It's not capitalism. It's socialism but raw
 but the truth is we've buttressed our entire country almost every aspect of our lives with government effort and
 It's been successful. Like it's what's made America
 And so it's like we improv Matt improv
 Improv in all of its forms
 Vallis Bolan was paid by the federal government
 This is again an initiation of theater games for children during the Great Depression
 Yeah
 Improvisation is germinated from that government investment an entire my life
 My life from this woman's brilliance and the government funding that made it possible for her to do
 That's it. I agree the only way for improv comedy to be successful is to have government backing
 It's the fucking fact. I would love to have a little look government jingle in my pocket every time I was teaching
 Holy shit make things real smooth, but just in general that needs to be
 yeah, we and I mean art is the first thing that gets it in the dick and
 Yeah, you know and that's things like so like I mean, we're very much out of our depths in terms of talking specifically about
 Hello
 But I think part of like we're trying to get people to chill is to be like is a little bit of a wake-up like hey
 We've been kind of doing this with everything the whole time and it's not just just the lefties
 It's not just the righties and it's not just what I'm so mad. What you're saying is the solution to this might be
 Education. Oh good
 good
 Then that's assured that we're gonna move forward in a positive direction then because that's gonna be a priority going forward
 Linda fucking McMahon
 Is running of all things I can't even watch WWE anymore
 Not even no, not even like recap shit. Nothing. I haven't watched it for like a year. It's terrible
 It's just like this is your it's the oh, it's because real like a professional wrestling
 I know it's done so much damage to the earth. I
 Listen to the whole fucking planet. They're gonna have a fucking UFC fight
 By the same company
 Gonna go
 Yeah, you're right
 I'm definitely gonna go ice cream socials going to the UFC fight on the front
 Press pass, of course, although. Oh, did you turn out ever did you see the explosive new?
 Confession I don't know what you'd have you how you actually say it. Are you familiar with the
 Canadian screw job
 Yes, the Montreal Montreal screw job, right? Oh this this is the the the Bret Hart thing Michael's
 What happened so Bret Hart was wrestling in his hometown
 he was gonna retire from the WWE or leave the WWE go somewhere else or whatever and
 They said you have to turn over your heavyweight belt to the new upcoming star Sean Michaels
 And he said not in Montreal not in my home city. Like we have to we'll have to do it another at another match
 Okay, and it's like this is where I'm from and this is where I can he's a lot of pride in me being the heavyweight champion
 you know, we'll do a fight there, but it's got to be a different time and
 Vince McMahon and Shawn Michaels colluded behind Bret Hart's back and the Bret Hart
 Is fighting out of some chokehold or something like that and gets basically called out and loses the match and the look on his face
 When the bell goes off and thing is over this and they're gonna give Shawn Michaels the belt the look on his face is
 Crazy and it is a famously
 When the most moment in WWE where they broke quote-unquote k-fabe, right?
 When it's a very shoot moment. Yeah, meaning it was happening for real
 It was happening for real and I think Brett wouldn't like punched Victor convinced McMahon
 I think like or something like that. At least spit on him. I think according to this he spit on him
 Yeah, spit on him and maybe punched him too. Yeah. Yeah
 so but it made so much news that they had to break k-fabe to break the the the
 fakeness of wrestling because it was it was leaking out that this was a crazy thing that happened behind the scene. Uh-huh. Well
 Bret Hart has just this past week come out and said
 You know Vince McMahon would always come on these specials whenever they were talking about the Montreal screw job and Vince's famous quote was
 We didn't screw Brett Brett screwed Brett
 Right. That was his favorite. Okay
 well
 according to Brett Hart
 It may be more accurate to say
 Vince screwed Shawn Michaels
 Wait, there is a rumor now
 Hart has put forth that
 Michaels and Vince McMahon mate where hat were flatmates at that point and that is a big reason why
 Vince put the belt on him and went through all that rigmarole because that was his current love boy
 I find it hard to believe that you can sleep your way to the top and WWE under Vince McMahon
 I know right unless you're willing to take a shit directly to the face
 It's not really uh, you're not your career's not really going to of course. This is what happened. This is obviously what happened
 This big man is a depraved animal. So the Montreal mudslide proceeded the Montreal
 Exactly exactly and that's how Brett that's how Shawn lost his smile because he got shit
 Yeah
 Pretty ridiculous pretty finally something that we know about the Leon saying it's the Montreal steamer. That's right
 That's a good one Leon. Yeah, so that's I didn't I didn't look into it too far
 I just heard enough from what I heard and I was like, okay, but
 Brett's usually a pretty straight shooter
 Or he knows this is the most scathing thing you can say about Vince McMahon
 I may maybe but why now? I guess cuz I don't know I think is he just was that your limitation
 He wants to kick him in the nuts. Yeah, maybe he just wants to yeah
 He would have come out I did follow this a little bit and I think it would have come out sooner had this actually been
 the case
 Really? Don't you think they didn't?
 Know media if you know anything about the ring boy scandals and all the other bullshit
 That's been going on and all this stuff that's followed the McMahons around for decades
 It's only really been having a light shown on it very recently that's had any kind of
 Consequence or public discussion about it. All right, that's reached. I hear you. I hear that. I hear that that makes sense
 Yeah, so I feel like yeah, I feel like there's a great deal more scrutiny
 I just think we're more attuned to it now and it's one of those things where back in the day
 You get stuff like that. Wow, he's a he's a very successful man. Of course, he's got haters, you know
 Of course, there's people after him and gonna start rumors and stuff
 But now with all the things that we do know about him and his and his crew
 And I don't I don't want to stick my neck out
 I don't want to you know stepping at the way these guys are they can be very litigious, but I don't think he's really that
 Damn, I think that's I think that's fake
 I think basic man as a fake
 Don't sue me up
 Okay, okay. That was that's Matt at hey scoops.com. That's who said that
 Tan is real. I think he's just I think he's just in a tanning bed. I don't think he uses like oh, yeah
 He's gone out of the beach
 No, so let's fight about that. No, so I speak of the wrestling
 I've grown to love John Cena as peacemaker and John Cena as a comedic actor
 Sure, and I never watched any wrestling with John Cena. Okay
 So five five move Charlie
 So he sat down to do an interview with Bill Simmons
 My favorite sports podcaster and talked to him for like over an hour. I was like, alright, let's do it
 And then it was all about his wrestling career and man
 You couldn't pay me to ever listen to John Cena talk about his wrestling career ever again
 The problem with that so I bought the I bought the problem with that ball one of the problem
 I bought the WWE game from I'm gonna say three years ago two years ago three. Okay three years ago and
 Let's say three. Let's say three. Whatever
 the
 Conceit of this one was Cena right, but not only Cena it was
 Cena recapping his biggest losses
 So that's the story mode that you play through you play through you play through as John Cena
 Through his biggest losses
 Yeah, and the thing and he he entered he is interviewed between each match
 Talking about what he learned and what the atmosphere was like during this match and special things about the opponent
 I kind of thing and it just comes off so crazy
 Because like it's very
 This isn't real right right it's not real things he's saying aren't really reason
 Oh boy, I knew coming into that ring. It was gonna be a real slobberknocker going
 I knew my competition with Andre the giant was gonna be exactly. It's like well, I don't think you ever fought Andre
 But like an example because I listened to this fucking interview yeah like he had to lose very badly
 To Brock Lesnar so that okay put up against Brock Lesnar would be then considered
 so
 Amazingly great that they had to be a champion so in order to put I think it was Roman Reigns
 The belts he had to get beat beat up by Brock Lesnar very badly that'd be okay
 They talked about like trying to like you know way that now hard that was physically and everything else and you know
 It's not it shouldn't be
 Correctly no one gets hurt. I mean yes, it's painful. It's stressful. It's very athletic
 But you shouldn't be injuring people. It's dangerous shit. It's dangerous
 Okay, hold on because I want to come back to this we do have to go to a sponsor real quick
 but I want to come back to this so we're putting a pin in this and
 We're gonna talk about this right after we get back from the following sponsor who?
 Also, I don't know. Where's a lot of tight spandex shit
 Today's show is brought to you by tube
 your
 Colossus your one-stop shop for tubes tube irk. Oh to
 tuberculosis tuberculosis
 tuberculosis tuberculosis
 Jacob go over tube urkulosis toss it to me
 Following sponsor today shows, but you might tube urkulosis your one-stop shop for tubes
 Nailed it Bell's a triple scoop 2025 go fuck yourself
 Welcome to tuberculosis
 Your one place to buy tubes. Yeah, I just need a tube
 What kind of tube do you want? Oh?
 It'll be a drainage tube. How about a cathode ray tube for televisions?
 I just needed a drainage tube for a for an ice maker
 and
 Drainage tube would you like one constructed from?
 PVC
 Yeah, that that seems yeah, it seems good very well follow me to the PVC
 tubile here at
 tuberculosis
 the largest tube store in all of
 Transylvania oh
 I didn't see the PVC aisle over here. Yeah, this is good. This is I I can find what I need here
 Thanks for your help very well. I leave you to the aisle
 Let's see. I just need a continue your shopping on them on molested
 Yeah, yep, yep, thanks
 Find what you need
 No, no not yet. You haven't you never left. I have other options. We have all tubes
 How about something few people think of we have two worms?
 two
 worms here at
 tuberculosis
 Worms, whatever you want place them inside of you the children of the night
 What beautiful music to make oh?
 Ever heard the worms make music they ever heard them sing in the moonlight
 No, well you could get some and do it and the best way to hear them is by listening through a tube
 It will amplify the worm song
 You know I thought you were nuts when I came in here, but you're winning me over, but I don't have any nuts just to
 Enter a check out
 That's a good sponsor seems like a good company. Oh, they are great. I don't know how they make any money I
 Think from this just let people buy the tubes they want but the guy doesn't have any fasteners
 Tubes ain't worth shit loose tube loose tube loose tube don't do fuck for you
 So I'm thinking about pro wrestling now. Oh, oh danger zone is there
 Is it just impossible for people to pretend that someone is better?
 Than us or has won a championship or something like that
 Is it just impossible for us to just pretend that that's happening do we do we just fall into?
 The trap of this is real every time
 Is that why it matters to the WWF people or WWE people who wears the the fake championship belt?
 It's so strange because like I guess
 Cena on this last trip around
 Came close to if not
 eclipsed Rick Flair's
 title runs I
 Has I have seen that yeah, because it's seen it seen as like I don't remember it
 Couple more time 18 or 19 time world champion something like that. Yeah. Yeah anyway, it's but it just like one or two
 above Rick Flair
 but you know
 What does it mean but having having the belt doesn't it doesn't actually mean you haven't actually won
 You can't win it 17 times if you don't lose it 16. So I think the fuck is that I think
 Good point. That's just good. That's also true. That's math. That's that's just the math checks out on what Paul just said
 But I mean like really like you guys there's 16 guys who are clearly better than you
 They are still beholden to the crowd
 The crowd the live crowds and they're in and their audiences for sure. Yes, if they make the wrong person champion
 They hear about it, right? Oh, yes
 You know it matters it matters for their business that certainly matters. Yeah
 So there's like I'm thinking of is more of like the mental
 Is it is it possible for human beings to pretend that someone is the champion?
 Without kind of falling into that trap
 Well, I think we should have every mouth finger butthole champion on this podcast come back on and talk about their lives after
 Winning mouth good boy. Good boy. I don't know eyes have changed you watch enough of that wrestling and it just gets
 It gets crazy
 I'll never know I will never I will not put myself to that test
 My kids I would have if my kids got into wrestling I would have my kids did not get into wrestling
 Yeah, and I think thank goodness and I still love the old classic goofy shit
 I think it's funny as hell, but I appreciate it just for the the goofiness of it all
 But then you start if you start to really scratch at it. It just gets sad real fast
 You know, well, you know most things, you know, they're they're playing a spots on me
 If you scratch at them long enough, it gets real sad. I
 Often just stare at Jacob until I feel sad
 That's basically what I do to get it going just stare at Jacob while he's scratching when I want to drum up your sadness
 Do that?
 Paul yes, what are you asking for your wife for yourself for Christmas? Oh
 nothing
 Do you guys get each other stuff? Yeah, I got I got and a
 New coffee maker and a giant and of Green Gables box set. Oh, by the way
 Yeah, I want to step on this for a second the amount of like
 Ho-ho-ho someone works for Starbucks didn't have a good coffee maker at home
 Stop pretending like every fucking employee of Starbucks becomes like some coffee goddess where they have to be like
 Instruments or whatever like it was possible to be a regular human being with an aged coffee maker
 This is the problem get a job at Starbucks. It was only it was only like three years old
 It was a good coffee maker. It just happened to get a stink bug in it and that made her physically unable
 Look at the coffee maker anymore
 She legit just vomited everywhere. She couldn't look at the machine anymore without getting physically sick
 That's the there was nothing wrong with this coffee maker. It was fancy Dan
 You know you press the shit and the new one. I got her fucking fancy Dan
 It's got a milk steamer thing on it and all kind of hoodly-hoo. It's fancy. It's a nice coffee maker
 It was like, you know almost $200 coffee maker that I got on super sale at my old Target
 So that is now paying for itself there a little bit milk that milk spritzer doubles as a Swedish hot bidet
 If you use it properly an upside-down Swedish hot. Oh, you just gave me a nightmare. Oh
 God damn talk about oh for fuck's sake to the Swedish hot bidet
 I can think a few things more horrific then
 Superheated items up the asshole and I know that was a medieval staple slow nowadays
 Oh, come on take talk it slower. No, no, no
 How hot is hot what I just what would you do like the the original the original pain?
 of a blistering asshole and then
 What happens after that's even worse, oh my god, oh
 What happens after you shoot stevie milk into your asshole then the trouble start that's what I but it really does it
 It's Pandora's box
 It's Pandora's butthole
 You have opened Pandora's butthole and she will never shit right again
 My wife and I decided last night to not get anything for each other for our anniversary. Our anniversary is December 27th, right?
 Leon's got the same situation in the chat here. His December 25th is
 Birthday Christmas and anniversary January 3rd. He married the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. He did
 Somebody's got to I'm gonna January 3rd. Hey, technically my mom did for a while
 That's true. She was a bride of Christ. That's right. Yep. Well that's separation. That's what she get it

 Anniversary is right after it. And so this year we're just we're gonna take a trip
 We've loosely decided there will be a trip for the anniversary at some point. Nice. Well, that is probably
 Your guys's love language if I can be corny, I think so, right?
 I think so like I don't think you guys care about getting each other jewelry
 We get we are people that especially me. I mean, I'm worse about it than SJ is if there's something I want
 I usually just get it same
 Like in November SJ's like quit buying yourself stuff. Other people need to be able to buy you things for Christmas
 I just my luggage. Oh man, so I was
 carrying
 So I get I get off of the ship at Fort Lauderdale and there's a place about about five blocks away
 You got to go down down to the light make a left about five blocks is Joe's Cafe old-fashioned diner
 And after you've had like deluxe
 fucking opulent cruise ship food for
 For me two meals a day
 You just go like oh a diner with regular fucking eggs and regular fucking bacon
 Let's go and I often just you know, skip the uber line skip it. It's it's chaos in the port, right?
 So you just I just drag my bags
 This this trip I specifically was only doing 20-minute sets
 So I tried to only have one case and so I'm dragging my stuff and I'm going like man
 My case is heavy. I could put too much stuff in this case and I get all the way
 To Joe's and I don't realize I'm like covered in sweat
 And then I look and at some point at some point I busted a wheel off of my giant case and I didn't realize
 I was and I didn't realize I was fucking lugging you were just dragging
 Dragging a case for blocks. Did it recognize I was sweating? Yeah. No, it's it's toast, right? Oh, yeah
 So I should ask for luggage for Christmas when said I went on Amazon immediately ordered myself a luggage thing that I wanted
 And
 But I was laughing at like I thought I packed too much stuff and instead I lugged something like an ogre
 like half a mile
 And I was like so gross. I didn't realize how gross I was I go like go to get a table and I'm like just like
 Like the waitress is like, you know, okay, can I get you water and I was like using the napkins like wipe?
 Cuz it's yeah Florida Florida humidity and I was like, oh, yeah, I just was the swamp
 Monster sitting down at the diner was so gross
 But yeah, I should have made me bacon bring it to me now
 I'm hungry. I have a thirst bring me coffee
 But yeah, so I should have I should have asked for luggage but I just got myself it
 So you guys had terrible about skip the anniversary December 27th anniversary, do you do Christmas gifts?
 We'll do Christmas gifts. Yeah, we're gonna we're gonna go out of town. We're gonna see family
 Actually, we're gonna we're recording double today
 Because because Matt and I are both in and out of town and around next week
 But yeah, we're gonna go see some family and do a little dual holiday stuff with them
 And then we'll do as she and I do do gifts for each other
 But I mean, well, we'll see we'll see what happens. She
 You're not a jewelry person, right? She doesn't get you a fancy watch or something like that
 but she might give me a little a little not a watch no, but she might get me like a
 Like a ring or a bracelet or something like that every now and then but not not usually no
 Yeah, well, she's got to worry about how much weight you're putting on that hand the back of the hand, right? That's right
 Another cotton ring
 Always did on her own tart. Yeah
 Saw the joke it didn't really you think about the consequences but
 That's what she's oh I thought about the consequences. I was fine with them. Yeah
 But like fancy dinner, do you think like a fancy dinner is your one of your go-tos?
 Yeah, well, we'll do like a like some kind of fancy dinner or something like that while we're while we're out somewhere
 Yeah, we we do we try to do more kind of celebrations. I think than than gifts Andy cheek says oral
 Is that part of your that's everyone's love language there Andy?
 Putting the language in love language, you don't need a therapy book to get to the court to the crux of that guy right there
 Yeah
 Put my dick in a box. Merry Christmas
 Who's the box? It's you Paul speaking of things in a box. Let's do a little scoop mail. Oh
 Love it because he's taking time to blow himself. Yeah
 We got our first holiday card of the season
 Sweet oh, we love it from Ryan and Josh
 Merry Christmas 2025. It's some lovely pictures on here. It's all the the the the family pictures
 My my camera is crazy. So you can't see it, but it's a but it's nice. We love we love getting holiday cards from the listeners
 very sweet also got
 This little package right here from rich scoop dear Matt Paul and Jacob, please find enclosed a couple of books
 I found at charity shops recently. There is a copy of magic for everyone for Paul and a copy of all new
 Star Trek from Matt
 That's fine
 Sorry, Jacob. I didn't find any books on whiskey for you
 No ducks. No mayo packets. So nothing for you this time fucking you in the face. That's rich scoop
 Rich scoop some people would say it's cruel to send gifts to Matt and Paul through me
 But uh, but yeah, that's it seems fine
 Paul bought me the Batman absolute Batman
 Thing first right you did get through it. It's great, right? Yes. What is that? That's that's the comic book?
 What yeah, yeah Scott Snyder wrote Batman for a while the the main title for a while and I loved it
 He did the whole court of owls and then on some really wild stuff
 really loved that so I
 Checked out his new stuff and this absolute Batman is just knocking it out of the park right now
 So yeah, I got Matt the first I guess it's the first five books. Yeah in the series
 What'd you like about it? I like spoilers possibly I guess yeah
 Yeah, but it's right off the top is Alfred's not his he's not rich and Alfred's not his butler, right?
 And so Alfred is just this other guy who's like a trained worldwide assassin and he's like he's actually like meant to like track down
 Track down a group days of tracking down. He runs into Batman and they realized they have to work with each other
 And it's really different deal
 And yeah, it's just it's just a it's Batman is younger guy
 And he's more this really frustrated almost like UFC fighter type person. It's really it's really clever. It's very cool. Yeah, yeah, I
 Quite like it and yes Cooper Nova girl the new absolute Batman drops today
 I haven't made it out to the comic shop yet today
 I might but I'm not buying it week to week
 But this current week's issue the cover is the Joker the reveal of the absolute Joker
 Looks insane looks like some kind of fucking creature. I don't know how they're gonna explain it, but it looks pretty wild
 I guess again. I'm behind
 By like five or six issues. I guess closer to ten by the time the trade comes out
 But I guess he went through his whole killer croc thing and a lot of his friends are now becoming
 The villains that they were destined to become. Yeah. Yeah, that's happening
 Yeah, so it's interesting. Yeah all all his childhood friends end up being the rogues gallery that Batman ends up fighting
 Yeah
 All right, is the it's just it's just take away take away his wealth being a superpower is probably one of the smartest things and
 Coolest things you could have done. Oh
 Yeah, that is interesting. Yeah
 He's a little more
 Gotcha. I mean he he was always making up for it with with more more tech genius stuff
 He well, he was always the Tony Stark of the DCU or vice versa
 I don't know how you really look Batman and Iron Man are more
 akin to each other than you might think and it's always myself but in this like
 Michaels right that's exactly right. He's a
 He's a construction worker. That's what makes him such a buff freak. That's a big part of it
 like he's he's going to school for for you know, Kim and all kinds of
 Super science stuff, but he's a construction worker. So like the Batmobile is a giant dump truck outfitted with armor and shit
 Yeah
 Let's do a little we're gonna save that email we're gonna do a little jock versus nerd oh shit
 Yeah, I'm on the hunt for balls
 The hunt for balls
 I'm Batman a real real quick Batman one last thing lemur creamer was asking do they keep his parents?
 So in this retelling he loses his father early on that's definitive, but his mom is still with him
 So that's a whole nother dynamic to that. His mother is still
 To very much alive and very much part of his life
 So that's interesting it is for the city and then they're after like politicians and stuff. So it's neat. Mm-hmm, huh?
 All right
 We're gonna scoop it today from the Swedish scoop

 That's right
 Hey, welcome to the polo movie Casablanca the New York Gotham's changed their name in 1885

 It is Chicago. Yep
 Really?

 That's right. God damn it. Yeah, you're a Chicago
 You got stupid questions 800 or 1200 and by the way, Matt's winning this game you have

 1200 Paul is a third with negative 2800 that's from Swedish scoop
 Thank you, Swedish scoop

 I should take it when Paul did a real Montreal steamer there. I
 Should wait until disco closes to to talk about this pet peeve. I have but I'm not gonna
 Okay. Okay, the disco riot Kaminsky Park was not an actual event that killed disco
 What it was was an event that was supposed to be it was drummed up by a radio DJ a DJ
 I'll do it and it ended up being this incredibly racist event where everyone brought a bunch of blues and R&B records
 To it and then it broke out of this riot, but it was basically racially fueled
 So it's one of the most weirdest reported things and it's used as a cornerstone in the disco show where I'm like
 That's not what happened as a baby child of the 70s. I remember growing up with that whole disco sucks thing
 Yeah, coming through his baby turns out that whole mantra that whole movement was just anti
 LGBTQ I stuff man. It was just oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It's all racist and racist
 Yeah, but I mean, you know, it's all just stems from don't let people enjoy
 The music that supports their their lifestyle and their culture. It's just awful. It's awful
 This country is crazy Steve doll. Yeah, that's the DJ. I think right Laurie. Yeah
 You know, I think he ended up didn't get in trouble for all that shit
 Well, they're like a lot of destruction of property and stuff that happened on his. Yes
 It fucked up like the ballpark and stuff. Yeah. Yeah, I think he ended up being on the hook for some financial stuff
 Maybe even did some jail time. I don't know back when there's a bunch of like niche cool podcast companies coming out
 There's one I'm trying to I can't remember remember it now
 But there's a podcast that interviewed basically a black usher from Kaminsky Park and his
 And in his breakdown of what happened the day disco died. It was a really great podcast
 At one point he basically has to like hide and run
 Because of what was happening in the park. What's that on? I have to find it. It's been so long
 It's listen to it forever ago, but obviously that a huge impact on me
 Swedish scoop is saying that was a doubleheader and the second game had to be forfeited
 Laurie is saying it was a huge deal, but I believe they had to just call the game. No jail time
 Yeah, oh boy
 Yeah, there you go. All right. Well, let's end on that high note, huh fellas?
 We're not just a racist cesspool now we always have been
 So we got that going for us
