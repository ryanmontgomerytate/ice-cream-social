1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Oh hello there everybody. I would like to thank all you ice cream truck drivers out there.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Who are the ice cream truck drivers? Those are the folks that deliver that freaking ice cream straight into your freaking ear holes.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Right now I'd like to thank Richard Dunn, Sarah Boyle, Sax Guy, Jimmy D, Scoop, Scoop Brady, Scoop Dijor, Scoop Cotta, Scoopy Caye motherfucker,

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Thunder, Cougar, Falcon, Scoop, and Travis Jaguri. Oh god damn it, Slurpee Caye motherfucker made me say motherfucker instead of motherfucker.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Now we've been demonetized. Right, it doesn't even matter now. It's all over. No, no!

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 If you want to be an ice cream truck driver, come help us because we've just been demonetized from this YouTube stream because of Thunder, Cougar, Falcon, Scoop, and Slurpee Caye motherfucker.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Come on over, be an ice cream truck driver, preachingfun.com, who knows? The life you save may be your own.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Here's a show. Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social? Yeah, I'd love to. Great, let's go.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 I don't know how I made it the first 45 years of my life without grabbing sunblock directly into my eyeball. But for some reason I have a problem where I can put a sunblock in my eye and then I'm like, fuck, for like hours.

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 For hours? It's time for Matt and Natalie's Ice Cream Social. Sitting in Las Vegas, that's Matt Donnelly. Sitting in Pittsburgh, that's Paul Mattingly. Also in Las Vegas, it's me, Jacob the Audio Guy. We're preaching fun.

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Yeah, what's up fools? Are we on Twitch? People are saying we're not doing Twitch, blah, blah, blah. Are we not on Twitch? I'll try and put us on Twitch again. Are we on Twitch? Are we not on Twitch?

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 I think we're on Twitch now. Maybe we weren't a minute ago. Okay, well. Ah, yes, that is true. We are now on Twitch. Hello Twitch!

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 And a ranch slug, if you're asking, it is from a man finishing in my eye at a truck stop. Oh my god, a finish man? A finish man. A finish man finishing. Yeah. I was like, do any of you speak Finnish? You. Great. Get in the shower.

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 So 50 sunblock. So sunblock, you know, whether it's 20, 30, you know, 50, whatever the SPF. 50 is your go-to SPF? Alright. Because I'm a porcelain skinned beauty, right? You're a dog and flower.

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 For those of us not familiar, what does SPF stand for? Social proof functions. That's right. Social proof functions. No one wins when they wear sunscreen.

16
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 And so, but the SPF, the higher the number, it just is the more this stuff takes longer to break down in your skin. That's the only thing. It's like, whatever's mixed with the sunblock, it's mixed with the substance that slowly goes into your skin, slowly but surely.

17
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 So when I try to protect this beautiful moneymaker right here, the face for audio that you're listening to right now. You can't see it if you're just listening to the show. Matt just pointed at his ass. He pointed at his beautiful white ass.

18
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Now I've learned my lesson. His alabaster white. I've ruined our interview with Colin Cloud by being a weird mess the entire time with my eyeball the entire time. Right? That's the most embarrassing interview we've had. Somehow Colin and I are still...

19
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 No, no, no. There were more embarrassing interviews. We're more, we're still nice to each other, but we would have been closer had it been a normal person on that podcast. We would be friends. Fair, fair.

20
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 He did actually, Colin and I had lunch yesterday and he said, "What the fuck is up with Matt's eyes?"

21
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 You're like, "Oh no, he's on a real streak. Nothing. Nothing. He's been on a roll."

22
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Actually, that's not true. We don't talk about you because it puts a weird damper on our relationship.

23
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 And so I put it in my eye and then once it starts stinging, I go, "Oh shit, I messed up again." And I know it's going to be like this way for the afternoon because it takes that long for 50 SPF to absorb. That's the whole idea is that I can't make it go away.

24
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 But I did that because I went over to my kid's fun run, which also we started our recording an hour later today so I could be there for my child.

25
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Stop your angry emails. My child comes first. You and your paternal responsibilities. My child comes first.

26
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 That's what my wife keeps telling me. You don't have a child. No, but she says she comes first.

27
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Uh oh. I thought she was telling you that Matt's children came first.

28
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 As a rule, if you do first, then she's mad. No, no. In marital affair times. In snuggle times. Wife comes first. And I agree.

29
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 So I go over there. Now the fun run. There's a few scoops who are very generous to donate to my channel's campaign. If they haven't already, they'll get a cute little thank you video for it.

30
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 If you haven't gotten your thank you video and you think you're owed one, email me at matt@hayscoops.com.

31
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Don't do that. If you're in the chat, you got to give me the weekend. But this comes out on Monday. So if you haven't got it by Monday, I should have gotten you a goddamn video.

32
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 We do indeed have a wonderful, generous community.

33
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 And it's all to go to this fun run, right? And so this fun run raises funds for the schools while this company makes money putting it on.

34
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 So I just found out today that the school doesn't get all the money. I thought the fund was put on by the school. It's put on a company that runs it.

35
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Oh, boy. What is there to run? Yeah, right. They show up. They have prizes for individuals who raise a certain amount of money, right?

36
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 And that's when my kid's trying to get this annoying beach ball to annoy his mom. That's his campaign. Right.

37
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 And they also come with all these accoutrements. When the kids do this actual run on the school, there's like a like a water squirting tunnel.

38
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 There's like different obstacles. There's like a big foam machine. They make they give out all these water, water pistol cannons to the teachers for the kids.

39
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 It's this big outdoor event. Right. OK.

40
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Then I thought it was I thought all the stuff belonged to the school and I was wrong. Now, I get it's not I get like someone probably did run it for a school one year.

41
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 And like someone said, we should do this for all the schools. And then. Yeah. And then it becomes a business and the business has costs and blah, blah, blah, blah.

42
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Yeah, sure. So they don't get all the they don't get all the dough. But so if they got to they raised fifty thousand for the school, which is probably twenty five thousand or something.

43
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 After the company gets cut, they get their feet wet. They take half. Good Lord.

44
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 They probably do. They probably do. And I was like, I was like, is it cat?

45
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Because if we go over certain amount that all that money should go to the school, like once you once once you make enough to go through the fund, you should be calling it.

46
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 But I'm not I'm not on the PTA and I'm not about to join the PTA for this issue.

47
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Matt Donnelly, PTA president. So, uh, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

48
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 The goal was to get the fifty thousand dollars for the school, you know, five or six grades altogether, raising fifty grand.

49
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 They the science teacher is going to shave his head for the whole school.

50
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Oh, boy. The kids would go crazy for the shaving of heads. Right. Right.

51
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 That that translates that has been a time honored tradition.

52
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 That's always been a big thing with wrestling back in the day.

53
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 They don't do it anymore. I haven't seen them do it in like, I don't know, a long time, but that used to be a big thing.

54
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 I just saw a fun interview, a fun wrestling interview this week with who was the I know his name, the Olympic guy who was with WWF.

55
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Kurt Angle, Kurt Angle. He was talking about a match that he had had with another wrestler who I didn't recognize, I don't think.

56
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 But apparently this other wrestler had really long flowing hair.

57
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 And Kurt Angle said Vince McMahon came to me and said, hey, you're losing your hair.

58
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Let's do a match where you get your head shaved at the end of it.

59
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 But don't tell the other guy because I'm going to tell him that he has to shave his head.

60
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 That's pretty slick. I just played a joke on this other guy until the day of.

61
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 And they're like, no, no, you're going to win. You're going to shave his head. Hilarious.

62
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Pretty slick. Well, Vince McMahon is such a cut up.

63
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 OK, yeah, but it really makes you appreciate Vince McMahon's sense of humor.

64
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 I think maybe I was wrong about him. Exactly.

65
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Good dude. He's just a scamp. Good dude. Good dude. Misunderstood.

66
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Union busting and sexual predator aside, good dude.

67
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 I wonder if he has any spouses that could run things on a federal level.

68
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 I bet he does. Let's try.

69
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 There's a woman who's an entertainer and a magician in town. Stacey Stardust. Our friend Stacey Stardust.

70
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 OK, we like Stacey. She always puts up like she's one of the people that puts a lot of motivational stuff up on her Instagram feed all the time.

71
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Got you. And so I had this really heartfelt rallying speech by Dana White.

72
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Dana White straight up hit a woman at a party like in front of everyone.

73
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Yeah, he slapped his wife at the slap preview.

74
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 He was at the event to preview the slap competition stuff and he just slapped his wife.

75
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 And I was like, if you want to privately be inspired by Dana White, you go right ahead.

76
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 As any entertainer, I don't want to put anything up with Dana White, but as a woman entertainer, you want to be like, see this woman slapper?

77
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 You can learn from this woman slapper.

78
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Don't forget our favorite NFL player, Ray Rice. Come on, Ray.

79
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Oh my god.

80
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 So they hit the 50,000 dollar goal. They shaved the guy's head.

81
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 They did it.

82
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 They had a couple more days. And so what they want to do is they want to add stretch goals. Right?

83
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Ah, OK, good.

84
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Boobs? Is he going street legal?

85
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 They upgrade instead of shaving, they upgrade to Nair water cannons and they just spray every hair off of him.

86
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

87
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Nair pressure washing.

88
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 He's just going to look like one of those Mr. Bigglesworth cats.

89
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 He fucked. Good God.

90
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 No, we get an email from the principal and saying that if we reach fifty five thousand.

91
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 OK, the principal and vice principal, we will dress up like babies for a day.

92
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Did you tell them that we tried that? It didn't work.

93
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Can I show you this Whistling Weirdos video from the Gong show?

94
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 No, I was literally like, dress up like babies.

95
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Why are you trying to be all sexy?

96
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 No, don't make me dress up like a baby. Don't raise so much money. I got to dress like a baby. No.

97
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Where would I ever find a pacifier in this bottle I like to drink out of? What? No.

98
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 How will I find the time to go out to my car and get my baby out there?

99
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 It's not Saturday.

100
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 But I definitely don't always have it in my car with me.

101
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 And if we get to sixty thousand, I'll fill my diaper.

102
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Don't make me do it. Don't make me shit publicly. Don't make me publicly shit in a diaper.

103
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 I'll be so embarrassed. What will I do? I'll never be able to show my sexy face again.

104
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 You probably won't even be able to masturbate properly.

105
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 I will. I'll find a way.

106
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 If it's a sixty-five, you can discipline me for a dirty diaper by putting this dog leash on me.

107
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 Oh my God. Right? It just keeps getting worse.

108
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 For seventy, you can spit on me.

109
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Seventy is the spit level.

110
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 All the students at the school can just spit on me for seventy thousand dollars.

111
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 God. You made it to spit level, guys.

112
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Yep.

113
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Scoop up Monte Cristo.

114
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Oh, we didn't make our goal, but oops, I'm dressed like a baby anyway. Sorry.

115
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Aren't I silly? I'm such a silly goose.

116
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 I thought it was baby day. Oh, boy.

117
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 I don't want these two ladies dressed like a baby.

118
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Oh, they're ladies.

119
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Yeah, I was. I've changed my mind.

120
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 You're in. Paul's not doing anything to my kids.

121
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Yeah, exactly. Where's that URL?

122
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Hold on. Paul is now getting him straight to seventy thousand.

123
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Hold on. Hold on.

124
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Hold on. Two lady principals? Hold on. Hold on.

125
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 D-d-d-d. Two ladies.

126
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 And then there was an established goal for sixty thousand, and the same guy who shaved his head was going to dye his eyebrows blue.

127
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 And I was like, can we have a meeting about stretch goals? Can we just?

128
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 It's five minutes. Five minutes, everybody.

129
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Like, I get it. You thought you thought 50 grand was shooting for the moon.

130
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 You were not prepared. You were not prepared to go over that goal.

131
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Let's just circle wagons for a sec and let's just figure some stuff out.

132
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Don't be a baby lady. Really weird, kinky shit for these stretch goals.

133
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 We've gone straight to babies.

134
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 I don't think all the children are going to be like, oh, my God, blue eyebrows. That would be the best.

135
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 I will say that eyebrow shaving is, I think, for an adult, a bigger deal than head shaving.

136
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 It's dangerous because sometimes they don't grow back. Exactly.

137
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 That's not a good idea. Yeah, it's a gamble.

138
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 And even dying, if you use the wrong kind of dye, you know, it could be bad.

139
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 It'll kill you. You can be stuck putting shit on your eye like I am right now.

140
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Matt, are you not able to use spray?

141
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 I don't want to spray my eye. That's where this all started.

142
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 But you do it while you have your eyes closed. You just shhh lightly.

143
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 That's what I do. I use the aerosol sunscreen. I know how sunblock works, guy.

144
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Apparently you don't. I'm sorry to say, Matt. No, you do not.

145
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 There's evidence to the contrary. There's lots of evidence to the contrary.

146
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 You do not know how fucking sunblock works. You push down and the liquid just comes out like spray?

147
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Yeah, it's aerosolized. That's great.

148
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 I do that every time before I mow the lawn. I hose myself in the face and arms and legs.

149
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Every time before Paul mows the lawn, I hose him in the face.

150
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 That's how it works.

151
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 And I think about two principals dressed like babies while I do it.

152
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 That'll make me spray every time.

153
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Oh, I can't stop spraying.

154
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 SPLs!

155
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 I pre-spray babies.

156
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 So much pre-spray.

157
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 I find the spray on my...

158
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 There it is. Scoop of body crystal as your solution.

159
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 You got to get this.

160
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 I'm not against it.

161
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 I'm not against it.

162
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 I bet you have goggles. Don't you have goggles from your kids?

163
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Just some swim goggles.

164
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Don't you have to destroy your own swim goggles?

165
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 I'm going to put on a scuba mask and I'll just slather around the scuba mask.

166
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 No, the scuba mask won't work. It's too much area covered.

167
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 I know that's why I'm making that joke.

168
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 I know the difference between goggles and a scuba mask.

169
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 You should put a bag over your head before you apply your sunscreen. It won't get in your eyes.

170
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Another person told me to put a bag over my head.

171
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 Boy, I got this all the time at Abu Grabe and now here? Geez.

172
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 I've done the spray and I find that the spray when I'm out in the sun for a long time is not very effective.

173
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Is the spray not very effective or do you touch it?

174
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Well, I spray the other way and I walk into it like perfume.

175
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Paul is not confident in Matt's ability to put on sunscreen at all.

176
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Paul's confidence in Matt's ability to do this on his own is at an all time low.

177
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 I've been mowing my lawn in the blazing sun and I just use...

178
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Does it not work or do you touch it?

179
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 I use a fucking whisper of Aldi brand spray and I'm fine for hours.

180
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 And where do you live?

181
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Pennsylvania. Well, okay.

182
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 But I did that shit. I did that shit on the strip promoting as the gazillionaire and I had to spray up there every day too.

183
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 You know who else just had a personal revelation about the sun and that's the following sponsor.

184
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Today's show, Matt Madigan's Ice Cream Social and Who That Baby Podcast.

185
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Who That Baby? Drop it in the diaper.

186
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 It's brought to you by from Coke Inc. It's Baroque Coke Soaked Bespoke Smoked Oak Cloaks.

187
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 That's from the Gorilla Dentist from that Björk video in 2025.

188
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 I'm sorry, I looked in the chat and watching the Mace clip of two people spraying each other in the face.

189
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 That's exactly how it would be.

190
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Yes, I'm sorry. That's the Baroque Coke Soaked Bespoke Smoked Oak Cloaks.

191
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 It's a Coke product.

192
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 It's a Coke product?

193
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Cloak!

194
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 I know it's a cloak, but it's Coke soaked.

195
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 That's right.

196
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Okay.

197
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 From the Baroque period.

198
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Alright, so here's what I did. I went to a place that specializes in Baroque art.

199
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 And I stole a cloak from a display of art that is Baroque.

200
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 And then I soaked it in Coke.

201
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 And while it was still wet, I had a tailor customize it to me so that it was bespoke.

202
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 And then I made sure to smoke it with some essence of oak wood.

203
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 So it was oak-smoked. It was an oak-smoked Baroque cloak that was bespoke and soaked with Coke.

204
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 I don't think he said soaked.

205
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 And that's all of them. That's all of them.

206
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Was that it?

207
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 We checked every box.

208
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 I got it!

209
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 It's a full commercial.

210
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 We nailed it.

211
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 It's good to check out.

212
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 We nailed it.

213
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 One in the bank.

214
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Now we gotta get back to this sunscreen shit.

215
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Do your children burn easily?

216
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Have you taught them how to do it right?

217
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 You remember, as long as the podcast will remember, that I had a really great father-son chat.

218
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 And then an hour later, we went to put sunblock on, and they closed their eyes.

219
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 And I did a spray. I did one and I wasn't quick enough to do the second.

220
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 So he opened his eyes and I sprayed him right in the eye.

221
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 So this is genetic here. This is a tradition now.

222
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 We're just not meant to be. We should just go back to cloudy Ireland where our genetics belong.

223
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 I see.

224
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 And hide and drink Guinness and tell stories and fight fires.

225
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 This is what we should do.

226
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 But yeah, let's get finally back to the sunscreen talk.

227
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Yeah. Anyways, yeah.

228
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 So I hear you, Paul. I usually can spray. No problem.

229
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 But I know I'm going to be in the sun for a long time.

230
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 You go with the cream.

231
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 50 proof SPF so that I don't burn my have you thought about going with like those zinc products that are color?

232
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 I should have. I have it. I know that the mineral ones where I look like a ghost, but it works.

233
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Well, not even that. Like there's the ones like remember all the ones that turn you blue until it until the lifeguards used to have the blue on their nose.

234
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 There's there's mineral based sunscreens that are maybe way thicker than what you're talking about, but you still have.

235
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 I know what you mean. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And they do. They really do do the job.

236
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 They do do the job. Do do they do do the job? Do do specifically designed for darker skin, if I'm not mistaken.

237
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 Well, I look legit.

238
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 There is a legit Irish genes in terms of that, like skin cancers in my family. That's why I don't like to rely on the spray.

239
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Oh, you should just stay out of the sun, man. I try doing what are you doing in Las Vegas?

240
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 Matt, Matt, you should get some sunscreen.

241
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 I'm getting if it's just a different brand sunscreen.

242
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 By the way, the thing that frozen custard put in the chat there that like kind of like that, like it's basically a deodorant stick, a tiny mini deodorant stick of yeah.

243
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 So I'm like, those do work. They're effective. But again, in Las Vegas, if you leave it outdoors anywhere, that's melty, melty.

244
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 It's just it's like a candy bar just melts. It's just gone. Yeah. Yeah.

245
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Yeah, even the car or whatever. It's it's all you need a cooler for your sunscreen.

246
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 That's it. I mean, that's around like a white mask on my face, a cooler of sunscreen.

247
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 You'll be fine. You'll give all those coolers with the wheels on it. You can just pull it behind you.

248
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 You should just get just get some crazy straight up Bukkake yourself and don't even rub it in.

249
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 There you go. That's exact. Tin Scoop has exactly the look.

250
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Oh, those principles go full baby. I'm Bukkake.

251
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 For seventy five thousand dollars. Yeah, we will let you powder our asses.

252
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 I'm actually my constant tears with an old T-shirt just because kind of clumsy.

253
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 It's her favorite specific about men is having old T-shirts around.

254
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Yeah, like tears. Yeah, that is true.

255
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 I cleaned my shop yesterday and I was looking for rags and I used two old T-shirts.

256
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 There you go. They were on a shelf in my shop.

257
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 That's why you keep them. That's right. That's it.

258
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 I was walking around yesterday. I was walking around on the strip yesterday.

259
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 And a fellow approached me. I was on my kind of regular circuit.

260
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 My nice match has a sock that he's now dabbing his eye with.

261
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Yeah, like request that I switched to a sock. Oh, good.

262
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Oh, I sent you a text about your eye. We need a picture of your eye.

263
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Oh, God. For what? We did a selfie. Yeah, I probably hate you.

264
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 OK. Anything for the pod. That's right.

265
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 So I'm walking around yesterday and I am in front of the Harris Casino.

266
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 And the Harris Casino, they have a crosswalk there that crosses across the strip there.

267
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 So I'm waiting there. I'm waiting for the crosswalk to change to cross over like 10 lanes of traffic that is the Las Vegas Strip.

268
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 And I am underneath a little overhang in the Harris Casino, as is my habit when I stand there,

269
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 because it has one of those air curtains, one of those outdoor air curtains.

270
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 So it keeps the hot air outside and keeps the cold air inside.

271
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 And so I just stand under that and it keeps me nice and cool. So as I'm standing there, a young man approaches me, I would say, in his mid 20s.

272
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 And this has happened on occasion before.

273
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 And I believe I told some stories from Portugal where I was offered some various types of drugs in Portugal.

274
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 So this guy comes up to me and he says the weirdest thing to open. But then I very much appreciated him later because his opening was,

275
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 hey, when you want to graduate to ski boots, let me know.

276
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 Oh, that's a good that's a good opener there.

277
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 And I knew what he meant already. I knew what he was offering me already. He's offering me cocaine.

278
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 He was going to fill a ski boot with bourbon and you're going to drink straight from the boot.

279
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Oh, God.

280
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 But I didn't know what he meant by graduate to ski boots. And as I'm opening my mouth.

281
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 He meant you were high already at other things. That's what graduate is.

282
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 That is that too. He was like, when you're ready to get higher than you are.

283
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 That's probably what he meant. Actually, now that you say it.

284
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 He was mistaken, but that's probably what he meant.

285
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 So I'm standing there and like I'm opening my mouth to say basically, no, thank you.

286
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 And he goes, he thinks that I don't understand him. So he goes, yeah, like we're going to go skiing.

287
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 We're going to go skiing.

288
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 And I still can't get my mouth open. He goes, in the snow, we're going to go skiing in the snow.

289
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 And then he leans in and I'm just I'm just smiling. I'm thrilled at this point. He leans in close to me and goes, cocaine.

290
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 And everyone around him was like, cocaine.

291
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 I was like, I need you to do less cocaine. I am I am worried about you.

292
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 I need you to do this less. All of your friends and family are very concerned.

293
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 I actually could have just been more direct. No one cares. But I just love slang.

294
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 I just want to just I just love to speak the street.

295
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 He had a whole like thing that he just ratted.

296
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 He was like, you want to graduate to some ski boots? We're going to go skiing. I mean, in the snow, cocaine.

297
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 You need to have more faith in your metaphors, sir.

298
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 Yeah, I got it.

299
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 I had you the first time, man. I was already not interested in buying cocaine from you after the first thing you said.

300
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 But I laughed and I laughed. I gave him a smile. I said, I said, I'm all set right now.

301
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 I said, I'm all set. I think I said something like I'm all set for ski boots right now or something like that.

302
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 Well, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.

303
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 I just be like, I'm I'm on Mount Fuji with a Yeti, bro. I'm good.

304
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 I have a nasal salve in powdered form.

305
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 I was like, I'm good, man. I'm good.

306
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 And he smiled. He said, well, if you change your mind, I hang out right over here.

307
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 And I said, I got you, man. We gave each other a nice fist bump and we parted friends.

308
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 But I have a cocaine dealer friend now. How many guys walk five steps ago?

309
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 Actually, yeah, I'll take the cocaine. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Probably not. Probably not.

310
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Yeah, it's not zero. Hey, you want to erode your septum?

311
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 Yeah. Huh? Cocaine.

312
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 Street drugs.

313
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 Guys, I didn't mean to swipe the A block with my PTA talk there.

314
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 Well, you did. Thanks a lot. We have to get down to talking about Taylor Swift and Travis Kelsey's engagement.

315
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Finally.

316
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 We're late enough in the news cycle that I think the backlash against it is hilarious.

317
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 I can't believe there's backlash. Who cares?

318
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Have you seen the Taylor Swift haters out there? Mostly right wing, hardcore right wing people, MAGA people.

319
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 Yeah. That have said Taylor Swift's career was going down the toilet, so she attached herself to a famous man.

320
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Oh, boy. Oh, yeah. That's that's insanity. That's insanity.

321
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 She made more money than anyone. That's just idiocy.

322
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 That's meant to be trolling. They're not actually. I think so.

323
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Yes, I think so. It's it's it's it's it's it's I'm sick of living in this world where bizarro opinions matter.

324
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 Yes. Everybody knows that Taylor Swift has billions more dollars than Travis Kelsey in her bank account.

325
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 But I'm all for it. Taking up space in the news non-politically because all we're doing is assaulted by these terrible things.

326
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 So I was like, I love having non-political big news stories. I was like, I don't even care that much.

327
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 But you know what? I'm going to root for it and I'm going to be here for it because it just means I'm not reading a story about Trump.

328
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 So let's go. Let's dive in. Yeah, it's great. I want nothing but good things for them.

329
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 Good for them. Hooray. Billionaire people go have a good life.

330
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 Paul has no beef with this at all. I don't have any beef with it, honestly.

331
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 It's fine. It's it's cute. My wife is very invested.

332
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 I mean, I have bought several Taylor Swift songs. I like Taylor Swift's work.

333
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 You know, yeah, I'm not a Taylor hater by any means. I think she's really very talented.

334
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 Very good. Yeah. But, you know, there's rumors she will play the halftime show and or possibly the sphere.

335
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. The halftime show, I think, makes more sense to me.

336
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 Here's why the halftime show makes sense to me. The sphere doesn't make as much sense to me because it ties her here.

337
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 And she can't make as much money in the sphere as she can in stadiums. Unless she charges crazy money per sphere seat.

338
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 But they already charge crazy money per seat in the stadiums. You're right.

339
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 As the only person in the three of us who has bought Taylor Swift concert tickets and has bought sphere concert tickets,

340
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 the Taylor Swift concert tickets were much more expensive.

341
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 Technically, you have invested a percentage into their wedding planning.

342
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think I paid for like the veil or something.

343
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Yeah, you may have paid for one or two of those flowers during the photo shoot for the proposal.

344
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 That's right. Yeah. One petal. One petal of the flower. Exactly. One little tiny hoop of the veil. One tiny little tiny hole.

345
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 You paid for it. You paid for the you paid for a tiny hole, Jacob. I paid for a tiny hole.

346
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 But the Super Bowl thing makes sense because she's got the we were talking about on chat yesterday.

347
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 The album is coming out. The Showgirl album is going to come out in October,

348
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 which means that by the time the Super Bowl rolls around, she could be into like full swing promo mode for whatever new tour she's going to make another three billion dollars off of.

349
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 Yeah. Yeah. Tommy, that like the Super Bowl thing makes sense just from an advertising standpoint.

350
00:31:47,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Yeah. But the sphere sphere would be amazing from a rep standpoint because she would have to play like 50 concerts or something like I mean, she could just she could just do a year long sphere residency.

351
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 Yeah, she was just parking in Vegas. She's one of the only ones that could actually do that.

352
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 She can just do five days a week at the sphere if she wanted to. She really could. Yeah. Yeah.

353
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 And just sell it out and just do it that way. She could she could just be, you know, have a full time job.

354
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 And then I could apply to be her sunblock applyer and I could try to spray and have her walk through the spray and yell, don't touch it.

355
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 Don't touch it. Don't touch it as she goes through. And she'll be like, it doesn't work. And you'll be like, did you touch it?

356
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 Is it the product or did you touch it?

357
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 You know you touch it.

358
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 You touched it. You touched it. You know who else touched it?

359
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 The following sponsor. Today's show Matt Manley's Ice Cream Social is brought to you by Uncle Johnny's Super Mega Awesome Golden Puke Bucket Emporium.

360
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 It's from Brian the Boulder Scoop in 2022.

361
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 This is Uncle Johnny's Super Mega Awesome Golden Puke Bucket Emporium.

362
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 Hey, you butthole face dummy. I'm Uncle Johnny. Uncle Johnny is here with the puke bucket. Hey.

363
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 You want to look in it? That would be a quarter, a shiny quarter to Uncle Johnny before you get to look inside Uncle Johnny's puke bucket, you butthole face turd.

364
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 Come over here. Come over here. Let me see your face. Come over here next to Uncle Johnny. Uncle Johnny wants to touch it. Your face. Just your face.

365
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 No, thank you.

366
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 Put it in the bucket. Put the quarter in the bucket and puke on it.

367
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 Uncle Johnny's got a million dollars. Uncle Johnny's got a million dollars. Uncle Johnny's got a million dollars.

368
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 And our hate scoop's a check out.

369
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 Oh, no. Jacob, why are you cutting off that goal?

370
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 I don't know. I must have had leave of license. That bit was just getting warmed up. That was clearly... Oh, man. Just been cleared for takeoff.

371
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 Uncle Johnny was going to go to some real dark places.

372
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 The voice reminded me a little too much of my real Uncle Johnny.

373
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 Triggered.

374
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 Yeah, yeah. Triggered.

375
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 Triggered.

376
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 My Uncle Johnny, who's not really my uncle, I think he's like a second cousin or something. But yeah, that was a little too close to Uncle John right there.

377
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 It's very tricky to balance that Uncle Johnny voice and not slip into full Cosby, which I was dancing on the line. But I managed to do it. I was pretty proud of myself.

378
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 I just put an inspirational quote from Cosby up on my Instagram.

379
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 Here, drink this.

380
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 I separate art from the artist.

381
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 I separate art from the Garfunkel.

382
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 You guys can figure out whether you want Uncle Johnny there to be in the Hollywood Squares. Come scoop fest.

383
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 Uncle Johnny, three lines, the three line character, Uncle Johnny, who just basically says Uncle Johnny has a million dollars. But that, you know what?

384
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 The fact is, he's going to get a lot worse. He's got three lines and a promise.

385
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 The promise of getting terrible.

386
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 Just a reminder, I'm going to be in San Antonio next week. So by the time you hear this, I'm here Monday through Saturday, the first through the seventh with shows every night at the Magic Saloon in downtown San Antonio.

387
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 Nice.

388
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 You guys want to do a little Scoop Mail? More than anything.

389
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 Let's do a little Scoop Mail.

390
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 Message for you, sir.

391
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 Well, y'all want to hear from the Satanic Scoop. My dearest churn migrants, I have long thought about a frustration I've heard voiced by Matt and Jacob and also by other commentators that I probably would put in the box labeled normal.

392
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 How much you can consider a magician slash improv comic normal is left as an exercise for the observer that you never see in sports movies or TV shows anymore as a fictional exercise.

393
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 You get little drips here and there like Ted Lasso or that Will Ferrell show or the upcoming movie Hymn from Jordan Peele.

394
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 But it is an undeniable fact, even to sports ball denier like myself, that the institution of the sports show has disappeared from the popular consciousness, at least in America.

395
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 You see, gentlemen, there is one place where the sports drama is still strong at its motherfucking anime.

396
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 What?

397
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 Every year brings in a new crop of stories of big dreams of athletic glory like some of them like Yuri on Ice are delightfully gay.

398
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 There's even an American hand egg anime. It's called Ice Shield 21 and while tragically heterosexual, that is still pretty darn good.

399
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 There are racing soccer, figure skating, track and field and basketball anime, tennis and basketball are there.

400
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 There are boxing and wrestling shows of every stripe. It's all there, my friends.

401
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 There's even a show about girls trying to knock each other into a pool with their asses and it's treated as serious as heart surgery.

402
00:37:49,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 In this time, when conventional sports ball has failed you, has failed all of us, might I suggest taking in the zany antics of cartoon pretty boys embroiled in ridiculous melodrama,

403
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 respectfully fucking you in the face while giving you a 15 minute monologue about my tragic backstory.

404
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 That's the Satanic Scoop.

405
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 Alright, that's a fine pitch.

406
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 Thank you, Satanic Scoop. Those are good suggestions.

407
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 I remember back in my day when I was an old anime head getting my 1800s on VHS and whatnot.

408
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 Yeah.

409
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 There was a basketball one.

410
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 This is manga mostly. I think there maybe was an anime for it.

411
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 There was a basketball one and I remember the other manga that I read.

412
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 There was a big tennis one.

413
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 I read a few of those just to see and then I got into the there was a manga all about the game of Go, which we would call a fellow here in the States.

414
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 Oh, yeah. Yeah.

415
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 Yeah.

416
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 A manga all about Go players and the competition.

417
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 It was interesting.

418
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 So they have never shied from going deep into obscure subjects to mine from and I applaud them for it.

419
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 Well, all right.

420
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 Let's go. I applaud them too.

421
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 Well done.

422
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 Thank you.

423
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 Well done.

424
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 Thank you, anime.

425
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 Heroes that we don't deserve.

426
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 Oh, I got an email here from Scott.

427
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 Hello. My name is Scott.

428
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 I think my scoop name is scoop me.

429
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 No, scoop you listener since 2018 yet have never wrote in, which at this point feels weird.

430
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 Okay.

431
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 Well, I'm glad you wrote in Scott.

432
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 I have a story from my dad from a couple of years ago, which I've remembered multiple times since and I've chuckled about each time.

433
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 So I figured I'd pass this on.

434
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 Please.

435
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 He used to get a roll and a cup of coffee from this bakery multiple times a week.

436
00:39:51,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 He walks in one particular morning to the lights half off and someone moaning help quietly from the back.

437
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 Oh, God.

438
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 My dad being born and raised in Queens in the 70s assumes he's walked into an armed robbery yet feels too bad to not check out what's happening.

439
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 Lo and behold, the older woman opening the bakery that morning fell into the steep basement while trying to put the kitchen lights on.

440
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 The best part is after my dad helps her out in the basement and into the front of the shop, she immediately says to him, so what do you want?

441
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 Very sharply.

442
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 Amazing.

443
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 He like helps her up and she's like, all right, now what do you want?

444
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 My dad confused and flustered by the situation said, huh?

445
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 To which she replied, why did you come in?

446
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 Resulting in my dad placing his normal order and paying full price as if nothing had just occurred.

447
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 Hilarious.

448
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 She gave no fucks.

449
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 I would provide follow up, but my dad has decided to go to Duncan ever since.

450
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 I bet.

451
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 I would too.

452
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 Not the best story, but you fellas have worked for the worst.

453
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 Thanks for the awesome comedy.

454
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 That's Scott.

455
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 Hilarious.

456
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 That's fucking hilarious.

457
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 If I help a store owner up after she has fallen into the basement, I expect at least a discount.

458
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 I mean, just a thank you so much.

459
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 Yeah, maybe a donut, maybe a free donut.

460
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 Yeah, just say thank you.

461
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 Not even just what do you come in for?

462
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 Thanks for helping me out of the basement.

463
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 Here's a donut.

464
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 I would have, and maybe this is strong, thrown her back in the basement.

465
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 I think you could have done one better and put sunscreen on her.

466
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 Charge me full price from down there.

467
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 Charge me full price from down there.

468
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 Just help her apply some sunscreen, Matt.

469
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 That would be far more painful.

470
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 Yeah, I'll just sort of mace her face and then let her stumble down the basement on her own.

471
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 That's really funny.

472
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 But there you go.

473
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 And there you go.

474
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 How funny, like no good deed, right?

475
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 And also lost a customer for life.

476
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 Lost a ritualistic customer.

477
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 Well, at least weirded one out.

478
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 I mean, he went to Dunkin'.

479
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 Yeah.

480
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 Like that's it.

481
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 That's not something.

482
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 I bet that woman went home that evening and was like, man, I fell down the steps.

483
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 This patron came in and helped me up.

484
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 I bet she didn't think to herself, I bet I lost that patron.

485
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 I don't think she was.

486
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 I don't think she's thinking anything.

487
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 As someone who works early in the morning, my brain doesn't really kick in until about two hours onto my shift.

488
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 Oh, you're right.

489
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 You're right, Paul.

490
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 An hour later, she's like, I shouldn't have charged him for that.

491
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 I should have given him a doughnut.

492
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 She probably.

493
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 Yeah, probably.

494
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 Maybe.

495
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 You're probably right.

496
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 You know, you're just kind of like going through the motions of, I got to do this shit.

497
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 I got to do that shit.

498
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 Oh, fuck.

499
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 Whatever.

500
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 So, but she's gone.

501
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 He's gone.

502
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 You're probably exactly right.

503
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 Oh, well.

504
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 I'll tell you what you won't be right about.

505
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 The questions.

506
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 In Jock vs. Nerd.

507
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 Oh, that was really clever.

508
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 That was a good one.

509
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 You want to do a little Jock vs. Nerd action?

510
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 Oh, am I?

511
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 Fuck yeah.

512
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

513
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 Explosion.

514
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 Hunt for balls.

515
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 On the hunt for balls.

516
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 We got a Scoopity coming at us today from ScalawoleScoop.

517
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 He said this is spoof, all like spoof stuff.

518
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 What did he say in his email here?

519
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 Oh no, I already got rid of the email.

520
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 But yeah, he said it was all like spoof stuff.

521
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 The categories are Zazz Movie Spoofs, Music Spoofs, Fake TV Spoofs, and...

522
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 Spoofery.

523
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 How do you say potpourri but with spoof?

524
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 Spoofery.

525
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 Yeah.

526
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 Spoofpourri.

527
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 Yeah.

528
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 Spoofpourri.

529
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 Paul, you're up first.

530
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 I'll take Fake TV Spoofs for 200, Dick.

531
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 My name is Jacob.

532
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 What would you rename a critically acclaimed Apple TV series if you turned it into a zombie

533
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 show about a deceased soccer coach?

534
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 The Walking Dead Lasso.

535
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 Oh, The Walking Dead Lasso is good.

536
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 What is Dead Lasso?

537
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 Yes.

538
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 Nice.

539
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 That's me.

540
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 I'll try the Spoofpourri for 200.

541
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 Some consider this the greatest spoof of all time, making fun of the French by making fun

542
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 of the British.

543
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 It spawned its own Broadway musical spoof named after canned meat that a rather famous

544
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 audio guy worked on.

545
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 That would be Vienna the Musical.

546
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 Spamalot.

547
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 Vienna.

548
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 What?

549
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 No.

550
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 Oh, it spawned one of the movie name, not the musical name.

551
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 Tricky.

552
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 Wow.

553
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 You got spoofed.

554
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

555
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 Pretty sneaky, sis.

556
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 You got spoofed.

557
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 You got spoofed.

558
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 Spoofed and boofed.

559
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 I'll take Spoofed and Boofed.

560
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 God damn it, Teen Wolf.

561
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 Fake TV sports.

562
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 Fake TV.

563
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 There's no sports.

564
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 Fake TV spoofs.

565
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 Oh, spoofs.

566
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 You wouldn't need to change the name of this TV show if the Muppets took it over and instead

567
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 of the more obvious choice of the Swedish chef used Fozzie as the lead character, Rizzo

568
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 would be hilarious as Richie.

569
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 The Bear.

570
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 The Bear.

571
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 The Bear.

572
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 What is the Bear?

573
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 Paul.

574
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 I'll try Zazz Movie Spoofs.

575
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 I'm intrigued.

576
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 Zazz Movie Spoofs for 200.

577
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 Daily Double.

578
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 Oh, my God.

579
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 I wasn't ready.

580
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 I hope you were really intrigued.

581
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 This spoof franchise has almost as many films as the horror franchise that inspired the

582
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 spoofing.

583
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 David Zucker directed parts three and four with a writing assistant by Abrahams for number

584
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 four.

585
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 Scary Movie, I believe.

586
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 Scary Movie is correct.

587
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 Yay.

588
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 Which was the original title of Scream.

589
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 Oh, yeah.

590
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 That's right.

591
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
 It's me.

592
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 I'll try Music Spoofs for 200.

593
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
 Coolio wasn't so cool about Weird Al making this spoof, but we can see why.

594
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 As some could argue that it's gone on to eclipse the original song it's based on.

595
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 Even Ezekiel thinks it's a better song.

596
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 Let's see.

597
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 So let me reread the question carefully this time so I know what it's actually asking me

598
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 for.

599
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 It's asking you for the spoof, not the original.

600
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 What is so cool about Weird Al making this spoof?

601
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 It's called Amish Paradise, which is a spoof of Coolio's Gangster's Paradise.

602
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 There you go.

603
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 That's it.

604
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 There we are.

605
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 Raid the question carefully and get the answer correct.

606
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 Matt?

607
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 Are you at barn raisings often?

608
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 Fake TV spoofs.

609
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 For 600.

610
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 Already spoofed by this podcast, this Netflix series title would work as a reality show

611
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 pitting princes or princesses against one another, or a real 100 meter dash to determine royal

612
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
 bloodlines.

613
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
 Still wouldn't be as funny as the real series though.

614
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:29,000
 Is this the original series?

615
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
 Oh, I get it.

616
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 It's spoofed by this podcast, this podcast being this podcast, Matt.

617
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 Like our podcast?

618
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 Yes, this one right here.

619
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 We have made fun of this Netflix series.

620
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 Yes.

621
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 It is a current Netflix series that we have discussed at length.

622
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 Quarter lengths, half lengths, full lengths, all the lengths.

623
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 Yes.

624
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 The Crown?

625
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 I don't think The Crown is a reality show.

626
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 All right, I'll pass.

627
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
 I'm missing it.

628
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 Paul?

629
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,000
 Oh, if Paul misses it now, it's great.

630
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 No, no, no.

631
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
 It's called Race for the Crown.

632
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 Race for the Crown.

633
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 Oh, I'm dumb.

634
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 I get it now.

635
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 Yeah.

636
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
 Paul.

637
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 He's just not going to get it.

638
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 We didn't need that question to determine that I was dumb, but it's a good reminder.

639
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 I'll go with Zazz Movie Spoofs.

640
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 For 400.

641
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 This spoof franchise was recently rebooted and according to two young discerning movie

642
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 critics, may just be the funniest movie of all time.

643
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 Move over, Ace Ventura.

644
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
 That's got to be the naked gun.

645
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
 Got to be the naked gun, right?

646
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 Yes.

647
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
 Move over, Ace Ventura.

648
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
 Oh, I can't.

649
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 I'll never make room.

650
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 That's me.

651
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 I'll try Spoof Parie for 400.

652
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
 James Bond was ripe for spoofing, so it was surprising that it wasn't until the late '90s

653
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 that this character introduced us to Alotta Fagina.

654
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:09,000
 Felicity Shagwall Robin Swallows and the twins, Fook Me and Fook You.

655
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 That would be the International Man of Mystery whose name is not Maxwell Smart.

656
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
 His name is definitely not Maxwell Smart.

657
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
 It is...

658
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
 Our Man Flint.

659
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
 Our Man Flint.

660
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 That's it.

661
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
 His name was Q.

662
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,000
 His name was Austin Powers.

663
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
 Isn't it funny how the brain just goes big holes in it?

664
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 Yep.

665
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 It's a good time.

666
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
 Matt, you're up.

667
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 Getting old is awesome.

668
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
 It's so much fun.

669
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
 Fake TV spoofs, please.

670
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:49,000
 For 800, already a kind of a spoof of all the '80s entertainment we grew up with, this Netflix

671
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 series with a Stephen King tone and a title font has a character with a name that recalls

672
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,000
 the hilarious line from the brilliant spoof, "This is Spinal Tap."

673
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 Man, I don't know.

674
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
 I have no idea.

675
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 Does that go to me?

676
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
 Paul, it goes to you.

677
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 Yeah.

678
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
 It's Stranger Things.

679
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
 Oh, Stranger Things.

680
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 Because it's 11.

681
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
 She goes to 11.

682
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
 Okay.

683
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
 Do you remember 11?

684
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:30,000
 Did you see that Spinal Tap played a secret show in front of the actual Stonehenge?

685
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
 Yes.

686
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
 Fucking crazy.

687
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 And they're coming out with a new Spinal Tap as well.

688
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
 I should just hesitate and cheat because people keep taping the real answers into the chat.

689
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
 It's an honor system, Matt.

690
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
 I don't look at the chat.

691
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
 You can just close the chat, too, if you're too tempted.

692
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
 Paul, you're up.

693
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
 I can't see the chat.

694
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 When I share the screen, I can't see the chat.

695
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
 How did you make marks on the screen?

696
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 I didn't do it.

697
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
 Did Newman do that?

698
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
 I don't know.

699
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
 I'll do Zazz movie spoofs for $600.

700
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 How would Newman do it?

701
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
 Newman's walking outside in the park.

702
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
 I don't know.

703
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
 Yeah, you did that somehow, Jacob.

704
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
 I didn't do it.

705
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
 Hold on.

706
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
 Stop showing the screen.

707
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
 I'll come back.

708
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 I don't know what that is.

709
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
 Mark suddenly appeared on the screen.

710
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,000
 The granddaddy of the spoof genre.

711
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 Why is Newman suspected of drawing on there?

712
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
 Because Newman's name popped up when it was appearing.

713
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
 Newman, you can unmute if you feel offended, if you feel attacked.

714
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
 Go ahead, Newman.

715
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
 Have I offended your delicate sensibilities?

716
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:51,000
 A little out of left field, buddy.

717
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,000
 For people who are listening, all of a sudden on the shared screen that has the stuff for

718
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
 the scooper day, marks just appeared on it.

719
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,000
 On my screen, next to those marks, it had the name Newman.

720
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
 I'm actively trying to mark on your face.

721
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
 Damn it.

722
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
 Spoof.

723
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
 Oh no.

724
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
 I got spoof in my eye.

725
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 Thanks for having me.

726
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
 Always a pleasure.

727
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
 The granddaddy of the spoof genre.

728
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
 Paul, this is your question.

729
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
 This film had its own sequel and made fun of disaster films, Saturday Night Fever, From

730
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
 Here to Eternity, and Zero Hour.

731
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
 It might encourage you to order lasagna on your next flight.

732
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 Airplane.

733
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
 Airplane.

734
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
 Absolutely.

735
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
 Hell yeah.

736
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 See, it's me.

737
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
 I'll try movie spoofs for $800.

738
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
 I still don't know what Zazz means.

739
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
 Does anybody know what Zazz means?

740
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
 I don't.

741
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
 Somebody in the chat.

742
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
 It might just be one of those things that this movie's got Zazz.

743
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
 Got Zazz.

744
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
 It could be that thing.

745
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
 This Zazz classic stars Val Kilmer.

746
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
 Oh, Zucker, Abram Zucker.

747
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
 It is.

748
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
 Okay, so it's all Zucker films.

749
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
 Oh, gotcha.

750
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
 Okay.

751
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
 This Zazz classic is great.

752
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
 I like Zazz.

753
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
 I like Zazz.

754
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:14,340
 This Zazz classic stars Val Kilmer and riffs on old war films, Elvis era musicals, Blue

755
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:16,440
 Lagoon, and spy movies.

756
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:22,200
 It all sounds like some bad movie.

757
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,980
 You shouldn't hang me on a hook.

758
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:27,760
 My father hung me on a hook once.

759
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,440
 Once.

760
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:34,560
 In that movie, it's not Spies Like Us.

761
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,560
 Nope.

762
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,560
 It sure isn't.

763
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,080
 You could pass.

764
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,080
 I know I can pass, Paul.

765
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:43,080
 I know how the fucking game works, Paul.

766
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:49,200
 I know what I'm able to do by the rules of the game.

767
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,760
 I'm encouraging you to pass.

768
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,760
 That's all.

769
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:52,760
 That we invented?

770
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

771
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,320
 Oh, shit.

772
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,320
 Nope.

773
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,320
 That is.

774
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,320
 That's not right.

775
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,720
 Fuck.

776
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,800
 Again, close.

777
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:10,120
 All I can think of is Spies Like Us.

778
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,120
 Okay.

779
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:17,120
 Man, I saw that movie a bunch, too.

780
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:21,800
 Man, I guess I'll pass, Matt.

781
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,800
 Top secret.

782
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,800
 Motherfucker.

783
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:30,500
 Correct.

784
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,840
 By the way, the same thing would have happened if I got the question.

785
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,840
 I would have frozen.

786
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:34,840
 It happens.

787
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,080
 It was only watching you struggle to pop right into my head.

788
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,080
 It happens.

789
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,080
 That's how it works.

790
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,080
 Matt, you got spoofs or spoofs.

791
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,720
 Music spoofs or spoovery.

792
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,240
 I got to gain ground on Paul here, huh?

793
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,240
 Oh, yeah.

794
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,240
 Paul has $2,800.

795
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,240
 Matt has $1,200.

796
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,240
 I have $400.

797
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,240
 Thanks a lot.

798
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,240
 Top secret.

799
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,400
 And there are five questions left.

800
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,640
 One daily double left.

801
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,400
 I'll take spoovery for $800, please.

802
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,720
 All right.

803
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:05,920
 The legendary director of this film and so many classic spoofs recently announced a much

804
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,520
 anticipated sequel.

805
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,880
 No telling if it's going to suck or blow, but one thing's for certain, the merchandise

806
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,600
 is where the real money is made.

807
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,160
 The search for more money.

808
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,160
 Spaceballs.

809
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,160
 Let's see.

810
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:24,440
 Oh, wait, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

811
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,440
 Mel Brooks.

812
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,440
 Mel Brooks.

813
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,440
 Spaceballs.

814
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,440
 Yeah, spaceballs.

815
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,440
 All the things.

816
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,440
 Saved it.

817
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,440
 Saved it.

818
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,200
 Well, the first line sounds like it's asking for the director and the movie.

819
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,200
 It does.

820
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,200
 Yeah.

821
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,200
 Paul, you're up.

822
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,640
 Music spoofs, please.

823
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,560
 For $400.

824
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,560
 This spoof.

825
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,000
 See, Newman's name just popped back up on my screen again.

826
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
 He's doing a little.

827
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
 What are you doing, Newman?

828
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,320
 Why are you messing with this game so much?

829
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,560
 Newman did it.

830
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:01,380
 This spoof of MacArthur Park has one of Weird Al's best videos rendered in classic California

831
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,800
 raisin style stop motion claymation.

832
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:06,240
 They certainly spared no expense.

833
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,280
 As Jurassic Park.

834
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:14,160
 Oh, Jurassic Park is frightening in the dark.

835
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,360
 All the dinosaurs are running wild.

836
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,360
 Beautiful.

837
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,360
 Yes.

838
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,360
 Beautiful.

839
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:24,360
 Let's see, it's me.

840
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,840
 I guess I need to avoid the daily doubles.

841
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,400
 So hopefully I can't win.

842
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,000
 It doesn't matter.

843
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,280
 Music spoofs, $800.

844
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:38,160
 A fantastic reminder of grammar rules that any teacher would love Weird Al's word crimes

845
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:43,400
 is a spoof of the big hit that many retroactively deemed to be a bit rapey and was considered

846
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:48,400
 a crime itself, the subject of several lawsuits.

847
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:54,580
 That is the classic song Long Distance.

848
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,840
 Long Distance.

849
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:56,840
 That's right.

850
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:05,080
 That's I mean, if you if you read between the lines, it's pretty dark.

851
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,080
 I have no idea.

852
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,080
 I pass, Matt.

853
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:13,880
 Grammar rules teacher without weirdos word crimes with a big hit song that many retroactively

854
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:17,800
 deemed a bit rapey.

855
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,440
 Um, uh, scooping over, I'll just type blurred lines in the chat.

856
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,440
 I'm going to go.

857
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,440
 Oh, what?

858
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,440
 You're cheating.

859
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,440
 It is blurred lines.

860
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,440
 Well done, Matt.

861
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:33,280
 I was going to say it's a well done Matt Donnelly and only Matt Donnelly song had some growing

862
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,280
 pains.

863
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:37,960
 Ah, growing pains.

864
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:38,960
 There you go.

865
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,960
 Matt, you got spoof, spoof, spoof, poorie.

866
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,200
 That's a good hint, Paul.

867
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,200
 That was a good hint.

868
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,200
 Yeah.

869
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,600
 Just play this episode backwards and it'll make sense.

870
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,600
 That'll be good.

871
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:51,120
 It was Alan Thicke's rapist child.

872
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,120
 Allegedly.

873
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:56,320
 Is it my turn?

874
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,320
 I don't know.

875
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,320
 Alan Thicke had more than one kid.

876
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,320
 Yes.

877
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:08,800
 Uh, I'll take spoof, peri, please for 600 the way the amazing cast of Rickman Rockwell

878
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:13,920
 and Weaver played it so straight in this film truly makes it an underappreciated spoofing

879
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,920
 of the Star Trek series.

880
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,600
 Let us know if anyone in ICS ever worked in a situation similar to this film.

881
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:27,560
 Oh shoot, this is happening to me, it's about the Jacob, the name would be in my head right

882
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,560
 now.

883
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,080
 I know the name of this name.

884
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,840
 Our whole gang went to go see it.

885
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,320
 It was really a fun day.

886
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,320
 Yeah.

887
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,320
 Yeah.

888
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,320
 Yeah.

889
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,320
 Everybody from the experience went to go see it.

890
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,120
 I'm just stalling for someone to just type in the chat.

891
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,760
 No, don't do that.

892
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:42,760
 That's yeah.

893
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:43,760
 Race for the crown.

894
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:44,760
 There you go.

895
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:45,760
 Thank you.

896
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,800
 Also race for the crown.

897
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:51,760
 Uh, I'll pass.

898
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,120
 Uh, that passes by the game rules that passes to Paul.

899
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:58,840
 I think it actually passes to me though.

900
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,800
 It's Paul, what is the quest?

901
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:08,800
 Galaxy quest is it at Paul close it out the category now stuck with the double music spoofs

902
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:09,800
 for 600.

903
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,280
 See, this is it.

904
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:16,320
 This is the fucking biggie for all 3,800 and the win.

905
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,320
 Oh man.

906
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:23,960
 Our first place or last place AI really took it to one of the legendary Beatles.

907
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,400
 Oh, it's not AI.

908
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,400
 That would be Al.

909
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,560
 Al really took it to one of the legendary Beatles when he quite accurately spoofed this

910
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:34,280
 song by writing his own version entitled.

911
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:37,840
 This song's just six words long.

912
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:42,680
 There's more lyrical craft in Al's version than the original.

913
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,740
 It's I got my mind set on you by George Harrison.

914
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:50,040
 I got my mind set on you by George Harrison.

915
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,040
 I'm sorry, Paul.

916
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:54,040
 It's got my mind set on you, not I got my mind set on you.

917
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,040
 I'm sorry.

918
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,520
 That's a loss, Paul.

919
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,520
 I'm sorry.

920
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,520
 You're right.

921
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,520
 It's a rough.

922
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,520
 It's a rough game, Paul.

923
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:01,520
 Oh, sure.

924
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,520
 Tough but true.

925
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,520
 Yeah.

926
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,520
 I mean, it is seven words instead of six.

927
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,520
 That's right.

928
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,520
 That is the game.

929
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:12,040
 We'll give Paul the win with 7,600 points.

930
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,480
 Matt's gotten second with 2,800.

931
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,000
 I've got third with 400.

932
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,960
 Thanks a lot, Top Secret.

933
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,520
 And that is from ScholarWallScoop.

934
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,520
 Thank you, ScholarWallScoop.

935
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:24,280
 If you want to send us a Scooperty or a Price is Right jock versus nerd or an Obelisk jock

936
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:29,240
 versus nerd or just some good old fashioned Scoop mail, head over to HeyScoops.com right

937
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,240
 there on the home page.

938
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:35,920
 You can do all those things at HeyScoops.com where you can also buy yourself some tickets

939
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:36,920
 to Scoop Fest.

940
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:37,920
 Buy tickets to Scoop Fest.

941
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,480
 It's going to be awesome.

942
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,680
 I saw some chats, Jacob.

943
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:50,800
 Make sure you're checking the messages coming through Scoop Group or Instant Messenger on

944
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,560
 the old Facebook.

945
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:57,400
 Somebody wanted to buy an extra ticket for the barbecue for their wife.

946
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:01,920
 I'm not checking anything on Facebook, but if you want to buy an extra ticket to the

947
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,280
 barbecue, go to HeyScoops.com, click on it, buy an extra ticket to the barbecue.

948
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,280
 There are a couple of tickets on there.

949
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,920
 There are some tickets on there.

950
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,160
 We've expanded the barbecue tickets.

951
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:18,240
 And I even told Eric the other day, we were talking about it a little bit.

952
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:23,240
 I think at this point, if anybody wants to come to the barbecue, sorry, not if anybody

953
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:26,560
 wants to come to the barbecue, if anyone would like to purchase tickets to the barbecue and

954
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:30,040
 come to the barbecue, we'll figure out a way to make it happen at this point.

955
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,680
 So come on down.

956
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,640
 Scoop Fest at the end of September.

957
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:34,640
 It's going to be awesome.

958
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:35,640
 Yeah.

959
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:36,640
 It is.

960
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,640
 I want to thank all the people who support this podcast until this weekend and week out.
