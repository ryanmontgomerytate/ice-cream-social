1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
 "She's mighty mighty, letting the shit leak out."

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:08,100
 "She's a brick, shit house, not terribly affected."

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,300
 This is the part of the show where we thank you, the Ice Cream Truck Drivers!

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,400
 Thank you so much, Ice Cream Truck Drivers!

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,200
 Our lists are fucked this month, I am sorry.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,600
 We don't have a new list yet, I don't know why, but it's all fucked up.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,600
 Maybe we'll have one by the time this comes out, who can say?

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,800
 Either way though, we're going to thank all of you before this month is over.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,400
 Thank you all the new Ice Cream Truck Drivers out there.

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,400
 Thank you everybody who supports us over there on Patreon.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,000
 If you want to be an Ice Cream Truck Driver, head over to PreachingFun.com.

 And who knows, the life you save may be your own!

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,600
 That's right, Dead Lazlo, professionals!

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,700
 Bro.

16
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,500
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an Ice Cream Social?

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,900
 Yeah, I'd love to!

18
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,400
 Great, let's go!

19
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:04,200
 Right before we got on air, Paula convinced me of the brick shithouse argument.

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,300
 I'm sorry, brick house.

21
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,800
 The pause to brick and house.

22
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,200
 It's a brick shithouse!

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,800
 That's what it's supposed to be.

24
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,200
 It's time for Matt Madinley's Ice Cream Social!

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,200
 Sitting in Pittsburgh, that's Paul Madinley!

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,000
 Sitting in Las Vegas, that's Matt Donnelly!

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,500
 Also sitting in Las Vegas, it's me, Jacob the Audio Guy!

28
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,000
 We're PreachingFun!

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,000
 How y'all doing?

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 I'm doing delightful.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 I just told everybody on stream I got a boo-boo from mowing my lawn today.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 You hurt yourself mowing?

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,500
 Yeah, I slipped and fell in wet grass because I was mowing so early to get done by the time

34
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,600
 the podcast hit.

35
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,800
 Which I did, I got it all done, which is great.

36
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,200
 But just injured.

37
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
 We're boo-boo brothers, Paul.

38
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
 What happened?

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,900
 Oh, Matt also has a boo-boo on his elbow!

40
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,000
 It's mostly healed, mine's from the water slide in Mesa, Arizona.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,500
 Oh, brothers in arms here.

42
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,600
 Is this a Corsican twin kind of thing happening, Matt?

43
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
 Yes.

44
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,000
 Is that what this is?

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,800
 Yeah, we are Corsican.

46
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,000
 We're Corsican twins.

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 I knew it.

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Oh, country scoop.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 My elbows are fine.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 I got elbow boo-boo.

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,400
 A lot of people got elbow boo-boos.

52
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,200
 They're going for like $7.80 a pop, elbow boo-boos.

53
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,000
 You know, I have tried to get, I just want a green one.

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 You want a green one?

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,600
 If I get a green one, I'll quit.

56
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
 Quit buying them, no.

57
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,840
 There's an economist, which economist?

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,160
 I don't know, who thinks the LeBouBou craze is a sign that we're about to hit like a really

59
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,480
 nasty economic thing in our world.

60
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,520
 I concur, and I would say also.

61
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:50,400
 An economist theorizes that the LeBouBou craze is foreshadowing a really bad financial time.

62
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,120
 Canary in a coal mine.

63
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,640
 Now, I know why he said this, but Paul was really quick to chime in that he also knew,

64
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,640
 so go ahead, Paul.

65
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,640
 Oh, sorry, Paul.

66
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,800
 Why is this happening?

67
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,860
 It coincides with the same thing that's going on within the trading card world, for those

68
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:11,200
 of you who play Magic or Pokemon and have ever tried to even buy the shit.

69
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:19,120
 But what it does, it correlates to people feeling frustrated that they have little to

70
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,560
 no buying power, and they're seeing this, it's sort of a gambling kind of thing with

71
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,000
 the LeBouBous.

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,040
 It's also the possibility of using their money to then resell it and make a little bit more,

73
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,400
 and that kind of thing.

74
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,240
 And also, it's not that crazy expensive.

75
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:42,780
 Buying a pack of Pokemon cards is not that crazy expensive, but it's a way to feel like

76
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,820
 you have some economic ability within you.

77
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,860
 Am I hitting the points there pretty close, Matt?

78
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,860
 A little bit.

79
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,840
 What you're saying makes sense.

80
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,920
 This person simply pointed to what economists have used in the past, what's called the lipstick

81
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,920
 index.

82
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,920
 Have you heard of this?

83
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,440
 So it's little treat, little treat time.

84
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
 That's it.

85
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,860
 The little treat thing is exactly it.

86
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:14,780
 So it's a sign that you can't afford big treats.

87
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:24,080
 So usually right before there's an economic downward trend, a nasty one, the prices of

88
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,400
 higher-end cosmetics go up.

89
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,180
 So suddenly people are spending a little bit more to feel better about themselves during

90
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:38,500
 the day on lipsticks and other high-end makeups because they can't afford to get on a plane

91
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
 and go somewhere.

92
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,360
 They can't afford to go to some exotic spot.

93
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,660
 They can't go to some property.

94
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,140
 They can't buy a new fancy car.

95
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:51,460
 This is why I'm glad my wife is in the coffee business.

96
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,020
 Fancy coffee is the ultimate little treat.

97
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,080
 Man, Starbucks is definitely just trying to create...

98
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,820
 That's their bar and trade, yeah, that's the whole thing, man.

99
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:06,540
 High-end drinks for women and drive-throughs, that's all that's happening.

100
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,080
 Every drink has a crazy color or crazy object in it now.

101
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,940
 That being said, I still like Starbucks.

102
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,940
 Starbucks is fascinating.

103
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,940
 There's nothing in Starbucks I love.

104
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,900
 I don't know if there's any amazing drink there or amazing food there.

105
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:26,620
 Well, and I guess it's from a coffee perspective, it's a very specific, very, is bitter the

106
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,980
 right word?

107
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,980
 Super roasted?

108
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:35,940
 They do a lot of high-roasted, super-high-roasted blends.

109
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:41,140
 And they're the first ones to really over-roast a Rebecca beans when we were all used to drinking

110
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,280
 Colombian coffee when they first came on the market.

111
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:50,300
 And so they torched, because they gave people a really robust flavor and then charged a

112
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,300
 lot of money for it.

113
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:59,820
 So we associated that taste with money because they created it.

114
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,580
 So that's become their signature thing.

115
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,580
 Some people...

116
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,380
 Yeah, but some people still like particular blends and things like that from them.

117
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,140
 So I don't want to besmirch the grudge.

118
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,220
 No, not at all.

119
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:15,980
 Famously, I described when I was a barista, every coffee profile is burnt and gotten troubled

120
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,620
 by my manager who's training me.

121
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,620
 It tastes burnt.

122
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:24,660
 You mean when you were doing your sample tasting as your onboarding kind of thing?

123
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,660
 Yeah.

124
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:32,100
 I'm getting notes of charred grill, campfire, whopper.

125
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,100
 That's exactly what I did, Jacob.

126
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,100
 But they told me to stop saying burnt.

127
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,260
 I started going campfiery, you know.

128
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:44,140
 Oh, this one tastes more like a brush fire.

129
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,140
 Overcooked bread.

130
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,500
 This has definitely got a crematorium kind of vibe.

131
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:54,500
 Oh, this reminds me of one of the seasons in California.

132
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,260
 Oh, fire seasons.

133
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,260
 Yes, that's right.

134
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:04,660
 Fireworks, warehouse disaster, notes of black cat explosion.

135
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,940
 Fireworks.

136
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,340
 This tastes very July 5th.

137
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,460
 July 5th!

138
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,460
 That would be...

139
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,500
 I love the smell of napalm in the morning.

140
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:29,040
 That would be an interesting coffee-whiskey blend, a 5th of July.

141
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,220
 5th of July is a very funny...

142
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,220
 Right?

143
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,220
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

144
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,220
 Make it like a drink.

145
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,220
 Embered.

146
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,220
 It's a 5th of July.

147
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,220
 Right.

148
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,220
 Jacob?

149
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,220
 Boo sales are down.

150
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,220
 You should get on that.

151
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,220
 Boo sales are down?

152
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,220
 Yes.

153
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,220
 Boo sales are down.

154
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,820
 I was reading this the other day.

155
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,420
 To no one's surprise, Canadians don't feel like drinking American whiskey right now.

156
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,620
 Which at least makes me happy.

157
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:58,780
 If they're not going to come see my little American show on the Las Vegas Strip, please

158
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,180
 don't buy the easier things to buy too.

159
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,060
 If you're going to keep your money away from my shit, go ahead and keep it away from the

160
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,060
 other shit too.

161
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:11,860
 It really is funny because we probably have some Canadians here up on our chat.

162
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,900
 Yeah, because they're not afraid to travel to our chat room.

163
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:22,940
 Yeah, but it basically is like, when you go like, "Oh, come on Canada," it definitely

164
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,740
 is like, "Oh," and then all that comes to mind is like, "We've been giving Canada shit

165
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,740
 for so long."

166
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:34,340
 All we do is fucking fuck with Canadians and finally they're like, "No, really, this time

167
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,340
 I'm leaving."

168
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,340
 And you're like, "No, come on, baby."

169
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,340
 Come on.

170
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,940
 "She never left before.

171
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,420
 She always just came back.

172
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,460
 Where are you going, baby?

173
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,740
 Where are you going?

174
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,180
 I can change Canada, I can change."

175
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,820
 You know my heart, Canada.

176
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,660
 You know my heart.

177
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:05,460
 Yeah, I mean, look, man, for all the shitty American boycotting of businesses, Canada was

178
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,460
 like, "No, no, no.

179
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,460
 Really."

180
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,460
 No, we out.

181
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,460
 We out.

182
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,460
 No, no, we really can flex, guys.

183
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,460
 We really can.

184
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,700
 Yeah, we got a couple of people living here.

185
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,380
 Yeah, it's not just some little island.

186
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,740
 Yeah, it's pretty crazy.

187
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,740
 Pretty crazy.

188
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,740
 I just listened to ...

189
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,740
 It's nuts.

190
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,740
 Oh, that's true.

191
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,620
 Scooper Nova Girl with the John Candy movie, Canadian Bacon with the recommend Canadian

192
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,180
 Bacon, a fine film.

193
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,180
 Oh, yes.

194
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,180
 It is a fine film.

195
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,180
 It is.

196
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,180
 There's definitely poignant at this point.

197
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:45,700
 You heard my favorite murder take on the heist, the big booze heist that happened out of the

198
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,900
 Johnny Walker distillery to hear about all that craziness that's happened in the, I guess

199
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,860
 it was early '90s.

200
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,860
 No.

201
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,420
 Did you ever hear this story, Jacob?

202
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,420
 I'm surprised.

203
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,420
 I don't think so.

204
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,420
 Maybe.

205
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,420
 I don't know.

206
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,420
 This guy ...

207
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,420
 Refresh my memory.

208
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,860
 What's that really famous old granddad?

209
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,580
 Not old granddad.

210
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,860
 What's the one that's really high end, the bottle that goes for crazy money?

211
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,060
 Pappy Van Winkle?

212
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,060
 That's it.

213
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,060
 Pappy Van Winkle.

214
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,060
 Oh, there you go.

215
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:20,460
 So they had Pappy Van Winkles on display in this guy.

216
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,900
 This guy was working for the distillery for years, and he worked his way up from distributing

217
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,500
 to being like a warehouse manager.

218
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,660
 Basically they had no security whatsoever, and he started stealing Pappy Van Winkle bottles,

219
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,740
 and he'd just steal them out of the display cases in the place.

220
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,980
 Yeah, he'd just take them from all over the place, and if he saw one not nailed down,

221
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,980
 he was taking it.

222
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,180
 Yeah, and selling them for lots of money, and just started off small, and by the end

223
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,540
 of it, he was just going crazy.

224
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,060
 Yeah, there was a Netflix special about him.

225
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,060
 Yes, I believe so.

226
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,660
 Because it was at the Buffalo Trace distillery.

227
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,660
 That's it.

228
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,660
 That's it.

229
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,860
 It was the Buffalo Trace distillery.

230
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,300
 That's the ones that make that booze.

231
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,900
 They make the Van Winkle line.

232
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,980
 Yeah, he was taking them, he was selling them to his friends, he was selling them to neighbors,

233
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,980
 he was selling them all over the place.

234
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,980
 It's a wild story.

235
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,980
 Yeah.

236
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,180
 And of course, he didn't stop at selling them to his next door neighbor for 500 bucks in

237
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,180
 cash or whatever.

238
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,180
 No.

239
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,420
 He had to put stuff online, got too big, and of course he got caught.

240
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,220
 Yeah, yeah, and all the records are on his phone.

241
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,940
 He didn't use a burner or anything, it's just his phone, all that kind of shit.

242
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,940
 Right.

243
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,940
 And like, grand larceny.

244
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,940
 Oh.

245
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,980
 It reached the stage of being like a big fucking crime.

246
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,980
 Totally.

247
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,860
 And there's a similar incident in Canada, but it involves maple syrup.

248
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,140
 Oh, I was going to guess hockey sticks.

249
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:46,220
 Your mission, should you choose to accept it.

250
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:52,380
 A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A. It's a Canadian version.

251
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,940
 It's a guy like walking out, but like everything he touches is sticky.

252
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,420
 Just like all his papers and stuff just attached to him as he walks out.

253
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,020
 I think you might be guilty, pal.

254
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,780
 No, no.

255
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,740
 I'm just wearing a sponge, I'm just wearing a sponge suit and I dip myself into a vat

256
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,820
 of maple syrup and then I'm going to go home and wring myself out.

257
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,820
 Gross.

258
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,820
 Sell those farmers market.

259
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,300
 I'm so sorry to have to ask this, but did you, did you steal that maple syrup?

260
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,300
 I'm sorry to ask, but did you steal it?

261
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,300
 I don't know.

262
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,460
 If something just attaches to your body, is it theft or is, you know, or did it choose

263
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,460
 to go with you?

264
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,460
 Oh, God.

265
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,460
 He stole it.

266
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,460
 That's a fine question.

267
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,860
 He dipped in it and then rinsed it off and sold rinse, rinsy maple syrup.

268
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:40,500
 This maple syrup that I buy from the store, I mean, sure, it tastes like maple syrup,

269
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,580
 but the maple syrup I buy from Ted down the street.

270
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,420
 Now it's got an extra little something.

271
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,420
 It's got a zing.

272
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,140
 He fucking, he fucking baby birded that shit.

273
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:56,060
 It took a giant straws like, and then, and then just waved as he walked out.

274
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,060
 Oh, gross.

275
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:03,580
 He kept it in his mouth, sucking up, sucking up maple syrup to a giant straw is so upsetting.

276
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,600
 Siphon it into his pants.

277
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,380
 See you later.

278
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,100
 Oh, that's so horrible.

279
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,100
 Bro.

280
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,700
 And he just, I don't know why that bothers me more than anything else on this show.

281
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,820
 Just a mouthful of syrup, like he's only able to fill up one medicine, go down.

282
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:25,500
 He fills up those little travel bottles every day, just fills up a travel bottle.

283
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,140
 He's only making like $2 a day with it.

284
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,560
 He's siphoning maple syrup, sucking it into a hose.

285
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:39,660
 You guys can drink these fireball on the plane or you can have grade B tasty maple syrup.

286
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,880
 Grade B?

287
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,100
 Grade B but edible tasty maple syrup.

288
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,980
 Scully's like, now he butt chugged it like a turtle.

289
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:54,020
 Most fun way to get diabetes for 1,000, Alex.

290
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,020
 Jason Victor.

291
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,020
 Yeah.

292
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,020
 The little maple leaf.

293
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,020
 Butt chugging like a turtle.

294
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,020
 The little maple leaf shaped souvenir bottles.

295
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,780
 That's exactly what I was picturing.

296
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,780
 Exactly.

297
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,780
 Oh man.

298
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,820
 But I actually know no details about the maple syrup that you're talking about.

299
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,820
 Yeah.

300
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:14,140
 It was a similar kind of thing, like insiders figuring out where maple syrup was being transported

301
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:20,660
 and hijacking entire bus loads of truckloads of maple syrup.

302
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:26,140
 Like hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars worth of maple syrup.

303
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,140
 Billions?

304
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:30,020
 I don't know about billions.

305
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,020
 Galactic president.

306
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,860
 If you count the tariffs, it's billions.

307
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,940
 I mean nowadays it could be.

308
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,940
 Nowadays it could be.

309
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,940
 Everything's up.

310
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,900
 Galactic president says a custom idea, maple syrup leg.

311
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,900
 Oh yeah.

312
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,120
 Not a bad idea.

313
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,420
 Not a bad idea.

314
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,420
 Ooze.

315
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,420
 Ooze.

316
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,380
 I went and saw two shows recently.

317
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,380
 Okay.

318
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,380
 Oh.

319
00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:02,060
 I saw Lucy Darling over at the NGM and she was playing, of course, with our good friend

320
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,060
 Sarah Hester Ross.

321
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,060
 Awesome.

322
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,820
 How was that?

323
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,460
 It was incredible.

324
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,340
 It was fascinating.

325
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:16,420
 And I say that just because obviously I come to Lucy through the magic world.

326
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:21,380
 Those of you who aren't familiar, you probably have seen Lucy Darling clips on your social

327
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,220
 media because she's really blown up.

328
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,220
 Right?

329
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,220
 Oh yeah.

330
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,220
 She's everywhere.

331
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,500
 She's still on improper crowd work.

332
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:38,940
 And so it's funny because basically magicians want to hate her for being successful.

333
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,180
 You actually hate everyone who blows up, like when Justin Willman first came around, everyone

334
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,180
 wanted to hate Justin Willman.

335
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,180
 Like it just happens.

336
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,300
 But people say like the dumbest shit.

337
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,300
 Right?

338
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:53,940
 So at first they were saying, you know, she's putting up, she's selling out these theaters,

339
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,140
 but they're very small theaters.

340
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,580
 And I was laughing and I was like, uh, uh, yes, please.

341
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,220
 Are you selling out a small theater, sir?

342
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,220
 Yeah.

343
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,340
 Give me, give me that problem tomorrow.

344
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,220
 And what are they, what are they making?

345
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,820
 So, so they're making fun of her for saying that she is selling out theaters and they're

346
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,700
 coming back and just being like, yeah, yeah.

347
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,700
 But they're little.

348
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,700
 She's the base.

349
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,900
 China says she's not as big time as, as you think she is or something like that.

350
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,900
 Right.

351
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,900
 Okay.

352
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,900
 Fine.

353
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,900
 Right.

354
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,900
 Exactly.

355
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,260
 And by the way, like she would sell a small theater, but like eight shows in a row.

356
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,900
 So it was like, okay.

357
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,900
 Like basically that just means like she could have played a big theater and went, oops,

358
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,900
 I booked the wrong theater.

359
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,300
 So like, okay, great.

360
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,940
 And she's smart.

361
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,700
 Like she's figured out, she's figured out something that I am chasing, right?

362
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,020
 She's figured out how to, how to, how to put herself online without spoiling all of her

363
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,020
 magic tricks.

364
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,020
 Yes.

365
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,020
 That is true.

366
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,820
 Has her interacting with people, getting laughs and it's out.

367
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,820
 Right.

368
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,820
 Oh, you know?

369
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,820
 Yeah, that's true.

370
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:56,740
 She's putting like funny moments of her show online, but not really revealing the tricks.

371
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,980
 Man, if, if you had funny moments in your show that you could put online, right?

372
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,300
 Oh, that'd be, that'd be so convenient.

373
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,400
 The problem is those aren't as easy to buy as magic tricks.

374
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
 That's true.

375
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
 That's true.

376
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,400
 So it's like, no foil again.

377
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,940
 Now I hate Lucy darling too.

378
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,380
 I put the ads out on Fiverr.

379
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,120
 I just can't get the jokes.

380
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:25,340
 So then someone said, like, well, you know, obviously people were just getting into her

381
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,100
 because they, because of her crowd work, some people were going to show not even knowing

382
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,660
 she's a magician, right?

383
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,660
 And then.

384
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,660
 Oh no.

385
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,940
 And then being like, that's what's going to like ruin their experience.

386
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,940
 Like I came to see.

387
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,100
 I came to see a funny comedian.

388
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,100
 She does magic tricks.

389
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,100
 I'm fucking out of here.

390
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,180
 Now she knows what card I picked.

391
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,180
 Fucking out of here.

392
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,180
 Disgusting.

393
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:50,600
 Well, I'm here to, to, to go ahead and put a bow on that as well.

394
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,740
 Because when I went and saw her in the show, I was curious.

395
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,900
 I wasn't, I wasn't, I wasn't in agreement with these people, but I was curious about

396
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,580
 what, what am I going to go see?

397
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,580
 Of course.

398
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,580
 Yeah.

399
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,580
 I didn't even know I was going to see Sarah Starrus.

400
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,700
 Sarah Starrus was there.

401
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,700
 Nice.

402
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:10,260
 And I know those two have been doing shows down in downtown at the, what's that spot

403
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,260
 called?

404
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,420
 Where, where, where our old improv theater used to be.

405
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,420
 The Inspire?

406
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,420
 Yeah.

407
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,420
 No, no, no.

408
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,420
 I know what it used to be called.

409
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,420
 The one in square where the onyx was.

410
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,420
 Yeah, yeah.

411
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,420
 Now there's a venue there.

412
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,420
 Anyway.

413
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,420
 Oh really?

414
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,420
 There's definitely a venue there.

415
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,420
 Yeah.

416
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,420
 Yes.

417
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,420
 Is it, is it that same space?

418
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,140
 No, it's a, it's in the middle there.

419
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,900
 A new, a newly built space.

420
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,900
 Kind of new.

421
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,900
 What's his name?

422
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,460
 Look at me with all the fucking details.

423
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:44,820
 Left Caesars and started running that space and I saw Sarah Starrus there.

424
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,580
 I had all the details when I talked about going to see Sarah Starrus' show.

425
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,580
 Okay.

426
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,780
 Remember I talked about how she, she packed it on a Monday night.

427
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,780
 Anyhow.

428
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,780
 Let's see, the Beverly, the Beverly, the Huntridge, third street notoriety.

429
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,780
 Nope, nope, nope.

430
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,540
 Just looking at downtown theaters.

431
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,540
 I don't know.

432
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,540
 We'll find, we'll figure it out.

433
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,540
 We'll figure it out.

434
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,540
 I'll figure it out.

435
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,540
 Yeah.

436
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,540
 Anyhow.

437
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,540
 So, so they have chemistry, like amazing chemistry.

438
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,540
 Yes.

439
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,260
 Like they really play off each other like very well and it's really, really fun.

440
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,260
 Yeah.

441
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:20,140
 And Sarah Hester Ross is so much dirtier than Lucy Darling, which is really funny.

442
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,300
 And Sarah is filthy.

443
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:29,740
 For people who have only experienced Sarah Hester Ross on this show, you don't understand

444
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,180
 how filthy Sarah can be on stage.

445
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,540
 And she's the, she's the headliner, so to speak.

446
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,260
 She's the second act.

447
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,740
 They just share the stage.

448
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,740
 She's a piano player.

449
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,740
 Oh, awesome.

450
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,740
 They just play off each other.

451
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,740
 It is awesome.

452
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,740
 It is awesome.

453
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,900
 And Sarah Hester Ross was a sniper, right?

454
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,900
 Like, you know, she's, she's used to running her own show.

455
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,380
 She's in like maybe she's like 20% of the show for this show.

456
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,420
 And so she just was like stepping up and just killing it every time she needed to.

457
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,380
 It was really great to see.

458
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,380
 Okay.

459
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:05,380
 The audience, indeed, loves Lucy Darling and just wants her to do crowd work.

460
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,140
 And that's what she did.

461
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,680
 It was a 90 minute show.

462
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:15,900
 The crowd was eating out of her hands the entire time, like roaring and loving everything

463
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,900
 she was saying.

464
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:21,900
 They were saying her lines for her, famous lines from her TikToks for her.

465
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:28,140
 And she did all of two magic tricks, two, did two, two in 90 minutes.

466
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,940
 I didn't know she was going to do magic tricks.

467
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:41,260
 Well, it's, it's kind of like Brad Sherwood was saying, crowd work slash improv.

468
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:45,900
 It's a kind of magic trick, just tricks, right?

469
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,900
 Sure.

470
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,380
 She, she has, she basically just kind of gave like four people roles, two people with big

471
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,460
 roles in the show and just kind of dared them to play along with the storytelling stuff

472
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,340
 and improv.

473
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,380
 And they just roared exactly, right?

474
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:06,580
 Like I was laughing because like Emily Gillette has always been very kind to all of us and

475
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,820
 was super kind to me, especially early on in my Vegas time here producing our improv

476
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,520
 shows and things like that.

477
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,100
 And whenever I talked to her now and I talk about being a magician, she always goes like,

478
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:23,900
 well, like she's always like, and I'm always laughing, like why, why do you hate that I'm

479
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,540
 a magician now, right?

480
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,220
 And she always goes, I just don't think it's the only thing you're going to do.

481
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,700
 I just think you, you're going to do more, which is, which is fine.

482
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,700
 Yeah, that's fine.

483
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,700
 That's a fine answer.

484
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,380
 But I really didn't know what she was talking about.

485
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,060
 When I saw Lucy Darling show, I was like, oh, this is what Emily Gillette would love

486
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,620
 if I was doing.

487
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:47,580
 Like this is actually, I did two little magic tricks in the middle and did 90 minutes of

488
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:52,740
 just me fucking around with my comedy friends and just making the audience roar with laughter.

489
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,740
 She would love it.

490
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,740
 Who was that dude?

491
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,740
 You're right.

492
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:02,380
 That very, I don't want to use the word pretentious exactly, but it was a very precious, it was

493
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,220
 a very precious magic show.

494
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,820
 It wasn't a lot of magic, but oh, I know who you're talking about.

495
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,940
 I have, I have his t-shirt.

496
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,540
 It's a classic magician here in Vegas.

497
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,820
 He's not around anymore.

498
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,820
 Hill Bill.

499
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,820
 Oh, yeah.

500
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,940
 I thought you were going to say, I'm going to say Hans clock or something.

501
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,940
 No.

502
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,940
 Steve, Steve Weirich.

503
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,940
 No, no, no, no, no.

504
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:28,740
 It was a Broadway special that this guy, and he had a moment about three years ago, I want

505
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,660
 to say, where he was the kid.

506
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,180
 You're talking about Derek Delgadio?

507
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,180
 That's who I'm talking about.

508
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,180
 Oh, okay.

509
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,620
 What's up with his new, is he doing something else now?

510
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,740
 Is he just, what's happening?

511
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,460
 He's doing a whole fish noodling thing.

512
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,460
 Okay.

513
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,940
 I ended up hanging out with him the other night by accident.

514
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,940
 He's fine.

515
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,940
 Okay.

516
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,940
 He's always fine.

517
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:54,100
 But, you know, he's very much in demand in corporate and private show settings.

518
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,620
 So he's got his niche.

519
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,620
 Yeah.

520
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,620
 Yeah.

521
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,620
 Yeah.

522
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,620
 That's great.

523
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,620
 We don't need to set up like a Kickstarter for him.

524
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,620
 I don't think so.

525
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,620
 Okay.

526
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:06,300
 Is he still doing a version of that show anywhere or is that kind of retired?

527
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,580
 He's just.

528
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,900
 I believe that's retired.

529
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,900
 All right.

530
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,900
 Right.

531
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,900
 Yeah.

532
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,900
 He had also had a run before then where he had partnered with this guy Helger, I think

533
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:21,340
 it was his name, Spanish guy, and they did a two person show with like all card tricks

534
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:26,380
 that Neil Patrick Harris fell in love with and produced and it had like a crazy run at

535
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,680
 the Geffen Theater, like an unheard of like six month run in Los Angeles.

536
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,940
 So he's had a couple of real feathers in the cap already.

537
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,940
 So okay, cool.

538
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,940
 Yeah.

539
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:43,020
 He's always been a real kind of like highly esteemed magician in the ranks or whatever.

540
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:50,580
 He also famously tried to get Brushwood kicked out of the castle for dress code violations

541
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:54,860
 for performing out of dress code.

542
00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:03,420
 So in fairness, any time I go to the Magic Castle, I try to get Brian Brushwood kicked

543
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,420
 out.

544
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,020
 Why are magicians such catty bitches?

545
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,020
 What the fuck?

546
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:11,420
 I mean, this is all old news, but it was just funny.

547
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,060
 There's only three tricks for them all to share, Paul.

548
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,620
 Because I only ended up hanging out with them in an happenstance way.

549
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,260
 And so I literally was like, oh, and that's funny.

550
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,000
 I was like, and basically my brain's going like, do not bring up Brian Brushwood.

551
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,260
 Do not bring up Brian Brushwood.

552
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,260
 Do not.

553
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,260
 That's all that's going on in my head.

554
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,700
 Because the answer could have been like, oh my God, that's so embarrassing.

555
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:34,980
 I was so into it back then and I was trying to be a castle boy and blah, blah, blah.

556
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,580
 Or it could be like, I still think the castle's got too much.

557
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:43,420
 It was like, no, and so I was like, yeah, it could definitely be like, fuck that guy

558
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,420
 still.

559
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,300
 And I was like, Brushwood even told me this story so long ago, I was like, I don't even

560
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,700
 know if he said something.

561
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,700
 He probably wouldn't even remember it.

562
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,700
 He might not even remember it.

563
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,580
 He might have been like, you did not.

564
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,580
 If I brought it up, he'd be like, please tell me you did not bring up that.

565
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,180
 So I kept my mouth shut.

566
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,780
 So you brought it up?

567
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,380
 No, this is it.

568
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,260
 I'm laughing because 10 years ago, I absolutely would have.

569
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,260
 Right.

570
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,220
 I've just been like, you know, I had to ask because I got your back, man.

571
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,380
 You know, I've learned because of Penn and Teller.

572
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,060
 There's having your back and then there's, yeah.

573
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:21,860
 I used to carry other people's water for so many conflicts and they'd be like, oh no,

574
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,860
 we buried that.

575
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,860
 And I'd be like, what?

576
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,860
 Oh shit.

577
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,740
 I've been furious at that guy for eight years.

578
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,380
 That's really fucking funny.

579
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:33,220
 Even with, I mean, maybe I shouldn't say this, but even like at one point, Tapeface and Piff

580
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:39,500
 had beef and Piff totally forgot to tell me that they absolutely buried it, that they

581
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:46,500
 absolutely made amends and get along and whatever.

582
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,500
 And I was like, what?

583
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,660
 I was carrying around hatred in my heart.

584
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,220
 I was awkward with him at red carpets.

585
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,180
 Because they weren't even like big beef.

586
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,860
 They were just like, it was like misunderstanding beef and they both knew it was misunderstanding

587
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,780
 beef before they squashed it, I think.

588
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,780
 Yes.

589
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,780
 They were basically both.

590
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,320
 They were both okay even before they squashed it.

591
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:12,740
 They ended up being accidentally played against one another via casino people and about like

592
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,380
 trying to find homes and casinos and so.

593
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,820
 It was just, you know, business stuff that actually is pretty boring when you break down

594
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,820
 the nuts and bolts of it.

595
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,820
 Yeah.

596
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,820
 It sounds exciting on the surface, but it's nothing.

597
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:27,980
 I'll tell you who else has beef with Piff the Magic Dragon and with Tapeface.

598
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:33,160
 I mean the three of these people are going to fight, Piff, Tapeface and this following

599
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,620
 sponsor are definitely going to have a physical altercation.

600
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,620
 Oh God.

601
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:42,300
 Today's show is brought to you by ... Where is it?

602
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,300
 God damn it.

603
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,300
 Here it is.

604
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:48,300
 I think I just put it in the more prominent place on my cell phone, not in the middle

605
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,940
 of row two on screen four of my apps.

606
00:26:51,940 --> 00:27:00,620
 But Cat Scratch Fever Salve, Cat Scratch Fever Salve is our sponsor and it's from Semi Pro

607
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,580
 Dad in 2022.

608
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:32,340
 It's Cat Scratch Fever Salve.

609
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:49,140
 I want to tell you about some really good stuff that he's selling that I'm pimping.

610
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,960
 It's called Cat Scratch Fever Salve.

611
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,780
 You ever get a scratch from a kitty-kitty?

612
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:00,020
 You ever get a little bruise, little scratch on your arm?

613
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,700
 Do you want that to get infected?

614
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,700
 No.

615
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,700
 No.

616
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,180
 Here's the best thing to do.

617
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:09,660
 Go ahead ... Oh, I remember his dumb name is Ted Nugent.

618
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:16,060
 Anyway, so what you want to do is go ahead and get you some of Ted Nugent's Paul Stanley

619
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:19,060
 Cat Scratch Fever Salve.

620
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:27,420
 Ted Nugent's Paul Stanley Cat Scratch Fever Salve is guaranteed to end inflammation and

621
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:32,060
 stop irritation and prevent infection.

622
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,060
 Yeah!

623
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,340
 Some of you might have been using wipes.

624
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:40,340
 Some of you might have been using disinfectant alcohol.

625
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:47,620
 I'm here to tell you what's better is Paul Stanley's Ted Nugent's Cat Scratch Fever

626
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,020
 Salve.

627
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:57,920
 It's medicated, it's vibrated, and it is perforated for your enjoyment.

628
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,920
 That's right.

629
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,180
 Take it from me.

630
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,180
 Perforated?

631
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,180
 The star child.

632
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,180
 I wouldn't lie to you.

633
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,180
 Buy it.

634
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:08,180
 Enter, "Hey Scoops at Checkout?"

635
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,180
 Buy.

636
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,180
 Saying "buy" is hysterical.

637
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:19,820
 I said buy it, but I should have just said buy it.

638
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:24,540
 Oh, I thought you were saying, "I'm done making this commercial now.

639
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,540
 Goodbye."

640
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,540
 Buy.

641
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,540
 It's over.

642
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,540
 I'm through.

643
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,540
 I'm through with that idea.

644
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,540
 Buy it!

645
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,540
 There it is.

646
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,540
 Cat Scratch Fever Balm.

647
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,540
 There it is.

648
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,540
 It's real.

649
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:42,300
 How about old Gene getting into the Kennedy Center?

650
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,300
 Gene and Paul both.

651
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,260
 You're in the Kennedy Center.

652
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,260
 Stop it.

653
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,260
 Paul agreed to go?

654
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,460
 Well, I mean, Paul and Gene are kiss.

655
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,460
 The kiss is going in.

656
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,060
 No, I think it's just Gene.

657
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,700
 Paul's been pretty adamantly anti.

658
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,860
 I don't know that they're going to go together.

659
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:02,100
 I'll be very surprised and disappointed.

660
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,900
 I mean, somewhat surprised.

661
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,940
 And some of the Kennedy Center honorees this year?

662
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,940
 Yes, yes.

663
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,940
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

664
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:13,300
 By the way, I don't have any beef with anybody going in.

665
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:17,180
 Like, the honorees, I'm fine with all the honorees.

666
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:21,620
 Does anybody care about the – are people saying these people shouldn't be going into

667
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,620
 the Kennedy Center?

668
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,620
 Sharing is exactly what we're talking about here.

669
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,900
 It reminds me of when Barry Bonds was breaking the home run record.

670
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,900
 Yeah.

671
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,900
 A little bit, yeah.

672
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,100
 And everyone was like, they want to do all this stuff like launch the ball into outer

673
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,100
 space.

674
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,100
 You know, all this other stuff.

675
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,100
 Right.

676
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,100
 Brandon Asterix onto it.

677
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,020
 What someone said is like, all that's going to happen is we're going to stop caring about

678
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,020
 the home run record.

679
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,020
 And that's exactly what we did.

680
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,020
 Yeah.

681
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,020
 We just stopped caring about it.

682
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,020
 Yeah.

683
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,020
 That's it.

684
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,500
 And then someone who does a trick with baseball cards, I can tell you, the ramifications of

685
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:51,320
 the steroid era are real, because when I ask people who likes baseball, and it's mostly

686
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,740
 young people in the audience, no one says yes.

687
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,780
 And sometimes, audibly, people go like, "Not me."

688
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,780
 Yeah.

689
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,780
 "Not me."

690
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,540
 And Adam and I go like, "Oh, no."

691
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,180
 And I'll even come with them with a bucket of baseball cards, and they literally look

692
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,180
 at me like, "No, I hate baseball."

693
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,660
 I'm like, "It's a first and a last thing."

694
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,660
 "I hate baseball."

695
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,660
 Can you chill out?

696
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,260
 They hate baseball so much they're like allergic to baseball cards?

697
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,260
 They literally recoil.

698
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,260
 Holy shit.

699
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,740
 It's like some kind of evasive extending pole and bucket.

700
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,740
 Sure.

701
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,740
 That it might not be-

702
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,740
 No, I understand the recoiling.

703
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,740
 Might not be.

704
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,300
 It might not be just the subject of baseball.

705
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:29,020
 I'm a little off putting myself, but it's a negative impact of baseball.

706
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:33,100
 And even like now, even in my baseball card collection that I use, I have a lot of old

707
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:38,400
 players in there, and I thought about replacing them with new ones, and it's basically-

708
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
 Nobody cares.

709
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,700
 Nobody knows.

710
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,180
 I can maybe put O'Tonnie in.

711
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:47,180
 I can maybe put Judge-

712
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,180
 A-Rod.

713
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,180
 A-Rod's the latest, right?

714
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,180
 I think you put O'Tonnie.

715
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,180
 I think you put-

716
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,180
 Yeah, A-Rod's in there.

717
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,420
 That's why A-Rod features in my thing, because I think it's the only one.

718
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,420
 I think it's the most-

719
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,420
 Is there anyone people know?

720
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,420
 And that's just because he was married to-

721
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,420
 I think it's the most-

722
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,420
 That dancer lady for a minute.

723
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,420
 J.Lo.

724
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,420
 Jennifer Lopez?

725
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,420
 You could maybe do Mike Trout.

726
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,420
 Was that her?

727
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,420
 Yeah.

728
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,420
 That dancer lady.

729
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,420
 A very famous celebrity.

730
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,420
 She was a fly girl.

731
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:13,420
 Yeah, but everything Paul is saying is true.

732
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,420
 A dancer lady fly girl.

733
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,660
 Please don't write on saying that Paul was right.

734
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,660
 We know he's right.

735
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:25,540
 I mean, if you look up her IMDB, it starts off with famous dancer lady, Jennifer Lopez.

736
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,860
 If you look up her IMDB, which no one has done-

737
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:34,260
 We also have owner of the Minnesota Timberwolves as well, as a result of multiple lawsuits.

738
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,580
 A-Rod is the owner of the Timberwolves.

739
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,060
 Oh, I thought you were about to say J-Lo owns the Timberwolves.

740
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,060
 No, no, no.

741
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,140
 That was going to be surprising to me.

742
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,140
 Yeah.

743
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,140
 But I mean, that's it.

744
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,460
 A-Rod is featured in the tricks simply because that's the one that I believe that most people

745
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,460
 would know if you don't like sports.

746
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,740
 Yeah.

747
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,540
 And that's an old joke, right?

748
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:56,660
 I made that decision eight years ago, right?

749
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,660
 And so-

750
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,660
 Right.

751
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,660
 That's crazy that it's that old and it still seems like that's it.

752
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,660
 What else?

753
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,660
 You're right.

754
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,660
 I don't even know what other name I even know.

755
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,100
 I've been to a couple of Pirates games.

756
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,100
 I couldn't tell you any of those players.

757
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,100
 No.

758
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:15,300
 I actually, I haven't done that a lot, but I really want to ask my kids, name a baseball

759
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,300
 player.

760
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,300
 Name a professional baseball player.

761
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,300
 Like a current one.

762
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,580
 Is there any way for you to get Savannah Banana cards in there?

763
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,300
 Because you could put like stilts in there.

764
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,060
 No one knows individual Savannah Bananas.

765
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,060
 People know what the Savannah Bananas are.

766
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,060
 People know stilts.

767
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,060
 No one knows individual players.

768
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,060
 They will not.

769
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,060
 The guy on stilts?

770
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,060
 He plays on stilts.

771
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,340
 I understand what you're saying.

772
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,660
 I understand what you're saying.

773
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,660
 How do people not know stilts?

774
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:44,100
 I believe that if I were watching a baseball game and there were a player on the field

775
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:49,860
 wearing stilts and I heard people referring to a player called stilts, I would know which

776
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,860
 player you were talking about.

777
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,300
 You'd be able to pick him out of a lineup that night.

778
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,300
 But after that, you know-

779
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:59,020
 I'd be able to, using the context clues, I'd be able to figure out who you meant.

780
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:04,460
 If I were to say scooped up by Roberto Clemente and thrown over to stilts, I don't think the

781
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,980
 audience would be like, "Yes!"

782
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,980
 You're right.

783
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,980
 Ooh, Savannah Bananas!

784
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,980
 I don't think-

785
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:13,980
 He just made a Savannah Bananas reference!

786
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,940
 What about characters from the Sandlot?

787
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,500
 There we go.

788
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:24,780
 I mean, you're right in that I'm trying to consider doing a whole different deal altogether,

789
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:31,340
 like, rather than, I don't want to go back to cards, but I'm trying to think of something

790
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,580
 just entirely different.

791
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,380
 There are Marvel trading cards.

792
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,100
 Everybody knows Marvel characters.

793
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,060
 Somebody did say earlier-

794
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,060
 That is interesting.

795
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,060
 Oh, Marcelo!

796
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:45,540
 Marcelo in the chat said earlier that you could get rid of the baseball cards and just

797
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,540
 put in Pokemon cards.

798
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,940
 Pokemon would be really funny, too.

799
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:52,900
 I think Marvel is a stronger move than- we've turned this into a brainstorming session,

800
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,900
 but I think-

801
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:58,500
 Stronger grip on the zeitgeist.

802
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,500
 Everybody knows Marvel.

803
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,500
 Not everybody knows.

804
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,500
 For Matt Show!

805
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,700
 Except it's my production.

806
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,100
 It's the My Newly Magic production meeting.

807
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,500
 Production meeting for Matt Show.

808
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,620
 No, Marvel characters are smart, and they're actually smart, too, because I also really

809
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,180
 want to get a Disney cruise ship.

810
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,180
 Oh, yeah!

811
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,180
 There you go.

812
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,180
 That's the way to go, man.

813
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,180
 Go with Marvel cards.

814
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,500
 Oh, well, they've got to be just Disney trading cards.

815
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,620
 Well, there's Lorcan-a.

816
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,620
 That's got to exist, too.

817
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,620
 You don't want to do Lorcan-a.

818
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,580
 Jacob, mine are fake anyway.

819
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,580
 Yeah.

820
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:33,220
 No, but there are Marvel art cards from back in the day.

821
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,220
 What?

822
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,220
 Oh, shit.

823
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,420
 This is what happens when people pretend to steal.

824
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,540
 I have Mickey Mantle and stuff, and they pretend to steal it in their pocket.

825
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,940
 In fact, someone has stolen a card from my-

826
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,940
 Oh, no!

827
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,940
 Outrageous.

828
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,980
 I thought it was a valuable baseball card.

829
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,980
 Someone stole a Cal Ripken thing.

830
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,980
 It was a valuable baseball card.

831
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,820
 And so, when they do it, I go like, "And if you think you're taking an actual baseball

832
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,380
 card from a working magician, you go ahead and keep that in your pocket and you tell

833
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,380
 all your friends."

834
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:06,740
 If you think this working magician has a Cal Ripken rookie card that he's passing around

835
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,700
 to you.

836
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,180
 No, the answer is fucking Marvel superheroes.

837
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,180
 Yeah.

838
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,180
 Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

839
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,180
 Yeah.

840
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,180
 It's easy.

841
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,180
 That's just the answer.

842
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,180
 Yeah.

843
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,260
 Anyhow, that's not what I was trying to talk about.

844
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,860
 Do they have to play baseball, though, for the trick to work?

845
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,860
 Yes.

846
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,860
 Yes.

847
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,860
 They have to play baseball.

848
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,860
 That's going to be a little-

849
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,860
 It's Iron Man playing baseball.

850
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:32,980
 People don't know that this is a secret softball game that takes place every year between DC

851
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:36,460
 and Marvel.

852
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,460
 Just go Marvel.

853
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,460
 Fuck DC.

854
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,460
 No.

855
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,820
 I am just going to go Marvel, because Disney owns Marvel, right?

856
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,820
 They do.

857
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,820
 And doesn't own DC.

858
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,820
 Yes.

859
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,820
 Yeah, yeah.

860
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,820
 So, I'm just going to just go Marvel.

861
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,220
 And then, no, I can narrate an event, Paul, instead of narrating a baseball play.

862
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,220
 Oh, fantastic.

863
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,220
 I can still narrate an event.

864
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,220
 Oh, man.

865
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,220
 Yeah.

866
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,220
 That'd be very cool.

867
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,820
 Because even my intro of it is like ... The intro of it is, when I was a kid, like the

868
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,540
 movie Field of Dreams.

869
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,900
 That's getting diminishing applause.

870
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,900
 Sure.

871
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,900
 Now, eight years later.

872
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,900
 Sure.

873
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,900
 Yeah.

874
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,240
 It was really nice when Kevin Costner was hitting again with Yellowstone, but that's

875
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,500
 gone now, too.

876
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,500
 Well, yeah.

877
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,500
 That's gone.

878
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,620
 I think Puddles has stolen all the Costner fire.

879
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,620
 That's just-

880
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,620
 That's true.

881
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,620
 There's nothing left.

882
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,620
 There's nothing left.

883
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,700
 And then, when I was doing it, Heidi Klum came in off the street and said, "Stop stealing

884
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:27,800
 everything from Puddles!" and then went back out on the street.

885
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,800
 Just wanted to make sure she-

886
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,800
 Puddles.

887
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,900
 I think Puddles did that after you started talking about it, so.

888
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:36,740
 Well, our attorneys will figure that out.

889
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,740
 Sure.

890
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:42,620
 I'm referencing, by the way, when I failed on America's Got Talent, and while they were

891
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:46,780
 judging me, I pulled out an apple and I sliced the apple with the knife I used for my card

892
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:50,900
 stab and started eating the apple, and Heidi Klum yelled, "You can't steal everything

893
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:59,900
 from Piff!" at me with a hatred that was like trying to stop a protest or something.

894
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:05,380
 It was with a family passion that she yelled at me.

895
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,180
 It was really startling.

896
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:14,020
 But we're talking about our blood oath loyalties.

897
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,740
 In the chat, we're getting some really good people talking about the times they were convinced

898
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:22,100
 to take a good blood oath, maybe.

899
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,100
 Let's see here.

900
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,100
 Too many people have chatted.

901
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,100
 I've lost track.

902
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:30,540
 But someone in the chat was like, an Olive Garden fired their cousin, and so the whole

903
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,620
 family protested all of Olive Gardens.

904
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,620
 The long-term grudges?

905
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,620
 Yeah, long-term grudges.

906
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,620
 Oh, I see.

907
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,620
 I see.

908
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:41,540
 The blood vendettas, not the blood oaths.

909
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,540
 Right.

910
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,540
 Jason Victor.

911
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,540
 Jason, are you un-muted?

912
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,220
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

913
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,220
 So what happened?

914
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,220
 You were fired?

915
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,220
 No, who got fired?

916
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,220
 No, my cousin.

917
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,420
 My cousin was ... Actually, it was kind of messed up.

918
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,420
 He was singing.

919
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,860
 He was like a waiter at Olive Garden, but he was really theatrical, and he would sing

920
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:01,980
 at tables and do all this ... He was like a tremendous performer and everything.

921
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,500
 He was in all these plays and shows.

922
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:08,660
 He would use tongs and pretend to be a crab and scuttle across the floor.

923
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,060
 So everybody loved him.

924
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:15,940
 A week before he was set to retire, they fired him without cause.

925
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,540
 My grandmother was like, "No, we will never go to Olive Garden."

926
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:23,660
 A week before he was set to retire, did he get knocked out of benefits and things because

927
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,660
 of that?

928
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,660
 Yeah, yeah.

929
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,660
 Yeah.

930
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,660
 Whoa.

931
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:33,020
 It was messed up, so ... Also, I'm finding out right now that Olive Garden has retirement

932
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,020
 programs.

933
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:43,100
 Now, this is like third-hand storytelling from ... We're built on hearsay and conjecture.

934
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,100
 That's fine.

935
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,100
 That's fine.

936
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,540
 We don't have the authority to be a primary source podcast.

937
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,060
 That's not where we're at financially.

938
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,260
 Also, we don't have an ombudsman.

939
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,260
 It doesn't matter.

940
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,260
 We do not.

941
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,580
 Nobody's checking.

942
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,580
 Who knows?

943
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:01,700
 It was one side of the story, times three times people I've heard it from, so I don't

944
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,620
 mean to create a beef for the whole podcast here.

945
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:09,220
 Oh, jeez, we're getting a phone call right now.

946
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:14,740
 It's the following sponsor, but the following sponsor is Olive Garden calling in to rebut

947
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,740
 this story.

948
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:19,660
 So here we are with Olive Garden and their rebuttal, "Take Away Olive Garden."

949
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:28,180
 Hey, it's a me, Mario Olive, and that's my brother, Luigi Garden.

950
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:34,180
 And today we are going to tell you that we don't fire people because we don't want to

951
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,380
 pay for their retirement.

952
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:38,900
 We fire them because we hate the singing.

953
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,220
 We hate singing so much.

954
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:44,380
 We hate theater.

955
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:49,460
 We often will not deliver food to any Broadway show.

956
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:55,060
 We will not offer endless breadsticks to anyone who knows how to play piano.

957
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:58,700
 We have a very firm, we've been against music from the inception of the founding of our

958
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,700
 company.

959
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,500
 How are you going to come to Olive Garden and sing one of endless breadsticks to cover

960
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,060
 your face?

961
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:09,760
 How are you going to sing endless breadsticks and a bottomless bowl of soup?

962
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:15,180
 You ever hear the phrase, "You sing at the table, the devil will dance on your navel"?

963
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,180
 That's the truth.

964
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:22,500
 You sing at the table, the devil will dance on your navel, so don't do it.

965
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,980
 It sounds a little different in Italian.

966
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:24,980
 It's more poetic.

967
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:33,300
 In Italian it sounds like, "You sing at the table, the devil will dance on your navel."

968
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:40,620
 But translated, that means you sing at the table, the devil will dance on your navel.

969
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,620
 That's much better.

970
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:45,580
 I'm sorry if I lost anybody there in my old country talk.

971
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:48,420
 Boy, I feel like I'm back at home.

972
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:52,700
 I feel like I'm back at home like a big old macaroni in my mouth.

973
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,580
 Enter in scoops and check out.

974
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,420
 Luisa got a little occasion at the end there.

975
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,460
 Oh, I like me some macaroni.

976
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,460
 Oh, boy.

977
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,460
 What?

978
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,460
 I guarantee.

979
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,460
 Go ahead, give me one.

980
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,460
 I'm going to roll this game.

981
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,460
 I'm going to roll this LP roll all the way over now.

982
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,460
 I'm going to give me some macaroni.

983
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,460
 Watch out.

984
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,460
 Go ahead, give me some of that.

985
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,460
 You're going to make my bolognese really spicy.

986
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,460
 I'm looking for some of that delicious lasagna.

987
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,460
 Wait.

988
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,460
 One last question for Jason.

989
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:25,380
 Did the protests hold?

990
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,140
 Have you never gone to an Olive Garden and do you know that no one in your family has

991
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,140
 ever gone to an Olive Garden?

992
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:35,220
 I think most of us have kept away from it for the most part, but if anyone did go, they

993
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,220
 would definitely.

994
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,220
 Wow.

995
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,920
 I don't think it's a real awkward Thanksgiving.

996
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,780
 I think it should be like, really, still none of us, not one Olive Garden.

997
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,780
 It's so affordable.

998
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:49,060
 It's right near the movie theater where I take my kids, are you sure?

999
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,820
 It's not great, but it's pretty good.

1000
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:56,260
 You know, this is a blood feud that actually benefits your blood from a salt perspective.

1001
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:01,380
 So that's kind of good.

1002
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,060
 This is like decades ago too at this point.

1003
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:07,780
 This is a really old, this happened a while ago, but I still remember she's like, no,

1004
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:08,780
 she called up everybody.

1005
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:09,780
 She's like, we can't go to an Olive Garden.

1006
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:13,380
 Was there a lawsuit after all that with the-

1007
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,380
 I don't think so.

1008
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:17,380
 I got to actually, I got to call him.

1009
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,220
 Is he okay?

1010
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,220
 We got to get it.

1011
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,220
 Yeah.

1012
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,220
 You get us an update on your cousin.

1013
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:25,680
 So busy hating Olive Garden because of the foiled retirement.

1014
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,060
 We never forgot the check.

1015
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:32,220
 Oh shit, my cousin died in 2020.

1016
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,060
 This was before GoFundMe's could help people like him.

1017
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:38,020
 Turns out he died right before COVID hit.

1018
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,540
 That's terrible.

1019
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:43,980
 My father won a defense case on this, like everyone presented all of these evidence of

1020
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,660
 like threats and all this other crazy stuff and phone records and all this stuff.

1021
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:51,540
 And my father on cross-examination was like, anyone check on him?

1022
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,940
 Anyone see if he was doing okay?

1023
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:57,100
 Like anyone ever talk to him about the threat?

1024
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,460
 The answer was no.

1025
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:02,620
 No one actually went to see if the person actually had anything threatening happening

1026
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:05,100
 to him and he got him off.

1027
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,100
 Wow.

1028
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,940
 Logic wins the day.

1029
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:15,740
 Never get tired of hearing stories about Dave Donnelly getting guys off.

1030
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:21,180
 I know he's happily retired now, just so everyone's not worried about Gary, but he's okay.

1031
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:25,740
 Does he sing at the table?

1032
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:31,220
 I saw him recently and I think he's still performing in community theater down in Florida.

1033
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:35,420
 Every Christmas he's like, "When they fired me from Olive Garden."

1034
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:39,300
 Oh, it's the story.

1035
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,660
 Oh, Gary's doing his song again.

1036
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,660
 Gary's doing his story song again.

1037
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,660
 We've heard this song.

1038
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:45,660
 Why is it every Christmas?

1039
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:50,700
 "I was only a week away from retirement, they cut me loose."

1040
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,700
 Shut the fuck up, Matt.

1041
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,700
 I love this song.

1042
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:53,700
 "With no excuse."

1043
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:58,540
 Oh, this is your first Christmas with our family, I forgot to tell you.

1044
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:00,300
 My uncle sings about the time he got fired from Olive Garden.

1045
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:04,740
 "When you sing at the table, the devil dances on your navel."

1046
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:07,260
 Oh, everyone knows that expression, we all know that expression.

1047
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:10,260
 Have you guys never heard that?

1048
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:16,260
 No, I've heard it in the original Italian, obviously, but never the translated version.

1049
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,020
 How was the Italian again?

1050
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:27,260
 "When you sing at the table, the devil dances on your navel."

1051
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,260
 That's it.

1052
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,260
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1053
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,260
 I'm sorry for that.

1054
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,260
 That's what I remember.

1055
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:32,740
 Bossy understood that, but nobody else got it.

1056
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:33,740
 Sure, sure.

1057
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:34,740
 Very clearly.

1058
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:35,740
 Thank you, Jason.

1059
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:36,740
 Thank you.

1060
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:37,740
 Oh, my heavens.

1061
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:38,740
 I hope his cousin is okay.

1062
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:39,740
 I mean, he's alive at least.

1063
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:40,740
 I think he's fine.

1064
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:41,740
 I'm sure.

1065
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:42,740
 I went into a bathroom the other day.

1066
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,740
 Stop it, gross.

1067
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:44,740
 Public bathroom.

1068
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:45,740
 And I was going to use the said bathroom.

1069
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:52,740
 And they had recently, it seemed, made a video, and I was like, "Oh, my god, I'm going to

1070
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:53,740
 die."

1071
00:45:53,740 --> 00:46:06,460
 I went into a bathroom the other day in a public bathroom, and I was going to use the said bathroom, and they had recently, it seemed, maybe painted the floor in the bathroom.

1072
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:07,460
 What?

1073
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:13,900
 And the paint they had chosen to use was that black paint that always looks wet, depending

1074
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,860
 on how you look at it, like from what angle you look at it.

1075
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:22,500
 So I'm in the bathroom, and I thought the whole floor was just wet, and I was trying

1076
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,100
 to move her.

1077
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,100
 I was so confused.

1078
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,100
 Oh, no.

1079
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,220
 You know, when you walk into a public bathroom and you just see a little, like, some wet

1080
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,980
 on the floor there, you just walk around it, you know, whatever.

1081
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:37,140
 This was, like, it was everywhere, and I had a moment of just sheer panic and didn't know

1082
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:41,700
 what to do before I realized it was just a terrible choice in paint by someone.

1083
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:45,260
 We had this happen when I was a kid.

1084
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:51,660
 Back in the day, we used to go to Kings Island as a family, back before I was working there.

1085
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:59,100
 And way back in the late '70s, which is when we went as a family, they used to have these

1086
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:06,940
 caves, these man-made, they were basically, what do you call those, like, holes?

1087
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:11,780
 Drainage tubes, big enough that you could walk through, you know what I mean?

1088
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:12,780
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

1089
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:16,180
 But they built it like a half tunnel.

1090
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:21,580
 So they made these tunnels, and they were these themed tunnels on, one of them was like

1091
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:28,580
 a Tom Sawyer, so you'd walk through and you'd see Injun Joe and Becky Thatcher, you know,

1092
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:34,820
 it was little static scenes of statues and things, but kind of retelling moments in the

1093
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:35,820
 stories.

1094
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:40,740
 Well, we go walking into one of these tunnels, and it had been raining that day, and there

1095
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:47,140
 was a pool of water in the tunnel, and the light was hitting it just right.

1096
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:50,340
 It looked like a pit.

1097
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:54,100
 It looked like a deadly pit that you couldn't go any further.

1098
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:57,180
 You would walk on it, and you'd fall to your death.

1099
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:03,700
 But what it turned out was it was a reflection of the ceiling from that water puddle.

1100
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:04,700
 Gotcha.

1101
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:05,700
 Yeah, yeah.

1102
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:09,140
 A precise optical illusion that it made it look like you were gonna fall and die, but

1103
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,140
 there was nothing.

1104
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:15,020
 But I take your point on the freakiness of walking around on a floor.

1105
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:19,400
 I was like, "Why would you paint this floor with this paint?"

1106
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:23,280
 Because then when it is wet, ugh.

1107
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,260
 Dead Lazlo's been boycotting Boston markets since 1998 because they wouldn't let him get

1108
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:30,260
 two of the same sides out of order.

1109
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:31,260
 Stop it.

1110
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:32,260
 Fair.

1111
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:39,660
 That is a reasonable reason to boycott Boston markets for 30 years.

1112
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:42,780
 And also that your boycott might work is really funny.

1113
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:47,260
 You indeed might have put them out of business.

1114
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:50,060
 Well, you didn't help, you didn't help.

1115
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:53,660
 Boston market had a smell, didn't it?

1116
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:54,660
 It did.

1117
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,260
 It had a very particular chicken seasoning.

1118
00:48:56,260 --> 00:49:01,740
 It was real strong, real pungent, almost like a, not as offensive to me as a Subway, but

1119
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,420
 same kind of vibe.

1120
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,420
 Mmm.

1121
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:05,420
 Mmm.

1122
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:06,420
 Yeah.

1123
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:07,740
 Yeah, that Subway smell.

1124
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:13,980
 In Portugal, there was a Subway in Lisbon, a Subway sandwich shop in Lisbon, and I went

1125
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,060
 and stuck my head in just to see if they had the same smell.

1126
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:19,580
 Yeah, this is a true story.

1127
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:20,580
 And they did.

1128
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,580
 They did.

1129
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,580
 Okay.

1130
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:23,580
 They did.

1131
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,580
 Same smell.

1132
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:25,580
 Overseas Subway shop.

1133
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:26,580
 Same smell.

1134
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:27,580
 Didn't matter.

1135
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:29,860
 I think it's just when you handle meat, it gives off a certain odor.

1136
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:31,980
 I think it's a meat handling odor.

1137
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,580
 I think you're right, Paul.

1138
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:39,580
 If you suck it on maple syrup, it gives a different flavor palette.

1139
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:40,580
 Yeah.

1140
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:41,580
 Ugh.

1141
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:45,300
 My, especially with my syrup, it was baby birded to me by someone who worked at a Canadian

1142
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,420
 maple plant.

1143
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,220
 God damn it.

1144
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,660
 That's why you got fired from the Olive Garden, because he was spitting the linguine onto

1145
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:54,660
 the tables.

1146
00:49:54,660 --> 00:50:02,300
 It was, it was baby bird, how many times do I have to tell you not to baby bird the linguine

1147
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,460
 to our customers?

1148
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,140
 You fired, you fired my uncle for his singing.

1149
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,900
 No, we fired your uncle for spitting food in other people's mouths.

1150
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,420
 I've got some grated parmesan, say when?

1151
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:13,420
 When?

1152
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,420
 When?

1153
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:15,420
 When?

1154
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,420
 When?

1155
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,420
 I didn't want you to win.

1156
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:18,420
 Win.

1157
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,420
 Win.

1158
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:20,420
 Okay.

1159
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:21,420
 An hour ago win.

1160
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:22,420
 An hour ago.

1161
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,420
 Okay.

1162
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,420
 I'll be back if you need anything.

1163
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:27,980
 I'm sorry, do you have any, do you have any fresh black pepper?

1164
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,020
 Hold on, I got some between cheek and gum on the other side.

1165
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:35,460
 Oh no, God damn it, why did I ask?

1166
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,140
 Oh, I regret this.

1167
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:45,620
 I keep several different kinds of cheese and spice in my mouth while I'm serving.

1168
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:47,780
 So that I can dispense it at any time.

1169
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:48,780
 It does sound like Cher.

1170
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:49,780
 I'm sorry.

1171
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:53,580
 Now, if you want to know how to impersonate Cher, all you got to do is imagine you've

1172
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:57,740
 got a mouth full of paprika.

1173
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:03,260
 We should say, we have to address some housekeeping over here, a little stuff on the internet

1174
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,140
 and some confusion in the chat.

1175
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:09,900
 So I accidentally, when I uploaded our last episode, uploaded it with today's episode

1176
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:10,900
 number.

1177
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,860
 And so it came out as 1236 to 1235.

1178
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:16,980
 And then people thought a crazy trend was happening because they said also we can't

1179
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:21,980
 find another episode on there and I won't even name the number.

1180
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:29,460
 And so the answer is one was my error and so you're not missing two episodes.

1181
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:30,900
 You are missing one.

1182
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:31,900
 Yeah.

1183
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:34,100
 And that's temporary.

1184
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,460
 Yes.

1185
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:44,140
 But a listener, just like Jason came on here and shared a lovely story there.

1186
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:46,180
 If all of a sudden his uncle was like, what the hell?

1187
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:50,460
 And also, sorry, gang up on his uncle on the internet, then we would maybe try to not be

1188
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:51,860
 the cause of someone's heart.

1189
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:52,860
 Mitigate that.

1190
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,860
 Yeah.

1191
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:57,340
 So yeah, it turned out someone was getting picked on by jerks on the internet.

1192
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:01,940
 And so we took down the episode to stop being a source of woe to one of our listeners.

1193
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:03,900
 And I'm going to edit that episode out.

1194
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,420
 I've got, I've got all the little spots to edit it out.

1195
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:07,740
 I just haven't been able to do that yet.

1196
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:11,940
 I'm hopefully going to, by the time this episode comes out, I'm hoping that that episode will

1197
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,460
 be back up as well.

1198
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:14,460
 It will be back.

1199
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:22,300
 In the meantime, please help yourself to one of our 1,230 other episodes, which, which

1200
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:28,940
 I am proud to say, I am proud to say we have stuck to it.

1201
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:35,740
 Our base episodes have been up and free and unpaywalled from the jump.

1202
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:36,740
 Yes.

1203
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:37,740
 I am really proud of that.

1204
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:38,740
 Except for this one.

1205
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:39,740
 This one is behind the paywall.

1206
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,740
 It's not behind the paywall.

1207
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:43,740
 It's not.

1208
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:45,500
 Oh, you can pay me and I'll send it to you.

1209
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,500
 Oh my God.

1210
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,500
 Okay.

1211
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,500
 Yeah.

1212
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,500
 All right.

1213
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,500
 There's ransomware here.

1214
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,500
 It's also not even the-

1215
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,500
 @AudioGuideJacob, pay me.

1216
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,500
 I'll just send it right to you.

1217
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,820
 It's not even the first time we did this.

1218
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:58,100
 We did pull down temporarily the one where I wasn't going to get sued by the people who

1219
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,100
 made Maryland.

1220
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,620
 Let me put that back up.

1221
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:02,620
 Right.

1222
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:03,620
 That's fine.

1223
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:04,620
 Yeah.

1224
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:05,620
 These things happen.

1225
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:06,620
 Yeah.

1226
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:07,620
 We got the finger on the pulse, people.

1227
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:08,620
 This is what you get.

1228
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,860
 You caught up in the mix.

1229
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:11,860
 Sorry.

1230
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:14,940
 Sorry for misnumbering to point of the fact that we did take down an episode.

1231
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:16,300
 So yeah, right now you're missing one episode.

1232
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,300
 I'll be back soon.

1233
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,580
 Two different things happened.

1234
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,580
 And yeah.

1235
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:23,980
 But the one we're ordering, the one we're listening to right now is-

1236
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:24,980
 Quantity over quality.

1237
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:25,980
 OG.

1238
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,500
 OG with the zinger.

1239
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,500
 I know.

1240
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,500
 You're not wrong.

1241
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,500
 OG coming in hot.

1242
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,500
 You're not wrong, Andy.

1243
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,500
 Yeah.

1244
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:34,500
 We're not arguing with you.

1245
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,500
 We're just laughing at the fact that you said-

1246
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:39,420
 But there's also a reason why Subway was successful.

1247
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,420
 The smell.

1248
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:41,420
 So there you go.

1249
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,420
 The smell and the quality.

1250
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,420
 Yeah.

1251
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:48,300
 They said, "We'd like to make this restaurant smell like the tunnel of the New York City

1252
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,300
 Subway system."

1253
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,300
 Yeah.

1254
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:54,220
 And much like a Subway sandwich, we were also worth hitting an ice officer in the face with.

1255
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:57,220
 Oh, hey, you know, I had a good one on that one.

1256
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:03,620
 A friend of mine sent me one of those Gaston flag parodies with that.

1257
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:11,060
 And the sandwich was being thrown at his face, you know?

1258
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:14,860
 And it's like, it said like, don't- what is it?

1259
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,660
 It was like, "Don't sub-"

1260
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:21,020
 All I know is I'd rather have a dildo thrown at me while I'm playing basketball.

1261
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:22,020
 Oh my God.

1262
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,020
 That's outrageous how much that's happening.

1263
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:24,900
 The sandwich thrown at me at any other time.

1264
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:28,940
 But it was like, "Don't sandwich on me," or something like that, you know what I mean?

1265
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:37,820
 And my quip was, "That guy should be referred to as Hoagy's heroes."

1266
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:38,820
 That's pretty good.

1267
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,780
 Glad we looped around to pick that one up.

1268
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:41,780
 I know nothing.

1269
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,220
 I know nothing.

1270
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:46,220
 I laugh.

1271
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:50,500
 We all get spammed every day with people trying to scare us with different bullshit things.

1272
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:56,220
 I had never changed my New Jersey area code on my phone.

1273
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,220
 Right.

1274
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:58,220
 Right.

1275
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:59,220
 Why should you?

1276
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:05,180
 So all my spams are like, "This is New Jersey DMV," or like, "This is New Jersey Power

1277
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:06,180
 Authority."

1278
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:08,180
 I have a Louisiana number, and it's the same thing.

1279
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:12,300
 I've got the 702, which tips me off every time these motherfuckers come call.

1280
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:17,300
 I'm like, "Well, you- I don't even know her.

1281
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:20,620
 That's my purse."

1282
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:25,140
 Anyways, Lucy Darling and Sarah Soros play each other tremendously well.

1283
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:27,660
 Sarah Soros is a sniper.

1284
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:31,300
 Ninety minutes, the crowd was just loving and roaring with her.

1285
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,420
 Merch line out the door.

1286
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:34,420
 Yeah.

1287
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:35,420
 Oh, fuck yeah.

1288
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:39,580
 It was one of like a dozen shows where they were all sold out at the MGM in Brad Garrett's

1289
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:40,580
 old space.

1290
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:41,740
 Brad Garrett Comedy Club moved.

1291
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:46,180
 That's how out of touch I am.

1292
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,340
 And it's Tapeface's theater.

1293
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:48,340
 The New Space is good too.

1294
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:50,100
 Tapeface, who I have no problem with whatsoever.

1295
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,100
 Love me some Tapeface.

1296
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,100
 Yeah.

1297
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,100
 I kinda like Tapeface.

1298
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,100
 In his theater.

1299
00:55:54,100 --> 00:56:00,300
 And it was one thing she was like, "Oh, she's famous.

1300
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,300
 She's hit."

1301
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:09,300
 I'm waiting an hour for her to say hello to all of her fans, and then I can hang out.

1302
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:13,700
 And when I looked at her, I was like, "Hey, I don't know what this show is."

1303
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:14,700
 And she was laughing.

1304
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,340
 And I was like, "It's not?

1305
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:19,940
 I mean, you're not doing traditional standup.

1306
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:20,940
 You did two magic tricks.

1307
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:21,940
 It's not a magic show."

1308
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:26,660
 I was like, "You're really like keeping a bit in the air?

1309
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:31,820
 You keep like five bits in the air, and the audience loves it.

1310
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:36,020
 And then you bounce back and forth between these bits, and the audience just loves you

1311
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:37,020
 for it.

1312
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,780
 And it's crazy."

1313
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:45,180
 But people loved it, people were just clapping for her, cheering for her, laughing for her.

1314
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:47,940
 I was laughing hysterically through the whole show.

1315
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,620
 I just realized right now that I might have sounded like I was qualifying myself outside

1316
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:51,620
 of the laughter.

1317
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:52,620
 I was not.

1318
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:53,860
 I was part of it.

1319
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:56,500
 I was part of it.

1320
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:00,500
 Also went and saw Atomic Saloon, so I went to see our friend Tyler before he departed.

1321
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,500
 Nice.

1322
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,100
 Where's he going?

1323
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,420
 He's going off on a Broadway tour.

1324
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:06,980
 Water for Elephants.

1325
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:10,380
 They went ahead and made a musical of Water for Elephants, which is an amazing book that

1326
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:11,380
 people love.

1327
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:14,420
 And then in it, there's actually a little person in it who's a real three-dimensional

1328
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:21,320
 character, not some magical elf, actually plays a dramatically awesome role in the show.

1329
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:26,900
 And then Tyler's getting to play that amazing role as the first Broadway tour, and I guess

1330
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:27,900
 that's worth doing.

1331
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:31,420
 Man, we got to get him back on again after this run.

1332
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:34,620
 We got to get him back on to talk the tour.

1333
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:35,620
 That'll be fantastic.

1334
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:36,980
 No, I'm so excited for him.

1335
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:41,540
 I ran into him happenstance at a bar the other night, and so we got to chat for about half

1336
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:47,340
 an hour, 45 minutes or so, and I didn't realize he's never done a Broadway tour before.

1337
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:51,060
 He's never done anything like this before, so this is just all new experiences for him

1338
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,740
 as well.

1339
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:53,740
 I'm excited for the show.

1340
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:54,740
 I'm excited for him.

1341
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:56,220
 Yeah, it's going to be great.

1342
00:57:56,220 --> 00:58:01,620
 Oh, he has to do it, and I was saying, obviously they didn't want him to go.

1343
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:03,580
 He's great in the show at Atomic Saloon.

1344
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:09,300
 He really, really makes that role so special, and he's so good at it, and he's so funny.

1345
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,580
 He's so personable.

1346
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:12,920
 He really connects with an audience.

1347
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:21,260
 He really just is a natural born entertainer, and it's really special to watch him work.

1348
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:28,660
 My family and I saw him do a random Panto show in New York, because it was only after

1349
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:32,740
 I saw him in Mavericks that I was like, "Oh, we're in New York?

1350
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:33,740
 He's doing a show?

1351
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:34,740
 Let's go see it."

1352
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:35,740
 We kind of knew him.

1353
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:36,740
 Yeah.

1354
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:37,740
 We weren't as friends with him like we are now.

1355
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:39,180
 We just had to see him.

1356
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:45,620
 We love Tyler, and so it was really great to see him in the show.

1357
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:48,500
 The last few times I've seen it, it's still great.

1358
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,500
 It's the best it's been.

1359
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,780
 Atomic Saloon is in the best shape it's been.

1360
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,780
 I think it's an awesome show to go see.

1361
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:57,340
 I'm so glad to hear that, because I really enjoyed the fuck out of that show.

1362
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:58,340
 Yeah, it's a good one.

1363
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:01,380
 I saw it twice while I was still out there, and it's great.

1364
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:05,420
 Yeah, the hosts now and the bits are just so much more present and right with the audience,

1365
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:07,740
 and then the kick-ass acts that are in it are well.

1366
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:10,260
 Our friend Christian is back in with his little dog.

1367
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:13,520
 He does the acrobatic act with the dog.

1368
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,520
 So good.

1369
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,220
 It's such a fun show.

1370
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,740
 I got hit with a bunch of bread rolls.

1371
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:20,620
 Oh, good.

1372
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:21,620
 Good.

1373
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:27,100
 I was the kind of tap percussion duo that's been there from the fucking beginning.

1374
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:31,580
 I was looking, I was like, "Jesus, wow," because they were back from Vegas Nocturne.

1375
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:32,580
 That's right.

1376
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:33,580
 Yeah, Suzanne and Peter.

1377
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:36,540
 Suzanne and Peter have just been in this town, entertaining.

1378
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:37,540
 That's nuts.

1379
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:43,660
 They do a bit where they do this percussion, but they're like the whatever, the hillbilly

1380
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,460
 twins or whatever.

1381
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:49,220
 He has a bunch of bread rolls in his pocket, and you don't see it.

1382
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,220
 He snipes people.

1383
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:54,060
 He just dances around, and all of a sudden, boom, a bread roll just comes flying across.

1384
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,060
 It's great.

1385
00:59:55,060 --> 01:00:00,860
 And right before the show, I was in the back of the main little orchestra section.

1386
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:02,340
 They're like, "Do you want to move up?"

1387
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:08,380
 And in my head, I was like, "How much do I want to get hit by bread rolls?"

1388
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:10,260
 But I was like, "Yeah, let's go for it.

1389
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:11,260
 Let's get moved up."

1390
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:12,260
 And I was just like, "Oh, man."

1391
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:13,260
 I got clunked.

1392
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:14,260
 Pelted, huh?

1393
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:15,260
 Bread rolls.

1394
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:16,260
 Yeah.

1395
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:17,260
 Bread rolls.

1396
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:22,500
 Last time I saw it, your wife was in it, and our friend, Matt Morgan, they were the

1397
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,860
 duo in it the last time I saw it.

1398
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:26,660
 So they got me up on stage.

1399
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:30,700
 Matt is also a very funny preacher, and I cannot resist that, but he's basically the

1400
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,380
 director now over there.

1401
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:35,860
 But I saw Heidi host, because my wife was not performing.

1402
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:37,580
 I still haven't seen Heidi do it.

1403
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,260
 She's very funny.

1404
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,260
 It is different.

1405
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:44,340
 It is definitely different than Sarah's and everyone else's, and it's really good.

1406
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:47,420
 We're talking about Heidi, Brooke, and Morgan, who we've had on the show with Matt Morgan

1407
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:48,420
 before.

1408
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:51,940
 Yeah, they are just a powerhouse in everything that they do.

1409
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:52,940
 Yeah.

1410
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:57,780
 But Sarah was not performing with Tyler before Tyler left, so I went and saw Heidi do it.

1411
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:58,780
 Nice.

1412
01:00:58,780 --> 01:00:59,780
 Yeah, yeah.

1413
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:00,780
 Kick ass.

1414
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:01,780
 That's good.

1415
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:02,780
 You've seen Sarah plenty.

1416
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:03,940
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1417
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:09,600
 Over at the Venetian, giant Wizard of Oz display over there.

1418
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,180
 I have my tickets.

1419
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:17,180
 Now the Sphere and Venetian are two totally different entities, right?

1420
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:19,700
 They are, but I believe they have kind of a partnership.

1421
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:24,620
 Yeah, because basically it just became like haphazard, the only place to park to go to

1422
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:25,620
 the Sphere is the Venetian.

1423
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:26,620
 Right.

1424
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:30,140
 And so the Venetian started charging event pricing during Sphere events.

1425
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:31,220
 Right.

1426
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:34,780
 Which is great for me because it has taken out the question.

1427
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:41,460
 So now I just pay the ridiculous amount of money to park at the Sphere because it's close

1428
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:46,740
 and it's convenient, because Venetian is now charging like $10 less.

1429
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:54,820
 Well, it is worth that $10 to me to not walk across the city and get to this event.

1430
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:58,180
 So I guess I'll just pay the extra 10 bucks and not have to worry about it.

1431
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:01,740
 Thanks Venetian for being assholes and charging too much for parking.

1432
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:02,740
 Yeah.

1433
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:06,660
 Country Scoop is mentioning that there's a place called Lambert's in Alabama, famous

1434
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:09,940
 for throwing bread rolls across the dining room.

1435
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:14,180
 Do you know, Matt, was that taken from that place or not?

1436
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:15,460
 Maybe.

1437
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:17,060
 I know that it was not.

1438
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:18,060
 Okay.

1439
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:19,060
 Oh.

1440
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:20,060
 Yeah.

1441
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:22,840
 Because I know Lambert's and they have a couple of places.

1442
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:26,180
 They have one outside of St. Louis as well that I've been to.

1443
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:27,180
 And they do.

1444
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:31,460
 They just chuck, like if you need a roll, you just like throw up your hand and like yell

1445
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:32,860
 like roll.

1446
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:35,300
 And they just chuck it across the room baseball style.

1447
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:37,300
 We saw some videos of that, Anne and I.

1448
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:41,700
 Oh, but I asked about that when Atomic Saloon started and nobody had heard of it.

1449
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:43,580
 It became a running joke for Anne and I.

1450
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:49,740
 She ended up buying us big Lambert's mugs with the guy throwing the bread roll on it.

1451
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:50,740
 Home of the Throwed Rolls.

1452
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:51,740
 That's right.

1453
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:52,740
 That's it.

1454
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:53,740
 Home of the Throwed Rolls.

1455
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:54,740
 Throwed Rolls.

1456
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:55,740
 Throwed Rolls.

1457
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:56,740
 The way they say it there.

1458
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:57,740
 Yeah.

1459
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:02,580
 So are you going to this Wizard of Oz show, Matt, or you just went to the display?

1460
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:04,780
 I have yet to see any show at the Sphere.

1461
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,540
 I don't know if the Wizard of Oz is even open yet.

1462
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:08,540
 It is not.

1463
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:13,380
 I have tickets to go see it though in September.

1464
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:14,380
 I think.

1465
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:16,620
 I think I have tickets to go see it before Scoopfest.

1466
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:17,620
 Yeah.

1467
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:21,100
 I know it is opening soon and our friends are flying out to come see it.

1468
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:23,380
 This is going to be a gigantic hit.

1469
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:24,500
 I think so too.

1470
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:33,980
 I was just talking about this on another show the other day that this - actually on - sorry

1471
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:34,980
 Brian and Justin.

1472
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:39,660
 I just forgot Great Night's Patreon only section that they do.

1473
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:40,860
 Their bonus episode that they do.

1474
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:41,860
 The Bones.

1475
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:42,860
 Thank you.

1476
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:43,860
 Yeah.

1477
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:46,060
 So I was on the Bones with them and we were talking about that and that is what I was

1478
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:47,060
 saying.

1479
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:49,540
 I was like this is - they tried the Nature video.

1480
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:50,620
 They tried all that stuff.

1481
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:54,740
 The thing to make money when they don't have the giant concert going in the Sphere.

1482
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:59,260
 And I think Wizard of Oz is going to do very well in that regard.

1483
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:02,460
 And they are hiring live entertainers to be a part of it.

1484
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:03,460
 Yes.

1485
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:07,940
 And so some of our friends are getting really good gigs out of this as well.

1486
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:08,940
 Yeah.

1487
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:09,940
 Yeah.

1488
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:10,940
 That is great.

1489
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:11,940
 And so it makes me more hopeful about it.

1490
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:16,860
 Oh and Scoopanova Girl is in the chat saying that she saw the morning video on CBS and

1491
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:18,100
 it didn't look good.

1492
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:25,620
 I believe that because nothing is - other than I think the movie itself, I don't think

1493
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:26,780
 anything else is done.

1494
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,780
 I think they are still creating everything.

1495
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:31,700
 So I believe that the advertising for it at this point would look really bad.

1496
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:37,420
 But I think also it is unfortunate that I think they are incorporating some AI gobbledygook

1497
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:40,980
 into the side effects around the giant screen kind of thing.

1498
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:45,700
 So I have seen some clips that - because like there is - you know they are doing like -

1499
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:52,660
 AI is going to be a part of fucking everything but AI is going to be in there.

1500
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:55,060
 I hear that it is not going to be the film in its entirety.

1501
01:04:55,060 --> 01:05:02,380
 It is a lot - I am going into it with a positive outlook on it and I am hoping that it is going

1502
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:03,380
 to be great.

1503
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:04,380
 Right.

1504
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:05,380
 Yeah.

1505
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:06,380
 And I am not -

1506
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:07,380
 If it is not, I will let you know.

1507
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:12,140
 Look, I am not a big Backstreet Boys person and I cannot speak to whether that is a good

1508
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:13,140
 thing.

1509
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:14,140
 It is a hit.

1510
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:15,140
 Yeah.

1511
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:17,700
 I can speak to the fact that the Backstreet Boys are punching up.

1512
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:20,180
 Like that was a way over achieving experience.

1513
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:21,180
 Yeah.

1514
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:23,780
 Like I want to go see their show at the Sphere.

1515
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:24,780
 Yeah.

1516
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:25,780
 Yeah.

1517
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:28,700
 So I am saying it is going to be a gigantic hit.

1518
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:30,700
 I don't know if it is going to be like My Cup of Tea.

1519
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:31,700
 I am just saying.

1520
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:32,700
 Yeah.

1521
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:33,700
 It is going to be good.

1522
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:34,700
 I am looking forward to it.

1523
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:39,860
 And as the Sphere exists as a black hole that is slowly sucking and destroying every other

1524
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:41,380
 piece of entertainment in this town.

1525
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:42,380
 That is true.

1526
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:45,380
 I can speak objectively to all of those things.

1527
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:51,540
 Like that giant snow globe is going to cause a lot of my friends their jobs.

1528
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:52,540
 Yeah.

1529
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:56,140
 So I am only happy to at least create a couple on the way out.

1530
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:57,140
 Yeah.

1531
01:05:57,140 --> 01:05:59,500
 There is at least that.

1532
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,500
 Yeah.

1533
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,500
 There is that.

1534
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,500
 There is that.

1535
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:10,340
 Because we have become a, the town, basically Sphere is slowly becoming Disneyland or Disney

1536
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:11,340
 World.

1537
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:16,980
 Metallica is the next one that is rumored, but more than rumored I think.

1538
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,420
 I think they are aiming.

1539
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:19,420
 I think they are pretty strong.

1540
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:20,420
 Pretty strong.

1541
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:21,420
 Yeah.

1542
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:22,420
 Yeah.

1543
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:24,620
 There are so many more steps to saying yes to playing the Sphere which is why you will

1544
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:28,940
 hear so many more rumors along the way and it is because it takes millions of dollars

1545
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:35,180
 on any artist's back end or front end, on the artist's end, whether they take it from

1546
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:36,180
 the back or front.

1547
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:40,860
 Don't you worry about which end I am on.

1548
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:44,180
 You have to invest millions and millions of dollars into the graphics that fit on the

1549
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:46,700
 Sphere to go to your concert.

1550
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:47,700
 Right.

1551
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:48,700
 Scully is like, "Guar please."

1552
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:49,700
 Yeah.

1553
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:50,700
 Guar.

1554
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:55,460
 A Guar show at the Sphere would be in fucking Sain.

1555
01:06:55,460 --> 01:07:00,860
 Hey, did you see that they just created some Guar action figures?

1556
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:04,940
 I want to do a Lambert's Dinner show before all the concerts where they have bread rolls

1557
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:06,660
 come from thousands of feet away.

1558
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:07,660
 That would be amazing.

1559
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:08,660
 Every which way.

1560
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:09,660
 Just launching them.

1561
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:15,700
 I just want to do the fucking billion dollar Lambert's Dinner Theater before any production

1562
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:16,700
 at the Sphere.

1563
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:17,700
 With Guar?

1564
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:18,700
 Every night.

1565
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:19,700
 With Guar.

1566
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:20,700
 With Guar.

1567
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:21,700
 Yeah.

1568
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:25,340
 Guar is the band that would sing at the table while the devil dances on your neighbor.

1569
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:26,340
 That's right.

1570
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:31,060
 They would be able to shoot fucking blood soup at you while you eat it.

1571
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:32,060
 Be amazing.

1572
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:36,220
 Instead of blood, hear me out, drawn butter.

1573
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:37,700
 Right?

1574
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:39,540
 You had me at drawn butter.

1575
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:40,540
 Ghee.

1576
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:44,660
 Just millions of gallons of ghee fired right at you.

1577
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:45,660
 Ghee.

1578
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:49,020
 Daft Punk, that had to be--

1579
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:53,580
 Paul, I can't believe that you just said millions of gallons of ghee fired at your face because

1580
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:57,260
 that is the prize today for the winner of Jock vs. Nerd.

1581
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:58,260
 Oh, stop.

1582
01:07:58,260 --> 01:07:59,260
 Millions of gallons of ghee.

1583
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:00,260
 Millions of gallons of ghee.

1584
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:01,260
 Fuck yeah.

1585
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:02,260
 Millions of gallons of ghee.

1586
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:03,260
 On the hunt for balls.

1587
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:04,260
 Millions of gallons of ghee.

1588
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:05,260
 On the hunt for balls.

1589
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:06,260
 On the hunt for balls.

1590
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:07,260
 On the hunt for balls.

1591
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:08,260
 On the hunt for balls.

1592
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:09,260
 On the hunt for balls.

1593
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:10,260
 On the hunt for balls.

1594
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:11,260
 On the hunt for balls.

1595
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:12,260
 On the hunt for balls.

1596
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:13,260
 On the hunt for balls.

1597
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:14,260
 On the hunt for balls.

1598
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:15,260
 On the hunt for balls.

1599
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:16,260
 On the hunt for balls.

1600
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:17,260
 On the hunt for balls.

1601
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:18,260
 On the hunt for balls.

1602
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:19,260
 On the hunt for balls.

1603
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:20,260
 On the hunt for balls.

1604
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:21,260
 On the hunt for balls.

1605
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:22,260
 No.

1606
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:23,260
 So much ghee.

1607
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:28,020
 Millions ranging from $200 all the way up to $5,000 and of course the winner will be

1608
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:29,020
 covered in ghee.

1609
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:30,020
 Let's see.

1610
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:34,540
 The first question is $200.

1611
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:39,540
 It's coming to me first and it's true or false stars.

1612
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:43,460
 Nobody wants to steal this early so let's see what the question is.

1613
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:46,940
 Warning, difficulty steps up fast.

1614
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:51,260
 Clint Eastwood has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

1615
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,260
 A. True.

1616
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:53,260
 B. False.

1617
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:54,260
 C. Blank.

1618
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:55,260
 D. Blank.

1619
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:56,260
 Okay.

1620
01:08:56,260 --> 01:09:02,780
 Just to tell you how the game works, I have a 50/50 lifeline that I'm not going to use

1621
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:03,780
 right now.

1622
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:04,780
 Good idea.

1623
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:06,700
 I'm going to go ahead and just say true.

1624
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:07,700
 A. True.

1625
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:10,380
 Oh, B. False.

1626
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:11,380
 Now.

1627
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:13,100
 Clint Eastwood does not have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

1628
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:17,140
 Does that mean that it never happened or that because those go in rotation?

1629
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:18,500
 No, no, no.

1630
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,620
 No, they don't go in rotation.

1631
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:21,620
 What?

1632
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:22,620
 You have a star.

1633
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:23,620
 You have a star.

1634
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:24,620
 No.

1635
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:25,620
 Yeah.

1636
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:26,620
 You're kidding me.

1637
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:27,620
 Yes.

1638
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:28,620
 Yes.

1639
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:29,620
 It's there forever?

1640
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:30,620
 Yes.

1641
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:31,620
 Yeah.

1642
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:32,620
 Get the fuck out of here.

1643
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:33,620
 Ask Fatty Arbuckle.

1644
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:34,620
 It's still there?

1645
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:35,620
 Hold on.

1646
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:36,620
 Fatty.

1647
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:37,620
 Fatty, it's Jacob.

1648
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:38,620
 Hi.

1649
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:39,620
 It's me, Jacob.

1650
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:40,620
 It's been a minute.

1651
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:41,620
 How's your star on the Walk of Fame doing?

1652
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:42,620
 I'm okay.

1653
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:43,620
 What seems to be going on?

1654
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:47,740
 I was in the middle of eating a lot of food as I want to do.

1655
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:50,220
 Oh, I'm sorry, Fatty.

1656
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:51,860
 I think I called the wrong Fatty.

1657
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:55,380
 I'm dipping all of my food in ghee.

1658
01:09:55,380 --> 01:09:57,340
 Oh, never mind.

1659
01:09:57,340 --> 01:10:00,340
 I called the right Fatty.

1660
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:01,340
 Yeah.

1661
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:03,380
 This is a PB in ghee.

1662
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:05,380
 Peanut butter in ghee.

1663
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:07,420
 PB in ghee.

1664
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:10,660
 PB in ghee.

1665
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:12,980
 Oh, no.

1666
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:17,300
 Oh, I'm so upset.

1667
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:24,100
 I'm choking on my PB in ghee.

1668
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:29,200
 I'm just going to reveal this true-false weather question and hope to move on.

1669
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:32,580
 Tornadoes have appeared in every state of America.

1670
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:33,580
 True or false, Paul?

1671
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:34,580
 Oh, man.

1672
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:35,580
 I'm sorry.

1673
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:38,020
 Are we boring you?

1674
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:39,020
 No.

1675
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:40,020
 I'm just trying to think.

1676
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:46,420
 You've got to define a tornado, sort of, but I can't.

1677
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:47,420
 Let's hear you define a tornado.

1678
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:49,740
 I'll go false.

1679
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:50,740
 Let's try it.

1680
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:51,740
 That's true.

1681
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:52,740
 Ah.

1682
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:55,740
 Shit my ass.

1683
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:57,940
 Two questions that were 50/50.

1684
01:10:57,940 --> 01:10:58,940
 We've not done well.

1685
01:10:58,940 --> 01:10:59,940
 Why?

1686
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:04,460
 You don't hear a lot about Alaskan tornadoes or Hawaiian tornadoes.

1687
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:07,540
 Yeah, but I don't hear much about much.

1688
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:14,660
 Aside from Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, am I right?

1689
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:18,060
 Let's go for it.

1690
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:19,780
 Give me the question.

1691
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:21,780
 Let's see.

1692
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:25,180
 How many movies have been produced in the Harry Potter universe?

1693
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:27,940
 Eight, nine, ten, or eleven?

1694
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:28,940
 Eight.

1695
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:29,940
 A.

1696
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:30,940
 No.

1697
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:31,940
 Eight.

1698
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:32,940
 What?

1699
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:33,940
 It's my answer.

1700
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:34,940
 I'll go.

1701
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:35,940
 Okay.

1702
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:38,940
 It's D. Eleven.

1703
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:42,300
 I was answering for speed, not for accuracy.

1704
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:43,300
 Alright.

1705
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,460
 Five hundred dollar question.

1706
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:46,940
 We've all missed a question so far.

1707
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:47,940
 Eight hundred dollar question.

1708
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:48,940
 We suck.

1709
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:49,940
 Corporate history.

1710
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:53,700
 Oh, the Harry Potter universe has those newer movies too, right?

1711
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:55,860
 The Johnny Depp ones that were big failures.

1712
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:59,140
 The mythical beasts and how to find them up your asshole.

1713
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:00,140
 That one.

1714
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:01,140
 Yeah, yeah.

1715
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:02,140
 Yeah.

1716
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:03,140
 Johnny Depp was in those?

1717
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:04,620
 Look up your butt to see a mythical critter.

1718
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:05,620
 Huh.

1719
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:06,620
 Yeah.

1720
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:07,620
 Harry assholes.

1721
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:08,620
 I mean, I did that.

1722
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:09,620
 The butthole you're finding.

1723
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:10,620
 Yeah.

1724
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:11,620
 Yep.

1725
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:12,620
 Let's see.

1726
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:13,620
 Let's see.

1727
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:14,620
 Corporate history.

1728
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:15,620
 Anybody want to steal anything?

1729
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:17,740
 We're getting into some stealing territory now.

1730
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:19,200
 What is it called?

1731
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,700
 Corporate history?

1732
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:21,700
 Corporate history.

1733
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:22,700
 Nah.

1734
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:23,700
 No, not that one, Jacob.

1735
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:24,700
 No one wants to steal corporate history.

1736
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:25,700
 Yeah.

1737
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:26,700
 Corporate history.

1738
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:27,700
 Come on.

1739
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:29,700
 What year did Walmart start?

1740
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:33,740
 1968, 1969, 1970, or 1971.

1741
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:36,020
 At least the options are nice and spread out.

1742
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:40,660
 So if I know like a rough time that Walmart started, I might be able to guess them.

1743
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:42,660
 My question is when will it end?

1744
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:43,660
 Am I right?

1745
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:44,660
 Talking to you, Boston.

1746
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:47,660
 Talking to you, Boston market.

1747
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:50,580
 I smell partnership.

1748
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:51,580
 I have no idea.

1749
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:52,580
 Boston Walmart.

1750
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:53,580
 Oh, I can't pass.

1751
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:55,900
 I'm not going to use my 50/50 on this.

1752
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:57,740
 Boston Walmart.

1753
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:02,420
 I guess, you know what?

1754
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:03,420
 1969.

1755
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:04,420
 Nice.

1756
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:05,420
 Yeah.

1757
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:06,420
 Come on, Walmart.

1758
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:07,420
 Sexiest year ever.

1759
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:08,420
 Fuck yeah.

1760
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:09,420
 It was.

1761
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:10,420
 It was.

1762
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:11,420
 It was.

1763
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:12,420
 It's so filthy.

1764
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:13,420
 Filthy Walmart.

1765
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:16,340
 Oh, now I'm holding onto control.

1766
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:18,380
 Actor origins for 1000.

1767
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:19,380
 Actor origins?

1768
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:20,380
 Anybody stealing?

1769
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:21,380
 I'm super stealing.

1770
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:22,380
 I want all of your 800 points.

1771
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:23,380
 Don't think we're going to get any other right.

1772
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:28,620
 That is coming in hot with the super steal.

1773
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:31,220
 What country does Cate Blanchett come from?

1774
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:34,140
 Australia, the UK, Canada or America?

1775
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:35,740
 Australia A.

1776
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:40,100
 Australia is correct.

1777
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:42,140
 And I don't have any points again.

1778
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:43,780
 It's just like the old times.

1779
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:44,780
 Oh boy.

1780
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:45,780
 Arkansas represent.

1781
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:46,780
 $1,200 questions.

1782
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:47,780
 Drinks.

1783
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:48,780
 Drinks.

1784
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:52,780
 Oh, I want nothing to do with it because I know nothing of drink.

1785
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:53,780
 Let's see.

1786
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:57,140
 Which country consumes the most tea per capita?

1787
01:13:57,140 --> 01:14:00,020
 The UK, America, Turkey or India?

1788
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:02,260
 Well, this is where it gets tricky here, right?

1789
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:03,260
 Does it ever.

1790
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:04,260
 Per capita.

1791
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:05,500
 That's that magic word right there.

1792
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:06,500
 Yeah.

1793
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:07,500
 Per capita.

1794
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:08,500
 Who's got the more capitals?

1795
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,500
 Right.

1796
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:10,500
 Right.

1797
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,700
 So India is too populated.

1798
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:15,740
 There's just no matter what the tea is, it's just, it won't add up.

1799
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:19,420
 You are spilling some tea on that.

1800
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:23,100
 Americans I bet drink way more tea than UK as a whole.

1801
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:31,140
 But I don't think, I don't think per capita, right, because then we're.

1802
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:35,940
 I think everybody in the UK drinks tea and a lot of people in the States drink tea, but

1803
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:36,940
 maybe not everybody.

1804
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:40,460
 Actually, I'm just going to say Turkey gets no respect.

1805
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:41,460
 I'm going with Turkey.

1806
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:42,460
 Yes.

1807
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:43,460
 Gobble gobble.

1808
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:44,460
 It was Turkey.

1809
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:45,460
 It's Turkey.

1810
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:46,460
 Look at you.

1811
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:47,460
 It's fire.

1812
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:48,460
 I'm on fire.

1813
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:51,660
 Thanksgiving every day with this motherfucker.

1814
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:52,660
 Can't stop, won't stop.

1815
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:53,660
 Let's see, '90s music.

1816
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:59,380
 Anybody want to steal my amazing amount of points?

1817
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:02,060
 Yes, I'm going to, I'm going to steal.

1818
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:03,060
 Paul's going to steal.

1819
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:04,060
 Do I?

1820
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:05,060
 Yeah, I just did regular steal.

1821
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:09,620
 What is the most successful one hit wonders from the 1990s?

1822
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:15,260
 What is the most successful one hit wonder, wonder maybe from the 1990s?

1823
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:18,620
 Baby Got Back, Ice Ice Baby, Macarena, or Mambo number five.

1824
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:24,660
 Which is so strange because Mambo number one through four is pretty amazing.

1825
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:25,660
 But no respect.

1826
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:27,620
 No respect.

1827
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:30,660
 This is all of these.

1828
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:34,580
 I'm going to, I'm going to go with Baby Got Back.

1829
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:35,580
 I'm going to go with my gut.

1830
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:39,220
 Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,

1831
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:42,220
 boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

1832
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:43,220
 Macarena.

1833
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:44,220
 Hey Macarena.

1834
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:45,220
 Aye.

1835
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:46,220
 Aye.

1836
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:47,220
 Your guts filled with regurgitated linguine from Olive Garden.

1837
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:48,220
 Clearly.

1838
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:51,220
 Paul got that wrong and it's back to Matt.

1839
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:52,220
 Failure, failure.

1840
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:53,220
 $1,600 question.

1841
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:54,220
 American history.

1842
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:55,220
 Fuck it, I'll steal.

1843
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:56,220
 What?

1844
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:58,380
 Unless, are you going to double down, Matt?

1845
01:15:58,380 --> 01:15:59,380
 How far are we?

1846
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:00,380
 Oh no, we're not close enough.

1847
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:01,380
 Go.

1848
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:06,780
 Which state was the last to declare Christmas a legal holiday?

1849
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:13,460
 Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Oklahoma.

1850
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:15,180
 You know what?

1851
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:16,180
 Arkansas is a little slow.

1852
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:17,500
 I'm going to say Arkansas.

1853
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:19,540
 There we go.

1854
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:20,540
 Aye.

1855
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:21,540
 It's Oklahoma.

1856
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:24,100
 Oklahoma where Christmas we don't give a shit about it.

1857
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:27,780
 Where the reindeer come whipping down the plains.

1858
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:31,700
 To steal, to try to wrest control away from Matt Donnelly.

1859
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:32,700
 That's right.

1860
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:33,700
 They've both been unsuccessful.

1861
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:37,580
 It's still Matt Donnelly's board with the $2,500 question.

1862
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:40,460
 Body science.

1863
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:42,340
 You guys can super steal me on body science.

1864
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:43,340
 Up to you.

1865
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:44,340
 Body science.

1866
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:46,060
 Oh, I can super steal body science?

1867
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:47,060
 Thanks, Matt.

1868
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:48,060
 I'll do it.

1869
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:49,060
 What the fuck?

1870
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:52,060
 All right.

1871
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:57,500
 What is the name of the process by which DNA is copied to produce an RNA molecule?

1872
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:01,860
 Translation, replication, transcription or mutation?

1873
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:05,860
 I'm going to go with transcription.

1874
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:07,900
 Transcription C is correct.

1875
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:08,900
 Oh shit.

1876
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:09,900
 Oh shit.

1877
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:11,220
 Who's got the points now?

1878
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:14,460
 And with that, you just transcribed my points to yours.

1879
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:15,460
 That's right.

1880
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:18,940
 You could call me CRISPR because I'm modifying your fucking score.

1881
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:19,940
 Boom.

1882
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:21,340
 There's three questions left.

1883
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:24,140
 Paul is now in the lead with 5,500 points.

1884
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,020
 Matt and I are tied at zero.

1885
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:27,020
 Yeah.

1886
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:28,020
 Oh no.

1887
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:29,740
 Oh, but you can't super steal me.

1888
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:30,740
 $3,000 question.

1889
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:31,740
 Philosophy.

1890
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:32,740
 I can't super steal.

1891
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:33,740
 Matt is stealing.

1892
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:34,740
 I can't super steal.

1893
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:38,900
 Which of these ancient philosophers is credited for the allegory of the cave?

1894
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:42,500
 Aristotle, Plato, Socrates, or Homer?

1895
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:44,500
 E, your mom.

1896
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,500
 Oh.

1897
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:46,820
 That's right.

1898
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:47,820
 She is a cave allegory.

1899
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:49,780
 Sit down, mom's cave.

1900
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:54,580
 Do you call the come in there stalagmites or stalactites?

1901
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:55,580
 That's right.

1902
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:56,580
 I stalagmite.

1903
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:57,580
 I stalagmite.

1904
01:17:57,580 --> 01:17:58,580
 I stalagmite.

1905
01:17:58,580 --> 01:17:59,580
 I stalagmite.

1906
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:00,580
 I stalagmite.

1907
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:01,580
 I stalagmite.

1908
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:02,580
 I stalagmite.

1909
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:03,580
 I stalagmite.

1910
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:04,580
 I stalagmite.

1911
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:05,580
 I stalagmite.

1912
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:06,580
 I stalagmite.

1913
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:07,580
 I stalagmite.

1914
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:08,580
 I stalagmite.

1915
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:09,580
 I stalagmite.

1916
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:10,580
 I stalagmite.

1917
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:11,580
 I stalagmite.

1918
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:12,580
 I stalagmite.

1919
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:13,580
 I stalagmite.

1920
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:14,580
 I stalagmite.

1921
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:15,580
 I stalagmite.

1922
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:16,580
 I stalagmite.

1923
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:17,580
 I stalagmite.

1924
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:18,580
 I stalagmite.

1925
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:19,580
 I stalagmite.

1926
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:20,580
 I'm gonna 50/50 it, Jacob.

1927
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:21,580
 Oh yeah.

1928
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:22,580
 Wow.

1929
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:23,580
 That got rid of Aristotle and Homer.

1930
01:18:23,580 --> 01:18:26,580
 Oh, Plato came second?

1931
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:28,580
 I think Plato was after Socrates.

1932
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:32,580
 Which had the barbershop playset?

1933
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:33,580
 That's Plato.

1934
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:34,580
 Okay.

1935
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:35,580
 That's Plato.

1936
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:36,580
 That's the one I'm familiar with.

1937
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:37,580
 The wacky hairstylist.

1938
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:38,580
 Yeah.

1939
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:39,580
 Right.

1940
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:40,580
 Right.

1941
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:41,580
 Right.

1942
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:42,580
 All right.

1943
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:45,580
 I'll go Socrates.

1944
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:48,580
 Socrates is incorrect.

1945
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:50,580
 It was Plato.

1946
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:51,580
 Socrates nuts.

1947
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:52,580
 Just like that.

1948
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:53,580
 Socrates nuts.

1949
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:54,580
 Let's see.

1950
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:55,580
 Eurasian history for 4,000.

1951
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:56,580
 I am going to supersede.

1952
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:57,580
 Oh no.

1953
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:58,580
 My money.

1954
01:18:58,580 --> 01:18:59,580
 Eurasian history, my specialty.

1955
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:00,580
 I'm always talking about Eurasian history, guys.

1956
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:01,580
 You know that.

1957
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:02,580
 Well, I mean, every other night you're going to P.F.

1958
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:03,580
 Chang's.

1959
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:04,580
 Yeah.

1960
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:05,580
 Exactly.

1961
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:32,620
 The Congress of Berlin in 1878 aimed to resolve which conflict, the Russo-Turkish War, the

1962
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:40,100
 Crimean War, the Franco-Prussian War, the Austro-Prussian War.

1963
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:45,660
 Well, shit.

1964
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:48,580
 I seem to have stepped in it.

1965
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:50,500
 I guess I'll use my 50/50.

1966
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:51,500
 Yeah, you got this.

1967
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:52,500
 You got this.

1968
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:53,500
 Oh, well, you got a 50/50.

1969
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:54,500
 That's pretty good.

1970
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:55,500
 All right.

1971
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:58,300
 That got rid of the Crimean War, which is what I was aiming for, so that's good that

1972
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:59,300
 you got rid of it.

1973
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:00,300
 Look at that.

1974
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:01,300
 So you saved yourself.

1975
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:02,300
 And the Franco-Prussian War.

1976
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:03,300
 You saved yourself.

1977
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:11,220
 So it's either the Russo-Turkish War or the Austro-Prussian War.

1978
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:12,640
 War huh.

1979
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:13,980
 Good God, y'all.

1980
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:16,260
 What is it good for?

1981
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:17,260
 Absolutely nothing.

1982
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:18,260
 Say it again.

1983
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:19,260
 Say it again.

1984
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:20,260
 Let's see.

1985
01:20:20,260 --> 01:20:22,620
 I'll say, you know what?

1986
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:25,420
 Those Prussians, they were a feisty people.

1987
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:28,380
 So I'm going to say the Austro-Prussian War.

1988
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:29,380
 Here we go.

1989
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:30,380
 Final answer.

1990
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:32,540
 Oh, it was the other.

1991
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:33,540
 Russo-Turkish War.

1992
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:43,740
 And Paul closing out the game physics for $5,000.

1993
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:45,100
 We could do nothing about it.

1994
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:46,660
 Paul, you could double down.

1995
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:49,420
 If I double down, I lose everything though, right?

1996
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:50,420
 Paul's doubling down.

1997
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:58,300
 Which law of thermodynamics states that in a closed system, entropy increases over time.

1998
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:00,300
 First law, second law, third law or fourth law.

1999
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:05,540
 I like that you just have to know the laws of thermodynamics to get the answer to this

2000
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:06,540
 question.

2001
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:07,540
 First law of thermodynamics.

2002
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:11,060
 Shoot, this guy used to sing it to me in Olive Garden, now I forget it.

2003
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:12,060
 Oh yeah.

2004
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:13,060
 That was everybody's favorite.

2005
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:14,060
 Well, they fired him.

2006
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:17,860
 The first law of thermodynamics song.

2007
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:22,340
 Could you bring us a basket of garlic bread and sing the thermodynamics song?

2008
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:24,300
 You got it.

2009
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:25,300
 You fucking got it.

2010
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:31,020
 First law of thermodynamics states that entropy increases over time, but only in closed system.

2011
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:32,020
 I'll use my 50-50.

2012
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:37,180
 That got rid of first law and fourth law, so it's either the second or third law, Paul.

2013
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:38,940
 It feels like third to me.

2014
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:40,540
 Oh, does it?

2015
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:41,540
 Okay.

2016
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:42,540
 Let's see.

2017
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:43,540
 So that's what I'm guessing.

2018
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:44,540
 Fuck my dick.

2019
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:45,540
 It's me.

2020
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:46,540
 Shit my butt.

2021
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:47,540
 Second law.

2022
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:48,540
 Poop my ass.

2023
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:51,980
 I think that means that we all missed the question that we used our 50-50 life right on.

2024
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:54,700
 But I didn't lose anything.

2025
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:58,660
 That is the game, Paul wins, but only with 500 points.

2026
01:21:58,660 --> 01:21:59,660
 Balls.

2027
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:00,660
 You lost 5,000 points.

2028
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:01,660
 How did I lose anything?

2029
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:02,660
 In a game that goes-

2030
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:03,660
 Because you lost 5,000 points.

2031
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:04,660
 Bullshit.

2032
01:22:04,660 --> 01:22:14,020
 In a game that goes from 200 to 5,000, the score is 500 to 0 to 0.

2033
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:15,020
 This is-

2034
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:16,020
 That's why-

2035
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:17,020
 That's from the winter scoop.

2036
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:18,300
 Obelisk is a great game.

2037
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:20,820
 This is why it could actually work on TV probably.

2038
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:21,820
 Yeah.

2039
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:22,820
 People only give away 500 bucks.

2040
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:26,340
 No, Obelisk is our best, that's our best on-screen game for sure.

2041
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:29,780
 They're making a ton of TV right now, so it shouldn't be a problem to pitch this, don't

2042
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:30,780
 play.

2043
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:31,780
 Yeah.

2044
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:32,780
 TV sucks anyway.

2045
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:33,780
 No issues there.

2046
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:34,780
 Fuck TV.

2047
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:35,780
 They're making so much, they're making so much programming.

2048
01:22:35,780 --> 01:22:37,900
 I don't know if you subscribe to the apps, but a ton of new shows are coming out left

2049
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:42,900
 and right.

2050
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:43,900
 Thank you for running that Obelisk.

2051
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:44,900
 That was a great Obelisk.

2052
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:45,900
 Yes.

2053
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:46,900
 That was Winter Scoop.

2054
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:47,900
 Thank you so much Winter Scoop.

2055
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:51,420

 Make us a Price is Skryte jock versus nerd.

2059
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:00,060
 Make us a Scooperty jock versus nerd.

2060
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:04,740
 Do all of those things right over there at HeyScoops.com, where you can also, while you're

2061

 there, purchase your tickets to Scoop Fest.

2062
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:08,380
 Yes.

2063
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:09,380
 That's right.

2064
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:13,260
 It is coming up here at the end of September in beautiful Las Vegas, Nevada.

2065
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:14,980
 It's going to be fantastic.

2066
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:17,180
 It's going to be at the Orleans Hotel and Casino.

2067
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:18,180
 Get your rooms there.

2068
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:19,180
 Stay there.

2069
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:23,100
 Just walk right down to the convention space, walk back up to your room when you need something.

2070
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:26,900
 It's really convenient, it's really nice, and the Orleans is going to give you a really

2071
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:31,540
 nice room discount offer if you just tell them that you're staying there for Scoop Fest.

2072
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:33,460
 Or you can use the code, Paul.

2073
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:36,460
 What's the code?

2074
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:38,580
 S-C-F-I-25...

2075
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:39,580
 C?

2076
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:40,580
 Yep.

2077
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:41,580
 C.

2078
01:23:41,580 --> 01:23:42,580
 K?

2079
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:43,580
 C.

2080
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:46,580
 No, no, no, C.

2081
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:47,580
 Yeah.

2082
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:52,420
 That's right, S-C-F-I-25-C. Head over there.

2083
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:54,640
 Get yourself a cheap room at the Orleans.

2084
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:55,640
 It will be fantastic.

2085
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:59,940
 If you don't have anybody to come with, it's great coming by yourself.

2086
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:00,940
 That's right.

01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:14,140
 Yep.

2097
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:15,140
 There it is.

2098
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:16,140
 SeeYouAtTheCone.com.

2099
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:18,020
 SeeYouAtTheCone.com.

2100
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:19,020
 Which is awesome.

2101
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:21,900
 You guys are fast on that shit.

2106

 Yearly will save you some jingle, and getting on there will save you some jingle.

2107
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:40,820
 If you want to go to Scoop Fest, you'll get a discount code that will save you a good

2108
01:24:40,820 --> 01:25:03,740
 amount of money on your Scoop Fest ticket, and all that can be done at PreachingFun.com.

2109
01:25:03,740 --> 01:25:07,500
 Or if you got fired for singing at an Olive Garden, even though you didn't work at an

2110
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:19,680
 Olive Garden, head on over to fartsinabag.biz.

2111
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:22,420
 That's fartsinabag.biz, that along with PreachingFun.com.

2112
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:26,420
 It's extra to our Patreon page, where for as little as $3 a month, you can upkeep this

2113
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:28,380
 show on the air.

2114
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:29,380
 Thank you so much.

2115
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:31,300
 We love all of our listeners and supporters out there.

2116
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:32,300
 Yes, we do.

2117
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:36,360
 At least one of, and maybe two of, our listeners are getting married.

2118
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:40,140
 We had some physical Scoop Mail that came in today, and part of the physical Scoop Mail

2119
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:46,140
 was a wedding invitation that we got for Macy and Danny, so congrats to Macy and Danny out

2120
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:47,140
 there.

2121
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:48,140
 When's their wedding?

2122
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:50,260
 Their wedding is September.

2123
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:55,660
 Oh, it is September the 27th, 2025.

2124
01:25:55,660 --> 01:26:02,420
 I think we're busy, and it seems like they might not make it to Scoop Fest as well.

2125
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:07,020
 Ships in the night.

2126
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:08,820
 Unless they're getting married in Vegas.

2127
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:09,820
 That's true.

2128
01:26:09,820 --> 01:26:10,820
 Boy, what a honeymoon.

2129
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:15,780
 If you're getting married in Vegas, come right on over to Scoop Fest right after the wedding.

2130
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:16,780
 Let's see the details.

2131
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:20,220
 They're going to have an open bar, they're going to have a cigar bar, they're going to

2132
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:24,020
 wear formal attire, and it's going to be an unplugged ceremony.

2133
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:25,420
 That sounds really nice.

2134
01:26:25,420 --> 01:26:27,140
 I will be there.

2135
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:28,140
 Wow, Jacob.

2136
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:29,140
 Okay.

2137
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:30,140
 What a commitment.

2138
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:32,540
 Scoop Fest, and I'm going to go to this wedding.

2139
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:34,060
 Brock, we've ever needed you more, buddy.

2140
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:35,060
 I hope you're listening.

2141
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:36,060
 All right.

2142
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:37,060
 Thanks for listening, everybody.

2143
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:38,060
 Stay safe out there.

2144
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:39,060
 We love you, and we'll see you soon.

2145
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:40,060
 We'll see you soon.

2146
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:41,060
 See you with a cold.

2147
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:42,060
 Thanks for joining us in the chat, everyone.

2148
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:42,060
 Lovely to see you all.

2149
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:13,580
 We appreciate you, bud.

2150
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:19,100
 If you have a public restroom that you are in charge of, don't paint the floor so that

2151
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:21,060
 it looks wet.

2152
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:23,860
 That is off-putting inside of a public restroom.

2153
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:24,860
 It's gross.

2154
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:25,860
 It's really gross.

2155
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:26,860
 See ya!
