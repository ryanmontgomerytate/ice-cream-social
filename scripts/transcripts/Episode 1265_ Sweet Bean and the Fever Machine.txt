 Old style Chicago's a good it might be a good call. That's a good. That's a nice
 cheap beer old style
 Just go like go like oh do they still make those fucking ones with the old men who drank
 Bartles and James
 Do they still make Bartles and James the wine cooler? Yeah
 No idea where you're going with the two old men
 Do they still make Schlitz Laurie else Roth? Oh, let's
 What's is all this is in the era of Pat's Blue Ribbon Schlitz is also a comedy word
 Yes, let's is a great word as is Blatt's
 Ranch slunk coming through with Blatt's Ballentine's there's Ballentine's ale back in the day
 Anyhow, yeah, I'll figure it out. I'll figure it out Schlitz
 Yes, let's is still made and is currently owned by Pat's Brewing Company. There we go Wow
 They reintroduced the original 1960s formula
 It's it's brewed in Milwaukee, but Milwaukee as we know Milwaukee and Missouri both start with an M. So I think that's fine
 they have a
 Some kind of cornered market on all the
 Nasty sounding names for beers. This is classic old beers. It's classic old factory worker beers, man. They all just sounded like
 bodily functions
 Schafer's
 Yeah, I got I got a bad case of the Schafer's. I should have I should have got the Vax when I had the chance
 No, I'm not. I'm going through Milwaukee
 with the with the jokers of magic I
 Was there last time we built the fooler show in Milwaukee and doing Pabst at the Pabst Center was like so fun. Oh, right
 I
 thought it was more cool than the audience did the audience didn't give a shit, but I
 Thought it was super fun
 They Pabst their prime. Yep, they're perhaps they are perhaps
 I finished up my f1 weekend. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. How was the rest of f1? Well, yeah, I was
 basically trying to figure out the story didn't end with last time we were recording so I didn't get into too much of the
 nitty-gritty details, but right the bottom line is the
 They thought it'd be really funny to have two inept announcers announce some of the marquee events at the ski lodge
 For all three nights at at the at the F at the Mercedes tents, right?
 And a race is about an hour and a half long and having inept announcers
 For an hour and a half for an hour and a half is a little is a little long
 Are you one of the inept announcers? Yes
 And what was it
 Did you have breaks?
 Yes, or more importantly, did the audience have breaks? Well, we
 Eventually, we figured out yes, you know good good. So we
 But it was funny was like so we we were brought in right and then we came up with all these things for all these
 Characters to be I came up with Stetson barber. You can call me big Barbie
 and
 We were gonna do all these games and everything and
 All the sudden we were at our first brainstorm session that said oh we just have to you know film something in senator Mercedes
 Just so they know what's going on. Oh Jesus
 Exactly exactly exactly
 Instantly so I was like film what like what are we shooting over right and it was like, you know
 And so it was me and Casey Wilson, right?
 friend of the print of the show we love Casey Casey and
 Mercedes based out of
 Germany. Well, yeah international
 international
 Automobile behemoth Mercedes-Benz. Yeah, where's their core base? Is it Germany? I mean, they're they're originally from Germany
 I don't know where they're based now, right?
 Now's your chance to put on your best German and give them the kind of inept announcer
 That's really gonna sell it. Oh
 My neighbor. I can't believe what is happened with the car
 The tires they're rolling over and over as a part holes and and the part holes are wet
 Why are we so much rain in Vegas?
 The rain
 Mercedes still based in Germany. Yes Mercedes are going to bends the rules to win. That is what we do
 So
 Welcome F1. I'm your host Dieter
 Exactly. Now it's the time much brackets for every race
 That's that's next year Matt. You just Pete Dieter
 So we're filming by the way, like Casey and I came in for like a brain door, you know a day at the office
 Brainstorming session we weren't dressed
 like particularly flashy or well or in character or anything and
 So didn't have your you had your casual tuxedo on not your show tuxedo
 And so we had different people to manage the project different people to brainstorm. There wasn't necessarily a distinct director
 So we're going to make this video I was like what's so what's this video like they just want to see stuff and I was like
 which stuff, you know, and so I
 Kind of help orchestrate like a four phase flow to take one of the video, right?
 Good and we finish and I go, okay. Well, that's the take and then I go we can we can cut up the best bits of
 That maybe it maybe we'll do another run
 And we'll just do fresh bits who's editing this ah, oh sweet summer child Matt
 They're getting this raw they're gonna be lucky. You know what this is. It's gonna be on a flash card mailed by a UPS
 And it's gonna get there in five weeks. They're gonna be like vases loss
 Well, I was I was expecting you to say what are you talking about? Matt? I just sent it right that is basically
 Like well, I don't see myself like editing a lot of it I can cut
 That Jack Jacob we need to get you that t-shirt yeah, I don't see myself doing a lot of editing
 I was like, well if we're not editing then I don't think we should do a second take right like cuz we're not gonna
 We can't edit the takes together and the magic is gonna be lost by the time it gets rather second roll, right? Yeah
 I've watched 20 minutes of stuff instead of 10 minutes of stuff that you know, whatever and so I
 Know like and I was like, I feel like I basically I think this is a bad idea
 You were you were right Matt. You were right. Your instincts
 I was like, we're not really showing them what we can do or whatever and they go. No, they just want a gist of what's going on
 And I was said to Casey I was like
 I've never known any corporate client let alone even production companies
 I've pitched projects to to show a single ounce of imagination when it comes to like what's going on
 Nobody wants the gist of it
 The only thing the finished product is the only thing that that kind of video does is let a middle management person say no
 That's exactly I was thinking I was like I was like, that's all I was thinking. I was like, oh gosh
 I might not get to do this gig. That's all it is. That's all that is. That's all that that's all they do is say no
 Because they're so scared to death of taking credit for anything that could go wrong
 right now
 To my cruise credit they this is not their first rodeo with Mercedes, right?
 So they've gone around around with them before so they kind of knew what Mercedes likes. Well, they just simply
 Been like, you know, they've simply presented stuff for Mercedes was skeptical
 And then all sudden it goes off without a hitch and they're and they're and they're happy and thrilled and okay
 So I that's true. The company has some credit with the with the car company. Yeah
 Like for example, this is a multiple times that I was performing a thing called the ski lodge
 I'm sure the first time they said hey, we want to shove a giant ski lodge in the back of your
 Hospitality area they were kind of I'm sure the first thing was like what what?
 How does that make any sense? I'm sure some eyebrows went up, right?
 And now it's like some people's like favorite part of the whole attraction
 And so now the ski lodge has been getting bigger and bigger with each race and this is like the fourth race
 They've had a ski lodge, right? Very cool. It's gonna be an alpine village by the time the next race, right?
 I hope so. I mean I doubt I'll be a part of it, but I hope so
 It's just gonna be the Winter Olympics happening and an F1 race breaks out
 And
 So they send off the video and then all of a sudden I get a call is like hey instead of noon to three tomorrow
 Can you come from 11 to 5?
 Hold on I'm just doing some some quick back of the napkin math here
 And I joke I wrote the video went over that well, huh
 Yeah, that did anyone I know the answer to this did anyone acknowledge that maybe we shouldn't have said that video no
 Have notes we have notes no
 No
 No one will ever say in any industry. I don't know. Maybe they get it yesterday. I just shouldn't have done it
 but this is where the
 Our team our team leader was super smart. We came in I say for a long time
 And Casey and I brought in stuff to look more professional
 And smart smart they said let's do another round but let's bring in everyone from the office and let's do it with it with an
 audience oh
 That's smart. It was smart. It was smart. Oh
 Because your stuff reads with human beings
 Yeah, of course no
 That's exactly how it is. God. It's okay. They just want the gist of it
 It's so different. It's honestly. It's why I love how we're doing our recordings now with our live audience
 It helps me tremendously when I'm doing my bits to see if people give it half a damn about it, right?
 Sometimes they do the answer is no, but
 Once in a while once
 Fuck that shit, we all they're all throwing their hands up. Give me the booze
 This thumbs down the camera
 They're just waiting for you to put on a bikini do shots in a hot tub
 That's like all like all the other twitch broadcasts figured out honestly
 Only fans and just do it. I'd fucking do it. There probably is a market. I don't know
 I've already got something of a user base. Maybe I should look into it
 Wait a second Jacob did you just hear that in 20 seconds Paul talked himself into doing an only fans like oh you
 Think I've been thinking about this just today, son
 Please you started with I can't do an only fans and then in three senses says I guess I can
 There was there was somebody who wanted us to do an only fans and do like a stand-up on
 On only fans. Do you remember that several years ago? I don't wait
 I don't remiss at all someone told us that we should do comedy comedy to us that we should do
 Stand up and improv on our only fans. Oh
 And I think we all had that reaction. I think we all went like, oh, all right
 We've already failed to thrive on twitch we might as well add another platform that we tank on we should just do that
 Hey your definition of drive
 Pop the brakes we can get on every platform that is made for something else and do comedy
 Just just us
 Doing doing live performances where people just tell take our clothes off while we do it is the truth is that be really refreshing
 I've never felt that attraction, you know that that kind of attention before
 It'd be fun Matt take off your pants. Oh, wow, take take them off Matt. It feels good
 Yeah, it's nice and airy. I'm gonna start pantsless Fridays
 I get that I get that I would be I
 Get that it would get old, you know for for any for any of our more attractive listeners out there who?
 Suffer harassment on the regular basis. I'm not trying to belittle your harassment. I understand it
 Maybe we get old it's just never happened to me. So it's a novelty at this
 I think if you open up a channel called bare necessities, I think you'd be a hit and I think
 Be good to go might be a different demographic than you're used to but I think
 Hey ready to grok attention is attention and money is money man. I don't know it sure is I
 Think it would be hard to you know, tell the kids don't come upstairs
 Daddy's doing a bare photo shoot for his only fans like it might be a little tougher to pull off though
 You're right. It would be hard
 Real hard
 Lumberjack in it. That's a great name
 It's not a bad one. Yeah, I was like ML Kennedy. Hey Scoop starts a farmers only profile
 Get my my flannels on here. That's all I need
 Only flannels. How about only flannel?
 flannels
 No, that has to already exist, right? Maybe
 Only flannels calm, let's see only flannels calm
 The fuck Oh
 Jesus
 Something goes on there. No, that was another twitch channel. I don't know how that came up. Oh weird. That's weird
 Only flannels has a twist channel already
 Only flannels calm seems to be a twitch channel. Okay
 So I guess that's it smart
 Somebody beat us to it. Yeah, good job
 Or they I'll tell you who else beat us to that
 Lumberjack in it that's sweet sweet lumberjack in it
 Today's show men manly's ice cream social is brought to you by
 Marcus McGillicuddy's luxury abandoned homes. That's from George scoop stanza in
 2024 that's a great scoop name
 Marcus McGillicuddy's luxury abandoned homes. Oh
 Marcus McGillicuddy. I came over to the United States
 And I move to Florida here in the keys a boat a lot of luxury apartments
 But they've gone unused for years and they're rotting from the inside
 What what that means for you?
 Value, that's right. You can get value from my open apartments what nobody's been in for years
 Come on down and get your case a Legionnaires disease from my old peeps
 And a bunch of mold. Have you seen those moldy spiders? What are we gotten going on? No, they've seen them
 There's a cryptid spider mold what's taking them over and turning them into looking like we creepy snowflakes
 Well, we got plenty of those don't we?
 Come on over not what I meant to say at the top. I mean it again
 Value
 You won't stay for a dollar
 You can stay for a dollar and I do not care how long
 That's an indeterminate lease what I'm offering you you give me one dollar
 You can stay in the abandoned place as long as you want
 You understand as long as you want
 But you do have to put it with the spiders and the Legionnaires disease and the squatters
 There's already a lot of squatters in me abandoned place
 I shouldn't have never bought it when I saw there was already a squatter in there
 I shouldn't have done it but I did but you know, I didn't pay much
 I paid like 40 grand to this guy and I got like 18 high-rise apartment buildings for 40 grand
 I thought that's pretty good turns out the tax lien on him
 18 million who knew? Well, I've had a done my due diligence
 I would buy dinner. So don't how about you?
 Come and stay and then you know, you can buy him off of me for a dollar
 I'll sell him real cheap now. You do have the tax lien liability when that goes over but
 Who's coming for it? I mean really?
 Nobody
 Nobody's coming to take take it from a McGillicuddy. You can trust me. No one's come to collect from me
 No one wants these old abandoned high-rises
 except for circus folk
 Apparently circus folk are real interested in the band and high-rises had I had a wee lad and a fat man come over and say hey
 How about we take your place for circus use? I said, I don't know
 Well, you the big guy and he says yeah, I'm the fat man in the circus and the little guy says yeah
 I'm the little guy in the circus and then sure enough they had a giraffe with them, too
 And a monkey and a lady who could dance on a zebra's back. I
 Couldn't believe it and she said I'd kind of do anything but dance on a zebra's back
 I can't dance on regular surfaces because they're too flat
 I require the spine of a zebra to impact my feet in order to enable my dancing
 I thought that's strange in it. That doesn't make a whole lot of sense
 Turns out they weren't circus people at all. They were aliens
 So these high-rise apartments are very
 Nice looking to the aliens who are coming to take us over
 I should have known from the one day who was real big and fat and a little guy this little guy crawled in him
 Like later on they crawled inside of him. Yeah, I should have known there's something fish something alien going on about that
 I should ask I'm the lady who dances on zebras
 She didn't have a zebra
 You know, hey, she didn't have a zebra. They did have a giraffe though
 At least that's what they told me it was could have been a stretched out dog
 I'm not hundred percent. I
 Don't know anyway, come on Bay
 Try out my houses what are rotten from the inside? They're not good. I'm tired of selling the alien circus people
 And her hey scoops to check out. Yeah, that was a that was a good take one
 Let's let's go back to one do it again. I went from the top everybody here you go
 McGillicuddy and action luxury abandoned homes. Hello. I'm Matt McGillicuddy
 Selling luxury abandoned homes in it. Yeah. Look I tell you what
 These homes are luxury and abandoned because they're overrun with mice
 That's just the truth
 Cut right to it. It's all mice
 It or hey scoops a check. No, here's the thing
 Not like you think it's old stuff from fries electronics
 It's actual wired mice
 From stem to staring
 You can't swing a cat in here and not hit a wired mouse. Please don't
 Don't swing a cat. Yes
 Damn it
 Cuz he hit a wire mouse
 Wait Wayne says send that to Mercedes and we will
 I've already said it it's been sent. What's this loss?
 We had a giant
 Concert on the stage in my backyard last night. Wait, what?
 SJ is putting together. I'll put it. I'll put the picture up here on zoom and switch. SJ is putting together a new band
 And so we needed
 rehearsal
 No, we needed video
 Why we outfitted the stage in the backyard? When did I have trust now? When did you get I have trust?
 this week
 Now how is that fixed? Oh
 It's it's clamped on right now
 it's there's trust clamped on to the on the stage and there's curtain hanging from the truss and lights on the truss and
 Are you looking to make it permanent or is it gonna just be no, no, that's all it's all that's all down already. Okay
 Yeah, no beautiful stage in his backyard, which which the pint of plane trio used for a scoop fest the inaugural performance was
 Pike that's right. Did you have the only ones that have signed the stage? I was gonna say
 The new band will have to sign the stage
 We haven't named to the new band yet is as yet unnamed band
 What's the criteria? Nope? Nope?
 What do you mean it's a what it's like it's mainly a corporate band it's
 name that
 Now alright, so so it looks like it looks like general rock is that what I'm saying general rock. Yeah, it's a military band
 general rock
 There it is. Oh my god. Would that what you say a military band general? Oh my god general rock
 Four-star general rock four-star general rock. I
 Don't know what I'm allowed to say about the band. I didn't I didn't discuss
 press with that
 Good point, but uh, but yeah, no, it's a they're there. The plan is to tour around
 Probably this coming summer and get a get a lot of dates just all over the all over the United States
 How about pussy bucket? I feel like that'd be a good corporate
 Ah
 That is one that is on the board already. It's it's high up there
 It's not number one, but it is it's pretty high up there. I'm on the side between cock magnet and cock and balls magnet
 Do do duo front people, okay
 Yeah, yeah, that's good that's the name of the band lady song or man song
 You pick
 Butch and bitch present
 General rock general rock is not bad what to have
 Who would the the two do it to shoot out and Bonnie and Clyde Bonnie and Clyde? Yeah solid solid like
 Yeah, also they were killed in Louisiana, so there's the there's the tie-in
 When people are like, why is your name Bonnie and Clyde? We're like, no, no, it's okay
 Bonnie and Clyde were actually killed in Louisiana, which is where Jacob is from who's Jacob?
 He doesn't have anything to do with this band. It's just a guy that we know
 Boney and slide, there we go
 A name and then like a thing. Yeah, like a hootie in the blowfish
 Yeah, I wouldn't I I'm not even being coy about it
 I would tell you the names that we've already come up with for the band
 But I can't think of a single one right now. All right. Well, you've already got SJ in the ruckus
 So SJ is not gonna front another band with SJ in it
 Right, uh, probably not. Yeah, probably not that be saying the commotion. Yeah, that'd be some more
 Sarah Jessica and the commotion there. Thank you
 But yeah, so that was a lot of fun and now I have a whole lot of truss that is the trust that was in
 That picture is a little bit of the trust that we have
 I got a whole lot of trust y'all
 What I have is I have a way for us to not have to rent pipe and drape for next scoop fest
 That's how much trust. Oh, that's awesome. How about this? Yeah sweet bean and the fever machines
 Sweet bean
 It's amazing that you say that that's already number one on the list sweet bean and the fever machines sweet
 We all came up with that one
 Yeah, that was basically everybody went away and brainstormed and all of us came back with sweet bean and the fever machine
 Right there at the top of our list
 I'm sweet bean. This is the fever machine. So say thank you for having us. Oh my god. Can you imagine if SJ got to be sweet?
 Bean. Oh
 All every time it's time for her to sing a song the other lead singer guy goes take it bean
 When I just picture money just showering yeah, yeah so much money coming in I just got hit in the head by a quarter
 How about coitus interruptus
 When they decide they want to be like a corporate band is
 Is there already a demand for corporate bands or is that a market that they want to try to crack?
 No, no, this is this is something that SJ and one of her agents came up with this. This is a thought for that
 It I'm saying corporate. It's really more like like city and city events
 That kind of like when cities hire bands, you know play the riverfront. Yeah
 Party, it's that it's that type of thing. Yeah
 Yeah, so let corporates the wrong word. I got it. I got it city and county events type thing Chris Bill and the exact change
 Oh
 Puts it right out there. We're in this with the dough
 Yeah, it gives a very professional
 Oh Wayne does not like Chris building exact change
 You get the thumbs down from waiting on that one
 I think Chris building the exact change might have legs, but we'll see. All right. All right, that one's out
 All right, how about a bean bean counter and the accountants? There you go
 You got that going on and then you can get your sweet bean take it bean back in
 And then you could do the the Dolly Parton typing song
 These are the account staking account
 Yeah, I'm also in the same market that's why I didn't know how much I would be competing with SJ
 But I'm doing an all tap dance cover band
 So everything every song we play is through the through the toes and heels to the balls over even heels of a tap shoe
 Interesting interesting. How about the Louisiana moon dogs?
 Paul's really trying which is weird. Are they based out of are they based out of Louisiana? No
 All right, Alabama moon dogs and one of them is based out of LA Oh the LA moon dogs
 Here's we got moon dogs location TBA
 Okay, that's the last percent of the way there the last moon dogs
 I'm trying to think of like if it isn't even like, okay
 What's in the realm of possibility Paul says a combination of words that make you go to SJ and say a single thing?
 What the barrier of entry of like you actually go in that state with an idea I
 Don't know I do know that I have not stood up or written anything down
 Like she's home right she's here she's in the building with me right now
 Thousand Paul and a thousand typewriters
 Speaking of tap dancing I saw
 Matt's grandmother-in-law
 She has a famous YouTube video clip Ruby Keeler. Yeah. Yeah
 Tap-dancing on a on a giant typewriter. I saw that clip last night as
 Part of a Las Vegas show that I went to

 Those those right at the show Spider-man 3 is like I gotta do something else. I'm right
 It's mostly moving a bunch of moving in about
 Oh
 Well, the barn was on fire and so were my pants I was getting to the barn to do the sex dance
 By sex dance, I mean putting my wiener in it. Oh, yeah
 The cow was there and began to grin it
 Yeah, I did the wiener dance right there with the cow
 Like I said before it's me putting it down the others got in the way for about a minute
 But then I slid to my side and I went ahead and did it
 Yeah, and I got the weird cow aides from fucking the cow the weird
 Now I'm gonna have to burn the whole barn down or the weird cow
 He's gonna spread through the town cuz the town folks come and fuck my cows
 Take it Billy
 That's a person not a cow playing bass over there don't worry about that
 Closely we're about to get back on the tour bus my face player and I my human face player
 Cover story for bestiality
 Buggery that's uttered in the puritan times. It was called buggery. If you were fucking an animal, is that right?
 Yeah, so this is on a Jane Borden, you know, she puts out all these little shorts now author cults like us
 We've had her on the show. Yes
 Buggery is so when people were so upset that someone might have sex outside of wedlock
 some people
 Took fucking animals as a workaround
 I'm not having, you know pre-marital sex with a human. Sure. I can fuck this animal and so they made that a crime, too
 Okay. Oh
 Wow, yeah buggery was the name of it though bestiality all of it. Yeah. Oh boy
 Really want to fuck something beside your wife I was talking to the pig
 Now wait so now out of work that these people are going to who does not fuck this house so the band is mostly rock-and-roll
 Yeah
 So we're good. We're back to that. We're back to the day. So we don't want like
 Fucking animals to go back to this. We don't want country music type names. We want to rock and roll
 like Starship or something like that
 Flicky yeah flicky being in the buggery wake up SJ. Let's go look like we've had deaf leopards
 So let's do another human malady mixed with a rare exotic animal
 Let's just try that combo and see what okay
 All right
 So like like high cholesterol rabbit
 High cholesterol rabbit. That's a great band name. How about how about crippled Jaguar?
 Huh, I mean Jaguar can be crippled already
 Blind melon. Oh wait. Oh shit. I need an animal. I know I just named an actual I did blind in an actual band name
 That's what I did. Yeah, that's the joke I went for
 About
 Eczema koala
 Fierce enough animal
 Rabbit disease marsupial. Yeah, welcome to the stage
 Monica copy bear. Oh
 Oh, oh, oh it's gotta be um, oh shit now
 I need a good one a real good real good. Ladies and gentlemen a whale with cataracts
 That's actually kind of good cataract whale
 Cataract whale cataract whale. I'm just wailing along. Hey
 Vertical walrus and the penguin knees
 Let's welcome this syphilis koala
 That'd be great because the Muslim chlamydia so they've got a different disease in the mix I like it oh
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, they those koalas fuck a
 Goraphobic honey badger
 Mildly depressed kangaroo
 We're secretly just doing Spanish job song suggestions. We are that's all we're doing. That's all we're doing
 But yeah, I think I think don't worry. I've written all these down
 I have sent them I have sent them to Mercedes already. They're gonna get back to us
 It's gonna be great tomorrow. I'm gonna go to see
 the new wicked wicked for
 Wicked good good wicked for good
 I'm excited about it. I'm hearing all kinds of things out there ups and downs
 Some people are really critical of it. Some people are really like leaving the theaters crying. We're going multiple times. I
 Think it's hard to have a sequel to a movie like that
 Yes, and they and they shot it simultaneously as well, right and
 The and you you lose all the credit you got from the first one where you created these worlds
 You can't believe what you're looking at, right? Right. It's such a good job creating that world
 Now you go making you like, you know what everything looks like and you're kind of like, okay, cool. And also
 This happened with Kill Bill. Ah
 When you have an awesome movie and you don't have to stick the landing but just leave a cliffhanger and people can leave a theater
 satisfied with a cliffhanger. Oh
 That's really that's that's a lot easier to do. That's a lot easier. I mean ask a TV writer
 If it's easier to write a season finale or a series finale
 Right, right, right, right. Exactly. That's a that's a very valid point. Have you guys watched smiling friends?
 Smiling friends. No smiling friends brilliant animated series. I highly recommend it. It's absolutely my kind of humor. It's fucking hilarious
 But they go in every season. They just got renewed renewed up to season 5
 Renewed up to season 5
 But they approach every season their last episode as though if this is it then this is it
 They make it so that it could be the end. So they've taken that approach Matt from the jump like that's pretty smart
 Yeah, I find it's weird a series
 that does does this bizarrely is
 Slow horses. You guys watching these slow horses on Apple. Yeah, watch a little name great. Gary. Oh my great
 great band name
 They always end it like
 Satisfactorily like if that was the last joke you would and then they run a preview for next season
 Which I find fascinating because I can't imagine they're always renewed but they run a preview of the next season
 At the very end of the montage and I'm always like why how the hell do you do that? That's impossible
 I mean, I guess they I guess they put that together and run it
 Until Apple says you're not renewed and then Apple just takes it takes that part out. Maybe maybe yeah
 And also, how do you shoot that? How do you already have it? Yeah, how do you right?
 That's the bigger question is where did this footage come from? I find it bizarre
 Okay, Jacob chase the blaze
 Yes, there you go, that's the one that's the one chase that's the one
 It's for people who want to have sex with people with STDs. Chase the blaze. Oh my god a bug chaser
 Bunch has chained the bug chasers bugger chasers
 Buggery buggery pittery. I only want to have sex with people who've had sex with animals previously. Oh my god
 Well, that's the now Matt. You've ruined it. That's the opening song
 People and vice versa how about
 You're supposed to play bass not sing
 You idiot utter embarrassment
 Stupid cow. I mean human. Oh
 And I'm married to stupid human I'm married to get on the bus I
 Know I'm sorry. I had to cut your your hooves to look like hands
 Terribly painful for you, but I love you so much
 The only way she could play bass
 Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
 Oh
 That is music to my ears music to my ears. If only it was a country band. We'd have this thing solved
 Man I was where was that? Oh, well, I was doing a week of shows in San Antonio
 Mainstream country music is so stupid
 Hold on this is breaking news mainstream country music is stupid. There are country songs that are amazing. They're country artists are amazing. Absolutely
 but the but the
 It's just pop with a
 Wawa pedal and they literally it's like I'm literally go like really every song has a drink in a truck in it
 Every song has a whiskey and and the truck in it like all of them
 Just makes me I basically I get so I'm sitting there drinking like coffee like a San Antonio coffee shop being like who can't write this
 Like who like anyone can write these?
 This is not surprising now Matt some of them have a wife at home who is not happy
 Some of them wish they just could have done better if a couple other choices this has gone differently
 Well, you know, there's some shit going on when the AI is beating them all
 Yeah, but that's been a problem with all genres, but yes
 Yeah, and I don't know how the hell you fix it, but Spotify is being hijacked by AI bands
 Yeah
 And these AI and these and these people people sitting around with AI are just making a bunch of money off of plays
 Instead of actual bands I was just talking to a friend the other day he was you saying that
 Doctoral what's the thing that you that you have to write to?
 PhD you don't use this a face. Yeah. Yeah, yeah doctoral thesis
 Betty stop guessing
 the door, but
 Stop guessing Betty
 Yeah dissertation. Yeah, that kind of thing. He's ready dissertation
 he's got it all written out and gave it to his you know faculty advisor person and
 Was kind of accused of using AI yeah to to write it. Mm-hmm
 and
 Basically the the professor said you either used AI to write this
 or
 You wrote this and it feels like AI either way. You need to rewrite this
 Is go fuck yourself
 But the the the professor was trying to be helpful because he was like no I did write this
 You know, I didn't I didn't use AI to do this
 I'm getting my PhD and this is this is what I want to be doing like I'm doing this because I because I want
 Want to do it. Yep. So no, I didn't have AI write this and the professor was basically like yeah
 But when the when the committee looks at this if they feel like it it feels AI
 Then then they're gonna hold that
 That's my favorite song shut up Betty get on the bus, I'm gonna cut your hooves again
 Finger up your hooves. I don't see Oh McDonald on the set list. No Betty. We can't play that song
 Oh, you're such a talkie cow Betty. I
 Mean person definitely a person person
 But yeah, they were like, oh, yeah, I had to rewrite my whole my whole thing or like a couple of chapters in it
 Or something. I don't know but it had to rewrite a sizable portion of it because it felt like AI
 It is like this is this is such a weird time that we're in right now because we haven't figured that part out yet
 No, and honestly, we're in that weird pocket in history where it's just a pain in the ass right now
 Yeah, and college professors are using AI to ask whether or not something is written by AI
 so they're doing it too and
 Some some college person are using AI to read people's fucking shit and and grade it. Yeah. Yeah. Oh
 Yeah, no, it's just it's just like the
 Thing anytime technology happens. It takes us a while to catch up to it
 I will tell you what's weird and almost like why we think AI is fascinating. Is that I think AI can be wrong and
 I think definitely so a bunch of lawyers recently got like sanctioned. I think whatever it's called or sees us
 cease-and-desist
 Killed no murdered. No, no, but they
 basically
 Had AI write their legal documents and had false sources
 Yeah cases whatever and then so we were putting together our quizzes for
 F1 we put together breakdowns of each rate of each driver
 And there wasn't a lot but there were three
 Errors three lines. Ah, and so if one of them was like, can we go over all of your material before you do it?
 I'm sorry Mercedes. We didn't know they were gonna send that video to you and it made up dumb stuff like they had pets
 They didn't have or right fears. They didn't have
 You can while you're working on on the AI stuff. There are times that you can
 That you should go in and just be like double double check all of that stuff
 You just told me is all of that actually correct or did you make up some of that and sometimes don't be it'll be like
 No, I made all of that up
 It'll just tell you. Yeah, right if you don't think to ask then you don't know that's really weird though
 I guess it is I asked for a list
 I was like, what are words have never been used in word. Oh, because I want to like see if I can get a word
 Oh and one if I can commit to a word
 okay, yeah, and
 It gave me a list and the list was completely wrong. I fact-checked it and it was just like no
 It just gave me a bunch of random five-letter words and said it checked two archives and it was just lying
 And I'm back in the eighties and nineties
 You'd get on and or you'd find an ad or something and you'd hire just like a college student
 We write a paper for you or in high school or something. I was asking if Paul's writing down band names. Yeah, I am
 fire listen
 And he drew a logo, yeah, I don't think you can go wrong with fire lizard I
 Surely not
 Finest it shirts me Paul if you're drawing my kid needs a name for his three at the and he's a logo for his three
 on three soccer team I
 Have I have I have
 My brother jingle ballers the jingle ballers jingle ballers
 So they're like my holiday themed. Yes. It's a holiday theme three on three. It's great people dress up for it
 Like it's a really silly. It's a really silly three on three soccer tournament
 Kids are there gonna be pictures of your kids in Santa costumes playing soccer
 There's gonna be a picture of their coaches in the Santa costume because I am their coach
 Yeah, I'll get my tablet in a minute and I'll draw one up. I just did the artwork for this
 For this month, it's coming out. Oh, yeah, so I'll get my tablet and draw up a possible logo
 I have already tasked Rob with it too. So you're
 If it comes in second, that's fine. Okay. Okay, that's what you got. You got a competition. Yeah
 III
 Yeah, cuz basically like my son's youngest
 His soccer team was a disaster this year
 Okay, a couple kids got injured a couple kids quit
 Some kids would just not show up. They regularly played without like enough kids
 Like one kid down my kid would play the entire game. It was a brutal brutal season
 So when the three on three came up, I was like, oh
 Let's get the five kids who showed up all the time who had and let's put them in a in a three on three together
 Yeah, have them play
 One one one one a proper finish to their season instead of just constantly getting clobbered by other teams
 The five gives you a pair of subs. Is that is that what? Yeah. Yeah, you have up to six and you saw
 You sub like crazy and three on three
 Okay, and so I was like, let's do it and then the coach who had finished his last evening coached like seven seasons
 Was like I'm not coaching again. So I said I imagine you don't want to come out of retirement and he goes no
 I do not I said, okay, I said I will coach this team. I'm gonna tell the parents
 I have no business coaching this team, but I will coach this three on three team. That's nice, but I'll do it
 That's really good of you, man. Yeah. Yeah
 So yeah jingle ballers jingle ballers. That's a I didn't want this to become a democracy
 So I simply said hey, do you want to play Hilly wants to play a three on three tournament?
 Do you want to join him?
 He's named the team the jingle ballers because I didn't want anyone saying anything else. I was like it's not up for debate
 There's no conversation. It is the jingle ballers. That is that has happened. He was debating that and the snow devils
 Snow devils much easier to logo
 Jingle ballers will be fun jingle ballers is funnier. How far can we go on the?
 innuendo scale
 The the Tina one last year they were just called the hard penises and they had a big giant cock
 Lots of veins. Yeah, but the the the testicles were soccer balls. That was what made it a soccer
 Thing jingle ballers. That's what I'm thinking already. I'm like
 Well, they showed up to the game in an Oscar Meyer wiener mobile that they had repurposed into just a giant penis
 They painted they painted they just all you got to do is paint veins on it
 Just like that boom becomes the cock mobile just dragging to Christmas ornaments for balls behind it like like they just got married
 When I say hard you say penis is hard
 So, yeah, I guess
 They're ten. So use your best discretion. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I got you. I got you. They're ten
 So they've only seen ten years worth of internet pornography
 Just right keep that in mind, man
 I just I think about this every once in a while and I do think about that
 I thought about it too when when I accidentally gave Matt's kid a comic that might have a boob in it
 But it was a circle in a circle. I like that that's moved accidentally now it I mean it was accidentally
 Also, I don't care but also
 but also
 If I were a child man, I've got a box of hustlers for your kids if I were me at that age
 Cuz I remember the kind of bullshit links. I went to to see pornography at 11
 We had to go to the woods or somebody's house with a weird older brother
 You know or whatever we also watched
 in a group
 Absolutely, right, which is absolutely weird when you think about it or yes weird now
 But like, you know, can you imagine a bunch of guys like gathered around now to watch internet porn around a computer?
 It's it's a different feeling. It isn't I imagine it. Yes, but there's no way kids of this day and age avoid porn
 You can't turn on a computer. It's it just it's in your face. I think about this like what like because like all our
 Our TV apps right have different profiles and the kids have kids profiles, right?
 Yeah, and then the kids but the kids know my password to get to my of course file
 Right to get to the unrestricted and then I'm like, oh maybe I should change that or do something about that
 Then I'm like the least of my concern is them finding stuff on like HBO
 Right, like right when they have access to shit. They saw Daenerys's tits
 They got on them on the max app and looked up old episodes of the Red Shoe Diaries, oh
 That's the thing real sex Red Shoe Diaries. Those are all gone
 Those up anymore, right
 Now the question is like so because right now they say it's basically a huge problem is that kids
 See so much porn before they actually have sex themselves. They get desensitized and weirded out by it. No, they feel
 They feel well, yes, but they they feel also pressure to imitate it or that they they want to do like
 Porn sex constantly. Yes, right
 Like the first time you know when they're losing their virginity. They're like when should I spit into your asshole, right?
 Yeah
 Do we do we gape now or gape later? Yeah
 Like that was my first question. There it is
 President Cooper star that's exactly what I came up with. Oh, that's scrambled porn. It was exactly my life
 That was absolutely my oh man scrambled scrambled TV porn scrambled TV. Porn is a great name for SJ's band and
 It is a good name
 Yeah, but basically they're trying to do all this crazy stuff and not enjoying it yeah, yeah
 That sucks. That sucks. Yeah
 But most people most the good thing about that is I have to have a speech and I'm gonna have to have a speech
 they're skipping from age 17 to age 48 and
 That's because that's the time when you kind of enjoy sex and after that. It's just like
 47 so it's like oh, I didn't realize I was a fucking cuss
 Yeah, you're knocking on his door
 I'll tell you who else is aging where is edging while they age
 That's the following sponsor edging while you age edging while you age
 Hold on. I was I lost the commercials. I was looking up buggery
