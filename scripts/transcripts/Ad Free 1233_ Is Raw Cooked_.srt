1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,600
 Well hello there, I am so happy that you're here because I'm gonna thank the ice cream truck drivers.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:17,200
 Thank you so much ice cream truck drivers. I don't have a new list yet, it's a new month but we're gonna thank each and every one of you this month by name.

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,700
 So right now I'd like to thank every single person out there who is an ice cream truck driver.

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:29,000
 What is an ice cream truck driver, I'm glad you asked. These are the folks that deliver that fucking ice cream straight to your fucking ear holes.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000

 The lice you crave can be extracted with a comb.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social?

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Yeah, I'd love to.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Great, let's go.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 C-O-M-B coo?

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 No, C-O-M-B coo.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Yeah.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 They're floating there, Paul.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Just like some comedians say.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 There's a bit about language that I can't remember.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Gallagher, bitches.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 It's time for Matt Mattingly's ice cream social, sitting somewhere, that's Matt Donnelly, sitting in Pittsburgh, that's Paul Mattingly.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Jacob the audio guy, I'm sitting in Las Vegas.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 We're preachingfun.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 That's the one that goes into the bomb, right?

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Boom and bomb.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 It's like a little flip card thing.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Boom.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Yeah.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Man, I know he became a crazy, crazy twit, but I loved me some Gallagher when I was younger, man.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Oh, I loved Gallagher.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Yeah.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Back in the video store days, that was it.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 You wanted to watch a comedian, you ran into Gallagher movies.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Yeah.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 I got really lucky later on, running comedy clubs in Las Vegas.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 I got to work several, like a two or three weeks, all total, with Gallagher as one of the headlining comedians.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 And man, the conversations in the green room when Gallagher is on are really pretty great.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 When he's not there to hear what people are saying about him?

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 No, no, no.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 When he's in there.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 I'm saying when he's in the green room, when he's back there like holding court and having the conversations.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 The crazy, like the bat shit crazy shit that gets talked about is spectacular.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 He really lost it towards the end there.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 And he developed a rep in Vegas for being a kind of like crazy ass lunatic.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 He was trying to like come up with his own version of like a slot machine or whatever.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 And he was trying to pitch a version of gambling.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 And he was a really, really angry, bitter guy.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 But just stand up, man.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 And also like while he was angry and bitter, also stayed super interesting.

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Like he was angry and bitter, but he had his shit together.

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 He was a compelling person. Yeah, yeah.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Yeah. And like, as we all know, just from I think watching three minutes of any version of Gallagher stand up, he sees the world differently than most people.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Yeah, yeah.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 And hearing from those people is always just fascinating.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 And of course, yeah, we think we've done this a bunch of times, but he taught his brother his act.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Then his brother, then he tried to stop his brother from doing his act.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 His brother said, no, I'm going to keep doing it.

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 He sued his brother.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Gallagher's manager took the brother's side and left Gallagher.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Yes.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 That's really the most insulting part.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And the brother got the right to perform as Gallagher too.

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 I think there's nothing worse than thinking like, I could franchise this, finding out you're right.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 And then you want to be like, no, wait, don't do it.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Hold on.

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 No.

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 When that genie's out of the bottle, forget it.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 If anything, you just should have doubled down and gotten more apprentices, right?

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Yeah.

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Right. He should have gotten Gallagher three, Gallagher four.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Yeah, yeah.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Release Gallagher four.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Fire.

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Yeah.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Also, none of the others should have looked anything like him.

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Gallaghy.

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 They never should have acknowledged it.

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Well, they could all have just all you got to do is put on one of them duffer hats with a long wig done.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 That's right.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Matt's halfway there.

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 I'll do it.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 I keep switching careers.

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 I should start doing Gallagher's routines.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Just add a wig to one of your hats, Matt.

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 I will.

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 I will.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 I will.

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 I've always said that when I cut my hair off at some day, that I'll just all attach it to the hat and just keep it around every now and then.

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 And I've sincerely thought about that, and it just seems like so much work to add it to my hat.

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Yeah, if you're not having it done professionally.

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 That just seems like a lot of genuine work.

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Also.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Sewing pieces of hair onto a hat.

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 You're going to select one hat that you're going to be stuck with for life.

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 You've got to sew it into a Velcro type mechanism so that it can be attached to multiple hats.

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 You don't make a bad point there.

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 It's a fairly good point.

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 My vision has always been that I would just walk out with the hat on and then take the hat off, and it would just be the "Oh, Jacob doesn't have any hair."

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 That's kind of fun.

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Of course, when I picture it, I picture myself being like egghead, completely bald as well.

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 I can tell you, Paul, I'm completely impressed by the Velcro thing.

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 I was thinking of just honing up for hair for each hat that you had.

102
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 Oh, my God.

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Are you crazy?

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 I know.

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Who has the money for that?

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Actual human hair?

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Rockefeller Donnelly over here.

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 You just saved imaginary Jacob, bald Jacob, hundreds and hundreds of dollars.

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Yes, at least.

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Yeah.

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Oh, that's right.

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Jeff Loomis makes a good point in the chat.

113
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Tapeface tried to do the franchising thing, and it really did not work well for Tapeface at all.

114
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 But he didn't do it.

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 He was being very surreptitious about it.

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 But so was Gallagher.

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 I think that Tapeface did exactly what Gallagher did.

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 I think he just didn't get away with it, and he did it in a different time.

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 So people were talking about it on social media.

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 A time without social media where you can't just go, "Hey, that's not the real Gallagher."

121
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Yeah.

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 I don't know.

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Tapeface, we actually would probably get Tapeface to come on.

124
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 I probably could, yeah.

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 The problem is, when he started more, I think it was like Fringe Festival stuff,

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 he started more theatrically as the boy with tape on his face.

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 He considered it more of a show then.

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 I think the problem was that he did "America's Got Talent"

129
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 and then became a singular character in that moment

130
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 and changed it from the boy with tape on his face to Tapeface.

131
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 And then still, in his mind, saw it theatrically, and so he could have an understudy or whatever.

132
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Yeah.

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 From what I heard, it seemed like he was looking at it as though he were putting an understudy into a show,

134
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 not that he was doing anything nefarious.

135
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Right.

136
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 I mean, I'm all for it.

137
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 I would love to have that kind of problem.

138
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 We'll have him on, and we'll talk about it.

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 I would love to have that kind of problem.

140
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Yeah, yeah.

141
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 It's going to be awkward next week when Jacob comes on and you guys don't recognize him.

142
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Me, me.

143
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Paul, could you imagine trying to sell people right now?

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 You're like, "Don't worry, I handpicked this person to train them to be funny like me."

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 To just have a substitute me.

146
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

147
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Hand-chosen.

148
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 I mean, there's more than a handful of podcasters who could probably do it.

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 No, but this is exactly what we're talking about.

150
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 This is an A-to-A analogy.

151
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Right.

152
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Sure.

153
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 But they're just simply not personally invested in someone else who's capable.

154
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Agreed.

155
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Yeah, it is a weird thing.

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 It is a weird time for all of life on Earth and the parasocial relationships,

157
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 which are the only things keeping us going day-to-day.

158
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Let's see, so if we wanted to build a new Paul, obviously it would have to involve small, small barky dogs.

159
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Mostly peanut butter.

160
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Mostly peanut butter.

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Raisins to taste.

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 That's your base.

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Raisins to taste.

164
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Raisins to taste, always.

165
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 The Lead Mill of Sunrise.

166
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Yep.

167
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Black T-shirts.

168
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 MLKennedy says, "Having tapers on the podcast like ventriloquism on the radio," right?

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Grow up, MLKennedy.

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Grow up.

171
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 And yes.

172
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Those were the days, right?

173
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 To be a radio ventriloquist?

174
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Oh my God, what a dream.

175
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 What a dream that would have been.

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Ugh.

177
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Hey, Bert, how you doing today?

178
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Oh, I'd be great if your hand wasn't up my ass.

179
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Oh, Bert, you crazy so-and-so.

180
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 But you don't even have to do that.

181
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 You're the crazy one.

182
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 He doesn't even see that.

183
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 You don't even have to do that.

184
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 I can't believe you have the audio right there to play that authentic clip from the old days.

185
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 I can't believe you just played that clip.

186
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 I know.

187
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Gold.

188
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Mortimer's nerd was a real perv.

189
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 What are you going to do?

190
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 MLKennedy, thank you in the chat, says that my mouth was not moving.

191
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 If anybody listening asks.

192
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 It was gold.

193
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 That was legitimate just, what do you call it?

194
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Throwing my voice.

195
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Yeah.

196
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Yeah.

197
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 That's right, that's right.

198
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 MarbleTulipScoopy says he could learn to love Paul number two.

199
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 I watched the special the other day.

200
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 There's a special somewhere, I forget where, but it's on the Astroworld Festival.

201
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 The Travis Scott Astroworld Festival.

202
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Yes.

203
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 That he did several times.

204
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Where lots of people got hurt.

205
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Lots of people got hurt.

206
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 The crowd rushed the stage.

207
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 There were multiple people that were kind of in charge of the safety of the festivals.

208
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 A lot of people didn't do their jobs.

209
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Were there some deaths?

210
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 I believe there were some deaths, like crushing deaths and that kind of thing.

211
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 At one point, according to the special, there were four active CPRs going on.

212
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 Four people were actively receiving chest compressions and everything.

213
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 And that did not stop the show.

214
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Oh, CountryScoop, thank you, in the chat says that 10 people end up dying in there.

215
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Goodness.

216
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 This is from when?

217
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Travis Scott's thing.

218
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 This is several years ago.

219
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Oh, okay.

220
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 He used to do the festival every year at Astroworld to give back to Houston, where he's from.

221
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 And I was watching this thing and I'm watching, a lot of it was lack of communication.

222
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 A lot of it was not telling Travis Scott on stage that things were going on.

223
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Arguably, he was told.

224
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 I don't know.

225
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 There were a lot of things going on.

226
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 There were large parts, though, of this documentary where I was watching horrible things happen

227
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 with all these thousands of people there in Astroworld and running around like crazy people.

228
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 And I was just looking at this going like, "Holy shit, this could happen to us.

229
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Holy shit."

230
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Like, we could just accidentally make something huge like this and then it just totally gets out of control.

231
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 And all of us look at it at the end going like, "I'm so sorry."

232
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Again, these are the problems you want.

233
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Paul and I are big enough that just the two of us falling over could crush 10 to 12 people.

234
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Sure.

235
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Yeah, it's true.

236
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Just.

237
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 True.

238
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Just.

239
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 Just.

240
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 All right.

241
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 We should not.

242
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 We shouldn't cross off the trampling.

243
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 No.

244
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 Trampling.

245
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 Jake, are you having second thoughts about putting this steel cage around every side

246
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 of the stage this year for Scoop Fest?

247
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Oh, if anything, I'm more on board with it.

248
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Really.

249
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 The chicken wire from Blues Brothers.

250
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Oh, my God.

251
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 That is the best.

252
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 That scene.

253
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Good Lord.

254
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 That makes me laugh so much.

255
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 They just keep throwing beer.

256
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 Just throwing beer bottles at the stage.

257
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Smash.

258
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 God damn.

259
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 So funny.

260
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 And it's great too.

261
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 I'm going to ruin this scene for people who watch Blues Brothers right now, but if you

262
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 watch it, you can just watch all of the sugar glass bottles explode.

263
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Yes.

264
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 As soon as they hit.

265
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Yeah.

266
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Like the thin little chicken wire.

267
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 But they still get all over everybody.

268
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 It's still a mess.

269
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 Yeah.

270
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 We have both kinds, country and western.

271
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 It's true.

272
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 It's true.

273
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Oh, man.

274
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Raw hide.

275
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 I watched a little bit of Monday Night Raw a couple of weeks ago, Paul.

276
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Take him home.

277
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Before we go, I really do think the loser leaves town match we've set up for two people

278
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 with the name I want to scoop, baby.

279
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 We should really think twice about it now.

280
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 It's going to create some real friction.

281
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Stampede.

282
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Go ahead.

283
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 There will be crushing deaths, but in the good way.

284
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Yeah.

285
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Careful what you ask for.

286
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Have you watched any Monday Night Raw, Paul?

287
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Here's the thing.

288
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 I listen to podcasts about wrestling.

289
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Okay.

290
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 I haven't watched a wrestling match in probably two years.

291
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Now that it's on Netflix.

292
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Yeah.

293
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 I keep getting ads for it popping up on Netflix.

294
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 So you decided to go ahead and watch one.

295
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Yeah.

296
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Yeah.

297
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 The other day, I'm home by myself.

298
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 I'm perusing.

299
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 I'm looking for an option to watch without SJ around because we watch a lot of things

300
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 together.

301
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 So I have to do the math of like, what is she not going to be mad at me for watching

302
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 without her around?

303
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 Wrestling definitely won't be mad at me about that.

304
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Good math.

305
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Yeah.

306
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 So I turned it on for a little while.

307
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 It seems to me, I haven't watched wrestling in, I don't know how many years, decades,

308
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 multiple decades.

309
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Long time.

310
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Long time.

311
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Yeah.

312
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Long time.

313
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 It seemed to me, and tell me if I'm wrong or not, it seemed to me that there was a

314
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 lot more talking than there used to be.

315
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Yeah.

316
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 And that the talking is much more contrived than I remember it.

317
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Yes.

318
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Now, is that me?

319
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Am I right?

320
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Or is that just me, child versus adult, looking at this?

321
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 No, you're right.

322
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 And if you saw the South Park from a couple of years back, they really nailed it where

323
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 it's more about a theatrical thing than anything else.

324
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 The wrestling is secondary at this point, which is so silly.

325
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Yeah.

326
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 It's funny that you mentioned this.

327
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 Just today, I deleted a couple of my wrestling podcasts because I'm like, this is...

328
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Oh, you're falling off.

329
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Well, I mean, yeah.

330
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Yeah, because...

331
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Tariffs?

332
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Triple H was...

333
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Oh, sorry.

334
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Triple H was in the White House just a couple days ago.

335
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Oh, is that right?

336
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Triple H was in the White House.

337
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Oh, right.

338
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Because what's her name?

339
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 McMahon.

340
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 I mean, she's been there.

341
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 She's like the secretary of something.

342
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 She's not, you know, she's not really directly connected to the company.

343
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Education, that's it.

344
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Sure.

345
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 She's not really directly connected to the company anymore, legacy-wise for sure.

346
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 But to have Triple H...

347
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Well, because Vince is out, right?

348
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Yeah.

349
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Well, so they say.

350
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 Okay.

351
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 But they might be...

352
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Yeah, yeah.

353
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 I saw something he might be coming back.

354
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 I don't know.

355
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Who fucking knows?

356
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 He was at a big party.

357
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 I was at a party with Vince, and he was making me pee on someone just the other night.

358
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Yeah?

359
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Okay.

360
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Well, maybe he's on his comeback tour.

361
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Yeah.

362
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 I'm telling you not to invite Vince McMahon to your pee-on-people parties, Matt.

363
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 No.

364
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Because he turns into a shit-on-people party.

365
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 That does.

366
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 That's the problem.

367
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Matt, you have to put Visqueen down.

368
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 You're going to ruin your hardwood floors.

369
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 This is so hard.

370
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 My wife knows I'm hanging out with them when Visqueen gets delivered to my front door on

371
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Amazon.

372
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Yeah, but I just, I think for my own, you know, sense of self, I'm just like, eh.

373
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Like, okay.

374
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Even, it's just been, it's really been these last like two months.

375
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Shit's gotten, shit's gotten kind of sketched for me.

376
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Again, and I'm, and I'm only just listening to stuff and hearing, you know, watching a

377
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 few little things on YouTube and whatnot, recaps, things like that.

378
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 And I don't know if you're familiar.

379
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Oh, wait, there's ML Kennedy saying Linda McMahon just got hacked at an interview.

380
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Someone got into the audio when she was talking about Department of Education stuff and somebody

381
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 played the clown song.

382
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Hilarious.

383
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Oh, the entry of the gladiators.

384
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Yeah.

385
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Wow.

386
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 That's amazing, ML Kennedy.

387
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 That's fantastic.

388
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Yeah.

389
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Cause that's, that's how she sounds and that's how the whole country sounds at this point.

390
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Right.

391
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 But yeah, you know, they do this, it's become an annual thing now.

392
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 They have a big, uh, to do the crown jewel that they do over in, uh, Dubai.

393
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Okay.

394
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 You know, uh, for the, in Saudi Arabia and that, you know, that's already kind of questionable.

395
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Yeah, sure.

396
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 On a political note, but here, but the thing is, uh, CM Punk, when he was out of the WWE

397
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 for a while for years, he was giving those wrestlers unlimited shit.

398
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Like he wrote a tweet, he wrote a tweet that said, go suck a blood soaked dick out in Saudi

399
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 Arabia.

400
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 You asshole.

401
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Yeah.

402
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Right.

403
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Right.

404
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Right.

405
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Right.

406
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,800
 So he was like coming for their throats over this, you know, there's given people shit,

407
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:56,720
 but also CM Punk, I think you should talk to somebody, you know, but Jesus Christ, man,

408
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,960
 it looked like he was taking a stand, but just last month, guess who's headlining crown

409
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
 jewel.

410
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,920
 Ah, got it.

411
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,080
 It's, and then, you know, I, I watch, um, I watch botchamania all the time, which is

412
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,800
 really funny.

413
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:18,160
 And um, they did the old clip of Krusty the clown where it's like, oh, I'm so sorry.

414
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,880
 They backed up a Brinks truck to my house.

415
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:29,800
 I'm not made of stone, you know, like, of course, of course money talks, right.

416
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:37,240
 But that's, it's endemic of everything going on in the whole world.

417
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:47,160
 And the fact that these players from this, you know, wrestling corporation are becoming

418
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,840
 statesmen, they're becoming statesmen.

419
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,840
 That's glad Jacobs is a governor.

420
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,200
 It's a Y or a, yeah, I don't, or a mayor.

421
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,680
 I don't know.

422
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,820
 It's just, it's too much for me to say Jesse the body Ventura.

423
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,820
 I mean, he was the governor.

424
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,820
 He was a governor.

425
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,820
 Yeah.

426
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,240
 It's just kinda, it's just a little too much at this point for me.

427
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,240
 I don't know.

428
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,520
 I just, Abe Lincoln was the president.

429
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,520
 Yeah.

430
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520
 He wrestled.

431
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,520
 Yeah, he did.

432
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,520
 He was a boxer.

433
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,520
 I think.

434
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,520
 I think he was a wrestler.

435
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,520
 I think he was a wrestler.

436
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,520
 Yeah.

437
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,720
 The weird thing though on, on raw, not having anything to do with any of, of all those things

438
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,720
 was, uh, the cameras.

439
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,900
 They did, they do so much camera work now and they switch back, you know, they always

440
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,620
 switch back and forth between different shots and everything during the wrestling matches.

441
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:43,220
 Now they switch back and forth between different shots and the camera speeds on the different

442
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,220
 cameras are different.

443
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:49,880
 Like the frame rate is different on different cameras or something like that.

444
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,720
 I'm not exactly sure what they're doing, but that's, that's what it looked like to me.

445
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,360
 And so they would, they would move it and all of a sudden it would look like the two

446
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,120
 wrestlers in the ring were moving faster than they were just a second before and then switch

447
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:09,000
 back and it was, it's, it, whatever it was, it was definitely on purpose.

448
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Yeah.

449
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,760
 It definitely seemed to be something that they were trying to do to kind of add to the

450
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,760
 action.

451
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,760
 Yeah.

452
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,760
 It was so odd.

453
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,260
 Was it throwing you?

454
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,320
 It was throwing me a little bit.

455
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,840
 I was kind of hoping that you would heard something about it if they had said something

456
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,080
 about it publicly or something.

457
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,080
 I haven't.

458
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,080
 Maybe not.

459
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,840
 The only scuttlebutt of that is that they have professional camera crews now.

460
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
 Oh, sure.

461
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,000
 They have, you know, they've had some of their old camera crew.

462
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,400
 Well, no, it's a, it's a huge step up because after the departure of Vince, Oh, did they

463
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,200
 have like their own people before they had, they had Mr. Kevin Dunn.

464
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:49,720
 Kevin Dunn had been there for a millennia and they finally got rid of him.

465
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,280
 And now all of a sudden the production value has gone sky high.

466
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,840
 They got these guys from ESPN, you know, the guys putting together the NFL best of stuff

467
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,840
 and all that kind of thing.

468
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,840
 Yeah.

469
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,760
 So they're, they got some real high production value going forward right now.

470
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,040
 It was a good looking product.

471
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,120
 That's what I mean.

472
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,120
 That's what I mean.

473
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,840
 It's like the video wall in the ballet.

474
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,520
 It was, it was a good looking product.

475
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,880
 No, they have the production.

476
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:18,360
 So John Cena, I guess is retiring and, uh, and him going through, like he's on a retirement

477
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,960
 tour or something, I guess.

478
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,960
 Yeah.

479
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,960
 These are his last year's matches.

480
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,640
 A pro wrestler going through and playing their greatest hits for an audience is so goddamn

481
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,640
 funny.

482
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,640
 Yeah.

483
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,240
 And well, it's, it's a weird thing that they've done with him cause he went heel, you know?

484
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,240
 Okay.

485
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,240
 No, I don't.

486
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,320
 He'd never turned heel his entire career.

487
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,160
 Oh, so he's a bad guy now.

488
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,160
 Yeah.

489
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,320
 But now he's starting to regret it.

490
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
 That's weird.

491
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
 Like, like he is shoot regretting it.

492
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,720
 Like he really is sad that he did it kind of thing because he never did it.

493
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,560
 So that's kind of crazy.

494
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,160
 Um, yeah, it's, it's something else.

495
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:00,440
 What did you just said before that about, uh, Cena and, uh, I dunno, I can't watch him

496
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,960
 do his retirement tour.

497
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
 Yeah.

498
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,960
 Interesting.

499
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,960
 Yeah.

500
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,960
 It, it's something else.

501
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,540
 Uh, I don't know.

502
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:12,760
 I just, I'll tell you who was really excited about seeing Cena too, though, coming out

503
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,760
 next year.

504
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,720
 And that's going to be the following sponsor.

505
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,240
 Today's show, Matt and Maddie's ice cream and social is brought to you by, I'm sorry

506
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,240
 for the delay.

507
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,440
 I just got some Bisque and delivered to my front door.

508
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:29,920
 Oh, that's having a party shoeless Joe's bottomless Crocs.

509
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,880
 That's from Anonymous in 2024 shoeless Joe's bottomless Crocs.

510
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,560
 Hey, it's shoeless Joe here for the bottomless Crocs.

511
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,680
 You may be asking yourself, how can I get bottomless Crocs?

512
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,680
 Well, it's simple.

513
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,480
 All you have to do is buy them from me.

514
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,600
 Shoeless Joe, I have Crocs with no soul.

515
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,600
 That's right.

516
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,820
 Just the top of the Croc.

517
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,160
 You slip it on just like a normal Croc.

518
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:57,080
 Most people think you're wearing a Croc, but no, no, you are wearing a Croc with no soul.

519
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,720
 You're walking around essentially barefoot.

520
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,440
 Now that in a lot of places is gauche.

521
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,200
 We don't want to come across as gauche, do we?

522
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
 No, no.

523
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,360
 Buy the topper, buy the Croc topper, put it on top of your foot.

524
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,200
 No one will ever be the wiser that you are just hillbilly in it.

525
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,780
 Go gauche, go broke.

526
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,060
 That's what I say.

527
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,060
 It's true.

528
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,060
 Go gauche, go broke.

529
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,060
 There's a lot of places.

530
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,060
 He says it all the time.

531
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:25,080
 I mean, many of you have probably gone into a convenience store and notice the little sign.

532
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,240
 No shirt, no shoes, no service.

533
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,520
 Yeah.

534
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:35,760
 These Crocs let you skip that line, as it were, and go ahead and walk on in there proudly.

535
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:43,960
 Even though you're technically barefoot, you have the clam shell of the Croc on top of

536
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,320
 your foot, disguising your naked soul.

537
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,040
 Hi, I was here.

538
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,160
 I'm hoping to have sex with one of your slutty crocodiles.

539
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,440
 Oh, okay.

540
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,800
 Come into the back room.

541
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,680
 Yeah, bottomless Crocs.

542
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,680
 Yeah.

543
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,200
 Get her hay scoops to check out.

544
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,280
 Yeah, that's what really makes the money for us.

545
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,920
 That naked soul turn was actually really poetic and beautiful, buddy.

546
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,800
 That was actually a little too high brow for the...

547
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,960
 Oh, you liked that?

548
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,040
 Yeah, that was actually kind of poetic.

549
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
 Poet didn't know it.

550
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,040
 Yeah.

551
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,040
 You know what's funny?

552
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,600
 See, Matt recognized that it had gotten a little high brow for the show, and he commented

553
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,600
 on it.

554
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,240
 Matt just made a joke about having sex with a crocodile who was bottomless.

555
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,600
 I think we both did the right thing.

556
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,360
 This is where we live, right guys?

557
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,240
 It's the same thing I used to talk about with Absinthe.

558
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,560
 It's everything from the profane to the sublime.

559
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,160
 We like to cover all bases.

560
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,120
 We can get esoteric when we want to, but we can also tell you...

561
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
 We should steal that line.

562
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
 They're not using it.

563
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,600
 They didn't take your...

564
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
 They never used that because it was my line.

565
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,800
 They should have used it, everything from the profane to the sublime.

566
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,240
 Believe me, as someone who has given them a line, they will take it and use it.

567
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,040
 They should have used it.

568
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,760
 Matt Maddow's Ice Cream Social.

569
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,760
 Everything from the...

570
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,760
 What is it?

571
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,760
 The profane to the sublime.

572
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,760
 The profane to the sublime.

573
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,760
 Get on board with our new fucking slogan.

574
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,760
 Will you get it?

575
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,760
 I'm on!

576
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,760
 I'm on!

577
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,760
 You know what?

578
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,480
 You bring up the no shoes, no shirt, no service.

579
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,920
 I don't see those signs that it needs to be...

580
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,920
 As much?

581
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,920
 Maybe they're done?

582
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,920
 Maybe it's over?

583
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,640
 No, I meant like, did that culture war win?

584
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,920
 Do we now know we gotta wear shoes into the 7-Eleven?

585
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,920
 We have to.

586
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,920
 Do you know what I mean?

587
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:35,880
 Or has footwear gone to the point of where it's like, "Well, technically, a toe ring

588
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,640
 is footwear."

589
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,640
 I don't know.

590
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,360
 I think it's all just...

591
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,280
 I think everybody is more aware that every business could just kick you out for any reason

592
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,680
 that they want to now.

593
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,680
 Yeah.

594
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,680
 Yeah.

595
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,680
 That's true.

596
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,680
 That's true.

597
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,520
 If you come into a restaurant, or maybe not a restaurant, but like a 7-Eleven barefoot

598
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:00,600
 and you're not being a jerk, they'll probably just serve you and you can leave.

599
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,360
 Well, I had memories as a kid, going back and forth to the beach because I grew up on

600
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,360
 the Jersey Shore.

601
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,360
 Pinky's out in Monk County.

602
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,680
 How come that's never come up before?

603
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:17,840
 When my chauffeur would take us to the beach, no, my dad would take us to the beach.

604
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,400
 We would go to 7-Eleven on the way home or something like that, right?

605
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,200
 I would run in barefoot and feel like fun as in the store doing whatever.

606
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,560
 My kids...

607
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,240
 I really think the answer is Crocs.

608
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,240
 Not anything but the fact that we've made...

609
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,240
 Like slipping on a sock.

610
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,240
 A very simple shoe.

611
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,240
 Flip-flop was easy, too.

612
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,360
 Flip-flop was easy, too, but I don't really ever see anything like proper flip-flops.

613
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,280
 I'll see it in a proper sandal, more like an executive sandal style for a lady.

614
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:51,680
 I feel like...I don't want to offend anybody, but I feel like people who wear flip-flops,

615
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,880
 that's what they wear.

616
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,320
 How dare you?

617
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:04,000
 How fucking dare you use this platform to disparage people on that level?

618
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,440
 Yeah.

619
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,840
 I occasionally wear flip-flop, but rarely.

620
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,840
 But anyhow...

621
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,200
 For the most part, honestly, I just wear it when we have a churn.

622
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,200
 I just wear it through the churn.

623
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,200
 I just wear flip-flops through the churn.

624
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
 Yeah.

625
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,160
 Guys, I'm wrapping up my Magic Invention.

626
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,160
 Huh?

627
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,480
 You guys want to get into it?

628
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,080
 It's pretty exciting stuff.

629
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,840
 A Magic Invention?

630
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840
 Convention!

631
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,560
 Oh, you're at a convention right now?

632
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:39,720
 Well, I'm at my house right now, but Magic Live is happening at the Orleans Casino.

633
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,720
 Oh!

634
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,760
 They always dry run Scoopfest by doing a convention.

635
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,760
 That's right.

636
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,760
 That's right.

637
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,760
 They're always right ahead of us, right?

638
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,760
 Yeah.

639
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,440
 They do this convention for 5,000 people to see how it's going to go, and then everything's

640
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,520
 road tested for us to bring in our hundreds of people.

641
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,520
 That's right.

642
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,520
 Well, we...

643
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,600
 I mean, we can't help it that we have the better, more elite convention.

644
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,600
 That's true.

645
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,760
 This is how it is, man.

646
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,760
 It's true.

647
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,840
 I was involved in this convention.

648
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,840
 Handsap has got a flip-flop.

649
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,840
 Look out.

650
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,840
 I've offended Handsap.

651
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,840
 There you go.

652
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,880
 I've offended Handsap, Handspap.

653
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,880
 Sorry, Handspap.

654
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,880
 Shrapnel.

655
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,880
 You didn't realize.

656
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,160
 That was a real bomb.

657
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,160
 What do they call them?

658
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,160
 Chooklas?

659
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,480
 I wonder if there's another word people want to...

660
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,480
 No.

661
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,480
 Chooklas.

662
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,480
 The thing you're talking about.

663
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,480
 We all know what you're trying to say.

664
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
 Chooklas.

665
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,480
 Yeah, yeah.

666
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,480
 They call them choncolas.

667
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
 Thongs.

668
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,480
 Yeah, yeah.

669
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,480
 Choncolas.

670
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,840
 Well, you know, people get really good at throwing those fucking things.

671
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,160
 What?

672
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,440
 You don't know about that?

673
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,480
 I mean, people get good at throwing things that they throw.

674
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,480
 No, but I mean...

675
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,480
 No, no, no.

676
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
 There's a...

677
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,160
 No, no, no.

678
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,200
 Nolan Ryan started as a chocolist thrower.

679
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:59,120
 I believe he's pronounced Chooklas, Matt.

680
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,600
 A scoopa cabra saying Spanish grandmas.

681
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,840
 Again, not to stereotype, not to get anybody upset, but there are lots of videos...

682
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,840
 Too late.

683
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:14,040
 ...of elderly women taking off a flip-flop and fucking dead-ass nailing people in the

684
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,040
 head with it.

685
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,040
 Just...

686
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,040
 Whoa!

687
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,960
 I never had family members that would throw things.

688
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,520
 I would have family members that would have taken off a flip-flop and just smacked you

689
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,520
 with it.

690
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,520
 Oh, that part, too.

691
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,040
 I think we had throwers.

692
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,480
 Spanish grandmas make a great name for a bowling team, just so we're clear.

693
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,800
 Jeff Loomis, welcome to the part of the podcast where Paul introduces an obscure fact and

694
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,800
 then acts borderline offended that no one else has heard of it.

695
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,800
 It's not no one else.

696
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
 Lots of people are saying it.

697
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,800
 Lots of people are saying it.

698
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
 Lots of people are saying it.

699
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,800
 Listen to this guy.

700
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:54,800
 But your introduction to that fact was terrible.

701
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:59,200
 You didn't know the word and then you gave us no other word.

702
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,280
 I said Chookla and I know it's wrong.

703
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,200
 And then it was annoying that we didn't know it.

704
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,200
 Okay.

705
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,200
 Whatever.

706
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,200
 Oh, man.

707
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:17,080
 Oh, bossy says that the flip-flops are a weapon of granny's.

708
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,080
 They're in the peninsula.

709
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,080
 So there you go.

710
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,080
 Oh, there you go.

711
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,920
 I just I'm saying there is a sect of older ladies who have become very adept at flinging

712
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,920
 their footwear.

713
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,920
 A sect.

714
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,200
 Jacob, hit the production meeting music.

715
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,200
 Oh!

716
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,200
 It's gone.

717
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,440
 Production meeting.

718
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,440
 Oh, God.

719
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,840
 It's another button that I don't have on this pad.

720
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,840
 Oh, shit.

721
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,840
 Where the fuck?

722
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,600
 This podcast is falling apart.

723
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,600
 I know.

724
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,600
 You're telling me.

725
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
 Production meeting.

726
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
 Okay.

727
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,200
 If we're going to read a comment from the chat, we have to read the comment from the

728
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,200
 chat.

729
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,640
 Because for the listener at home, when you go, oh, yeah, so yeah, like, that's not a

730
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,120
 good way to incorporate the chat into the podcast.

731
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,120
 We've all been doing it.

732
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,660
 So that's why I'm calling it out on a production meeting.

733
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:12,880
 So if you're going to acknowledge the chat, fully acknowledge and fully read the chat

734
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,540
 and then that's a good note.

735
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:18,240
 And then we do it because otherwise I think people listening at home are going fucking

736
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,240
 nuts.

737
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,240
 OK.

738
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,240
 All right.

739
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,240
 Production meeting over.

740
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,240
 No, that's not it.

741
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,240
 That's the machine.

742
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
 The machine.

743
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240
 Where the fuck is my production meeting?

744
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:33,640
 It's just a machine now.

745
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,320
 If we had a turn, this would never have happened.

746
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,360
 We would know where their production meeting was.

747
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,360
 It's true.

748
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,360
 It's true.

749
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,360
 Possibly true.

750
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:48,120
 It is possibly true.

751
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:53,000
 So I was asked to host a show this year at Magic Live.

752
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 Yeah.

753
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 Oh, that's right.

754
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 Yeah.

755
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:04,360
 And it became very clear very quickly that it was a mistake for all involved.

756
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,200
 Who did it become very clear to very quickly?

757
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,400
 No, no.

758
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,480
 So here's the thing.

759
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,000
 They always have a big showcase show and a big and a close up showcase.

760
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Right.

761
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,800
 And they always experiment with a third show.

762
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:24,240
 And then the experimental third show is it medium, medium pace magic?

763
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,240
 Is that what it is?

764
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,240
 It is.

765
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,240
 Yeah.

766
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,120
 It is magic that starts like really far away, but finishes very up close.

767
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,880
 Like you run.

768
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,920
 Progressive magic.

769
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,920
 Think of a card.

770
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,040
 And then you run towards them and smack them in the face with a card.

771
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,040
 Oh, God.

772
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,040
 I was thinking of a confine of diamonds.

773
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,040
 Oh, shit.

774
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,000
 The most painful card to get hit with.

775
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 Oh.

776
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,840
 I was on the bottom of his fucking flip flop.

777
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:04,120
 So originally, the show is going to have no no host, and it was called the Experimental

778
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,560
 Theater Concepts Show.

779
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,560
 Yes.

780
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,560
 OK.

781
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,560
 Huh?

782
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,560
 Who's not?

783
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:14,640
 Everybody just I know everyone in the chest just rolls off the tongue.

784
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,840
 Why couldn't I go?

785
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,840
 I wish I was there.

786
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,840
 I know.

787
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,840
 I know.

788
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,840
 I know.

789
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,960
 It's a theater concept show, meaning you have to do like an avant-garde or unique trick.

790
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,960
 Yes.

791
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,960
 Yeah.

792
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,920
 You have to experiment with the presentation of magic in some way.

793
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:38,080
 I don't want to I don't want to steal your thunder here.

794
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:46,240
 But when I think experimental and avant-garde magic trick, my first thought is Rudy Kobe.

795
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,520
 Oh, yeah.

796
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:52,800
 I mean, Rudy was around and Rudy was certainly someone who Rudy Kobe is certainly someone

797
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,480
 who pushed the boundaries of magic and pushed magic in different directions.

798
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,480
 And theatrically too.

799
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,480
 Yes.

800
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,680
 If you're going to make it about theatrics, his whole thing was theatrics.

801
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,680
 Yeah.

802
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,680
 No.

803
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,120
 In fact, if you're familiar with Rudy Kobe, a lot of his stuff is on YouTube.

804
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:12,280
 If you go look at look at his stuff, Lab Man is his alter ego.

805
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:18,840
 Yeah, Lab Man is the is the is the bit and you really don't see too much like it.

806
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:23,720
 And actually, that style of what he's doing is part of like an older vaudeville thing.

807
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,840
 Yes.

808
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:29,100
 But he made it so that it was completely felt modern and unique in its time.

809
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,100
 It was.

810
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,240
 It is great.

811
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,240
 It's very, very cool stuff that he does.

812
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,240
 Yeah.

813
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,240
 I love the legs.

814
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,240
 That's fine.

815
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,240
 Yeah.

816
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:42,400
 I said it's fine.

817
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,680
 It's perfectly good.

818
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:48,640
 So initially I was approached it was actually when I did my run at the Magic Castle, one

819
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:56,480
 of the people ran the one of the people who runs the festival, my friend, Nick Lang, said,

820
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,560
 you know, hey, this is going to be so experimental, we're thinking about having, you know, kind

821
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:05,400
 of a host to kind of keep it all together and kind of have fun with it.

822
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:13,700
 And the pitches are like, I'd be able to have fun doing like these different bits or whatever.

823
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,000
 And it's the biggest and it's the biggest magic convention in North America.

824
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 Right.

825
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 It's, you know, it's, it's, it's, you know, obviously, I'm going to say yes to the opportunity

826
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,400
 no matter what it was.

827
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,400
 Right.

828
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,400
 You've got to jump on it.

829
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,440
 Yeah.

830
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,400
 And when I showed up for rehearsal, like the bits were so avant garde that I was like, if

831
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:38,800
 I'm trying to do like wacky bits in between, I, this isn't going to go well.

832
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:46,020
 So the routines were just too out there to be made fun of or they were too, they were

833
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:51,440
 too, yeah, they were, they were taking such a big swing that if I tried to make a joke

834
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,320
 about it, it might look like I'm making fun of it.

835
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,320
 Yes.

836
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,120
 Was it like the end of my crock bit where I threw you off by being poetic and you were

837
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:04,080
 like, Oh God, that was amazing, the way he moved that light across the stage, without

838
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,080
 touching it.

839
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,080
 I can't make fun of that.

840
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,840
 Well, like when, yeah, even as that crock commercial, like I was like, why is this tear

841
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,800
 running down the side of my face?

842
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:19,960
 So example, like, I'll just go through the things that there, that there were like one

843
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,280
 guy did like a completely AI thing where he sat down in the chair and a screen popped

844
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,800
 up and did a complete AI head.

845
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,160
 It was like Max Hedrum from the nineties.

846
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,160
 Oh, wow.

847
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,520
 But I didn't want to make a Max Hedrum joke to make fun of it.

848
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:42,680
 Both did not date myself and I guess while you're looking at Rudy Covey's magic specials,

849
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,680
 go ahead and look at Max Hedrum.

850
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,680
 We're in the same time period.

851
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:55,000
 Matt Fruer, everybody, Max Hedrum, catch the wave, k-k-k-k-koke.

852
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,880
 Yeah, yeah.

853
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:03,800
 And then, so, you know, another guy did a trick where he was talking, but then all of

854
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,520
 a sudden he does this trick backwards and does the whole thing backwards.

855
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,440
 And then another guy had a thing where everyone put on headphones, but it was like more of

856
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,520
 like a theatrical piece.

857
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,080
 And so you were not to be in the room.

858
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,960
 And so they're supposed to make the room feel empty.

859
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,820
 And this was like, it was, yeah.

860
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:26,560
 And so all of us was very, I basically said that we've created a show that's very ketamine

861
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:33,720
 friendly is what I was saying to my friends when I was like, what's the show like?

862
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,380
 And I was like, it's very ketamine is the vibe.

863
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,840
 Watch the show while sitting in a k-hole.

864
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:50,800
 And so bringing a wacky improv comic was maybe not the best pairing for this.

865
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,800
 No.

866
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:58,000
 And especially like also like when it's like, you know, experimentation and technology stuff.

867
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,080
 No, no, the funny thing is that we, I pitched an idea for this show.

868
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:09,240
 I tried to get into the show as an entertainer and they were like, that's too out there.

869
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,120
 Actually I was, we were told that it was not out there enough.

870
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:17,060
 So I, cause I did this, you know, I did the, I'm going to be at the magic castle again,

871
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:23,840
 August 20th through 24th, once again with my buddy Nick Paul and we did an improv bit where

872
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:29,200
 we, where we, where we did magic, but took, made it like a genre roller coaster of a magic

873
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,200
 trick.

874
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,200
 That's a fun.

875
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,200
 Yeah.

876
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,200
 It's on my Instagram somewhere.

877
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:40,480
 And so we pitched different versions of using improv games for magic.

878
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,320
 So like we were going to do a card stab routine, having the audience members be our arms or

879
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:50,400
 we would be the arms of audience members and do the trick and we're going to do an illusion

880
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,440
 to it, to the song of anyone's choosing that you go through Spotify on one of our phones

881
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,360
 and choose any song they wanted.

882
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,500
 And we were going to, you know, explore doing an illusion twice to two totally different

883
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,400
 pieces of music.

884
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:09,320
 And that was considered not different, not different enough.

885
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,520
 Now when I just described those pieces, I just described, you can see that like, yes,

886
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:18,100
 I believe we were below the theatrical bar of what they were looking for.

887
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,560
 But energy wise, they could have used it.

888
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:24,560
 I think they could have used it just for a little, just to put a little pep in the room.

889
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,320
 A little pep, a little kick up, yep, yep, yep.

890
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:31,080
 And I had to like stall in between, but I wasn't going to do magic tricks in between

891
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,880
 because the show was showcasing experimental magic.

892
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:41,240
 So it wouldn't be good for them to do like road tested material in between to stall.

893
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,320
 Did you err on the side of Cirque du Soleil?

894
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:52,160
 Did you like wheel in a baby on a giant screen and be like, I'm the lonely baby who's sad?

895
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,160
 Oh, were you there?

896
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,160
 Paul, were you there?

897
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,160
 That's exactly what I did.

898
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,160
 That's what happened.

899
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:04,480
 I mean, that's our kind of stuff's got to be laying around somewhere.

900
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,480
 Oh, yeah.

901
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,480
 Yeah.

902
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,480
 Yeah.

903
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:13,680
 We're sitting around waiting for somebody that wants to print money, print money, print

904
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,680
 monopoly money.

905
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,680
 That's right.

906
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,040
 That you can only spend at the Cosmopolitan buffet.

907
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,040
 Zarkana and run.

908
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,920
 They're both just sitting around waiting on somebody to pick those up and just run with

909
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,920
 them.

910
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,160
 Everything from the profane to the sublime.

911
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,040
 Now what was your, what was your solution, man?

912
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:37,240
 Jeff in the chat mentions, Jeff in the chat mentions that if you can go see a good magician

913
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,400
 at the magic castle, it is an awesome time.

914
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,400
 All right.

915
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,080
 But you should also go August 20th to the 24th.

916
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,360
 Oh, I didn't read Jeff's whole thing.

917
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:50,880
 He said, if you can go see Matt at the magic castle, it's an awesome time.

918
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,880
 I messed up.

919
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,880
 It didn't read his whole post again.

920
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:01,560
 No, you also is going to go see Matt at the magic castle.

921
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,560
 And that's the following sponsor.

922
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:10,840
 Today's show is brought to you by stinky pants pants for babies.

923
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,840
 That's right.

924
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,880
 Stinky pants, pants for babies.

925
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:18,160
 That's from a dead Laszlo in 2024.

926
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,160
 Boo boo.

927
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,160
 Wah wah.

928
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,160
 Boo boo.

929
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,160
 Wah wah.

930
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,160
 Boo boo.

931
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,160
 Wah wah.

932
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,160
 I got a duty.

933
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,160
 Boo boo.

934
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,160
 Wah wah.

935
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,160
 Boo boo.

936
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,160
 Wah wah.

937
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,160
 Boo boo.

938
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,160
 Wah wah.

939
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,160
 I got a duty.

940
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,160
 Hi.

941
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:40,560
 I'm a big dumb baby and I poop my duties all in my pants.

942
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:46,440
 And I hate it because everyone says, hey, big dumb baby who smells like duties.

943
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,760
 What's wrong with you?

944
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,560
 And I'm like because I'm still pooping in my pants with my duties.

945
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,280
 But turns out there's a solution.

946
00:41:54,280 --> 00:42:00,600
 All I need is these poopy pants for babies that come pre pooped and the poop smells like

947
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,520
 bananas, so it's not bad.

948
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,600
 So now I'm not big dumb baby who smells like poop.

949
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,800
 I'm big dumb baby who smells like a pants full of bananas.

950
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,620
 And nobody knows any better.

951
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:17,720
 But don't ever take me on a field trip to the zoo or I'll get ate up by the gorillas.

952
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,720
 Oh God.

953
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,720
 I'm in the cage.

954
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,720
 He got me.

955
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,720
 No.

956
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,720
 They shot him.

957
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,760
 They shot him dead.

958
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,800
 I didn't mean for this to happen.

959
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,200
 Poop, poop, poopy, poopy pants that smell like bananas.

960
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,600
 Don't go to the zoo.

961
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,160
 Enter HeyScoops at checkout.

962
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:41,840
 Again, I was just laughing along with you, Paul, and then you made a Harambe reference

963
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:46,120
 and tears flowing down my face.

964
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,520
 Okay.

965
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:53,120
 We learned last episode that if Paul's too gross and fast forwards the commercial.

966
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,120
 That's right.

967
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,320
 Do we think she fast forwarded that commercial or not?

968
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:02,760
 I think she probably listened to that one.

969
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,100
 It didn't get too gross.

970
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:08,680
 Are you now that you know that fact, does it affect the way you make commercials?

971
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,680
 Are you?

972
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,680
 No, are you?

973
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,680
 Not at all.

974
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,960
 I'm not censoring myself for that woman.

975
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:18,160
 No, she's been 20 years of uncensored bullshit for me.

976
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,160
 She knows what's up.

977
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:23,360
 No, but she also did say, because I talked to her about it the other day, she said, it's

978
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,720
 not every commercial, just some of them.

979
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:34,340
 What did Sam always in your corner was she won over by any of the Chinese bridge arguments

980
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,880
 we had for our for your backyard?

981
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,400
 I don't know.

982
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:44,120
 I don't know that she's listened to that episode yet, because we got to talk about, you know,

983
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:50,480
 maybe doing it and having the water flow of, you know, flowers underneath, but she could

984
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,480
 be swayed.

985
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,800
 She can be swayed.

986
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:59,560
 I was contacted by one Ryre Appledorn who is apparently in the middle of constructing

987
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:05,160
 a Chinese bridge for his own yard and with that same kind of flowery solution, I think.

988
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,760
 So I said, hey, let's, you know, let's talk.

989
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,520
 So he's already offered to build me a Chinese bridge.

990
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:15,640
 So I'm going to see how it works and see what we do there.

991
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,280
 Maybe maybe in a year or two, we can make that happen.

992
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,960
 I write this summer, I'll always hire Ryre.

993
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,080
 You hire Ryre.

994
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:29,960
 I tell you, Ryre was a fantastic co-pilot with me and the dogs to get me all the way

995
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,440
 across the country.

996
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,640
 That was that was a very good thing that I didn't spill anything in the car or any.

997
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,240
 Look, look, that's me.

998
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:41,200
 That's my that's my issues coming out.

999
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:46,560
 That was that's my weird I'm working on.

1000
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:55,080
 I'm working on new tricks and I had is I thought Ryre was so wrapped up with with brushwood

1001
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,440
 that I did not hire initially to make a prop for me.

1002
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:04,840
 And I had another company make a prop for me and not accomplish what I needed to accomplish.

1003
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:12,680
 And so I headed over to Ryre and a little bit like a little a little maybe jaded.

1004
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:17,440
 I just was like, hey, this company tried X, Y and Z and said it won't work.

1005
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,440
 I think that's bullshit.

1006
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,760
 I bet you could do it or whatever.

1007
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,120
 And he came back to me basically going, no, the problems that the company said that the

1008
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,920
 prop are correct.

1009
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,680
 But I've invented this new way to do it.

1010
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:35,760
 So Ryre came up with a totally new proprietary technology way to do the trick I want to do.

1011
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,760
 Amazing.

1012
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,180
 And I'm being cagey about the trick, not because I give a shit about that, only that I might

1013
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,600
 perform it at Scoopfest.

1014
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,200
 So I'm being cagey because I don't want to give it away.

1015
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:49,240
 Well, you should be cagey too, because you guys can patent those things at some point.

1016
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,240
 Oh, good idea.

1017
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,240
 Good idea.

1018
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,240
 Yeah.

1019
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,480
 I mean, I don't know exactly how all that works with the magic community.

1020
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,480
 It's hard to make lock stuff.

1021
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,200
 Nobody does.

1022
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,680
 It's always very low key.

1023
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,680
 It's honor system, right?

1024
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,120
 People get along all the time.

1025
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,080
 No one ever fights about it ever.

1026
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,020
 That's the way it works in the magic community.

1027
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:12,200
 Magic and variety, have that in common.

1028
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,640
 Nobody's ever upset with anybody for stealing anything.

1029
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,560
 Nobody accuses anybody of theft.

1030
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,580
 Nobody is to say they've made it their own.

1031
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,520
 It never happens in the magic world.

1032
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,480
 Oh, and if you just want to get really mad about it, listen to burlesque people complain

1033
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,480
 about it.

1034
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,680
 Oh, I can't imagine, right?

1035
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,960
 Listening to burlesque people complain about people stealing bits is, I mean, listening

1036
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,520
 to magic people do it, listening to variety people do it.

1037
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,120
 That's already insane and annoying.

1038
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,120
 Let me tell you, honey.

1039
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,120
 Listen to burlesque people do it.

1040
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,520
 You're like, what are you actually talking about?

1041
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:49,920
 35 years ago, I was the first to reveal my left tit immediately as soon as the curtain

1042
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,280
 came up.

1043
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,280
 And those motherfucking bitches stole it and ran with it.

1044
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,040
 They call it the pirate eye.

1045
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,040
 That's right.

1046
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:04,040
 I had the first pirate eye move, left tit specifically.

1047
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:11,040
 And that fucking dungaree-wearing whore took that fucking bit from me.

1048
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,040
 Dungaree?

1049
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,040
 Yes.

1050
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,440
 That ragamuffin dungaree-wearing whore.

1051
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,440
 That's right.

1052
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:25,200
 This was 35 years ago when ladies didn't do such pantaloons.

1053
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:30,920
 It or he scoops at checkout, I don't know.

1054
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,240
 There was decorum.

1055
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,240
 Decorum.

1056
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,480
 There was fucking rules.

1057
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,480
 There were rules.

1058
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,480
 I was the first one to put castles on my kneecaps.

1059
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:52,260
 Dirty knees, look at these, we called them.

1060
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:56,720
 Dungaree-wearing whore is a scoop fest t-shirt, right?

1061
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,120
 That's about it.

1062
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,120
 Yeah.

1063
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,520
 And Brogan's always in the chat here.

1064
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,400
 Actually, Brogan, you're in Las Vegas right now, aren't you?

1065
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,640
 Do you want to unmute?

1066
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,440
 Yes, I am.

1067
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,480
 Because you're at a Star Trek convention?

1068
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,480
 Yes.

1069
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:20,840
 Because you're here to see, what is it, Dave Davies, Dan Davis?

1070
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,880
 I'm here to see Daniel Davis.

1071
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:23,880
 Daniel Davis.

1072
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:24,880
 Yeah.

1073
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:25,880
 From The Nanny.

1074
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:30,280
 The guy from The Nanny.

1075
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,280
 Yeah.

1076
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,520
 I ran into Jobeth last night at the bar.

1077
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,520
 Oh, God.

1078
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:41,400
 And you were talking about, because we had you on and we were talking about how Daniel

1079
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,560
 Davis was going to be at the Star Trek convention, that's why you were going.

1080
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,400
 So you're trying to get Paul to go because Daniel Davis is going to be there.

1081
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,120
 I did not understand the reference, obviously, in any capacity whatsoever.

1082
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:55,480
 But it turns out that Daniel Davis is not primarily a Star Trek person.

1083
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,480
 True.

1084
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:05,240
 And in fact, he himself, the actor, was debating whether or not to attend the Star Trek convention

1085
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:09,320
 because they're not that big of a character on there and they have a large acting resume

1086
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,760
 outside the Star Trek universe.

1087
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,240
 He's a Broadway star, yeah.

1088
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,840
 He's a Broadway star.

1089
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:23,040
 And then I understand Chris, the Microscrew, bought a cameo for you from Daniel Davis.

1090
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,760
 Is that right?

1091
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:28,560
 That is correct.

1092
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:32,440
 And then the result of that cameo was Daniel Davis saying, I was on the fence about doing

1093
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,640
 the convention, but now I've done this cameo for you and you're going to the convention,

1094
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,640
 I'll do the convention.

1095
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,640
 Is that right?

1096
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,640
 Oh, wow.

1097
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:45,800
 Brogan, while you're here, just because you brought it up privately and a topic that's

1098
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:51,600
 come up on the pod, you have come to the United States now three times or two times?

1099
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:57,560
 Twice, twice this year.

1100
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,220
 Twice this year.

1101
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:06,240
 Have you encountered any hassle or fracas coming to the country?

1102
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,680
 We've had scoops from other countries that they don't want to come to ScoopFest because

1103
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,880
 they're worried about things they post on social media, that kind of stuff, and there

1104
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,540
 are stories that's happening.

1105
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:20,600
 So I guess broadly then, have you experienced a difference in travel because you've come

1106
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,320
 here many times?

1107
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,320
 No.

1108
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:28,600
 I mean, don't get me wrong, it was genuinely terrifying the first time and even the second

1109
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:36,000
 time because I flew a different airline this time and I usually go from Edinburgh to London

1110
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
 to Vegas.

1111
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,240
 So Vegas is usually my first hit into the States.

1112
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:46,160
 This time I went from Edinburgh to New York to Vegas.

1113
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,320
 So passing through customs was at New York.

1114
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,280
 I have not had any problems.

1115
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,360
 No one has asked for my phone.

1116
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,800
 No one bothered at all.

1117
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:03,280
 Although I will say I got global entry, 100% do that because I got to New York and they

1118
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:09,440
 went to the little kiosk, took my picture, the guy looked at me and went, "Go through."

1119
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,360
 Did not stop me whatsoever.

1120
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,240
 Nobody asks for a goddamn thing.

1121
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:20,740
 That is genuinely more interaction than I usually have with anyone when I'm doing global

1122
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:22,840
 entry coming back in.

1123
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,680
 Into the country, like I said, from your Portugal stuff.

1124
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:31,000
 Yeah, like last week I came back in, like that was more interaction, what you just described

1125
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,320
 was more interaction than I had with anybody coming back in.

1126
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,680
 We came back in through Philadelphia.

1127
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,680
 Global entry.

1128
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,680
 Yeah, yeah.

1129
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:42,240
 Now Paul, I don't know if they could hear the bunnies on that one.

1130
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:50,820
 Yeah, global entry, when I was partying with Vince McMahon, global entry was very different.

1131
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:56,120
 Global entry, gobble, gobble global entry.

1132
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:05,320
 But yeah, like nobody asks to see your phone and don't get me wrong, I am very white and

1133
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,600
 I look like I'm 12 years old.

1134
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:11,600
 So you know, I look very non-threatening.

1135
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,560
 And because I am just a patinoid.

1136
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:18,880
 You bring up your race, I don't think anything race-based has happened with this administration.

1137
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:19,880
 Really?

1138
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:23,080
 I don't think anybody said anything about that.

1139
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:28,040
 I'm only mentioning it because I burn in the Vegas sun, but whatever, if you want to break

1140
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:33,320
 it racist, Matt, okay, whatever.

1141
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,520
 Logan was sunburned from sitting under the lights on the plane.

1142
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:40,800
 That was a joke last week.

1143
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,560
 Yeah, I was just curious, you know, whatever.

1144
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,560
 That's all fine.

1145
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,560
 I'm so excited.

1146
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,360
 My accent is getting a bit thick.

1147
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,360
 I think it's, I think.

1148
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,360
 What accent is that you're talking about?

1149
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,360
 What do you mean?

1150
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:57,360
 Shut the fuck up and let me get to my point.

1151
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,360
 There's no accent at all.

1152
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,840
 Bro, can you switch over to full Gaelic any second?

1153
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:03,520
 I've not detected the slightest change in your demeanor.

1154
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,080
 Wait, you're both from Kazakhstan?

1155
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,080
 That's right.

1156
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:12,320
 Kazakhstan represent engines to full, I canna hold her together, Kevin.

1157
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,320
 I'm at the table grabbing the bill first.

1158
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:27,440
 I canna restrain myself here at the table, going for my credit card as it were.

1159
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,480
 Someone ordered a pate.

1160
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,760
 Oh, we just, we just let him go.

1161
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,760
 We just wait until he stops.

1162
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,760
 Don't we?

1163
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:39,160
 Wait, you wind me up and I just goo, I just goo.

1164
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,920
 He wears himself out eventually.

1165
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,920
 At the table.

1166
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,280
 You want to fuck my crocodile?

1167
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,920
 It's really more of like a comedy tantrum, if anything, you know, you have to kind of

1168
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:50,920
 let it.

1169
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:54,160
 Palm addingly, a 50 year comedy tantrum.

1170
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,760
 That's my fucking biography.

1171
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,760
 The autobiography.

1172
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,760
 Yeah.

1173
00:53:58,760 --> 00:53:59,760
 God damn right.

1174
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,760
 Let's do some scoop mail.

1175
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:01,760
 Message for you.

1176
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:09,040
 We got a scoop, a scoop mail from Sarah Boyle.

1177
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,360
 We got a physical scoop mail and I'm going to read you this letter that came with it.

1178
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,680
 Yes, Matt Donnelly.

1179
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,520
 She's right up there pointing to her.

1180
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,160
 Oh, I thought you were just like waving.

1181
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,520
 Uh, let's see.

1182
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,680
 This got left at my, at my house.

1183
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:30,320
 This was, I walked out of my front door and this was on my doorstep.

1184
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:35,420
 Creepy doing it, like I felt really intensely creepy, but I was like, I'm not going to pay

1185
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:37,440
 to ship this.

1186
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,160
 You live like three miles from me, like I could walk to your house with it.

1187
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:48,240
 And so I was just like, I know where you're not wearing like a FedEx uniform.

1188
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,240
 It's all good.

1189
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,240
 You know?

1190
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,240
 I don't know.

1191
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,620
 I, I think we're fine.

1192
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:53,840
 I think everything's fine.

1193
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,760
 I mean, everybody that's coming to the whiskey barbecue knows where Jacob.

1194
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,760
 That's right.

1195
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:58,760
 Yeah.

1196
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,640
 It's just my house, somewhat public information.

1197
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,720
 And yeah, so somebody at each other's houses anymore.

1198
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:09,800
 It's not like the eighties when you could just knock on the door.

1199
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,280
 You just left a box outside.

1200
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,280
 No, I didn't.

1201
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,960
 I think everything was fine.

1202
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,200
 And I love that hideous house.

1203
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:23,400
 You're trying to convince me to buy and I, I don't think anybody should buy that house

1204
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:27,400
 that doesn't want to spend another like hundred fifty thousand dollars on it.

1205
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,400
 No, no, no.

1206
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,400
 It's way too much.

1207
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:34,600
 But Steve and I literally like genuinely are considering buying a house that's in a different

1208
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,220
 cul-de-sac on Jacob Street.

1209
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:44,120
 If they drop the price a little and I'm like, is it, is it weird to move into his neighborhood?

1210
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:48,400
 Like you'd be, you wouldn't be the weirdest people in the neighborhood.

1211
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,280
 That is definitely true.

1212
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,920
 I've met a couple of your neighbors.

1213
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,080
 You wouldn't win that battle.

1214
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:59,160
 So there is that, uh, dear denizens of eventually a new churn bat scoop, and I recently got

1215
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:06,600
 back from 10 days of puffing, watching in the, uh, what is this a Westman Westman islands?

1216
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,600
 Yeah.

1217
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,080
 The Westman islands in Iceland.

1218
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,640
 Oh, that's great.

1219
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:15,500
 Uh, upon our return, there was a package of very degrees Fahrenheit the whole time we

1220
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,960
 were there and it was a hundred degrees Fahrenheit here.

1221
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:21,560
 And I was just like, I could, that's like half weeks.

1222
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:22,560
 Yeah.

1223
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,560
 Yeah.

1224
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,400
 Uh, let's see.

1225
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:30,320
 Upon our return, there was a package of very silly blood sport and merch.

1226
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,320
 Like the movie.

1227
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,840
 Like the John blood van Damme movie.

1228
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,840
 Great.

1229
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,120
 Have you, have you not looked in the box?

1230
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:41,560
 Uh, no, I haven't, uh, let's see, uh, though that you had pre-ordered a while back, uh,

1231
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:47,000
 I'm going to drop this box off of stuff at Jacob's house and try not to be super creepy

1232
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,560
 about it.

1233
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:53,480
 Uh, no, the letter is the only part of this that I've really dug into.

1234
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:58,200
 Because when I found a random box on my front porch, I opened it to see who had left it.

1235
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:03,200
 It has, well, I mean, it has my address on the side because it's in this still in the

1236
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,200
 shipping box.

1237
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,200
 Oh yeah.

1238
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,200
 Great.

1239
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,760
 But I wrote physical scoop mails if any do on it, just so you know what it was for.

1240
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,760
 So that's why I opened it.

1241
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,180
 I, I didn't explore any of the more, any of the outside.

1242
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,240
 I was fine with everything.

1243
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,240
 This was all good.

1244
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,280
 Uh, there is a, uh, what is that?

1245
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,920
 Oh, a kumite duffel bag.

1246
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:21,920
 Oh, that's great.

1247
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:28,360
 Uh, for each of you and Icelandic booze sampler for Matt and Jacob, uh, some coffee, a couple

1248
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:36,120
 of spare fancy Icelander, uh, travel bags, uh, Iceland air, the airline, Iceland air

1249
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,520
 travel bags.

1250
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:44,000
 And a while ago, Jacob and I discussed the, uh, random deal.

1251
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,960
 Sorry, my handwriting is dead in kosher.

1252
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:47,960
 There we go.

1253
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:48,960
 Yeah.

1254
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,920
 There's a random dead in kosher that someone bought me that might be, uh, it might be good

1255
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:52,920
 for SJ.

1256
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:53,920
 Oh yeah.

1257
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:54,920
 I pulled that out of the box and gave that to SJ.

1258
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:55,920
 She says, thank you very much.

1259
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:00,920
 I enjoy your no holds barred and so they were like, here's a t-shirt from this show.

1260
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,480
 You didn't go to of a band that you don't care about.

1261
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:08,120
 And I was like, why, why did you spend money on this?

1262
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,760
 Uh, see you next month for scoop fest.

1263
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:11,760
 You lied about that part.

1264
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,280
 I saw you today on this zoom call.

1265
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:19,760
 I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to be in one of the zoom calls, so I didn't.

1266
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,080
 Ah, thank you very much.

1267
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,080
 Sarah Boyle.

1268
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:28,040
 Thank you for dropping off some physical scooping house here.

1269
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,040
 Can't wait.

1270
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,040
 Oh yeah.

1271
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,040
 Yeah.

1272
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,840
 They say kumite on them.

1273
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,720
 Fucking a yes.

1274
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,880
 Oh man.

1275
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:37,880
 That's awesome.

1276
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:38,880
 You'll see it very well.

1277
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:39,880
 Your background filters.

1278
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:40,880
 Hold on.

1279
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:41,880
 I'm turning off my background filter.

1280
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:42,880
 It's still cool.

1281
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:43,880
 Yeah.

1282
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:44,880
 Cool.

1283
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:45,880
 Cool.

1284
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:46,880
 Cool.

1285
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:47,880
 Cool.

1286
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:48,880
 Cool.

1287
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:49,880
 Cool.

1288
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:50,880
 Cool.

1289
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:51,880
 Cool.

1290
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:52,880
 Cool.

1291
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,880
 Cool.

1292
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:54,880
 Cool.

1293
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:55,880
 Cool.

1294
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:56,880
 Cool.

1295
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:57,880
 Cool.

1296
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:58,880
 Cool.

1297
00:58:58,880 --> 00:58:59,880
 Cool.

1298
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:00,880
 Cool.

1299
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:01,880
 Cool.

1300
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:02,880
 Cool.

1301
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:03,880
 Cool.

1302
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:04,880
 Cool.

1303
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:05,880
 Cool.

1304
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:06,880
 Cool.

1305
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,880
 Cool.

1306
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:08,880
 Cool.

1307
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:09,880
 Cool.

1308
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,880
 Cool.

1309
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,880
 That's the pilot dead bodies behind the beep turns off.

1310
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:12,880
 It's true.

1311
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:13,880
 That's right.

1312
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:20,360
 Everybody's getting to see my, my, uh, my real background now because, uh, yeah, I, I just

1313
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:24,160
 have mirrors behind me, which is why I keep some kind of something.

1314
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,160
 It looks good.

1315
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,160
 It makes everything look bigger.

1316
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,160
 That's true.

1317
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:28,160
 It's true.

1318
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,160
 Uh, let's do a little chalk versus a nerd.

1319
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,160
 Ladies and gentlemen, it is time.

1320
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:59,160
 Time for chalk versus nerd.

1321
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:07,480
 We got a scooper today coming out today from Hey scoop, get off my lawn.

1322
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,480
 Hello all.

1323
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:13,800
 I'm answering Jacob's call for some trivia with a scooper and an obelisk two for one.

1324
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,040
 Oh, that's, that's a great point.

1325
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:20,840
 Oh, some of you do send a multiple, uh, like scooper and obelisks all at the same time,

1326
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:21,840
 which is fantastic.

1327
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:22,840
 I love when you do that.

1328
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,680
 Do me a favor just to help my organization out.

1329
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,080
 Send them in two different emails.

1330
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:32,040
 Do one, one email per, uh, per game and that just makes it easier for me to keep up with

1331
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,040
 everything.

1332
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,040
 Uh, but this is fantastic.

1333
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,640
 And thank you so much for doing this.

1334
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:42,760
 Uh, let's see, uh, two for one, I have been out of commission for a while explaining my

1335
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,640
 absence from making these things.

1336
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:49,880
 So first a PSA don't get shingles, just don't do it people.

1337
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:53,320
 Let me tell you, that's the fucking truth.

1338
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,660
 I've had it twice.

1339
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:59,960
 My job has me lots of different places all the time, so there's no telling how this happened,

1340
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,320
 but I had chicken pox as a kid and now here we are.

1341
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:06,640
 I'm past the worst of it, but dealing with the nerve damage where it infected over my

1342
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:13,640
 mouth later, I got it on my face, my mouth, and in my inner and outer ear, including my

1343
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:17,120
 ear drum, 10 out of 10 do not recommend.

1344
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,120
 Oh my God.

1345
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,120
 I'm so sorry.

1346
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,000
 That happened to a friend of mine with his eyes.

1347
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:29,660
 He got it on the backs of his eyes and now his, like if he walks outside on like an overcast

1348
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:32,680
 cloudy day, he still has to wear sunglasses.

1349
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:36,880
 His eyes as a result are extraordinarily light sensitive.

1350
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:42,480
 I know in today's America, this may be an unpopular opinion, but do get the damn vaccinations

1351
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,760
 for single shingles.

1352
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,440
 I turned 50.

1353
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:50,580
 I'm under 50 and never really thought much about it, but this got my wife to immediately

1354
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:52,360
 go and get her first shot.

1355
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:55,840
 It picks a nerve branch and screws it up when you get it.

1356
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:02,800
 I caught mine in the first 48 hours and likely shorted the worst of it and still can't survive

1357
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,740
 without nerve blockers yet.

1358
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:06,360
 Just very fortunate it wasn't in my eye.

1359
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,360
 There you go.

1360
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,360
 I guess there's that.

1361
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,480
 Anyway, here's an obelisk and a scooperty.

1362
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,440
 Enjoy it more than the shooting pain, tingling, and hot and cold feelings that I randomly

1363
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,560
 get all the time in my face.

1364
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:20,600
 It's Chris, Hey Scoop, get off my lawn.

1365
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,360
 So let's see here.

1366
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:26,820
 We have a scooperty coming to us from Hey Scoop, get off my lawn.

1367
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:31,120
 I am stalling while I share it with everybody else so they can see it over here and we've

1368
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:36,660
 already played that, nevermind.

1369
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:37,660
 Let's see.

1370
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:39,880
 So this is why I need multiple emails.

1371
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:47,240
 Let's see if we've already played this obelisk as well.

1372
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:50,440
 Yeah we have, damn it.

1373
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:54,080
 But we didn't have the full read through of the email so that's good.

1374
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,080
 We had not had the full read through of the email.

1375
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,080
 That is true.

1376
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,080
 Yeah.

1377
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,080
 Give me one second.

1378
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:03,840
 I'm going to find us a different one from neck pubes.

1379
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,000
 Hey folks, I'm a proud patron and wish I could contribute more.

1380
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,040
 I just want to say to the people that aren't patron members, there is a lot you're missing

1381
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,600
 out on and it's worth a few extra bucks a month to have it.

1382
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:17,840
 The way I look at it, I can do gig economy work for about $20 an hour, I listen to podcasts

1383
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:22,760
 while I do that, 10 bucks can get me over 30 minutes of content so it pays for itself.

1384
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:27,360
 A question I have for the churn, does it help your numbers if we download the episodes from

1385
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,360
 a different app than Patreon?

1386
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:33,120
 I've picked auto download on three separate apps in case it does.

1387
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:37,160
 Anyway, love you guys, keep it real, neck pubes, and here is a scooperty that we're

1388
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:40,000
 going to look at in just a second to make sure that we haven't already played it.

1389
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,960
 But yes, good question neck pubes.

1390
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:44,160
 Yeah, I think it-

1391
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,600
 I mean the more the merrier, right?

1392
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:51,320
 If you set us the download on any app, it's going to help us out.

1393
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:58,140
 So when in doubt, set this show to download and it will be groovy.

1394
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:00,640
 And I have found a scooperty that we haven't played yet.

1395
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:03,320
 Let me just play the little production meeting.

1396
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,320
 Great.

1397
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,600
 That's the machine.

1398
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:11,440
 The categories are the first, the most, the last, and the least.

1399
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,040
 Paul, you're up first.

1400
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,760
 What you want?

1401
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,800
 I will take the last for $400.

1402
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:22,880
 Which of these three car brands was the last to produce cars?

1403
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:30,680
 Oldsmobile, Pontiac, or Saturn.

1404
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:34,280
 So this means, this question is asking who produced a car-

1405
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,840
 Who went out of business last.

1406
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,000
 Who went out of business last.

1407
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,520
 Okay, that's what I was looking for.

1408
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,560
 I think it's Oldsmobile.

1409
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:46,560
 Let's try it.

1410
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:52,000
 Pontiac was 2010, Saturn was 2009, Oldsmobile was 2004.

1411
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,200
 And if you're keeping track, that means that Paul got it as wrong as he possibly could

1412
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,200
 have.

1413
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,200
 That's right.

1414
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,200
 I got it backwards wrong.

1415
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,200
 Let's see here.

1416
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:03,240
 I'm just going to mute that person who is not muted.

1417
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:04,240
 Great.

1418
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,240
 Moving on.

1419
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:07,840
 Matt Donnelly, what would you like?

1420
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:13,480
 I would like to take the first since I'm the second one going.

1421
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,760
 The first for $400.

1422
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:20,720
 Which of these platforms was released first, Twitter, TikTok, or YouTube?

1423
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:27,400
 Oh man, I'll go with YouTube.

1424
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,400
 YouTube is correct.

1425
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:36,480
 Twitter was 2006, TikTok was 2016, YouTube was 2005.

1426
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,080
 Well done, Matt Donnelly.

1427
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,840
 I'll try the most for $400.

1428
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:44,640
 Which of these sports leagues have the most teams named after birds?

1429
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:49,360
 Oh, the NFL, the MLB, or the NBA.

1430
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,200
 All right.

1431
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,200
 Bird time.

1432
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,000
 I think we had a version of this question before.

1433
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,800
 I'm pretty sure we have.

1434
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:59,160
 I don't think it's Major League Baseball.

1435
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,320
 I'm just going to kick them right out.

1436
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:06,200
 Oh, I think that's the one that it is, Jacob.

1437
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:12,840
 This is where Paul does his subtle hints to help.

1438
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:15,800
 I can't think of any bird named teams in baseball.

1439
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:16,800
 In baseball?

1440
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:17,800
 The Cardinals?

1441
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:18,800
 The Blue Jays?

1442
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:19,800
 The Cardinals?

1443
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:24,260
 Okay, other than those three though, I can't think of any bird teams in Major League Baseball.

1444
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:26,400
 The Reds?

1445
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,440
 The Reds are birds?

1446
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,440
 The New York Jets?

1447
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,440
 The Nickerbockers?

1448
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:31,440
 The Raptors?

1449
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:35,520
 Those are just pants.

1450
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:38,960
 And don't tell me the Raptors aren't birds because dinosaurs are birds.

1451
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,800
 Okay, I'll give you dinosaurs.

1452
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,800
 The Wizards?

1453
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:50,760
 The NBA has the Hawks, the Pelicans, the Raptors.

1454
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:58,920
 The NFL has the Cardinals, the Eagles, maybe it is baseball.

1455
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,480
 I think it is, but I can't remember.

1456
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:01,480
 They got three.

1457
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:04,440
 Is there another one in the NFL that I'm not thinking of?

1458
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:09,160
 We've got the Cardinals and the Eagles, the Ravens, so that's three for NFL.

1459
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:10,640
 The Murderbirds?

1460
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,800
 The Murderbirds.

1461
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:13,800
 The Hawks?

1462
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:14,800
 Is there a hawk team?

1463
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,400
 Yeah, that's NBA.

1464
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,920
 Atlanta Hawks.

1465
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:22,280
 The NBA has the Pelicans, the Hawks.

1466
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:30,140
 Shit, I've got three for baseball and three for football.

1467
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:31,800
 I've got to be missing one in there somewhere.

1468
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:32,800
 I'm going to say football.

1469
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:33,800
 I'll say the NFL.

1470
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:37,000
 It is the NFL, five.

1471
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,440
 Major League Baseball has three, so we named all of those.

1472
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:45,840
 Oh, and NBA has two, three if you chubby the Raptors.

1473
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:46,840
 Which we do.

1474
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:47,840
 We Raptors.

1475
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:48,840
 Paul.

1476
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:49,840
 Seahawks.

1477
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:50,840
 Seahawks.

1478
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,880
 Oh, that's another good one.

1479
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,360
 Oh yeah, they're the Osprey.

1480
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:56,640
 I think that's the bird that the Seahawk refers to.

1481
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:57,640
 I'll take...

1482
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:58,640
 So that's four.

1483
01:07:58,640 --> 01:07:59,640
 Who's the fifth one?

1484
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:02,320
 I'll take the last again.

1485
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,320
 The Dolphins.

1486
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:04,320
 That's it.

1487
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,320
 The Dolphins.

1488
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,320
 Chicken of the Sea.

1489
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:07,320
 Yep.

1490
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:10,320
 Boom, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

1491
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,320
 Losing.

1492
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,720
 Which of these NFL players was the last to retire?

1493
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:19,640
 John Elway, Emmett Smith, or Deion Sanders?

1494
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,160
 Emmett Smith.

1495
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:23,320
 Emmett Smith is correct.

1496
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:25,760
 Retired in 2004.

1497
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:27,080
 Sanders retired in '01.

1498
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:29,400
 Elway retired in '99.

1499
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,400
 Yeah.

1500
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:31,400
 Matt.

1501
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:36,000
 I will do the last for 1,200.

1502
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,520
 The last...

1503
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,080
 Which Stooge was the first to die?

1504
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,080
 Last.

1505
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:42,080
 Larry Fine.

1506
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,080
 Last to die, sorry.

1507
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,960
 Larry Fine, Moe Howard, Curly Howard.

1508
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:46,960
 Pass.

1509
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:47,960
 Shit.

1510
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:48,960
 That's me.

1511
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:49,960
 I think Larry...

1512
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:50,960
 Oh, wait.

1513
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:51,960
 Did Larry die?

1514
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:52,960
 No, I think Moe died earlier.

1515
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:53,960
 Stooge to die.

1516
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:54,960
 I think Moe died earlier.

1517
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:55,960
 I think Curly.

1518
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:56,960
 I'm going to say Curly.

1519
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:57,960
 The last.

1520
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:58,960
 Shit!

1521
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:07,600
 God damn it.

1522
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,220
 It was Larry.

1523
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:11,880
 It was Larry, and I knew that too, and I was still thinking the first.

1524
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:12,880
 God damn it.

1525
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,360
 He was living in the Hollywood retirement home.

1526
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:16,360
 It's true.

1527
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,720
 He was the last of the Stooges to die.

1528
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:20,480
 Yeah, he famously lived in that Hollywood retirement home.

1529
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:21,480
 That's right.

1530
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:22,480
 Oh, that's me.

1531
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:26,480
 I guess I'll do the last for 2,000 since I just lost all those points.

1532
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:35,200
 Tom Bergeron has lots of stories about as a kid, he wrote letters to Larry Fine and

1533
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:39,560
 Moe Howard and actually ended up becoming like pen pals and talked to them and stuff.

1534
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:42,160
 We'll call them on the phone and stuff too.

1535
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,720
 Oh, nice.

1536
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:47,200
 Which retail chain was the last to close its final location?

1537
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:51,360
 Kmart, Sears, or Toys R Us?

1538
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:54,560
 That's a tough one.

1539
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,800
 I think there's still some Sears, aren't there?

1540
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,160
 I think Sears is gone.

1541
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,160
 Is it?

1542
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,160
 I think so.

1543
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:07,080
 I kind of think Kmart was the last to close up.

1544
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,080
 I don't know.

1545
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:12,120
 Because I think Toys R Us, when Toys R Us closed, they shut all of those down pretty

1546
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,120
 quick.

1547
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,120
 Yeah.

1548
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:16,400
 And I think it was very similar with Sears.

1549
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,000
 I'm going to say Kmart.

1550
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,280
 It is Kmart.

1551
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:21,960
 October 24.

1552
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,400
 Jesus Christ.

1553
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:26,880
 Sears, 22, and Toys R Us, 21.

1554
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,840
 I didn't even realize Sears was gone.

1555
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:29,840
 Yeah.

1556
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,240
 Sears has been gone for a little bit.

1557
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:32,240
 That's crazy.

1558
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:35,720
 That's because you never bought craftsman tools.

1559
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,880
 But I used to just go to Sears all the time.

1560
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:40,880
 I don't know what to tell you.

1561
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:41,880
 Paul.

1562
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:42,880
 All right.

1563
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,880
 It's gone, buddy.

1564
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,640
 The most, please.

1565
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,280
 The most for 800.

1566
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:56,560
 Which of these pie sells the most in the USA, apple, pecan, or pumpkin?

1567
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:59,720
 I mean, we say it's as American as apple pie.

1568
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:02,120
 I say that all the time.

1569
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:06,680
 But I got to believe pecan and pumpkin got a hotter business.

1570
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:09,280
 I'm going to go pumpkin.

1571
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,280
 OK.

1572
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:11,280
 It's apple.

1573
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,720
 29% of all pie sales.

1574
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:16,120
 Pumpkin number two, 23%.

1575
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:18,640
 Pecan coming up at the end, 9%.

1576
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,680
 I got to tell you, you people are missing out on some pecan pie.

1577
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,960
 I got October brain going on.

1578
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:24,960
 Yeah, you do.

1579
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,800
 I'm already in spooky season.

1580
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:33,880
 As soon as we flip to August, I'm like, ooh, ghosts and shit.

1581
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:36,040
 The last 400.

1582
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:37,240
 The least, I mean.

1583
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:38,240
 The least for 400.

1584
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:39,240
 Daily Double.

1585
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:40,240
 Yes.

1586
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:41,240
 Let's go.

1587
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,280
 This is where I strike.

1588
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:47,040
 Which of these three states has the least religious affiliation?

1589
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,960
 Vermont, New Hampshire, or Washington.

1590
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,600
 New Hampshire.

1591
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,000
 New Hampshire.

1592
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,360
 It's Vermont.

1593
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:58,840
 Only 63% of citizens claim religious affiliation.

1594
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:03,520
 New Hampshire is 64, and Washington 68.

1595
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:04,520
 Those heathens.

1596
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,520
 You were close.

1597
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,520
 Those dirty.

1598
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:07,520
 Those heathens.

1599
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,520
 Those Vermont heathens.

1600
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:10,920
 Those syrup-chugging heathens.

1601
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,360
 I'll try the least for 800.

1602
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,120
 Syrup-chugging heathens.

1603
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:18,480
 Which of these states has the least trees per square mile?

1604
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:24,320
 North Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska.

1605
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:28,200
 I mean, here's the thing.

1606
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:32,680
 I'm going to say Nebraska, and I'm going to tell you why.

1607
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:35,440
 Because they got all that farmland.

1608
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,440
 They got so much farm there.

1609
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,960
 Same thing with Iowa, though.

1610
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,040
 I agree.

1611
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:41,040
 I agree.

1612
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,040
 But I'm going to go with Nebraska.

1613
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:45,200
 I feel like they've got more farmland per capita than Iowa does.

1614
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:46,680
 Maybe I'm wrong.

1615
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:47,680
 Nope.

1616
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,200
 I'm just wrong all around.

1617
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:52,640
 It's North Dakota.

1618
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,640
 North Dakota was the correct answer.

1619
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,160
 I was just out.

1620
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,160
 Paul.

1621
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:01,080
 I will take the most for 2,000.

1622
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,080
 Ooh.

1623
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,920
 Which of these celebrities is the tallest?

1624
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:09,560
 Alfred Hitchcock, Eminem, or Bob Villa?

1625
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:10,840
 Hitchcock.

1626
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:11,840
 Joke's on you.

1627
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:15,160
 I was just at a party with Hitchcock, Eminem, and Bob Villa the other day.

1628
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:16,200
 Same height.

1629
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,200
 Same height, precisely.

1630
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,400
 Bob Villa was the tallest.

1631
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:24,440
 5'9", Hitchcock, 5'7", Eminem, 5'8".

1632
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:25,440
 Man.

1633
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,320
 Burned by Bob Villa again.

1634
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,200
 How's that feel, Paul?

1635
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,760
 Will it never end?

1636
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,440
 Matt.

1637
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:37,840
 The most, 1,200, please.

1638
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:43,440
 Which of the countries read the most in a week per capita, Denmark, India, or the United

1639
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,440
 States?

1640
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:45,440
 No.

1641
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,440
 Oh, sorry.

1642
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,080
 United States right out.

1643
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,080
 No.

1644
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:50,080
 Yeah.

1645
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:55,360
 Isn't Denmark the one where they do the Christmas Eve, give each other a book, and you go hide

1646
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,520
 and read it all night?

1647
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,520
 Yeah.

1648
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:59,520
 Sure.

1649
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:00,520
 Yeah.

1650
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:04,960
 And then if you catch, if they find you in your reading spot, you have to hit them with

1651
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:05,960
 a sandal.

1652
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:06,960
 Right.

1653
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:07,960
 Right.

1654
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:08,960
 I'll pass.

1655
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:12,340
 Hit them with a sandal.

1656
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:13,340
 Passes to me.

1657
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:14,340
 Countries read.

1658
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:15,340
 I'll guess India.

1659
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:16,340
 India.

1660
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:17,340
 Let's try India.

1661
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:19,200
 They got a lot of people.

1662
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,760
 I know that's not per capita, but whatever.

1663
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:24,160
 India is the right answer, 10 hours, 42 minutes.

1664
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,080
 Denmark is still higher than the U.S.

1665
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,080
 Well, yes.

1666
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:28,080
 Yeah.

1667
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,800
 So you were correct about who had the least, Matt.

1668
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:31,800
 Great.

1669
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:32,800
 Yeah.

1670
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:33,800
 It's me.

1671
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:36,120
 I'll try the least for 1,200.

1672
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:38,880
 Which of these states has the least domestic pigs?

1673
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,760
 Now, wait a minute.

1674
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:50,320
 Does that mean the lowest amount of domestic pigs or the amount of pigs that are not well

1675
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,320
 domesticated?

1676
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,320
 I think it's the second one.

1677
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:56,360
 I think it's how many, which of them have the least domesticated pigs?

1678
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:58,600
 I like to wipe my ass on the couch.

1679
01:14:58,600 --> 01:14:59,600
 Exactly.

1680
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,600
 I'm not very domesticated.

1681
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:01,600
 Rhode Island, Maine, or Delaware.

1682
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,120
 I'm the least domesticated pig you'll meet.

1683
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:11,240
 I mean, Rhode Island has to be a trick answer there, right?

1684
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,240
 Who knows?

1685
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:13,240
 Who can say with this game?

1686
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:16,000
 Rhode Island is a tiny little state, so you want me to pick Rhode Island because they

1687
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,040
 don't have the least domestic pigs because they're so small anyway.

1688
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,520
 Well, I'm not going to do it.

1689
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:26,160
 I am going to say Delaware, so go fuck yourself.

1690
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:27,160
 Delaware?

1691
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:28,640
 Delaware is the correct answer.

1692
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:31,040
 Oh, I just gamed your game.

1693
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,040
 Only 300,000.

1694
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:35,400
 Now, what do they mean by domestic pigs?

1695
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,000
 You know everything that I do, Paul.

1696
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
 It's your turn.

1697
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,000
 I'll go with the least.

1698
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,160
 For 2,000.

1699
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:47,760
 Which of these states has the least human limbs per capita?

1700
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:52,480
 Hint, it has the most amputees, Indiana, South Dakota, or Louisiana.

1701
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:57,800
 Oh, by the way, there is a player who is signed to an NFL team right now who has six fingers

1702
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:05,600
 on one hand, making the average amount of fingers that an NFL player has more than five.

1703
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:09,480
 Wow, which is exciting.

1704
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:14,760
 Jason Pierre-Paul, who only has nine fingers because he blew one of them off, I think,

1705
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:19,320
 in a fireworks accident, he's not currently in the NFL, so the fact that there is one

1706
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:24,040
 player with 11 fingers and everybody else has 10, the average is above 10 now, which

1707
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:25,040
 is wonderful.

1708
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,040
 Wow.

1709
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:30,760
 What do you think, Paul, Louisiana, Indiana, or South Dakota?

1710
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,520
 Indiana, please.

1711
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:35,020
 Indiana has the least limbs.

1712
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:36,520
 I'm sorry.

1713
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:37,520
 It's Louisiana.

1714
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:38,520
 Oh.

1715
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,480
 I have no data for any other states.

1716
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,560
 It's just something that Louisiana is proud of.

1717
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,600
 Well, they don't call it the big easy to lose your hands in for nothing.

1718
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:47,600
 That's right.

1719
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:48,600
 That is the full name.

1720
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:49,600
 Yeah.

1721
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:54,880
 Matt, you got the first for 800, 1,200 or 2,000, and let's see, you have zero points.

1722
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:55,880
 Perfect.

1723
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:56,880
 I have 2,800 points.

1724
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:57,880
 I am in the lead.

1725
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:01,880
 Paul is in a distant third place with negative 4,400.

1726
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:04,000
 So it's anyone's game.

1727
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
 Anyone's game.

1728
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
 Except Paul.

1729
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,920
 I'll go with the first for 2,000.

1730
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,880
 All right.

1731
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,680
 Which of these three movies came out first?

1732
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:17,560
 Lethal Weapon, RoboCop, Princess Bride.

1733
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:20,280
 Oh, man.

1734
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:24,480
 I'm right back in grade school for all of these.

1735
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:29,520
 I remember begging to see RoboCop with my older brothers.

1736
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:30,520
 Okay.

1737
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:38,720
 Because it was, because then Princess Bride, I definitely watched it in grade school.

1738
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:41,840
 Like that was, that was okay to watch in the school movie.

1739
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:46,280
 All right, man.

1740
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:50,840
 I don't these all feel like the same time.

1741
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:51,840
 I got nothing.

1742
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:52,840
 I'm going to pass.

1743
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:57,120
 I passed the me shit.

1744
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:00,280
 Princess Bride is 80s.

1745
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:03,200
 RoboCop is also 80s.

1746
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:08,120
 But Lethal Weapon is 80s.

1747
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:12,640
 So you see how I'm doing my math out loud.

1748
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:16,360
 I am aware of your mathematicals.

1749
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:17,740
 I think it's RoboCop.

1750
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:19,640
 I think RoboCop was early 80s.

1751
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,480
 I think Princess Bride is later.

1752
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:22,600
 Feels right to me.

1753
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:25,520
 I'm not sure when Lethal Weapon is, but I would guess like mid to late 80s.

1754
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,160
 So I'm going to say RoboCop.

1755
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,160
 It's Lethal Weapon.

1756
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:30,160
 Oh, shit.

1757
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:31,160
 No, this is wrong about all.

1758
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,160
 Oh, God damn it.

1759
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:33,160
 This is one of these.

1760
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:36,840
 They were all 1987.

1761
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:41,240
 Lethal Weapon was March, RoboCop was July, Princess Bride was October.

1762
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:42,240
 Wow.

1763
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:43,240
 They were close.

1764
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:44,520
 I have been played.

1765
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:51,560
 Can you imagine a year where we had those three movies in the same year ever happened?

1766
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:52,560
 Yeah.

1767
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:53,560
 1987.

1768
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:54,560
 Yes.

1769
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:55,560
 But like.

1770
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:56,560
 Yeah, it's easy.

1771
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:57,560
 Just imagine 1987.

1772
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:58,560
 I just didn't know.

1773
01:18:58,560 --> 01:18:59,560
 Nothing like that happens now.

1774
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:00,560
 I don't know.

1775
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:01,560
 I don't know.

1776
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:02,560
 Let's see.

1777
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:03,560
 I'll try the first.

1778
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:04,560
 Oh, let's see.

1779
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:05,560
 Where am I here?

1780
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:08,520
 I have 800 points now.

1781
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,480
 So 800 is enough to get me there.

1782
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:15,560
 The first for 800 among these three countries, which was the first to learn about the good

1783
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:23,600
 news of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, Ireland, Poland, India.

1784
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:24,600
 Let's see.

1785
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:28,060
 Brogan, did you hear about Jesus before Poland or India did?

1786
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:32,320
 Fuck you, Jacob.

1787
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:39,560
 Brogan, the self-hating Irishman.

1788
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,080
 Who was the first to hear about it?

1789
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:42,600
 Poland, India or Ireland?

1790
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:45,520
 I mean, Ireland is right there.

1791
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:54,080
 It's very close to several countries that really dug on Jesus Christ.

1792
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:56,600
 He got rid of them snakes.

1793
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:57,600
 That's right.

1794
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,600
 India.

1795
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,800
 I know I got to India.

1796
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:01,880
 I don't fucking know.

1797
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:02,880
 Paul, I'm passing.

1798
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,860
 I'll guess Ireland.

1799
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:05,860
 Let's try it.

1800
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:06,860
 It's India.

1801
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:14,120
 52 A.D. Ireland was 431 A.D. Poland was 966 A.D. Poland held out for a long time.

1802
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:18,120
 Paul, closing out the category and the game, the first for 1200.

1803
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:19,560
 Here I go.

1804
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:25,640
 Which of these three candy bars were released first, Baby Ruth, Three Musketeers or the

1805
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:27,460
 Milky Way?

1806
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:29,800
 Here's my math, all right?

1807
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:34,480
 Nougat is a scheme.

1808
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:38,480
 Why is it that all of Paul's math involves a nougat?

1809
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:43,200
 Because it's like they call it the nougat math.

1810
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:46,940
 I don't understand the nougat math with these kids today.

1811
01:20:46,940 --> 01:20:49,840
 I'm going to go.

1812
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:52,200
 I'm going to go with Baby Ruth.

1813
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,760
 OK, let's see it.

1814
01:20:54,760 --> 01:21:03,160
 It is Baby Ruth, 1921, Milky Way was 1923, Three Musketeers 1932.

1815
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:10,000
 Paul got that question absolutely right, which pushes him all the way up to third place with

1816
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
 negative 4000 points.

1817
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:15,280
 Matt's in second place with a big old goose egg, that's zero points.

1818
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:20,760
 And I'm in first place with an impressive score of 800.

1819
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:22,720
 We crushed it.

1820
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:27,040
 We tow that scooperty up from the flow on up.

1821
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,320
 Thank you so much, neck pubes.

1822
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:32,760
 If you want to send us a scooperty or a price of Skrite Jock vs. Nerd or an Obelisk Jock

1823
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:38,960
 vs. Nerd or just send us some scoop mail over there, head over to HeyScoops.com right there

1824
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:39,960
 on the homepage.

1825
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:40,960
 You can send us some scoop mail.

1826
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:41,960
 We can do all those things.

1827
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:42,960
 HeyScoops.com.

1828
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:43,960
 Do it now.

1829
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:49,480
 We're on a low on a scoop on a scooperty's Jock vs. Nerds, all the Jock vs. Nerds.

1830
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:51,040
 We're just running a little low on them.

1831
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:55,320
 Head over there and do that little thing.

1832
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:56,320
 Thank you so much.

1833
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:59,920
 If you do, I want to thank all the scoops who got to join us today on today's zoom call.

1834
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:04,400
 I want to thank all the people who are watching us on Twitch.

1835
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,840
 And I want to thank all the people who support us over.

1836
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:09,320
 Oh, no, no.

1837
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:10,600
 What's happening?

1838
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:11,600
 You've been evaded.

1839
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:12,600
 What?

1840
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,600
 Look who's on the zoom.

1841
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:15,600
 It's Brian Brushwood.

1842
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,680
 Oh, I thought there was maybe somebody else.

1843
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:19,600
 I was really confused there for a second.

1844
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:20,600
 I'm sorry.

1845
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:23,040
 I'm taking client meetings here.

1846
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:25,600
 What can I what can I help you guys with?

1847
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:30,560
 I'm drawing charts and graphs and by God, how do you zoom?

1848
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:31,560
 People do this.

1849
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,280
 You just zoom all day.

1850
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:37,480
 It's not casting, but only one person's listening and then you don't get to run ads on it after

1851
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:38,480
 the fact.

1852
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:42,200
 I do in the class is the worst thing we've ever done.

1853
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,200
 You know what I got now?

1854
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,200
 Clients.

1855
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:45,600
 You know what I'm wearing right now?

1856
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,200
 A fucking white collared shirt.

1857
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,640
 The fuck is wrong with this world?

1858
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:51,640
 Sellout.

1859
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:52,640
 Yeah.

1860
01:22:52,640 --> 01:23:01,840
 You know, it's even worse is you're about to get your ass handed to you at Scoop Fest

1861
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,040
 when we do the trivia battle.

1862
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:05,880
 So it's even harder day than you thought.

1863
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,400
 Hang your head in shame.

1864
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:09,640
 That is 100 percent the truth.

1865
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:18,320
 And everyone knows also, I can't help but notice the the room that Brian is sitting

1866
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:19,320
 in.

1867
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:20,320
 Brian is in my house.

1868
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,320
 Right.

1869
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:26,040
 It's on the other end of my house right now, which which only makes me a bigger asshole

1870
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:31,840
 for missing the bulk of the program because I'm sitting here like, oh, yes.

1871
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:39,580
 And this and well, the time we did it on the podcast, we did it like, ah, even more like

1872
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:44,640
 while you're racking up dick points, Brian, you were at the Orleans and did not text me.

1873
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:45,640
 Yeah.

1874
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:52,400
 You know, I was too busy getting cornered by Michael Weber, smirking his face off.

1875
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:58,960
 He has thoughts about because he's the fucking magic police and he's got opinions on what

1876
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:02,040
 is good to teach people.

1877
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,040
 Yes.

1878
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,520
 Sorry, I didn't text.

1879
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:14,000
 I was waiting for this moment, but client meetings pushed it.

1880
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:18,160
 I was working in my backyard yesterday and Brian gets back from from from doing all of

1881
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:20,880
 the all the things that Brian is doing in town.

1882
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:25,320
 He walks into the backyard in like slacks and a button down shirt.

1883
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:27,400
 And I didn't know what to do with myself.

1884
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:31,800
 Well, first of all, SJ yelled and I was and I made a joke.

1885
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,900
 I'm like, I'm just here to check the meter.

1886
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:40,640
 And then but the strangest thing happened because I walked in and obviously a lot of

1887
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:43,400
 landscaping was happening, a bunch of garden stuff.

1888
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:45,720
 And I see Jacob is edging the lawn.

1889
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:52,140
 And then I look over, I talk to SJ and then my eye drifts down to a patch of astroturf.

1890
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:58,040
 And then I follow the astroturf over and I see the feet that Jacob is standing on, on

1891
01:24:58,040 --> 01:24:59,420
 the astroturf.

1892
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:04,800
 And I golden retriever my head a little bit as I try to consider why is he edging the

1893
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:05,800
 astroturf.

1894
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,820
 And then I realized that's not an edger.

1895
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:09,280
 He's pressure washing.

1896
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:12,320
 And we had a delightful conversation about pressure washers.

1897
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,320
 We did.

1898
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:14,320
 We did.

1899
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:17,920
 I had just gotten through pressure washing several tons of rock when when Brian came

1900
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:20,120
 outside.

1901
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:24,120
 Brian, because we I won't announce it on air, but off air, remind me to tell you that two

1902
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:28,800
 very high profile people got kicked out of Magic Live for wearing fake badges just to

1903
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:33,800
 go into the dealer's room.

1904
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:34,800
 That's OK.

1905
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,720
 I actually really that I'll tell you what, man.

1906
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:41,560
 This is one of those things where it's like if you become a high enough profile person,

1907
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:42,820
 you better get legit.

1908
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:48,680
 Because I used to I used to be a hacker, pirater and stuff swimming on all the pirate days.

1909
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:52,540
 And then I started hosting a show with Tom Barrett called Cord Killers about how to watch

1910
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:55,640
 what you want, when you want on streaming services.

1911
01:25:55,640 --> 01:26:01,600
 And I realized how long, how long until somebody rings the hypocrite bell on this.

1912
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:04,960
 And so I had I had to give up all of that unsavory behavior.

1913
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:05,960
 Yeah.

1914
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:06,960
 Yeah.

1915
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:07,960
 Yeah.

1916
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:08,960
 These guys should have done the same.

1917
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:09,960
 And they're not.

1918
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:10,960
 You heard it first.

1919
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:18,920
 Penn and Teller kicked out of Magic Live, fake badges.

1920
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:19,920
 Apparently they were recognized.

1921
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:20,920
 No, no, no.

1922
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:26,720
 Actually, Pips the Magic Dragon kicked out of Magic Live with his fake badge and his

1923
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:27,720
 magic suit.

1924
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:29,440
 In a bit to make it totally hypocritical.

1925
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:35,640
 Well, one, Penn has no interest in going and Teller actually usually gets a VIP access

1926
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:38,360
 to the to the room before anyone else goes.

1927
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:41,720
 You just walk Teller in and walk him around.

1928
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:43,040
 They do the same thing.

1929
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,040
 Copperfield and Blaine.

1930
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:45,040
 I met David.

1931
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,520
 I met David Blaine this year.

1932
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:47,680
 Oh, that's nice.

1933
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:49,840
 Met is a strong word.

1934
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:53,580
 I greeted David Blaine this year.

1935
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:56,400
 But yeah, anyhow, super fun.

1936
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:00,520
 Brian, I'm so glad that this is the only way we're seeing each other while you're in.

1937
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:03,080
 No, I'm going to be here all week.

1938
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:05,280
 I insist that we meet up in person.

1939
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:08,920
 As a matter of fact, I'm going to go as soon as we're done here, I'm going to go to the

1940
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:11,240
 Orleans, but I guess you won't be around.

1941
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:13,600
 I won't.

1942
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:18,920
 My festival is over.

1943
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:21,660
 My convention is complete.

1944
01:27:21,660 --> 01:27:25,520
 So there are on the Las Vegas strip billboards all over the place.

1945
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:30,360
 There's all of these new ads being run about reporting cybercrime.

1946
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:31,360
 There's all these things.

1947
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:37,120
 There's a Terminator cowboy on these electronic billboards like if you know of someone committing

1948
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:40,800
 cybercrime, scan this QR code and report them.

1949
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:45,120
 And we were standing outside last night looking at these billboards, trying to figure it out

1950
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:47,280
 and why these billboards were there.

1951
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:50,640
 And then I finally realized, wait, DEFCON is happening this week.

1952
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:51,640
 Yep.

1953
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:55,440
 And I was like, Brian is staying in my house because DEFCON is happening this week.

1954
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,000
 I should know this.

1955
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,800
 That QR code is suspicious because of that fact.

1956
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,160
 I was about to say, right?

1957
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:01,160
 Sure is.

1958
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:02,600
 I was talking about a honeypot there.

1959
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:06,800
 I will not be scanning any QR codes this week.

1960
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,800
 I would not be engaging my wifi anytime this week.

1961
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:10,800
 No.

1962
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:11,800
 Anywhere around that.

1963
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:12,800
 Sorry.

1964
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,160

01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:23,680
 There it is.

2003
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:24,960
 It's coming through in clutch.

2004
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:25,960
 You invented it, Jacob.

2005
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:27,680
 I'm surprised you can't remember it.

2006
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:28,680
 I know.

2007
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:35,320
 Well, you know, it's so much joy and positivity that goes into creating those QR codes, those

2008
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:39,200
 custom codes for our discount people over there at the Orleans.

2009
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:41,080
 It's too much joy to hold onto, honestly.

2010
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:45,360
 But yeah, head on over there, get yourself a room at the Orleans.

2011
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:46,360
 Room visits at ScoopFest.

2012
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:47,360
 It'll be awesome.

2013
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:48,680
 I have some cyber crime to report.

2014
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:49,680
 I'll see you guys soon.

2015
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:50,680
 All right.

2016
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:51,680
 Take care of yourselves.

2017
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:52,680

2019
01:30:53,680 --> 01:31:16,120
 Oh, Myra in the chat is pointing out right now, SCF is for ScoopFest SCFI, I don't know

2020
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:17,120
 what the I is.

2021
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,120
 It's for September.

2022
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:19,120
 Oh, September.

2023
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:20,120
 That makes sense.

2024
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:21,120
 25.

2025
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:24,120
 Oh, yeah, that's that makes it makes a lot of sense.

2026
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:24,800
 That's that's just fair.
