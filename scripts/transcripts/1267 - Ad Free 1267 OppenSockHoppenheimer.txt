I have a bum need right now Yeah, I think there's something going on. It's my right knee is just acting a fool I don't know why It's just been the last five days the lefty. So we have a different disease entirely. Absolutely Absolutely different. It's be careful fellas. It's spreading completely different shit. I don't know It's just you know, I think it's possibly the change in the weather combined with the fact that I Worked my ass off three days straight. I don't know Who knows whatever it's you know, what's fucked up, but good it gets better the more I'm up and on it So I guess that's weird. It's when I sit down that it starts to get really bad. Oh, it's like tightening up Yeah, I don't know so I'm having to stretch a lot more and all that kind of thing which eventually is good I do need to do more stretching and all that kind of thing What's happening with your knee Matt? I? Just heard it playing in the soccer game with adults versus kids soccer game. Oh smart. Oh, yeah smart play Okay. Oh, hold on one second guys. I gotta hit this button Because my knee hurts too And what I'm finding is that I am a restless sleeper. Oh I tossed in turn so what happens is I Feel better and then I wake up and my knee hurts the next day because I've you've been jerking around leg around all When I like okay, so I worked yesterday early in the morning You know had a full day and stayed up past my normal bedtime, which I was I had three days in a row So I was getting to bed at like five o'clock So I wouldn't play I wouldn't play any games and sick as a dog So I was trying to take care of her a little bit and not get sick myself and so far so good Yeah, I got a little stuffy head today, but not too bad, but When I stay up late like I did last night past my normal bedtime my Legs start to get real antsy And they start they start to hurt and they get jittery And I have to like shake my leg and twist my leg all evening It's like go to bed go to bed go to bed. Okay fine But yeah, I was up pretty late. I mean I wasn't up that late. I was like 930, but Well, I Forgot that I'm here. I'm at sea. I'm in the ocean. Yes. I'm actually actually off-shore some rando island at princess zones But I've seen it and I Forgot to pack a knee brace because I found it was helping my knees I was going to sleep with a knee brace, which doesn't help me sleep better It just helps my knee feel better the next day. I sleep worse. I sleep more restlessly wearing a knee brace Okay, right because I wake up. Oh, it's got me Something's grabbing my knee. Oh shit. I'm watching alien Earth. I assume some alien has gripped my knee They do By the way, I hate the modern TV show where like you you kind of like slow burn Middle episodes to like to like peak almost peak boredom and then they and then they really stick the landing on the final Two and a half episodes and you're like, yeah, all right You did pick it up and I it's like I'd rather watch the show that I just watched at the end the whole time Are they I hate it too and what makes me crazy is in our day. We had 24 25 Now they can't even get fucking eight. Yeah Well, yeah, I think we look back at the quality of those 24 episodes. We're not gonna be like nail them I think yeah, I think you'd be surprised. I think you'd be surprised Well, here's the thing here's not nailed them. Take a look take a pause recording. Let's all go watch Hill Street Blues And let's come back Let's all go watch in the heat of the night. I mean my my base dog is We're gonna sit down everybody and all watch a different world. Let's do it I just think they're trying to get rid of more episodes Where I want to agree with you It's just money. We just we're spending movie money on television now And so you can't afford to make more than eight episodes, right? but Compelling drama that can resolve in an hour. That's where you're talking about that's what you're talking about Paul is These episodes are these these modern TV shows are secretly just super long movies. Yeah, which is gross, you know Yeah, they're a lot of movies. They have some They have some kind of arc Yeah But they They're slow burning the shit. Well, that's the thing like Trek is sort of Responsible for all this too because it was season three where they did You know best of both worlds That was the first true Season to season cliffhanger that had ever been attempted in syndication Oh, I see it was it was the end of a season and then the season break. Yes Gotcha, so half of the season half of the cliffhanger was at the end of the season then you had to wait four months five months before the next one started up again and you know Tantalizing but it was the one where Patrick Stewart became the other thing that the when he became a cutis. Yes That is are the what's the Borg that's the Borg that became the cutis of Borg Yeah, and that is that was the model that they then went forward with from then on out with all The Trek series all the Trek series had season cliffhangers. I Still remember as a kid not knowing how like I didn't necessarily like we didn't get like TV guide to the house or anything, right? And different strokes. Yeah, they snuck under the set of Knight Rider. I remember that They were hiding behind he was with that kid from Terminator Not the main kid from Terminator the other redhead kid from Terminator Well, I think was also on salute your shorts. Yeah. Yeah, the little punk that was him and and Arnold hid what happened they hid and they almost got killed They hid the hit in the set and it's that was gonna be exploded, right? Yeah. Yeah, and everybody goes The audience goes well and I was like all summer being like I have to remember to watch the first comes back around What happened? Yeah, he was wondering whether Dead and explosion like they start the series like so sorry every character is dead. They all do well It wasn't every character. It was just Arnold dead space The cast on to the set of a James Cameron movie James Cameron murdered them Was gonna happen in terms of that like Arnold's death. Yeah, I don't In a set explosion in the Simpsons in the first season A child was killed. There's that classic episode in the first season Simpsons are all classics But that one where Homer finally goes to try sushi and He fucking loves it and then he decides he wants to go for the forbidden sushi the Fugu Which is the blowfish which if not prepared properly can be poisonous and deadly And yes, so the whole premise was will Homer die Eating this poison sushi and the commercials that you didn't get TV guide I got TV guide and the TV guide commercial was a little blurb a little picture With Bart coming up to going. Yeah, right like they're gonna kill the main character of a Show in the first season and you know So it really was you know, it was before Game of Thrones. They were do that back then They were always on their ear. They were always putting stuff in a thing. What then I also saw Damn, I just saw a tick to talk to me. So say I'm not gonna talk about it. Anyway, I Wanted to say before we go any further. I Wanted to say thank you to Matt and Jacob because Guys, I don't know if you know, but they always come through when it's my birthday and sure enough here We are recording on my birthday And they did it. They gave me permission to use my sound box throughout this episode Happy birthday, buddy. There we go. So that's what you have to look forward to Wait, is zoom is zoom cutting off the The fart box it didn't let the sound go through. Let's see if I can get one to go through the recording will hear it, but we won't Zoom as a thing where it cuts out like weird weird weird noises of it's part of it's part of it's Noise canceling things that you'll meet here. What a bunch of shit Correct that it is going into the Okay, that's great. Well, so it'll be really funny That it will you know It'll come up only in the episode So that'll be a whole surprise for later. Yeah, that's right. So yeah, but a couple of people said it I already had it pulled up to I'm sorry Paul Star Trek didn't do it first. Who did it first? Dallas who shot J. R. Oh, I guess you're right. Yeah, ten years ten years earlier Dallas was 1980 Star Trek did it in 1990 Yeah, yeah, so they did the the season great who shot J. R I'm sorry Paul. You're precious Star Trek didn't do it first. Hey, look look I'm I am I Have no problem giving Brandon Braga less credit fuck that guy Dog good he can eat dig what a turd he's at Brandon Braga's a piece of shit Oh, man now my my computer's asking me if I'm playing music. No, I'm not playing music. You dumb thing. I Mean I played a tiny little piece of music. Well, now I can't really do it. It's not fun if I nobody can hear it Anyway, oh, I got a message for so Well, not only did I injure my knee playing soccer But we decided this year man. We did a whole Is it Nick Newman Totally influenced by whole family about Thanksgiving. It's basically this is the unit because he did our kids hate Thanksgiving food. Oh Would you do that's right? Your kids do not care for Thanksgiving food. They never have they do not they do not and Sarah's, you know, basically a vegan. Mm-hmm And so I rest that there's only one person the household that was looking forward to Thanksgiving It was me and I was like, well, I'm not gonna I'm not gonna, you know, be a fatty dick And so we blew it off I've never done it before my life we blew off Thanksgiving. Oh I'm so proud of you. I'm so proud of you. Feel so weird. I feel icky about it. No, no, no, what'd you have? Just normal. So here's what we did. We rallied a Kind of like friends friends with kids kickball game, okay? And We brought turkey and roast beef deli slices and croissants and right and some fixings Some hummus of penis peanut. I said Pia penis. I said penis. Okay, so we did we did our we did our new tradition of Dipping our penis and in hummus Good Mind the pine nuts and Uh, we have like a basic like half ass picnic Rich Cooper the jet says that's not a new tradition. You know what's weird matt You know what's strange about that tradition is I personally have never had anyone I've never paid anyone to penis on me before Uh Nobody's buying that You never paid a garbanzo to be They're paying a garbanzo to bean on me. Oh shit There's no evidence that built that built could never garbanzo'd on trump's bean. That's right. No, no But holy shit So then so we're playing kickball and both sarah and I Popped the hamstring playing kickball. Oh, damn it. That's awful I saw sarah that night and she was like this is terrible. This is the worst thing Sarah really Sarah really poppy she was going to run for a ball and you know like like it's like you like music professional dreams Whether they're running and they just stop and you go Yeah, like sarah's sarah's running and all of a sudden it was like nope And I was like, oh god like I was the one running. I could have ran To the next base and I stopped like oh god and then the very next play I popped my hamstring running from second to third. Oh god. So, uh, I just It's my brain subconsciously cannot let sarah have any more attention that she already gets good. I have to bear We have to do it. Well, we had we had inadvertently a similar situation at my home because uh the day before Thanksgiving and got terribly sick like Knocked down drag out sick still had to go to work still worked and almost dying And so I was like, okay. I better make at least some kind of backup plan So on the way home. I bought warm up mashed potatoes and mac and cheese So at least we'd have something that resembled a Thanksgiving day. Okay, okay And got home and sure enough. She was just out of it. We were done. We didn't get to go down to the the in-laws But we absolutely had chicken nuggets mashed potatoes cottage cheese That was that was Thanksgiving dinner That was it Wait, where's the cottage cheese is the cottage cheese of its own dishes to go on top I put mashed I put cottage cheese on the mashed potatoes. I can't I love that. That's my favorite Good lord. I this has come up before and I I still don't understand it. I talk about it all the time It's one of those things that just happened too. I love it just did a triple take up on his on his view I love it. I love I love mashed potatoes. God, it's cheese. I love it. I always have It's so good. Are you pregnant? Are you expecting? I mean By the looks of me you'd think when when's that fucking thing coming but uh No no Uh I let's see nick see nick newman top baked potatoes with cottage cheese. I think it's a southern thing I think there's some kind of weird You and nick will not represent the entire No, okay, okay, but oh i'm say katucky fine. I'll say katucky because I my mom My mom used to make lasagna using cottage cheese instead of ricotta So I that's I prefer cottage cheese and lasagna to ricotta Any day of the week. Yeah But I just really love a little cottage cheese on my mashed potatoes According to the google. It's not a uh, it's not a southern thing or It doesn't have a particular area of origin It is uh touted though as a a nice higher protein version and a little healthier version of mashed potatoes If you're not doing like all the yeah, if you're not doing like the Loaded mash sour creams and bakings and all that now. I just do a little just a little cottage cheese Just a dab of potatoes and some cottage cheese in there little salt and pepper. Yeah, sure Yes, little salt and pepper some kind of sure every doctor be proud Proud of you switching the cottage cheese. Oh, I mean, it's the healthy lifestyle choice of the generation as you can tell It's done wonders for me It's really moved the needle I mean it got you to this birthday. It did. I mean, hey, I made it to 51 Better than a lot of people do I bet it's better than half the population does So there you go RFK approved. Don't be saying that lemur creamer lemur creamer in in in the chat Well, it's an event that took out all those horrible dyes of the cottage cheese Turned out that cottage cheese is actually When it's with the mashed potato Brings out the body Oh Paul you RFK we can't hear you, but I know it'll be on the broadcast I killed my wife. I drove into suicide and I write horrible fuck poetry He's so nasty. We're not nasty. He wrote he's so nasty I would pay $14.99 for a book of RFK's poetry. Oh god Don't say that he'll publish it. He'll do it. He'll he don't give a fuck Only if it's an audio He does sound a little like Yes, the kickball we all ate sandwiches and hummus and uh It went home and I had we had leftover pizzas from the day before because we had all the a bunch of kids over if we all saw wicked okay, and So it was so it was leftover pizza was the other Thanksgiving course that we had and then uh, And it was off to mac kings for dessert That's pretty great That sounds like a really nice day Uh, it was super fun. It was it was it was really nice not to take Thanksgiving that seriously And it was like gosh I really have to figure this out It's a really good idea To not stress out of the whole Thanksgiving Um I performed at in the max Thanksgiving variety show nice good Um He asked bread sure would and I since paul couldn't make it paul was invited. Um To do a some kind of improv song bit. Oh fun And then I called spedoni and spedoni was available. So we had spedoni there beautiful And then After arranging all that I got a text from brad saying you got a minute and I was like, oh, no He's gonna fail. Uh-huh, and then I I call him and it is not him bailing. He's like, hey, I said a wild idea He's like, what if all right, what if what if we do uh, uh do it all in shakespeare And uh, you do magic tricks, but I play like your hype man like your producer And I'm just blown away by all the magic we're doing and I just narrate everyone's thoughts I like this and I said, um The one thing that mac king's show has is magic. Yeah And arguably lousy with it and You know, we were specific guys to do music. Yeah, it goes. All right. Why don't we do it as a musical? Oh Yes, and motherfucker So we did uh Uh, we we did what we call the uh, the prom Shakespeare repertory presents much to do about magic the musical great Funny that's cool Uh, it was so well that some people thought it was written which is always the best Exactly And brad and I want to do it again beautiful That we want to find a way to like we we were not satisfied with just the the ten minute hunk that we did We want to do it again. This is the trick, right? Like we're finding these new ways to expand on improv like, uh Collin mockery is doing the hypnoprov Yeah, brad works with collin a lot, so I imagine he's seeing the bold new adventures that can be like what else can we use improv to mine Well Yes so brad and collin perform Uh, i've been performed together for 15 something years or more than that maybe okay So so anytime you see hip-prov performing that's collin not performing with with brad Ah It's just I think that's the the most uh delicate way I can say got it. Yeah. Yeah fair fair So yes, collin has discovered that trying to sell the hip hip-prov thing they tried it in vegas It was too soon. It was a mistake and there's also bad timing. Yeah, um and and uh did not Did not get a lot of positive show reports from that hey, man Experience, where did they do that? Muppet improv didn't hardly fucking work in vegas. No, it's it's fucking tough Muppet didn't work in vegas for a different set of reasons. Oh fine, but it's still it's still Improv with awesome shit not working. So yeah, there's the crazy cocaine habit of all those puppets that really did it in That's that they really do Good lord those felt line straws. They are just hoovering it They are Paul they are I'll tell you who else is sucking up a lot of cocaine into their felt lined noses and that is the following sponsor Which I have in my hand right here. Oh There we go. Sorry. I've heard do more than I usually have to um This is paul's emergency toilet paper socks paul's emergency toilet paper socks from a scoop of montecristo Uh this year that was this year We've all had the horrible embarrassment of having to shit In a place Without a bathroom When it happens Not if but when Will you be ready for the challenge? Of the necessary ass wipery Because that's the real challenge of going to the bathroom without a bathroom the cleanup introducing paul's emergency ass wipe socks Paul's emergency ass wipe socks are equipped with a double layer one for absorbency and one to be discarded and then used again for absorbency That was two number ones. There are two number ones Yeah, but one of them's four number two when you have the paul's emergency shit socks on You technically are wearing four socks The first outer layer is the more absorbent layer And that is the one to be used upon first blush if you will getting the most liquid Out of the system The second is less absorbent but no less important But we advise you go ahead and employ both socks Use the second sock's first layer of absorbency To make sure that the rectal area is clear of all juices Then With the third sock, which is the first sock second layer Go ahead and do what we call the check it tab Tab it up there Take it back out and check it Where are we standing folks? Did we get everything? If we didn't Invert the third sock, which is the second sock of the first sock I'm sorry paul, I can't believe the war is happening Finally After the check You go ahead And you use the fourth sock, which is the second sock of the second sock That one of course Is rounded up And tucked As a muffler To prevent any further seepage Interhase goops and check out It just makes too much sense We gotta figure out the zoom thing because everyone's turned off their cameras and so we can't see if anyone's laughing I saw a few or maybe everyone turned off their camera just to vomit I saw a few I saw a few laughs. I saw a few laughs Just Just in time for christmas Just in time for christmas You can hang them by your you can hang them by the fireplace, you know, uh, I mean you gotta drive out somehow. Yeah Have you been if you guys been watching this show physical asia on netflix Is that the one with the really strange? uh, japanese Uh, olivia newton john impersonator Yes, yes, that's that's the show that i'm alluding to right now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the japanese olivia newton john impersonator physical asia Yeah, that was it was really odd, but I mean, you know, yeah, let's get physical in asia Oh, that's so much better than the the japanese person singing physical that I thought you were about to do I didn't do that. That was bad. I know you did Uh, they so it's it's a uh, it's a crazy reality competition show Where they do, uh, these insane like physical tasks and everything and it's different, uh, asian countries Uh, participating uh competing against each other also for some reason australia So it's like all these asian countries because olivian john and australia because of olivian newton john, of course So i'm watching it last night And they they do it's all uh overdubbed all of the language is overdubbed Which is kind of neat, uh, just as a side note all of the teams competing against each other Uh in the overdubbing watching watching the show it just sounds like they're all speaking english to each other Which of course they are not they're all speaking their native languages to each other Which means nobody else can understand them in the competition So they can just work together and talk to each other in their native language and the other team can't understand their planning And it's it's really kind of a neat twist But the thing i want to talk about was the overdubbing because they do all of these crazy physical things where they're like grunting and yelling and everything while they're While they're doing it and they overdub all the grunting and yelling Oh, that makes no sense It's so goddamn funny that makes no sense That's really strange. It is the best thing to watch once you realize that that's what they're doing and like Oh, right. That's not the uh, that's the same overdubbed voice that is now yelling Which is not what that person actually sounds like Yeah It's so good It's so good What are some of the physical challenges they have to do? They do shit like I mean, it's it's really insane stuff The the first one they do is like a king of the mountain type thing Where they have these these each team is six members and they're all like MMA fighters and uh wrestlers Uh track stars. It's it's quite a few former olympians Uh all this stuff. I mean it's it's the battle of the network stars Kind of but in like a hard core way. I mean it's it's a ball of the network stars was hardcore I'm telling you paul Meatloaf could not have gotten through the first leg of the first competition on this show He would have died in support I was wondering we're going to present a vigorous defense for battle of the network stars I will I will It's paul's birthday matt Of course, we're going to present a vigorous defense of battle of the network stars You know, I also saw jacob. I don't know if you're aware of this new show that they're doing They've gone in and they're doing this whole retelling Of the guys who came up with the atom bomb Uh, but it's set back in the in the 50s So it's like it's like a future backwards So it's like it's all it's the it's the the the scientists that made the atom bomb, but they're all Uh high schoolers in the 50s Right, okay, so it's up up and hop up and sop up and sock hoppinheimer is what it's called Uh Sock hoppinheimer If you can't say the title of the show on the first three tries the title is too complicated Up and sock hoppinheimer. I said it there Up and sock hoppinheimer and it's also starring olivia newtron john It all comes together that's how it works. Yeah Uh The show was a bomb. I'm assuming it's that's pluto tv and it's pluto tv. It's a pluto original Good call man. Good call pluto original Oh There I said it again Two out of eight Say up and sock hoppinheimer five times fast. Good luck. No, I'm not trying to watch pluto tv I No, they do these insane challenges Like they they do stuff that if the three of us tried to do Oh, god single one of these games we would die. Oh, I can't play kickball Oh, the first thing I heard about on thursday night was how injured you and sarah were And I see sarah and sarah's like oh matt and I are so hurt and keeps watching these These tick tocks with these physical challenges. Have you seen some of these where the couples do these extreme physical moves? With each other they do like these very gymnastic They'll see a gymnastic move and then they they're like, okay We can we can do that, you know, and they're they're in there like a little home gym and they're trying to do it And sometimes they fuck it up and some of them. Well over Thanksgiving She found this one where these guys are doing a new tradition right after the Thanksgiving meal the men Grab the their wives and hoist them on their shoulders and run a race And and it's the beats of strength. Yeah, and was laughing her ass off And I was like, I could do it. Let's do it. She's like, no, no, you couldn't I said I could do it Come on. I'm picking up. Let's go and I can't try to pick her up And she wouldn't she wouldn't work with me at all which is probably trying to convince and to let him pick her up Is the video that we all need to see she wouldn't do it. She would not do it She's like, no, no, no, I was like, I can't do it by myself You gotta give me a little jump so I can you know get it going here But she would not she would not commit to the bit but to be fair She was also coughing up a fit because she was still uh very very sick, but uh, I don't get picked up like that That's right. She doesn't get picked up like that and she didn't get picked up like that because I didn't do it But she was she was ridiculous I could have done it, but uh, yeah, I see all these things Jacob, did you ever see the the japanese one with the wall and the shapes? The wall and the shapes. Yeah So did I see a television show made in japan that had a wall and some shapes is your question Yeah, so what happens is Yes, good job. You're standing. You're standing. Yes. I saw shogun paul. You're standing in this you're standing in this hallway, no wait paul before you go on I'm trying to think of a show that doesn't have a wall and shapes any of them What happened is the outdoors set shows like the bear grill site things where he's surviving in the wilderness I guess I don't have no walls. There's plenty of shapes though. They have shapes, but no walls The the wall has a shape cut out of it of a silhouette Uh-huh, right a person's physical silhouette. Okay in some sort of stance Oh, and the wall. I think I have seen this actually the wall moves towards you Yep, and you must assume the stance to wily coyote style Fit through the silhouette as it you have to pass through the wall or it smacks you Yes, you have to it's called hole in the wall. There you go, buddy's on it. It's called hole in the wall And so I thought it was called any port in the storm Any port in the storm It depends on what region you're watching it in some of them is called any port in the storm Some are called hole in a wall I've watched every episode of any port in the storm So that's what happens and the wall keeps going up and then either you get through it or you get smushed They're gonna do a two person version of that paul. Have you seen that? No, what is it called death in the doorway? Oh, it's a gentleman's game Any port in the storm also has a lot of smushing as well A lot of smushing A lot of smushing There was the cocaine addicted muppets Was uh, they had a solo show with miss piggy called any snort in a perm And she was just out there hoovering Hoovering cocaine So much money Hi Oh, I don't know piggy Oh, kermi.

This is magical I took about like I you know grew up with uh with four brothers and a sister and uh We you know, I I am I am the shortest of my not by a lot, but I'm the shortest of my brothers. Uh, So, uh, never Never had leftovers. Yeah Never no no meal no meal leftover. Yeah, that checks out Y'all we're like leftovers. What is this? What is this concept? Uh Yeah, my mother-in-law does this thing where she insists on trying to make like a turkey soup with the turkey carcass of the turkey thing And like it's this it's this whole it's the thing that takes up the whole next day. Right, right Uh All that all that started was to make sure that sarah and I stopped cooking turkey. That's all that happened because that we just don't we just were like We don't want to spend the whole other day making soup and we don't want to spend the next four days eating that soup Yeah, uh, it's just not just not the world we live in Um, but uh, yeah But look I saw on instagram. It looks like you had a fine spread at your house there, Jacob Oh, yeah, no, it was it was so nice at uh, yeah, we had a we had a ton of people over and everything It was great. I love Thanksgiving. I don't know what y'all are talking about. I love doing the the whole meal I love doing all of it. It's it's great time I did too. I think it's my favorite holiday really I I promise I'm making a very good turkey. Yeah, um, I just wasn't simply alone in my house Uh, uh, as as nimble and famously said all Thanksgiving food tastes like napkins and that's what my kids think too So there you go And it was it really was this show that changed my perception. So at first I was like I have to as their dad Keep making it until they like it because that's the way it works and there's only on this show I found out so many listeners hate Thanksgiving food also as adults Oh You should show your boys. Do you ever watch uh, garen the guy out of ireland? He's very funny. He's gonna say Thanks for watching. I'm delicious You ever seen him? He's really funny No, no, he's he's really really funny. You should look up some of garen's stuff, but he did from ireland Just a couple days ago. He cooked his own version of a traditional american Thanksgiving dinner And uh, I was very surprised by what he liked and what he didn't like So he was okay with the turkey Okay, um He hated craft macaroni and cheese box dinner The box fine, which I mean, I guess yeah, that's not really Thanksgiving food. Anyway, well mac and cheese Mac and cheese is a Thanksgiving food. And that's what people I suppose so sure people getting shit You're you're bringing a very fiery debate. Yeah, there are people that That insist that mac and cheese is not a Thanksgiving food people says that it is I don't think it was a Thanksgiving food, but I'm not upset if I see it show up. I love it. I love it Uh, mashed potatoes. He made his own mashed potatoes. He has a special recipe for the mashed potatoes So he wasn't expecting the mashed potatoes to be anything but delicious. They were He made kind of a cheese that he put in his mashed potatoes. What kind of cheese? What kind of white cheese does he put in there? Oh, no, he does not do the no no He doesn't do the cheese It's just curds and way it's barely even cheese. It's like halfway done um So, uh, then he had the green bean casserole Which he was very suspicious of But he liked Yep, I like a green bean casserole and then he made pumpkin pie Which they don't do pumpkin pie in ireland at all apparently No, they do potato pie. Yeah, but I mean they don't mash potatoes They don't do pumpkin pie at all And he was really super suspicious about it all But he made it and he really liked it. He was suspicious of the pie He was suspicious of the pie. He did he he was took him Some time to get over the he's he was like, oh, it's got this vegetabley Uh mush to it. I'm not used to like a dessert And he says and then I went on and I watched all your fucking videos of all your fucking celebrations And I saw how all you got all you only got these these yam potatoes all these sweet potatoes with fucking marshmallows on top So many fucking marshmallows get fucked. I don't want marshmallows anywhere near my dinner. That's bullshit I do agree with that. I don't want the marshmallows. I agree with that too. He says he says I know a lot of you say it's great I don't know More power to you keep those fucking things away from me. It's secretly deserting early That's what I don't like about it Yeah, it's like what's it because what I have marshmallows and sugar and brown sugar and cinnamon on something I'm like well now I don't want to eat savory things anymore. You you shift my gear to dessert Right. It's unfair. Yeah, it's like it's like a hip it's hip prop Like we do we do the uh the the sweet potatoes we do the sweet potato casserole It's got brown sugar and pecans and everything. It's not healthy. It's not it's not a uh It's definitely still a dessert masquerading as uh as a dish But uh, it doesn't do the full on swing over with the marshmallows Sweet potato the masquerade Um Uh Galactic president scooper star McScoops a lot Stuffing on a waffle iron. That sounds amazing stuffing on a waffle iron is legit. I saw that earlier. I've seen that before It's a that's a fucking idea Do you put a little gravy on it and then kind of sear it all in is that how it goes? I think your gravy afterward though. You have like a little A little I suppose you're right. Yeah. Yeah, you just make it I think you want the hot gravy. Yeah, nice hot gravy then pour it on after you waffle iron it Because when you get something that has crispiness and moisture, that's the key. Yeah, right So that's that's that seems really good. That sounds fucking good But paul wants the hot crispified some gravy, which is also ambitious As long as it has a skin Give me that give me that skin Give me that gravy skin. No gravy skin is not Not no, that's no good How dare you No, I'm just uh, I'm just upset because uh Well, I'm I'm not I'm not I upset is the wrong word disappointed lightly That I can't just go get the food that I want on my birthday without driving an hour and a half out of my way Yeah, like it's literally an hour and a half drive for me to get even fucking panda express It's like This conversation for me must be what it's like when the topic is football for other scoops You're horse racing. Yeah Yes, not so express you're absolutely right rich Yes, it takes way too fucking long so I and that's the thing it's by the time I get back home I'm like, oh, well I drove an hour and a half for panda express You might as well just give fucking mcdonald's. It's just it's turned into Shit at that point I mean that's the same thing, right? Kind of panda expressing mcdonald's or it didn't even say it's all owned by the same company, right? Well, we're thinking of uh Maybe going to cost go on wednesday I'll get that good old hot dog That'll be my so what did you guys what did you guys think of wicked too? Didn't see it What? No, I didn't see you didn't rush out to see the sequel. I did not I've only seen it seven or eight times Uh, so I I don't really have a fully flushed out opinion on it yet I know it's really cool when they breakdanced to save the car wash I thought it was really amazing Have you seen that is that what you're talking about that? no, there's There's a bit I'm talking about the plot of break in two Okay, well, I'm gonna blow your fucking mind to show you some shit that you You're not gonna show me anything, please Show us something ball. It's an audio program. I'm gonna tell you about it as it's happening You're gonna narrate it to us. Oh good First it's like a long time pulling up though. I don't know if I have the plot right from break in two I'm not looking it up. I'm just we're just moving on No, all it is is it's the old donnie and marie Uh Or the osmonds that's what it or no no wasn't the osmonds. It was a fucking money call. It's a brady bunch Uh, the break you remember the brady bunch had it had a They're providing show. Yes Yeah, yeah, where um one of the kids I forget which which kid one of the kids got replaced on it Because they couldn't get the whole original cast back together That is correct. I think it was one of the young kids. It was just like a new kid Oh jan. Thank you. You like the president. Yep. They had to replace the jan Well, what you just and jan sickly stuck upstairs. She was cutting Ropes to see different obviously would fall from the top of the theater and there's a cliffhanger The first cliffhanger ever What you just joked about matt happened And it happened with none other than rip taylor as the cowardly lion And the rest of fucking brady's dressed up like the people from os Doing the theme from car wash. They're doing car wash at the car wash. Yeah, and Fucking greg brady dressed up like the scarecrow and rip taylor is the lion to be in as flamboyant as he can be Just out of hand and I thought this would be really funny for somebody to slip into a copy or one of the edits of Uh os 2 or wicked 2 wouldn't it be really funny if this showed up? I'll uh, you know, um Somebody's just like watching that on tv in the background or something No, no, it would you know, what's the on tv in the background? I don't know tv. No, what's uh Fight club like in fight club. Remember how uh, he would always slip in little snippets of pornographic stuff And all the movies if you could put this in And just make everybody upset That is true. That is true. We gotta do that. That is quite a fever dream as none of the elements make sense at all No, it's fucking bizarre And and rip taylor evolved a rip. Yeah rip taylor of all people you think like if you you'll never get rich But it beats digging a ditch I think I said you guys the funny the me my song which is that uh, don't worry glinda and alphabet will be back in avengers Uh That's awesome Tick-tock and The guy He's a madham madham. What now madham mova or whatever name is, you know, there's dolls of all these figures, right? There's dolls. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, sure. So he's got all the dolls stacked up And then madham mova Comes in and it's playing that that song from the drag race stuff And here comes the hurricane bitch Katrina Katrina Katrina Katrina Katrina. She's not getting And the bow comes down and crushes It's fucking funny Katrina Katrina Katrina here comes the hurricane bitch yelling Katrina. It's funny It makes me laugh. So what what did you really like it? Did you not like it? Oh, that was fun. That was good. That was good. Would you be able to watch it all in one sitting? Yes That's that's that's my only takeaway is they added three songs to it and those three songs aren't on par with the actual Chorus soundtrack. Yeah to basically strike to basically make the second Movie fill out. Yeah. Yeah Is it they're not terrible. There's not there's just there's nothing to is it closer to the book or the Musical do you know I wouldn't know Because my wife wouldn't know either my wife loved the book And we went to see the musical and she was so upset because the ending is oh really Yeah, the ending is so different and just all had to carry her out of there like it was a Thanksgiving day prank I threw her on my back and she laughed the whole way home It was crazy It undercuts the meaning of the whole Story the ending scooper nova girl in the chat says that it's the musical on screen nothing added from the book. Well, that's unfortunate For an yeah, because that musical did did so poorly, but um, no, I don't like the musical No, the the ending of the musical is bupkus deus ex machina bullshit That's everything now though. I guess you're right. There's so much People are coming movies for happy endings, dude. Yeah Yeah I'm not worried about that. Like there's so much of that any tv show I watch any movie I watch like half of them now at least have the have the uh God from the machine. Yes the deus ex machina Just some kind of supernatural thing or somebody comes in or something But something off-screen happens and the plot resolves itself Do we know do do our do our audience members? I think most of our audience members know deus ex machina But you know where that really comes from from back in the day in early theater There was actually a hand. Yeah, the greeks. Yeah, the greeks had an actual hand of god That would come down from the top of the The thing and touch characters or zap characters and that was a way to resolve plots by actual Divine intervention. Yeah, they would they would just say like, uh, you know medea is doing all of these things Uh off off stage right now, right and then the gods intervened intervened and and now it is this And now here comes everybody to bow. Yep Yeah, there you go. Uh, yeah, I was told that people kind of get all off script And kind of go haywire with stories and stuff and and and so like that was a way to like just clean everything up Yeah, yeah, and uh, somebody did 10 minutes of uh, shake spirit magic I can tell you we can go haywire fast. I'll bet you go haywire. I'll bet it go lose. He lose. You know, you ought to do that again No, we're gonna Paul might have to take a flight. We might have to do a thing I would I honestly think I would fucking I want to I want to I want to see brand schedule, but I want to submit it for uh Uh fallout fringe. Oh, oh, yes That'd be really fun. Yeah um So I you know for people going to see the movie. I don't want to you know, it's a good movie I don't want to pass the whole thing. Uh, yeah There's just one part that really stuck out to me that I was really really like like really laughing because it almost took me out of it So this whole thing's like basically family friendly pg ish pg 13 ish story but there's a part where The prince has got to get it on with somebody they they they they they run off and they they they're finally by themselves and they're gonna There's there's a hookup that's going to happen. Oh, yeah And it is the weirdest shot thing Ever it's like this weird like it's like it looked like an old chris isaac music video Like everything from one room to another And like It took me out of it completely. I literally was like almost laughing. I was like, what is the scene? Because I can't like just show them getting it on right? So there's Wicked games the title of the song is wicked games That's what it must have been That must have been You don't know the wicked games video listeners do yourself a favor and google the wicked games video So it's like the characters from one room to another like taking off clothing, but then also putting on clothing Like that's great. Bizarre Someone said big ups to modern love whereas someone puts on a sensible shawl to have sex Oh gen alpha The sex card is now I think Matt I don't want to frighten you but if you back up just a little bit Back back your head up just a little bit.
