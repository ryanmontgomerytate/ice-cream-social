1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 That's wrong.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 That's wrong.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Hold on. How's that wrong?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Off to a fantastic start.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 I should put my headphones on.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 That's how it's fucking wrong.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 I don't know how to do things.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 It's an abomination your lack of headphones is disgusting to watch.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Hello!

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 I'd love to thank all you ice cream truck drivers out there.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Who are the ice cream truck drivers?

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Well these are the folks that deliver that fucking ice cream straight to your fucking ear holes.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Right now I'd like to thank

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Paul's brother

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Here's the show!

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social?

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Yeah, I'd love to!

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Great, let's go!

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 We've got our friend Jonas Wolferton stopping by the churn today.

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Paul created a football on Patreon with the most ridiculous post ever.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 We can finally announce, we can finally announce where we were.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Our mystery show that we were talking about.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 It's time for Matt and Matt Hickley's Ice Cream Social!

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Sitting in Las Vegas, it's Matt!

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Sitting in Pittsburgh, it's Paul!

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Sitting in Vegas, it's me, Jacob the Audio Guy!

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 We're preachingfun.

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 I want to start with an apology.

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 I just blamed Paul for something that was Jacob's fault.

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 That was me, that was me.

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Jacob took credit on it, which is great.

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 I mean, eventually it will be my fault.

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Yeah, yeah.

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Very soon.

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 I thought Paul had already done it, so I jumped on it the last second and did it.

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 This is for the Zoom hangout.

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 I already told the people that were in the Zoom early.

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 But yeah, that was my fuck up.

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 I thought Paul had already done it.

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Paul thought I had already done it.

56
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 So I just jumped on it and did it real quick.

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 It didn't think about any problems that I was going to create in the future.

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 So I get all the Patreon emails and it just was like, wait, what?

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 What's that, when, where, what's going on?

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Yeah.

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 See, you get those and you were bothered by those.

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 I get the Zoom email.

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Every time somebody tried to click through the link and go, I was getting an email as

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 well.

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Oh man.

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Well, we offered a new feature for Patreon off-air hangouts on Zoom.

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Paul was going to host the first one and then we're going to be more detailed going forward.

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 I did, but it just, we did get it cooking.

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Yeah.

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 So I got, I got to still chat with you, Matt, a little bit later about Patreon stuff, getting

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 in there and then I'm going to get myself all situated with the Zoom coordination stuff

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 so I can actually send those out real soon.

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 So I'm going to do that and then I'll talk to you, Matt, later this week about getting

74
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 all that.

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 I'm busy.

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 But congratulations to Casey and Josh on their recent marriage.

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Yes.

78
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 It was lovely.

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Such a lovely time.

80
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 And there was a surprise.

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 So the surprise, the secret, the reason why we did the Tierney show is because Paul and

82
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 I were hired to go surprise a groom on his wedding by having his two favorite podcasters

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 stop by and do improv on their rehearsal night dinner.

84
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 And we surprised Josh by pretending to call him on our way to another gig.

85
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And then we walked out of our car into the wedding venue.

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And there's nothing more special as improv comedians to walk into a room where two people

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 are very excited to see you and 50 people don't know what's going on.

88
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 But to their credit, they got on board real quick.

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 I was like, my son was like, how'd the show go?

90
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 I go, well, no one was expecting to watch the show.

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 So the fact that they watched the show and participated was a real, I was like, imagine

92
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 if it was everyone polite.

93
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Imagine if I just came into your classroom with Paul and just did an improv show.

94
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 That's the same feeling as everyone else at that dinner.

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 But they were down and they loved it.

96
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 And the main thing, Josh was super surprised, really shocked.

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 And Casey was very pleased that we got the desired effect out of him.

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 So that was it.

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 No.

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 And again, like we say, we have the best listeners in the world because we attract the nicest

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 people.

102
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Sure enough, that wedding was filled with just amazingly awesome people who were very

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 kind to us.

104
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 I was playing chess with their son.

105
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 I was invited on the dance floor numerous times at the wedding.

106
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 It was just a lot of good hanging.

107
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 So yes, it was incredibly delicious food, libations, games.

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Oh, Paul, that actually brings up a sticky subject.

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 I did get a note.

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 You were only hired as the guest.

111
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 You weren't actually supposed to eat anything.

112
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 So I do have a bill.

113
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 It was an invoice.

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 They did send a bill over.

115
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 I get it.

116
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 I had an extra ravioli or two.

117
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 That's for sure.

118
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 That is noted on the invoice.

119
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Extra ravioli or two.

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Yeah.

121
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 We should maybe address basically how this all snowballed in a way that made sure that

122
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Jacob wasn't there.

123
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 I think maybe we should get into that as well.

124
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Okay.

125
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 So originally I was called and I was emailed because I was a magician.

126
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 And she said, I think my husband likes your podcast, but he likes magic.

127
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 And so I think you did a duo.

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 And she brought up Nick Paul.

129
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Nick Paul, who I just did the magic castle with.

130
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Yeah, yeah.

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 I said, oh, so you want the magic show that Nick Paul and I did at the castle?

132
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 And she's like, yes.

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 And I said, great.

134
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 So I called Nick Paul.

135
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Was he available?

136
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Yes.

137
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 And then I basically, on a follow-up email, was like, so you guys saw us at the castle

138
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 or whatever?

139
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 She goes, no, we've never been to the magic castle.

140
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 And I said, so how did you find about the Nick Paul and I show?

141
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Because Nick Paul and I do shows together, but like at the castle and a few other places,

142
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 but not often.

143
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Right.

144
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 And she was like, well, I just know that my husband listens to the podcast.

145
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 And then I started going like, uh-oh, Nick Paul, Paul Mattingly, she might think she

146
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 has the name right.

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 And I said, listen, right now, you have a magic show booked with myself and Nick Paul

148
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 and Nick is available.

149
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 This is far enough away that maybe you want to, without giving anything away, figure out

150
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 whether he wants to show up with the magician that maybe your husband's never heard of.

151
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Or the podcast partner that she has heard of.

152
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Which is really funny.

153
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 If you show up at somebody's wedding with a magician that the groom has never heard

154
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 of, it's great.

155
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 I imagine he's like, hey, Matt, hi, sir.

156
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Hey, pal, thanks for being away.

157
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 And Matt's helper.

158
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 What a surprise.

159
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 I'm Josh.

160
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 And so like a month later, she's like, yeah, yep, you were right.

161
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 I'm wrong.

162
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 And we do not.

163
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 So I had to call Nick Paul to be like, hey, pal, you're no longer one.

164
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 No one likes you.

165
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 You sure have a popular name though.

166
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 It's his name.

167
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Yeah.

168
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 So all that kerfuffle, we ended up, you know, booking an improv show with Paul and I.

169
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Had it come earlier to my attention that just simply about Ice Cream Social, I might have

170
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 said, do you also want Jacob there?

171
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 It was such a kerfuffle and a hubbub to pull it off that I totally, it wasn't until I was

172
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 at the wedding and everyone was talking about how much they liked the podcast because we

173
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 met another scoop that was there, Ryan.

174
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Ryan, who actually turned Josh on to us way back in the day.

175
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Yes.

176
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 He obelisks Josh.

177
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Oh, funny.

178
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Yeah.

179
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 And he didn't make it to the rehearsal dinner and was so pissed when he found out we were

180
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 surprised, showed up there and did a show.

181
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 He's like, fuck.

182
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 But anyways, it was, I really had a lot more fun at the wedding, knowing that Jacob probably

183
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 should have been there too.

184
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 And he wasn't.

185
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 And that made me really feel great.

186
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Well, I wasn't at the party.

187
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 I was at home working on things.

188
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 I will say, not having any fun.

189
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 It would have been nice to have Jacob there to deflect from the possibility of your early

190
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 onset death.

191
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 He would have, he would have advised me, or more to the point, he would have been in charge

192
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 of knocking on your door and he would probably would just wouldn't have stopped knocking until

193
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 you had to.

194
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Yeah, exactly.

195
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 He would have said Matt, he would have said Matt and I would have heard a voice that wasn't

196
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 housekeeping is what would have happened.

197
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 I just knocked twice and assumed you're dead.

198
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Yeah.

199
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 In fairness, every time I do go to wake Matt up, I do impersonate a housekeeper.

200
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Housekeeping.

201
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Yeah.

202
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 I don't always do the same accent.

203
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Sometimes I go Dutch.

204
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Sometimes I go Slavic.

205
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 You know, it just depends on my mood.

206
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 And then my instant boner wakes me up and I have to go like, all right, I'm up.

207
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 That's right.

208
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 That's right.

209
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 But it was amazing.

210
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 It was so wonderful.

211
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 We're going to bury that right now because we have our friend Jonas Wolverton here.

212
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Exactly.

213
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Speaking of instant boners.

214
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 He headlined our variety show at Scoop Fest this year.

215
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Certainly.

216
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Yes.

217
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 The ball's on him.

218
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Jonas, how you doing, pal?

219
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 My balls are doing well.

220
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Good.

221
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Good.

222
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 We were worried.

223
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 I could tell you.

224
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 I could see the fear in your eyes.

225
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 All good.

226
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Hi.

227
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Hey.

228
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 How you doing, everybody?

229
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 So you have a solo show coming up at the -- it's not ArtSquare Theater anymore.

230
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 What's it called?

231
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Vegas Theater Company?

232
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Vegas Theater Company, yeah.

233
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 So I'm doing my solo Mack and Fro show.

234
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 And Mack and Fro is the bad boy of tennis who you guys saw at the Scoops Fest.

235
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 That's right.

236
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 So you're a variety artist.

237
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 You juggle.

238
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 You do a sear wheel.

239
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Where did you end up coming up with the John Mack and Fro idea?

240
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 I have always loved John Mack and Fro.

241
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Yeah.

242
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 No relation.

243
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Oh, interesting.

244
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 If you're listening, lawyers.

245
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 No related.

246
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Nothing related.

247
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Did you play tennis in your youth?

248
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Very rarely.

249
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Okay.

250
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 I was a New York City kid.

251
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 I played baseball.

252
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 All right.

253
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Thick ball.

254
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 But no bad.

255
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Shortstop and third.

256
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Oh, come on.

257
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 I call him infielder.

258
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 He had infielder vibes.

259
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Yeah, yeah.

260
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 No, that was pretty good.

261
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Infielder vibes.

262
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Come on.

263
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 I feel pretty good.

264
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 I still feel good about that one.

265
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Yeah.

266
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 So I grew up watching John Mack and Fro have some serious blowouts.

267
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

268
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Yeah.

269
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 He is the most New Yorker of all of the tennis players from that time period for sure.

270
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 That's why I love him as well.

271
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 He is the most likely for a New York kid to enjoy who doesn't play tennis.

272
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Yeah.

273
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 That's where New York kids are going to gravitate to is John Mack and Fro.

274
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Exactly.

275
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Exactly.

276
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 That and the 86 Mets who are all high on cocaine.

277
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Yeah.

278
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Oh, man.

279
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 I got caught watching like a documentary on Dwight Gooden and Daryl Strawberry.

280
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 And it just kept getting like...

281
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 The clickety click of the roller coaster, all the heights are right at the very beginning.

282
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 And then it just goes down, down, down, down, down, down, down.

283
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 And I was like, Jesus, will someone stop this documentary?

284
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Please.

285
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Somebody stop this documentary before someone gets hurt.

286
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Get the present day.

287
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Get the present day.

288
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 It's so dark, the whole thing.

289
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Oh, my God.

290
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Halfway through the documentary, you get a proof of life.

291
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 These are my heroes when I'm eight.

292
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Perfect.

293
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Perfect.

294
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Yeah.

295
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 So I love Mack and Ro and I love the sort of performance art aspect.

296
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Not really knowing what performance art was as a kid, but later on from reflecting about

297
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 it, I got a gig with World Team Tennis to do Sear Wheel, which is what you guys see in

298
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 the back there.

299
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 And I was like, hey, I've been thinking about doing this bad boy of tennis character kind

300
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 of an homage to Mack and Ro.

301
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Would you guys be cool with that?

302
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 And they're like, yeah, absolutely.

303
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 So I got hired to do a gig.

304
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 I did a Sear Wheel act as him and also interacted with the crowd and filmed the whole thing

305
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 as a sort of...

306
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 I didn't know what I was going to do with it.

307
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Make it like a documentary, a mockumentary or something.

308
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Because Mack and Ro, for people of a certain age, he's an iconic character.

309
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 But in the circus world, most people don't even like sports, let alone famous tennis

310
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 players.

311
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 So was there any time where you were floating the idea of doing Mack and Ro and just another

312
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 circus guy was like, what the hell are you talking about?

313
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Please don't do this.

314
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 What are you doing?

315
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 No.

316
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 My world is the world of the clown.

317
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 And so that's actually my first entrance into circus was through clown.

318
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Okay.

319
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 I went to the Clown Conservatory in San Francisco.

320
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Oh, wow.

321
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Yeah.

322
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 And I did a whole year long program in clown.

323
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 And so my attraction to the circus is originally through clown and through character.

324
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 And I'm a theater kid at heart.

325
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 And that's my first passion.

326
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 And so I wound up...

327
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 And that's the cool thing about the clown is you can literally draw from anything in

328
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 the world and find what's ridiculous about it and find what's funny about it and find

329
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 the absurdity in it.

330
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Right.

331
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 So how old are you in the Clown Conservatory?

332
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Where are you in your life?

333
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 This would be in 2001, 2002.

334
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 So I just graduated from college in film and was working in film and was like, ah, man,

335
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 I was making a documentary about a sideshow circus and wound up getting like literally

336
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 ran away with the circus was like, this is so cool.

337
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 I don't want to be making the film.

338
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 I want to be the film.

339
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 We actually had a stand up comedian.

340
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Come on.

341
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 That happened with his documentarian as well.

342
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Yeah.

343
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Yeah.

344
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 So, so you literally, here's the good news is like, if you turn to your parents, it's

345
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 like, you know what?

346
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 I don't want to do stuff in the film.

347
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 They're like, Oh, thank God.

348
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 But I do want to be a clown.

349
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Absolutely.

350
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Yeah.

351
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 His parents more than we thought we did.

352
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Monkey pod.

353
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 No more film.

354
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Bad news.

355
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 I'm a clown in San Francisco.

356
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 But they, but they were behind you in your choices.

357
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Thousand percent.

358
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 That's great.

359
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Yeah.

360
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Always.

361
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Always.

362
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Always.

363
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 I mean, um, that's, that's, are they artists also?

364
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Uh, no, not at all.

365
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Not at all.

366
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 My mom like worked in book publishing.

367
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 My dad's a, um, a political guy in Brazil.

368
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 So a political guy in Brazil.

369
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 That sounds like mafia.

370
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 That sounds like mafia to me.

371
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 He's kind of like the fixer for the president.

372
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Okay.

373
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 This is not, you're not dissuading my, my conclusion.

374
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 I'm nailing it.

375
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Infielder, mafia dad.

376
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 I'm nailing it left and right.

377
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Yeah.

378
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Yeah.

379
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 But, but for good, because he's actually a good president.

380
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 He's, he's, he's on the side of the people.

381
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 So yeah, he's, he's not one of those assholes.

382
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 That's, you know, he's, he's very much against the current American regime.

383
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 So, you know, let's, let's get on this for the second year, but like, how do you keep

384
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 up with all that?

385
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Do you follow the like Brazilian news and stuff?

386
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Um, I am, I have Brazilian citizenship.

387
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 So I try to keep like one eye open to what's happening in Brazil.

388
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 Also as an exit strategy for this country.

389
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Yeah.

390
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Oh, really?

391
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Are you, I didn't realize people were thinking about what other countries they could live

392
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 in right now because of.

393
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 It's just in the back pocket.

394
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 I wasn't immediately jealous of your Brazilian citizenship.

395
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 I'll tell you right now.

396
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 Wait till you hear about my Canadian.

397
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Go fuck yourself.

398
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 I mean, I'm also a spy in addition to being a mafia.

399
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 So, so that's, that's gotta be crazy to follow your dad's career a little bit.

400
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Yeah.

401
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Yeah.

402
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 And the thing is, my dad is actually the one who got me in a circus.

403
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 You can think about it.

404
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Like he, he was always into clowns growing up.

405
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 I hear stories about him.

406
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Like, you know, back in Brazil in the center of town, like the circus would still come

407
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 through the town and they would do this thing.

408
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 The clown would do this thing where the kid that would help the clown out to get all the

409
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 other kids to come to the circus.

410
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 They'd put a little bit of ash like behind their ear so that when they showed up to the

411
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 circus, they could like see the kids who had the ash behind the ear and they would get

412
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 in for free.

413
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Oh, that's a, that's really romantic.

414
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 I like that.

415
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Yeah, so there's, I was very small when I saw my first circus in Brazil.

416
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 I was like five years old, I think.

417
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 It was either Ringling in New York or it was in this small like rural circus in Brazil.

418
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 And I just fell passionately in love with it.

419
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 And so it's been, it's always been this idea of, oh, I really want to be involved in the

420
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 circus in some ways, always been in my mind.

421
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 And it just, it just came out after I went to college and got, had a film career and

422
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 I was like, fuck it, circus.

423
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 This is it.

424
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 This is the new thing.

425
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 We're going this way now.

426
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 As someone who works in a circus, I am always fascinated, fascinated by people who see that

427
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 and go like, I got to do this.

428
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 I'm someone who is in like a, in that area, you know, mainstream kind of like show business

429
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 and then saw variety arts is like, oh wait.

430
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Yeah.

431
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Variety arts.

432
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 You can work all the time.

433
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 You don't have to try to chase fame or awards.

434
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 You can just get work.

435
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 And I think that's, I think that's what's really attractive.

436
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 It really is.

437
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 But there is this thing of, cause it's so much of showbiz, what people, I, I, this is

438
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 probably wrong because I'm in showbiz.

439
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 And so I'm trying to picture what people who aren't in showbiz think about it.

440
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 But it seems like, you know, from the, from the movies and stories and everything, people

441
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 are attracted to the kind of glitz and glamor of showbiz.

442
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 And circus has very little glitz or glamor.

443
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Hard to disagree.

444
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Hard to disagree.

445
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 It has its own type, sure, but it's not, it's not that red carpet.

446
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 I can't think of any more glamorous than Jonas wearing a giant afro wig and a G-string and

447
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 having all these scoops pelted with tennis balls.

448
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Name anything more glamorous than that.

449
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 I stand corrected.

450
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Yeah.

451
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 I mean, I've, I've, I've performed in, you know, um, like dirty rock clubs, like right.

452
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 The double.

453
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Yeah.

454
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 You have done a show at the double down.

455
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Fuck.

456
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Yeah.

457
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 Double down.

458
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 I do combo the clowns, uh, wheel of misfortune.

459
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 What's it called?

460
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Wheel of Paul.

461
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Just, you know, that, that club is not named after the KFC to fry chicken breast sandwich.

462
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 It was before the sandwich.

463
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 I'm not going.

464
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 I'm not going.

465
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 It's a happy accident.

466
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 No, I, I know about the double down.

467
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 I've been the double down a time or two.

468
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 What's, uh, ass juice.

469
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 That's the, uh, the ass juice.

470
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,600
 That's the, the bartenders at the end of the night will take the, the trays where they catch

471
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:56,500
 all the detritus and they will, they will pour you shots of whatever is in there and

472
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,000
 you can, and it's in a little toilet bowl too.

473
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 Yeah.

474
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 There you go.

475
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 It's a, it's a specialty of the house.

476
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Yeah.

477
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,680
 I know me some double specialty, but I've performed a double down, but I've also performed

478
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,160
 for the, uh, the spulton of Oman.

479
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:18,040
 Get out of here as a double down as Mac and pro you've done the Mac and just generally

480
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,040
 over my career.

481
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
 Okay.

482
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,040
 Nice.

483
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,680
 So that's, that's, that's a good spread for sure.

484
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,840
 You started in clown, but you've learned other skills.

485
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,040
 When, when, like, when did you start figuring out like the seer wheel?

486
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,920
 Like what's some time was like, Hey, you're too athletic to just be a clown.

487
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,480
 You should maybe do other things.

488
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,480
 Yeah.

489
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,840
 I thought I was a clown, but I started, I was like, Oh, I'm old for the circus.

490
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,880
 Cause I'm like 25 or whatever.

491
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:45,360
 And uh, and then I saw Daniel seer, uh, he of the seer wheel, uh, the inventor, the inventor

492
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,360
 of the wheel.

493
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,360
 Yeah.

494
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,360
 He invented the wheel.

495
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,760
 I didn't even realize it was that new.

496
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,760
 Yeah.

497
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,800
 He, he premiered his, his, uh, act in Paris festival of Paris is one of the largest circus

498
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
 festivals in the world.

499
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,760
 Sorry, we should say quickly that like for anyone, seer wheels, like a giant metal hoop,

500
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,520
 you kind of say like a giant metal hula hoop or whatever.

501
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:09,120
 That a person can fit inside, yeah, yeah, so the person kind of the Vichy retruvian man.

502
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,120
 Ah, yes.

503
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,120
 That's a great, yeah.

504
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,120
 Yes.

505
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,360
 You're basically spokes of a wheel and you are generating the, the, the spin in the wheel.

506
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,960
 Um, and you can roll and there's, and there's, um, you can manipulate it.

507
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,240
 There's a whole bunch of like, uh, vocabulary that when I first started out working with

508
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,800
 Daniel seer, um, yeah, which is, it's, it's a six foot tall bull for me.

509
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,800
 It's my height.

510
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,080
 It's six foot tall ring that I get inside of and spin around.

511
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,040
 Um, I started working with Danielle, uh, seer in Montreal in 2003.

512
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:46,500
 He just won the, um, the silver medal, I believe at the Paris festival and he premiered a brand

513
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,120
 new circus discipline.

514
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:53,280
 And so when I started out, there was four people and before that I saw him and what

515
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,000
 got me interested in it was I was in clown school and we had to choose an apparatus.

516
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,880
 We had to choose like juggling or, or, um, hand balancing or, you know, whatever circus

517
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,540
 discipline or apparatus you wanted to choose.

518
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,680
 And I, um, saw Daniel seer perform while I was in clown school right at the beginning

519
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,680
 of it.

520
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,680
 I was like, that's it.

521
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,720
 Oh, but it didn't even exist back then, right?

522
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
 There was nobody had a ring.

523
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,720
 Right.

524
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,720
 Just kind of, right.

525
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,200
 You know, it was just Danielle and I was like, he make his own, I guess he had to, yeah,

526
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,600
 he manufactured his own ring.

527
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:31,200
 And then, uh, I, he, and then he's like, on Amazon, they're not there.

528
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
 Nope.

529
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
 Nope.

530
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,200
 Yeah.

531
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
 You can, you can get them online now.

532
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,000
 They're, they're, they're more accessible and stuff.

533
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 And a lot of people, a lot more people are doing it now, but, um, I fell in love with

534
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 it.

535
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,520
 I, the one thing that did exist that was kind of similar was a German wheel, which has two

536
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,520
 rings.

537
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,120
 Um, so I started training on German wheel and then, um, wound up creating an act in

538
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:57,880
 German wheel, a clown act, and then, um, auditioned for Daniel Sears company in Montreal, Cirque

539
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:04,480
 l'Oise, and got hired to, to create, be one of the creators, one of the creative artists

540
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,960
 that originated the show called Rain that toured the world.

541
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
 Oh yeah.

542
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
 I remember Rain.

543
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,960
 Yeah.

544
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,560
 We should, we should actually point out, like, you do love the Sear wheel because you, you,

545
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,440
 when we asked you to do Scoop Fest, you said yes.

546
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,600
 And you said you had a version without a Sear wheel, one with, and I said, okay, what,

547
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,200
 what, what conditions do you need for the Sear wheel?

548
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,000
 And you laid out like three factors and we met none of them.

549
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,400
 We asked for, not one, it had to be a wooden stage and not carpeted.

550
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:38,820
 We had a carpeted stage, stage had to be a very, very big, uh, our stage was very small

551
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,800
 and eight feet, eight feet, that's the record.

552
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,800
 That's the record.

553
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
 Yeah.

554
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,720
 I just kept saying, I kept saying, maybe do the version without the wheel.

555
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,680
 And you just kept being like, I'm going to bring the wheel anyway.

556
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,960
 I'm going to bring it just in case.

557
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,640
 And we had, we had some rather messy acts before you.

558
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,640
 Yes.

559
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,640
 I was legit concerned.

560
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,200
 Oh, Paul was worried the entire time.

561
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,840
 What was going to happen to your wheel at the end of the show?

562
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,400
 All he was thinking about was your wheel at the end of the show.

563
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:10,200
 I'm kicking banana husks and, and goop and pieces of lettuce and tomato off the side

564
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
 of the stage.

565
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,200
 I'm like, fuck.

566
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,880
 You shouldn't have brought a sandwich onto the stage in the first place.

567
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,600
 Banana, tomato and lettuce.

568
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,160
 You even added a criteria that would made it even more difficult for me to perform.

569
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,520
 So thank you guys so much.

570
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,620
 You literally put a banana peel on the stage.

571
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,620
 What's funny?

572
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,440
 Tell me what's funnier.

573
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,440
 That's exactly it.

574
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,920
 I was, I was like, this is, this is, this is the shit show.

575
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,160
 This is what it's going to be like.

576
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:41,880
 It's perfect for the world of Mack and fro, cause the world of Mack and fro, he's, he's,

577
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,280
 he's on, he's on the outs, you know, if you're not, if you're not frustrated, if you're not

578
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,240
 at the butt of the joke, then it doesn't really work.

579
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,240
 Right?

580
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,240
 Yeah.

581
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,240
 Yeah.

582
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,720
 The more obstacles you can put on in front of Mack and fro, what is the sear wheel, uh,

583
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,000
 tiny stage record?

584
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,960
 Do you know or do you have, I mean, really did that to me.

585
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,720
 But I mean, seriously, is there anybody that performs sear wheel on a smaller space than

586
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
 eight feet?

587
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,960
 Do you, I mean, talk, get ahold of Guinness.

588
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,360
 Are you asking Jonas, is there someone dumber than him?

589
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:17,560
 No, it was fucking, it was fucking fearless.

590
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,560
 It was awesome.

591
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,760
 Are there producers less considerate than us?

592
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,160
 That's what Paul is asking.

593
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,560
 I know that, I know the answer to that.

594
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:29,520
 I fucking know the answer to that, but it was great and, uh, yeah, it was just so cool

595
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,520
 to see.

596
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,080
 And I was legit worried, but it went off without a hitch.

597
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:41,000
 There is the world record for a sear wheel performance does not currently have a smallest

598
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,600
 stage category.

599
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,600
 Okay.

600
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,840
 However, the minimal, uh, the minimum, uh, space generally required for a professional

601
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,440
 artist is 15 foot by 15 foot.

602
00:25:53,440 --> 00:26:00,800
 Look at that, you math whizzes out there might notice that that is bigger than eight.

603
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
 Yeah.

604
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,800
 I didn't know that we were actually the measure how professional we are, which is, uh, we

605
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
 are 56% professional.

606
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:14,280
 We've got that shit on video, you can just, you can just send that into Guinness and be

607
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,280
 done with it.

608
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,280
 There you go.

609
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,280
 Here it is.

610
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:22,440
 Now that you've challenged me, I'm going to do it.

611
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,160
 I think about this all the time where I think, uh, my kids who want to go to college, I've

612
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,380
 said this on the, on the podcast many times as like, or I have said, or they can learn

613
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,600
 the sear wheel and just work the rest of their lives, right?

614
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,040
 Playing for the sear wheel, do you, do you accidentally, at least once crush your fingers

615
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,040
 on the wheel?

616
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,040
 Yes.

617
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,040
 Oh, I did it.

618
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,360
 Oh, that, that's the only thing that bothers me when I think about it all the time.

619
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,480
 I feel like it has to be more than once.

620
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,880
 No, it's like Johnny dangerously once.

621
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,840
 And then that's the lesson learned.

622
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,840
 Huh?

623
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,120
 And it's, it's, it's when you do the coin spin.

624
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,200
 So you're like, you're, you're, you're, you're, uh, spinning like a coin and you're kind of,

625
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,800
 kind of wobbling down to the ground.

626
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,800
 Yeah.

627
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,800
 Yeah.

628
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,800
 Yeah.

629
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,560
 With your, with your head, like throwing down to the stage and coming back up and you're,

630
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,740
 and you're letting you pushing the wheel and you're grabbing and pulling it up and you're

631
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,320
 pushing it and pulling it up.

632
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,400
 And yes, that is the trick that everyone inevitably will crush their fingers on.

633
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,240
 That's the one I crushed my fingers on.

634
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,520
 And then I learned, I learned how not to do that trick.

635
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,260
 When you crush your fingers with it, is it, is it just painful or does something usually

636
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,260
 break?

637
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,160
 Uh, no, just, you know, just put a little ice on it.

638
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,200
 Or just like, you know, slamming your finger in a car door.

639
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,160
 This isn't like the story of our all seer wheel artists don't have fingernails or something.

640
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:46,000
 Cause when I first watched that act, I always thought, I thought, are there designs where

641
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,680
 there are whole handholds inside the wheel or anything?

642
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,400
 Or was that like an early on?

643
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,760
 Yeah, but they're kind of, some people do that, but it's, it's very rare.

644
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,260
 I think it's, it's just the simplicity of having a ring that's so, right.

645
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,260
 You don't have to.

646
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,260
 Yeah.

647
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,260
 It makes it clear.

648
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,820
 You don't have to do any excess stuff.

649
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,440
 It's just like the, the, the focus is on the figures that you're creating with your body

650
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,260
 as opposed to, um, your eye getting distracted by some kind of unnecessary thing.

651
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:14,800
 It's just like the German wheel that you mentioned earlier, like your hands are inside of two

652
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,380
 rings and the, and the German wheel already.

653
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,200
 So there's already kind of an apparatus that does that anyway.

654
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,200
 Yeah.

655
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,080
 And it's, it's, it's very German and efficient in that way.

656
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,080
 Like this is Rebecca.

657
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,080
 Oh, Rebecca.

658
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:37,260
 She got unmuted because she had to answer, uh, we, we, um, it reminds me of, uh, contact.

659
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:42,480
 Remember the spaceship and the scientists decided that they had to have a seat in the spaceship,

660
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,720
 but didn't need a seat.

661
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,720
 So you're probably right.

662
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,920
 It makes it a much more elegant beast when it doesn't have the extra constructs in it.

663
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,920
 You're right.

664
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,280
 That's exactly the, the, uh, analogy I was going to use.

665
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,920
 And also the wheel I saw that had hand holds on it, it shook so violently when the guy

666
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:01,600
 was using it.

667
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,760
 I also have a theory in that, in that, um, that I spin left.

668
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:14,600
 So I'm spinning counterclockwise and I'm getting, I'm, I'm, uh, it's just the way that Danielle

669
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:21,020
 spin when he taught me, um, he spun left, some people spin right, but I spin left and

670
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,880
 I have a, I have a theory that that keeps me young.

671
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,960
 Oh, you're Supermanting it.

672
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,960
 Turn it back time.

673
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,960
 Yeah.

674
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,960
 Okay.

675
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,960
 That's right.

676
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,960
 You're running the car reverse.

677
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,400
 Take the miles off.

678
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,400
 Taking that odometer back.

679
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,540
 So your show, you're doing two nights?

680
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,540
 Yeah.

681
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:44,160
 So I'm doing two nights, November 21st and 22nd at the Vegas theater company.

682
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,560
 Um, it's called the Mack and fro show.

683
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,600
 And then I'm also doing the Mack and fro show in LA.

684
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,600
 Okay.

685
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,480
 And then I'm also doing the lesion theater, um, which is going to be December 3rd at the

686
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
 lesion.

687
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,600
 Um, it's a, it's a big hub for comedy.

688
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,560
 Also the same exact show, but it's going to be my, my, my debut in LA on December 3rd.

689
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,960
 No clown is huge right now in LA.

690
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,680
 Like it's very, yeah, yeah, it's blowing up on the internet too.

691
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:17,720
 I follow like three or four very specific, strange clowns on Instagram.

692
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,200
 Yeah, absolutely.

693
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,200
 Yeah.

694
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,080
 And that's kind of the hub is, is, uh, is, is at the lesion.

695
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,120
 So I'm going to go, I'm going to take my clown to go meet their clowns.

696
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,120
 Nice.

697
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,120
 Oh, that's going to be so fun.

698
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,120
 That's awesome.

699
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,280
 And is there a website or anything that people can see the dates and times on and maybe buy

700
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,280
 tickets?

701
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,280
 Yes.

702
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:42,960
 For Vegas, it's theater, uh, spelled in the British way T H E A T R E, uh, dot Vegas.

703
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:50,720
 Um, and then for the lesion theater, I believe it's Elysian E L Y S I A N theater spelled

704
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,920
 the American way.

705
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,920
 Great.

706
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,560
 So we fight over tea and how to spell theater.

707
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,560
 That's just the way it goes.

708
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:02,560
 No, let's just figure that out.

709
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,960
 We should decide right now.

710
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,040
 Should we, should we just make this call right now?

711
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,320
 Uh, I always default to the British spelling.

712
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,320
 It looks more elegant.

713
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,320
 I do.

714
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,320
 I also do RE Matt.

715
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:17,840
 Do you do RE or ER motherfucker jersey trash?

716
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:25,240
 I may, I may, I just had a petition of Toby Keith through the halftime show, the zombie

717
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,460
 body of Toby Keith.

718
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,200
 This happened to me this week.

719
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,200
 I'm bringing up a real thing.

720
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,200
 Yeah.

721
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,200
 Yeah.

722
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,200
 That's real.

723
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,200
 That is real.

724
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,200
 They're going to AI him as the halftime.

725
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,920
 No, there's a petition to make him be the halftime performer.

726
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:43,000
 Because the halftime performer is an American, but has tan skin and speaks Spanish, there's

727
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,800
 a legit petition to have Toby Keith instead.

728
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,800
 Yes.

729
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:54,960
 Because the NFL is going to listen to a petition of 50,000 bigots because you have to, you

730
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,960
 have to, you have to say yes to that.

731
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,960
 You have to.

732
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,960
 You have to.

733
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,040
 Look, I understand being a bigot.

734
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:04,760
 I don't understand spending your effort on the halftime show.

735
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:10,120
 I don't understand burning these calories to be a more effective bigot.

736
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,880
 There's so many other companies that have DEI policies.

737
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,760
 Why are you going after the super bowl?

738
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,840
 There's so many ways to be a bigot where you'll, you'll affect a group of people.

739
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,720
 This case, you're only affecting bad buddy and he's already doing very well.

740
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,720
 Yeah.

741
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
 Exactly.

742
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,280
 I went to home Depot this week to get a piece of hose.

743
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:35,040
 I needed a piece of hose and it needed a very specific diameter for this hose.

744
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:40,200
 And I was like, I think it is a seven eights or no, I think it's a seven sixteenths rather.

745
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:50,120
 And so me and me and the guy, we find a piece of seven sixteenths, so we find a piece of

746
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,120
 seven sixteenths hose.

747
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,880
 I have a little piece of hose that I brought with me and I hold them up and they don't

748
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,880
 match.

749
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,160
 I was like, Oh, the seven sixteenths is a little big.

750
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,920
 Let's drop down to a three eights.

751
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,320
 So we find a three eights hose.

752
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,480
 Paul, this is all math.

753
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,480
 Don't worry about it.

754
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,120
 We find a three eights hose and sure enough, it is a little small.

755
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:15,480
 So somewhere between these two sixteenths of an inch is where the hose that I have is.

756
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,240
 And I say to the, to the guy, I go, I don't, maybe it's metric.

757
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,360
 Do you think it could be metric?

758
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:30,520
 And he gets the most offended look on his face, genuinely and goes, well, cause I told

759
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,680
 him it was for an ice maker.

760
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,560
 I said, he goes, uh, did you, did you buy it in the United States?

761
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:43,360
 And I kind of chuckled a bit like, well, sure, then it shouldn't, then it shouldn't be metric.

762
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,920
 And I thought he was joking.

763
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,860
 And I kind of played along with it and I went like, yeah, yeah, they get these metric things

764
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,320
 and they bring them into the, to the things in the United States and yeah, I bought this.

765
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,920
 I got the US, but who knows where it was made.

766
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,880
 You get it.

767
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:03,120
 And he, to my horror, he didn't get, was not joking and continued on that conversation.

768
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:08,840
 And I felt very strongly that something that was purchased in America should have freedom

769
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,840
 units.

770
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,840
 Okay.

771
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,840
 Shouldn't be in metric.

772
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,840
 Your first mistake was Home Depot.

773
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,600
 I mean, we, we got, we got a boycott that fucking place.

774
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,600
 Sorry.

775
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,600
 Uh, scooping over girls.

776
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,600
 Right.

777
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
 It's George straight.

778
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,600
 Not Toby Keith.

779
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,600
 I got, I got George.

780
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,600
 He's dead a lot longer.

781
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
 Either way.

782
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,600
 I just speak English.

783
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,600
 You know what I mean?

784
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,600
 That's all we're saying.

785
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,600
 I'm going to get the artists wrong.

786
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,600
 Speak English.

787
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,600
 Don't use metric.

788
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,600
 Yeah.

789
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,600
 It was metric.

790
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,600
 By the way, it was 10 millimeter.

791
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,600
 This is what I mean.

792
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,600
 This is what I mean is like, okay, we have known that we've had, you know, an undercurrent

793
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,600
 of racism as part of our culture in this country for a very long time.

794
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,600
 No, this is the problem.

795
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:45,600
 We thought it was only an undercurrent, but now it's becoming an overcurrent.

796
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:52,600
 And the fact that like this person literally is spending their emotions being upset about

797
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,280
 metric units for metric, dude, it's metric.

798
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,600
 You have things in this store that are metric.

799
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,080
 Like it's just, there's ways to build stuff.

800
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,080
 Yes.

801
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,080
 Fuck Home Depot.

802
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,080
 They're the option.

803
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,080
 Correct me.

804
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,080
 I right.

805
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:12,160
 Correct me if I'm wrong, but from the jump feet as a measurement started as being measured

806
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,720
 by the Royals foot length.

807
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,880
 So if you're sticking to feet, I thought it was a Roman thing.

808
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,000
 No, it was the length of the length of the King's foot.

809
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,760
 So you're telling me that you're down a mile is something like a Roman thing.

810
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,420
 I think, I don't know.

811
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:35,160
 But I know with feet it was, and it changed from King to King.

812
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,100
 So you're just telling me your measurement system is so fucking crazy and it all depends

813
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,840
 on one dude's fucking feet.

814
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,680
 So you're going to just bow down and kiss the foot.

815
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,680
 That's what you're telling me.

816
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:49,120
 You're literally in the chat is telling me that a mile is not the length of a King's

817
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,120
 foot.

818
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,120
 So sorry.

819
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,400
 Sorry, Rich scoop for clearing that up.

820
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,800
 Well, I mean enough inbreeding.

821
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,880
 You never know what you're going to get.

822
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,880
 Oh, I forgot.

823
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,880
 That's true.

824
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,880
 I forgot my crown.

825
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,880
 Let me turn around.

826
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,880
 No.

827
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:13,320
 Sideshow Bob to the extreme anti-royal anti-fascist metric system is actually the way to go.

828
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,720
 That's what I'm saying.

829
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,720
 Absolutely.

830
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,720
 Yeah, absolutely.

831
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,160
 It comes down to more democratic to use the metric.

832
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,160
 It's far more democratic.

833
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:28,880
 Paul and I saw Kurt Brownler do a bit of the standup about the way to convince Americans

834
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,880
 like the metrics, the mores by start submitting our dick length in centimeters.

835
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,880
 Yes.

836
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,840
 Everyone's going to feel like a lot better.

837
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:43,360
 Do you want a three inch dick or do you want an 18 centimeter cock as the bit is really

838
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,360
 good.

839
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:52,400
 I'll tell you who else wants an 18 centimeter cock and that's the following sponsor.

840
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,460
 I'm sure that math is completely wrong.

841
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:59,160
 Don't convert Paul's math on that.

842
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,080
 Today's show is brought to you by Gregorius Griffin's Gardening Gadzookeries.

843
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,080
 That's right.

844
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,200
 That's from Danny Olwein in 2021.

845
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,040
 Gregorius Griffin's Gardening Gadzookeries.

846
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,800
 Hey everyone, it's me, Gregorius Griffin.

847
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,160
 Are you here for gardening?

848
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,720
 Well, Gadzooks, I've got the gear.

849
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,720
 You go ahead and grab a garden weasel and get to scrubbing.

850
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,720
 Scrub out all them weeds.

851
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,720
 Scrub them with your hands and your fists, twist it and pull it.

852
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:32,840
 The gardening Gadzookeries will clear up and open ways and pathways for the seeds to take

853
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,840
 root.

854
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,840
 Don't you know?

855
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:39,040
 Make sure that they're planted in rows, rows of where it's at and make sure you measure

856
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,400
 it with the metric system.

857
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,560
 You don't want feet of crops.

858
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,000
 You want metrics of crops.

859
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,120
 Think about it.

860
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:54,960
 Do you want a foot of cabbage or a meter of cabbage?

861
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,000
 Get right.

862
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,600
 Make your crops more meter-y.

863
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,240
 Enter Hayes Group's checkout.

864
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,560
 Jonas, did you ever finish your documentary?

865
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,320
 Did you ever finish the doc that you were shooting?

866
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,320
 No, I didn't.

867
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:14,160
 I wound up making a short doc on it.

868
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,520
 But that's funny because the sideshow troupe is the Bindlesip Family Circus in New York

869
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,520
 City.

870
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,900
 If anybody out there in New York probably knows who those guys are.

871
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:28,960
 And they actually hired me like 20 years later to do a gig for them.

872
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,720
 Oh, funny.

873
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,880
 After I left Cirque du Soleil, which I performed in Zumanity for 10 years, I've been freelancing

874
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,200
 since about 2019.

875
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,920
 And nobody was like, hey, where's that doc, buddy?

876
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,400
 Where's that film?

877
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,000
 They did ask for the footage though.

878
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,080
 And I was like, you know what, I'm not going to make this into a film but so you guys please

879
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,280
 have this for your archive.

880
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,120
 So they copied all the raw footage and everything.

881
00:38:54,120 --> 00:39:01,320
 And back when we were shooting on tape, yeah, back in the day.

882
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,440
 Was your gig for the Sultan one of the craziest gigs you've ever done?

883
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,720
 Yes.

884
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,680
 So I was on that gig with Daniel Sear and one other performer, a woman by the name of

885
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:20,880
 Valerie and it was in Oman and we were treated like royalty from the get like, I literally

886
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:28,280
 if I wanted to like a legit massage, like anytime of the day, I could have one.

887
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:33,240
 I literally did two back to back 90 minute massages on the Sultan of Oman's dimes.

888
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,800
 Well, they got a lot of oil out there for the massages.

889
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,800
 That's the whole thing.

890
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,800
 Yes.

891
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,800
 That's it.

892
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,800
 It's all oil.

893
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,560
 You were like Kobe beef by the time you went out there.

894
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,560
 Marbled.

895
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,480
 So it was the randomest thing.

896
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:53,280
 It was for a Toyota dealership opening, which I guess Toyota trucks are like big in the

897
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,280
 Middle East.

898
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,280
 Okay.

899
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,280
 They love trucks.

900
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,280
 I'm just random.

901
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,000
 But anyways, we're like, okay, we're opening this dealership and they hired Sear Wheels.

902
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,720
 And and about an hour before the show, this massive sandstorm kicked up.

903
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,960
 And like, like biblical sandstorm.

904
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,680
 Oh, no.

905
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:20,280
 And so we were on stage in these white flowy outfits that were basically giant sails.

906
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,720
 While you're in your Sear Wheel?

907
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:27,760
 While we're in the Sear Wheel, getting blown around.

908
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,000
 That's exactly what you didn't really have to do any effort to move.

909
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,920
 You just kind of go with the wind that made it much easier, much easier.

910
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,560
 We were getting blown in one direction, like off the stage and Sear literally got blown

911
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,560
 off the stage.

912
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,560
 Oh my God.

913
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,560
 Yeah.

914
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,560
 Were they okay?

915
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,560
 What happened?

916
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,560
 Not happy.

917
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,560
 They're still they're still rolling.

918
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,560
 It's terrible.

919
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,280
 It's the worst thing that can happen to a Sear Wheel artist.

920
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,600
 That's how Daniels will disappear.

921
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,200
 He just kind of like rolled away.

922
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,200
 Yeah.

923
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,200
 But yeah.

924
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,880
 So like we get blown one way and then like I'm doing actually two people in one in one

925
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,660
 wheel with his woman, Valerie, and we're spinning together and getting blown like towards as

926
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:13,760
 if we're getting blown off stage and we had to like find a way to maneuver ourselves to

927
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,760
 get back towards the center.

928
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,000
 And you had more than eight feet to work with at that point still.

929
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,200
 Goodness sakes.

930
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:25,320
 Yeah, there's at least nine feet on that.

931
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,320
 Wow.

932
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,320
 That is that's bananas.

933
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:32,880
 Yeah, that was a wild one.

934
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,160
 We're staying there in the sandstorm to watch the performance.

935
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,160
 Yeah.

936
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:51,520
 But I didn't see them really cannot see the audience there.

937
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,200
 I was assured later that they very much enjoyed the full sand out.

938
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,840
 Now what's it like with the sand underneath?

939
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,240
 I mean, that's also a slippery kind of thing, right?

940
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,240
 Was that even?

941
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,240
 Yeah.

942
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,240
 I mean, it was not it was not good.

943
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:12,360
 It wasn't quite scoops level conditions, sand, more grit than old tomato hunks.

944
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,360
 Okay.

945
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,560
 Sandstorm was not quite as bad as Scoop Fest, it was close.

946
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,220
 Did they did they did the sound affect the performance too?

947
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:29,000
 Because I know when those things comes in, it's all did it did it did it did it did it.

948
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 You can't hear anything.

949
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 Yeah.

950
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,440
 It's been a long way to make that joke than I expected.

951
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,440
 Thank you.

952
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,440
 Thank you.

953
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,000
 I'm I'm I'm nothing if not patient song and then just like stop it.

954
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,160
 That's how the town knows it's kind of an air horn.

955
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,880
 Yeah, you're just walking around all seizure.

956
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,480
 What?

957
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,520
 Oh, no.

958
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,600
 Oh, no.

959
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,600
 I'm gonna get inside.

960
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,600
 Oh, shit.

961
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,600
 Was that it?

962
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,600
 Oh, yeah.

963
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,600
 That's definitely coming.

964
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,600
 That song gets me pumped.

965
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,600
 It's a great song.

966
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,600
 It's a great song.

967
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,600
 You know, pumped up to hide from sandstorms.

968
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,600
 We should write some lyrics to it.

969
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,000
 I don't think I could do that.

970
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,520
 I don't think I could do that.

971
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,520
 Those are the lyrics.

972
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,440
 I guess.

973
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:25,400
 That's it.

974
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,240
 Sandstorm.

975
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:34,480
 Yeah, sandstorm.

976
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:41,780
 Yeah, it's been just been some crazy wheel gigs.

977
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:47,440
 You know, I toured with the Dresden Dolls and you know that that band from the 2000s.

978
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,440
 Yeah.

979
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:57,600
 So cabaret, punk, duo and I performed on a US tour with them.

980
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:05,040
 So I had to clear out entire like rock venues like the floor of the rock venue, the pit

981
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:10,520
 area and then I would do Sear Wheel in rock venues and stuff like that.

982
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,520
 That's always fun to do.

983
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:17,200
 I love rock clubs and performed at the Roundhouse in London with them and cleared out the pit

984
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,880
 and did Sear Wheel in there.

985
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,880
 That was fun.

986
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,760
 So this is really taking you literally all over the world.

987
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,760
 Yes.

988
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,760
 Yes.

989
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,760
 I have five continents.

990
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,760
 That's so cool.

991
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,760
 I performed five continents.

992
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,760
 Yeah.

993
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,760
 Which one?

994
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,760
 Which tour are you missing?

995
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,760
 Australia.

996
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,760
 Australia.

997
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,480
 That seems like an easy one to get.

998
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,320
 You should be able to get one of those.

999
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,320
 Yeah.

1000
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,320
 No, I love I love Australia.

1001
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:43,040
 I was honestly before I before Cirque hired me to move to Vegas, I was going to move to

1002
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:49,280
 Australia and just overstay my visa and marry an Australian.

1003
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,280
 Just do that.

1004
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,280
 No problem.

1005
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,840
 Yeah, that's just you know, that's what you do, right?

1006
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,080
 When you're a vagabond circus corny.

1007
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,080
 Yeah.

1008
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,080
 Yeah.

1009
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,080
 Yeah.

1010
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:05,580
 And then and then I say also France, even though it's not a continent, France, the theaters

1011
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:10,440
 in France always had like lovely cheeses, like really stinky French cheeses laid out

1012
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:16,560
 on every board of stinky French cheese and in France.

1013
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:23,600
 I think I think I not only spent all my per diem, I may have spent most of my salary on

1014
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,600
 food in France.

1015
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,600
 That's fair.

1016
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,600
 That's pretty fair.

1017
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,600
 That's fair.

1018
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,960
 The food is better over there.

1019
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:30,960
 I hear good things.

1020
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:37,120
 Theater RE in France.

1021
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,000
 That's why Matt will not perform at those theaters.

1022
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,760
 Is that the best kind of pre sear wheel move to cheese up?

1023
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,760
 Is it?

1024
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,760
 Does that help you?

1025
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,760
 Oh, yeah.

1026
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:51,240
 You don't want to you don't want to be flowing free while you're spinning around that sear

1027
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,240
 wheel ball.

1028
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,480
 You want to you want to clog that shit up.

1029
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,480
 I guess that's true.

1030
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,840
 You want to be bound up like a cat in a cage before you hit that wheel.

1031
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:02,080
 One thing the fun thing to do is to chug a bunch of water.

1032
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,080
 Oh shit.

1033
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:07,720
 And then do a coin spin and then just feel the water sloshing around in a circle in your

1034
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:11,680
 mind.

1035
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:15,040
 I honestly thought for a second you were going to tell me you pissed while you did it.

1036
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,320
 That would have been wild.

1037
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,380
 Like some kind of avant-garde design that you make on like a canvas.

1038
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,440
 Do a sear wheel on a camera.

1039
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,600
 Have you done it with paint?

1040
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:27,880
 Have you made like sear wheel art yet on a giant paint?

1041
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,200
 Let's skip over the urine.

1042
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,200
 But let's go back.

1043
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,200
 Let's think about paint.

1044
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,440
 We could we could use the wheel on a giant canvas.

1045
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,440
 I don't know.

1046
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,960
 I don't know why Paul is naysaying my art here.

1047
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,600
 I have I have tried with with paint on the wheel.

1048
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,600
 It's a little bit slippery.

1049
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,600
 So you can't really do very much.

1050
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,800
 You can create patterns of that.

1051
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:51,160
 I've also drank a glass of wine while spinning in the wheel holding the wine at the same

1052
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,160
 time.

1053
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,160
 Wow.

1054
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,160
 The wine glass.

1055
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,680
 You kind of have to tilt it ups because you know the the the G force is taking it out.

1056
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,680
 Right.

1057
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,080
 So you can tilt the glass and drink it like that.

1058
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,080
 That's funny.

1059
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,640
 You can drink a beer to you know what you're spinning as well.

1060
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,920
 Since you've worked with sear himself, does he have like pet peeves?

1061
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,920
 Has he seen people do stuff with the wheel that he considers an abomination or anything

1062
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,920
 like that?

1063
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,920
 Oh no.

1064
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,280
 He's actually really just impressed and you know sear is very impressed with the way the

1065
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:27,520
 discipline has been expanded upon and just completely taken to really wild wild lengths

1066
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:32,920
 doing things that we never could have imagined when we were first starting the discipline.

1067
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:37,400
 There's some things that that the kids do nowadays and I'm like, yeah, that won't work

1068
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,200
 on a scoop stage.

1069
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,520
 Does he have the market corner?

1070
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,200
 Does he have some merchandise yet?

1071
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,720
 He needs some merch, right?

1072
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:53,600
 Does he not have a searing is believing t-shirt yet because that's no you've got to have it.

1073
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,600
 I know.

1074
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,600
 I know.

1075
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,200
 He's he's he's kind of like been in the shadows.

1076
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:03,280
 He kind of like made this thing made his just circus discipline and then like just drop

1077
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,280
 did a couple.

1078
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:08,000
 Yeah, he kind of did the show that I was working on.

1079
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 He did a couple.

1080
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,600
 I did a Cirque show as well.

1081
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,600
 Corteo.

1082
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,240
 He designed that act and then he kind of just like was like like like Homer Simpson into

1083
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:22,000
 the like my work here is done.

1084
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,640
 I have accomplished all that I need to.

1085
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,640
 Yeah.

1086
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:33,360
 Yeah, he was he was a wonderful, wonderful mentor and this is what a what a right place,

1087
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,360
 right time.

1088
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:38,480
 You know, honestly, like I just it's just when you hit it just reminds me like to whenever

1089
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:43,600
 I'm kind of need to make a choice on what I want to do on something, a creative project,

1090
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,600
 whatever.

1091
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,800
 I'm just like, what is the what is the best possible scenario?

1092
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:53,520
 What what what what's the thing when I have a vision or an inspiration hit me, I really

1093
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:58,240
 got to follow it to its to its conclusion, because you never know what can come from

1094
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,240
 that.

1095
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:06,160
 You know, literally, I have had a 22 year circus career based on one scene, clowns in

1096
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:13,400
 Cirque du Soleil, Dralion, a clown troupe called Les Voila that inspired me was like,

1097
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,560
 oh, God, clowning.

1098
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,560
 That's it.

1099
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,560
 Yeah, of course.

1100
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,560
 I love Charlie Chaplin.

1101
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,560
 I love Buster Keaton.

1102
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,720
 Like, I'm going to I'm going to be a clown.

1103
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:25,440
 And then the second sort of lightning flash was seeing Daniel Cyr perform and being like

1104
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,440
 that.

1105
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,440
 Cyr wheel.

1106
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,440
 Yep.

1107
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,440
 That's it.

1108
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,440
 Amazing.

1109
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,780
 Like, really, to just hone in on my intuitive sense of like, what's going to inspire me?

1110
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:39,840
 What's going to what's going to make me what's going to fulfill my soul?

1111
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:44,440
 You know, like what's going to what's what's the thing that's going to make me passionate

1112
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:50,200
 to get out of bed in the morning and and or not sleep and travel, you know, halfway across

1113
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,160
 the world and do a show.

1114
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,720
 John McEnroe and John McEnroe is the answer to that question.

1115
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,720
 Why?

1116
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:04,280
 I got a friend that I can I got a friend in mime, no relation, Lauren Saw and Lauren got

1117
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,880
 to work with Marceau before he passed.

1118
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:12,280
 And like, I feel like you've got kind of a similar thing here now that you are a direct

1119
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:16,560
 line from Cyr into this unique art form.

1120
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,160
 So have you already been approached by people?

1121
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,160
 Are you?

1122
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,980
 Are you an instructor at this point in that way?

1123
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:29,440
 Are you are you leaning into that kind of bearing of the torch for this art form now?

1124
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:34,720
 I definitely can instruct to do private lessons for people who want to.

1125
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,560
 I'm really more into the creation side of it.

1126
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:43,560
 I've realized that I'm not really teaching for me is is it's cool, but I much rather

1127
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:49,040
 make a one man show, you know, a character based one man show that that's where I like

1128
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,360
 my I find my passion.

1129
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:54,960
 I mean, I am going to have you teach my children just so that just to save me on college money.

1130
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,720
 Just really at this point, it's as good an option as anything.

1131
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,720
 It really is.

1132
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,720
 No, for real.

1133
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,520
 Like that's the thing is like you like and you can go to circus college in Montreal.

1134
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:11,180
 They have the Ecole Nationale de Cirque, which is a it's a university.

1135
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,360
 It's in Montreal.

1136
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:18,120
 And if they are passionate about circus, kids who are 18 can audition.

1137
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,720
 Well, I think one who's not passionate about anything, so I feel like I am going to be

1138
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:25,560
 sending him to that school.

1139
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,240
 Just because I find find a passion there.

1140
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,240
 Yeah, for sure.

1141
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,600
 Like it's such an amazing program.

1142
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:35,240
 I actually funny thing I auditioned for the National Circus School of Montreal the same

1143
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:39,920
 week I auditioned for Cirque-L-Oise, so I had two intense days of auditioning for the

1144
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:45,060
 National Circus School of Montreal back in 2003.

1145
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:50,560
 And then also, I had three intense days that turned into four because I got a callback

1146
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,560
 for Cirque-L-Oise.

1147
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,080
 You grew up in New York, right?

1148
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,480
 Yeah, originally in New York City.

1149
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,280
 Was anyone in the circus starts or anything like that when you were growing up?

1150
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,680
 No, we had we had Ringling Brothers, Barman Bailey Circus every year, which I would go

1151
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:08,280
 see at Madison Square Garden.

1152
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,720
 And we had the Big Apple Circus.

1153
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,720
 Yeah.

1154
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,720
 All right.

1155
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:15,100
 But all these circus performers were like of circus families, right?

1156
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:21,240
 So everybody was they had generations of circus knowledge.

1157
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:24,080
 Our friend Brian is ringmastering the Big Apple Circus right now.

1158
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,080
 That's right.

1159
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,080
 Brian Alters.

1160
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,080
 Brian Alters.

1161
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,080
 It's so cool.

1162
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,080
 I just saw that.

1163
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,080
 That's amazing.

1164
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,080
 Yeah.

1165
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,080
 So happy for him.

1166
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:38,120
 And so I figured out I didn't figure out that circus could be a possible thing that I could

1167
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,120
 do.

1168
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:43,600
 So I was twenty five and I was like, oh, there's a clown program.

1169
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,600
 That's amazing.

1170
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,240
 Like, let me let me audition for that.

1171
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,360
 And I think that's the whole movement of New Circus, right?

1172
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:55,480
 And Cirque du Soleil is like you can have diverse you come from diverse backgrounds.

1173
00:52:55,480 --> 00:53:00,400
 So a lot of the house troupe comes from gymnastics, right?

1174
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,280
 You can have a soloist that comes from the dance world that then trained in circus.

1175
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:10,120
 Like it's it's actually to your benefit to have an to have a new family history.

1176
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,320
 Contrary to popular belief.

1177
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,320
 Yeah.

1178
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,320
 Yeah.

1179
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:19,640
 No, it's like it's a it's a whole new world where you can train yourself in a year or

1180
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:24,360
 two or maybe more, depending and really get to a high level of circus.

1181
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:29,600
 There is there is a whole new breed of circus artists out right now that are doing what

1182
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,600
 what he's talking about.

1183
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,520
 I mean, this is a brand new thing.

1184
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,520
 It's really great.

1185
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,520
 I mean, social media has done that.

1186
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,880
 It's like it has to the magic world, right?

1187
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,480
 It's the reason why magicians are finally a more diverse group of people.

1188
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:46,400
 We're not like going like what a woman doing a magic trick is still say that, come on.

1189
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:53,760
 But yeah, yeah, that's one of the one of the many positive aspects of the Internet is one

1190
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,000
 of the three positive aspects.

1191
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,360
 More people are getting into circus.

1192
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:05,080
 It's pretty cool, well, Jonas, we'll send people to theater dot Vegas, theater re dot

1193
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:08,960
 Vegas or the at least inside of it, you can go see them in L.A.

1194
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,760
 What do people follow you in general because you travel obviously travel over the world

1195
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:13,760
 reform over the world.

1196
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,760
 What do people follow you in general?

1197
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,680
 Yeah, you can follow me on Instagram.

1198
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:22,720
 That's usually where I put all my shenanigans at zoo punk, Cirque.

1199
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:28,320
 So it's spelled Z, you punk, P, U, N, K, Cirque, C, I, R, Q, U, E.

1200
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,320
 OK.

1201
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,320
 We'll put it in chat for anybody.

1202
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,960
 Yeah, we'll put it in the bio of the episode as well.

1203
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:34,960
 Perfect.

1204
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:35,960
 Yeah.

1205
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:41,040
 That's Instagram is usually where you can find out information about Mac and Fro Show.

1206
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,240
 I'm also in puppetry of the penis.

1207
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,240
 We didn't even get to that.

1208
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,240
 Right.

1209
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,240
 Oh, right.

1210
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,240
 Yeah.

1211
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,240
 Sure.

1212
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,240
 That has its own.

1213
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,240
 There's literally a trick in puppetry of the penis.

1214
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,240
 That's an ice cream cone.

1215
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,240
 Ice cream.

1216
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,240
 Next scoop fest.

1217
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,240
 We are.

1218
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,120
 I mean, we know we know a lot of puppetry of the penis, people.

1219
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:02,000
 Like, I'm buddies with Jamie and well, you know, Jamie, of course, too.

1220
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,360
 And you know, you know, he hired me.

1221
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,360
 Yeah.

1222
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,360
 Well, you know, tons of puppetry.

1223
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:09,280
 We had the original guys that came out here, Barry and, oh, Barry and Rich.

1224
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,280
 Barry and Rich.

1225
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,280
 Yes.

1226
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,280
 They did our first scoop fest.

1227
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,280
 Yep.

1228
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,640
 And it was really funny because there was 200 people laughing, applauding and one person

1229
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,320
 who just turned and looked at a wall during the performance.

1230
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,320
 It was awesome.

1231
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,320
 It was amazing.

1232
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,320
 Yeah, they couldn't.

1233
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:27,080
 It was a fascinating wall in my defense.

1234
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,520
 That paint was nearly dry.

1235
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:31,040
 I got to watch that paint just completely dry.

1236
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,040
 It was amazing.

1237
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:35,000
 I still remember because, you know, scoop fest, we just say like, hey, if you want to

1238
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
 do a slot, do whatever.

1239
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
 We just want you to do it.

1240
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,160
 You just tell us what you want to do.

1241
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,600
 And so they said yes to doing it.

1242
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,960
 And then I never clarified what they were going to do.

1243
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:48,240
 And so before the show, I was like, I don't know what you guys want to do, if you guys

1244
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:52,200
 feel comfortable, where you're at or like how much longer of a slot do you want, blah,

1245
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,200
 blah, blah.

1246
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,200
 They go, oh, we're whipping our dicks out.

1247
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,240
 I go, okay, okay.

1248
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,240
 Okay.

1249
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,920
 And that was the full conversation.

1250
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:00,920
 That was it.

1251
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:01,920
 Okay.

1252
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:07,320
 The most important question of today is how much space did they need to whip their dicks?

1253
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:10,760
 16 by 16 foot stage.

1254
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,560
 Yeah.

1255
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,680
 Get us on the horn, folks.

1256
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:17,320
 They had so much room for activities.

1257
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,320
 Metric.

1258
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,320
 Metric 16 by 16.

1259
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,320
 16 meter.

1260
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:26,600
 For all you listeners out there that can't see this podcast, I'm making the hamburger

1261
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:27,600
 right now.

1262
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:34,200
 I like that you're like, you saw I must do the clown.

1263
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,200
 You saw the cereal.

1264
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,200
 I must do the cereal.

1265
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,200
 You saw the hamburger.

1266
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,000
 You're like, I must make shapes of my penis.

1267
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
 I must.

1268
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,400
 I must do it.

1269
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,920
 I was already doing it, right?

1270
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:45,920
 Right.

1271
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:46,920
 I get paid?

1272
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:47,920
 Sure.

1273
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:52,480
 It's like every man's dream, you get paid.

1274
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,160
 How often do you do that show?

1275
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,480
 That's Thursday through Sunday in Vegas at the Erotic Heritage Museum.

1276
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,480
 Okay.

1277
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,000
 Eight o'clock show, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

1278
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:11,560
 And then I'm also at the Wizard of Oz doing this really cool immersive experience after

1279
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,760
 the movie at the Spear.

1280
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,160
 I like right now there's some listeners who are like, yeah, whatever, I'm just going to

1281
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,160
 go see him play with his dick.

1282
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:23,160
 Wizard of Oz, sure, but I'm going to go to the dick thing, I think.

1283
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:31,240
 I mean, it's the last one of its kind, it's holding on as we're celebrating 10 years of

1284
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,240
 puppetry of the penis in Vegas.

1285
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:38,120
 Oh, I thought you were talking about the Wizard of Oz at the Spear.

1286
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:44,120
 Although I do have to make a couple of jokes in puppetry about Wizard of Oz, I'm like,

1287
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:50,440
 you know, you had all these choices in entertainment and you decided to come to, you know, you

1288
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:55,680
 could have went to the Wizard of Oz at the Spear and dick it, but you chose this.

1289
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,680
 That's it.

1290
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:57,680
 That is it.

1291
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:01,960
 A different kind of flying monkey, that's all.

1292
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:02,960
 Choose your flying monkey.

1293
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:08,840
 Oh, you got to come up with a new cock and balls trick called the flying monkey in honor

1294
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,240
 of the Wizard of Oz.

1295
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:16,120
 Oh, we got Halloween coming up, I'm trying to like this week, figure out what the best

1296
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,120
 trick would be.

1297
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,480
 Well, yeah, you guys do the bat wing, right?

1298
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,320
 We could do bat wing.

1299
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:25,080
 Yeah, I want to maybe the vampire, like I've got these teeth, these glow in the dark.

1300
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,080
 Oh, there you go.

1301
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:30,400
 I'm trying to, I'm trying to work that into the show for the Halloween for on Friday.

1302
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:38,320
 The dick that sucks itself, the vampire.

1303
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,320
 You can have it.

1304
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,320
 Take it.

1305
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,320
 Take it.

1306
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,320
 I want that show to run forever.

1307
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,320
 I have news for you.

1308
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,320
 Paul's not going to do it.

1309
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,320
 I'm not.

1310
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,320
 You wanted to open for cock.

1311
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,320
 You could.

1312
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,320
 Yeah.

1313
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,320
 Some one of these that had to develop some kind of a stand up bit.

1314
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:50,320
 Yeah.

1315
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,320
 Something I could just do the hamburger later on.

1316
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,320
 I can only do the slider.

1317
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,320
 I need to go back to my ventriloquist days.

1318
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,320
 I need to get a ventriloquist bit worked up.

1319
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,320
 That's what I need to do.

1320
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,320
 And how do you do that?

1321
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,320
 I'm going to do the slide.

1322
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,320
 I'm going to do the slide.

1323
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,320
 I'm going to do the slide.

1324
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,320
 I'm going to do the slide.

1325
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,320
 I'm going to do the slide.

1326
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,320
 I'm going to do the slide.

1327
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:09,320
 I'm going to do the slide.

1328
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,320
 I'm going to do the slide.

1329
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,320
 I need to go back to my ventriloquist days.

1330
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,320
 I need to get a ventriloquist bit worked up.

1331
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,320
 That's what I need to do.

1332
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,320
 And honey, I need to move back to Vegas.

1333
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,320
 Important work.

1334
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,320
 Yeah.

1335
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,320
 Really got to go.

1336
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,320
 And yeah, I know we just repainted the house and we're loving our life out here.

1337
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:22,320
 Time for me to go play with my dick.

1338
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:25,320
 You'll support me, right?

1339
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:28,320
 As long as I don't have to anymore.

1340
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,320
 Okay.

1341
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,320
 Great.

1342
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,320
 Great.

1343
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,320
 Okay.

1344
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,320
 Somebody said the Marilyn Manson trick.

1345
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,320
 Oh, I don't know.

1346
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,320
 Is that for a dick trick?

1347
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:36,320
 Is that just sucking your own dick?

1348
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,320
 Oh, that's the whole, you cut your ribs out.

1349
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:38,320
 That, that whole.

1350
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:39,320
 Right.

1351
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,320
 I think David Gahan from Peshmo do that too.

1352
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,320
 Urban Legend.

1353
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,320
 Yeah.

1354
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,320
 Urban Legend.

1355
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,320
 Yeah.

1356
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,320
 Well, Jonas, we're about to descend into a bunch of Halloween bits, so you're welcome

1357
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:48,320
 to run away at this point if you want to go, go, go live your life.

1358
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:53,320
 I'll stick around in it because I'm going to practice my, you know, I'm going to be

1359
00:59:53,320 --> 01:00:01,320
 my vampire trick.

1360
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,320
 Oh, good.

1361
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:03,320
 Good.

1362
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,320
 Good.

1363
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:10,320
 I'll tell you who else is going to practice their new vampire dick and balls trick while

1364
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:11,320
 we wait.

1365
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,320
 And that's the following sponsor.

1366
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,320
 Oh my.

1367
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:17,320
 Today's show, Men, Men as Ice Cream and Soul Show, is brought to you by Black Hole Baby

1368
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:20,320
 Diapers from Teddy Officer Scoop, also in 2021.

1369
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,320
 That's Black Hole Baby Diapers.

1370
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,320
 Hello.

1371
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,320
 It's me, Carl Sagan.

1372
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:32,320
 I'm here from beyond the grave to tell you about the billions and billions of infants

1373
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,320
 shitting and pissing themselves throughout the nation.

1374
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:39,320
 It's a high time that you buy them the proper undergarments.

1375
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:42,320
 What I have is Black Hole Diapers.

1376
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:47,320
 What these will do is, of course, open a rift in space time that we're not really certain

1377
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:49,320
 what's on the other side of it.

1378
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:55,320
 But we do know that the piss and shit of the children will get instantly sucked into it,

1379
01:00:55,320 --> 01:01:01,320
 spaghettified into the tiniest, smallest form that it can be and thrown into some alternate

1380
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:04,320
 dimension or whatever.

1381
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,320
 Again, it's all theoretical.

1382
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:09,320
 We don't know what lies on the other side.

1383
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:15,320
 However, we can, with some assurance, state that on the other side of our Black Hole Diapers,

1384
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:18,320
 there's a great quantity of piss and shit.

1385
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:23,320
 Go ahead and buy these Black Hole Diapers for your children.

1386
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:27,320
 Make sure that they don't sit directly on the hole.

1387
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:28,320
 That's the trick.

1388
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:32,320
 You don't want to spaghettify your babies, or maybe some of you do.

1389
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,320
 I don't know.

1390
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:37,320
 This demon-haunted world is enveloping all of us.

1391
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:41,320
 Why not let it envelop your piss and shit from your children?

1392
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:46,320
 Do the environmentally sound thing and send all the piss and shit from your babies into

1393
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,320
 the nether regions of time and space.

1394
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:53,320
 That's Black Hole Diapers from Carl Sagan.

1395
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:57,320
 Enter Hey Scoops at checkout.

1396
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,320
 Well, let's see.

1397
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:02,320
 Oh, my Uber Eats is here.

1398
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,320
 Hold on.

1399
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,320
 I just have to go get my Uber Eats here.

1400
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,320
 Oh, my Uber Eats driver.

1401
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,320
 It's vampire Bill Cosby.

1402
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,320
 What do you know?

1403
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,320
 What do you say?

1404
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,320
 How you doing?

1405
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:12,320
 Hey, hey, hey.

1406
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,320
 It's Bill Cosby.

1407
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:18,320
 I'm here to give you what you ordered from the store and some things.

1408
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,320
 Oh, thanks.

1409
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,320
 Some sundries.

1410
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,320
 There you go.

1411
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,320
 Have what you need.

1412
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,320
 Theo is dead.

1413
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,320
 Boo.

1414
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,320
 He's a ghost this year.

1415
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:26,320
 Yeah, that's right.

1416
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,320
 He came with me.

1417
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,320
 He's right here.

1418
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:31,320
 This is my son, Theo, who's a ghost now.

1419
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,320
 He couldn't scare the fuck out of you.

1420
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,320
 That's what he does.

1421
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,320
 He's scaring you.

1422
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:39,320
 Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.

1423
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,320
 Was he scared?

1424
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:41,320
 Yes.

1425
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,320
 Well, you should be.

1426
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,320
 Good.

1427
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:48,320
 This is my ghost son who died in the ocean trying to save his baby, but he did, and he

1428
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:49,320
 did.

1429
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:50,320
 Oh, boy.

1430
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,320
 It's too bad.

1431
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,320
 It's a terrible thing.

1432
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,320
 Well, thanks for coming by.

1433
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:55,320
 Thanks for bringing my groceries here.

1434
01:02:55,320 --> 01:03:00,020
 You know, I'm never going to miss a chance to come and hang out during the holiday.

1435
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:01,320
 This is my favorite holiday.

1436
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,320
 It's on the holiday.

1437
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,320
 I get released.

1438
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,320
 It's not true.

1439
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,320
 I'm free now.

1440
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,320
 I can do whatever I want.

1441
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:08,320
 That's right.

1442
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:11,320
 No jail can hold the cause.

1443
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:14,320
 Oh, vampire Bill Cosby.

1444
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:15,320
 I'm so sorry.

1445
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:17,320
 I have to answer the story here.

1446
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:19,320
 I'm going to turn into a bat then.

1447
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,320
 Poof.

1448
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,320
 Goodbye.

1449
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:22,320
 Flap, flap, flap.

1450
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,320
 I'm gone.

1451
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,320
 Oh, that's too bad.

1452
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:27,320
 He would have really loved to have met our next guest.

1453
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,320
 It's actually Piff the Magic Dragon.

1454
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:30,320
 Piff, come on in.

1455
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,320
 Right.

1456
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,320
 I'm a magician, isn't it?

1457
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:33,320
 Hey, what do you want?

1458
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,320
 We've got some free candy for me, mate.

1459
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:36,320
 Come on in.

1460
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,320
 Where's your grub?

1461
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,320
 Give it over.

1462
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:41,320
 I want some MPay days, right?

1463
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,320
 Here, I'm a dragon.

1464
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,320
 OK, yeah.

1465
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,320
 Here's some candy.

1466
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,320
 Yeah, too, right.

1467
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,320
 I'm going to sit on a hoard of candy.

1468
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:50,320
 Piff, I just want to congratulate you.

1469
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,320
 Your 10-year anniversary is coming up soon.

1470
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,320
 10 years of being a Las Vegas headliner.

1471
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,320
 That's got to feel pretty good, huh, buddy?

1472
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,320
 That's right.

1473
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:59,320
 It's a decade of decades from Mr. Piff the Magic Dragon.

1474
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,320
 What, what, what, what, what?

1475
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:02,320
 I'll be entertaining everybody.

1476
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,320
 Can't nobody hold me down.

1477
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,320
 Hey, look, guess what I'm going to do?

1478
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,320
 I'm going to make all you bitches disappear.

1479
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,320
 Poof, where'd Chris Angel go?

1480
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,320
 Oh, fucking no, do I?

1481
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:12,320
 I'm taking over his spot.

1482
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:13,320
 Yeah.

1483
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,320
 That bitch is off.

1484
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:15,320
 Done.

1485
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,320
 I'm the king.

1486
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,320
 One king.

1487
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,320
 Are you still going to use the wind machines and blow garbage on people?

1488
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:23,320
 I mean, I wouldn't be much of a drag if I didn't blow off people with some fire and stuff.

1489
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,320
 That's kind of what I'd do.

1490
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,320
 That's fair.

1491
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,320
 That is fair.

1492
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,320
 That's right.

1493
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:32,320
 You're going to be touring next year with Penn, doing Piff and Pop.

1494
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:34,320
 You say so.

1495
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,320
 No, I do say so.

1496
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,320
 It's happening.

1497
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,320
 I'm all right.

1498
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:40,320
 I'll take you word out.

1499
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:41,320
 Oh no.

1500
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:42,320
 At least I got top billing, didn't I?

1501
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:43,320
 What?

1502
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,320
 Isn't it?

1503
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:49,320
 It sounds like you need some, maybe some, some legal advice on how to deal with this

1504
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,320
 tour coming up with, with Penn here.

1505
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,320
 I don't know.

1506
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,320
 I don't think so.

1507
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,320
 I think, I think it's all settled.

1508
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:55,320
 I got top billing.

1509
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,320
 That's all I need.

1510
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,320
 Uh-oh, somebody else is here.

1511
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,320
 I better run away.

1512
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,320
 No, no, this is great, Piff.

1513
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:00,320
 What?

1514
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:03,320
 Stick around and chat with, this is our friend, the forgetful goldfish lawyer.

1515
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:08,320
 Maybe, maybe the forgetful goldfish lawyer can help you out a little bit.

1516
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,320
 Uh, what is it you need?

1517
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:15,320
 Uh, uh, Piff wants to make sure that he understands he's protected in this, uh, tour that he's

1518
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:16,320
 coming up with, Ben Gillette.

1519
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,320
 Okay.

1520
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,320
 Let me look into my briefcase here.

1521
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:22,320
 Well, it looks like all I've got in here is Tetraflakes.

1522
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,320
 What were you asking me again?

1523
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:28,320
 Uh, uh, you, you want to, if you want to take Piff the magic dragon as a client.

1524
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,320
 Who's that now?

1525
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:31,320
 He's a magician in Las Vegas.

1526
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,320
 What's your name, sir?

1527
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,320
 Oh, I'm Matt.

1528
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,320
 I'm the co-host of this podcast.

1529
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:37,320
 Okay.

1530
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:40,320
 Uh, let me go ahead and call somebody.

1531
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,320
 Hmm.

1532
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:44,320
 I've forgotten all the phone numbers.

1533
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,320
 Okay.

1534
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:48,320
 Well, okay.

1535
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:49,320
 That's what goldfish do.

1536
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,320
 We just forget.

1537
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,320
 I understand.

1538
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,320
 Uh.

1539
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,320
 What?

1540
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,320
 You, you forgot something?

1541
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,320
 I forgot to breathe for about a minute there.

1542
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,320
 Oh no.

1543
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,320
 Oh gosh.

1544
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,320
 It happens.

1545
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:01,320
 Yeah.

1546
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:02,320
 Yeah.

1547
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,320
 But, uh, you know, we don't, you don't have to make any calls now.

1548
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:05,320
 I just want to know that you're, you know.

1549
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:09,320
 Well, I'll tell you what I don't want is this idiot representing me for anything.

1550
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:10,320
 It's a bullshit.

1551
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,320
 Piff, this is a great, he's a great lawyer, Piff.

1552
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,320
 The fuck he is.

1553
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:17,320
 I'll tell you, the only thing he's got in common with the law, he's got the scales of justice.

1554
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,320
 That's about it.

1555
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,320
 He can fin his way right out of the fuck out of here.

1556
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:22,320
 Go on and swim away, you dumb bitch.

1557
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:23,320
 Isn't it?

1558
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:24,320
 Oh, wow.

1559
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,320
 The lawyer is leaving.

1560
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,320
 That is, that is horrible.

1561
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,320
 He was, he was.

1562
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,320
 It's upsetting.

1563
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,320
 It's just hard to see.

1564
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,320
 He ran into a light post.

1565
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,320
 Oh my goodness.

1566
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,320
 For an idiot he is.

1567
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,320
 I'm going to go chase him.

1568
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:34,320
 I will see you later, Piff.

1569
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:35,320
 Thanks for coming by.

1570
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,320
 Bye, Piff.

1571
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,320
 Happy Halloween.

1572
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,320
 Fuck all of you.

1573
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,320
 Wow.

1574
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:40,320
 Jesus.

1575
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,320
 Fuck.

1576
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,320
 Really, really acerbic over these 10 years.

1577
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:43,320
 That was, that was by far the most, yeah.

1578
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:44,320
 He's changed.

1579
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,320
 It's gone to his head.

1580
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,320
 All that, all that success.

1581
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:59,440
 All that instant ease.

1582
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:00,960
 All that, all that golden princesses.

1583
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:01,960
 It's really gone to his head.

1584
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:02,960
 You know, being a Las Vegas headliner is so easy.

1585
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:03,960
 It's all gone to his head.

1586
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:04,960
 So easy.

1587
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:05,960
 Yep.

1588
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:06,960
 Well, it's been a good week, everybody.

1589
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:11,960
 How did you guys have a good week?

1590
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:16,520
 I had a great week.

1591
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:17,520
 Are you asking me?

1592
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:18,520
 I, sorry.

1593
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,520
 Yes.

1594
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:23,640
 I was asking you and then three notifications somehow popped up on my screen all at the

1595
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:24,640
 same time.

1596
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:31,640
 It really distracted me.

1597
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:34,520
 I got to re-watch Groundhog Day this week.

1598
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:35,520
 Oh yeah.

1599
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:36,520
 Over and over again.

1600
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,520
 Yeah.

1601
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,520
 It was on over and over again.

1602
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:43,400
 And it really struck me how much faster he accepted that the day was happening over and

1603
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:47,080
 over again to him than I believe I would have in that situation.

1604
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:51,920
 Oh, he's just like, second day, he's like, "Oh, I see what's going on."

1605
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:52,920
 He's like, "Oh, I guess this is happening."

1606
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:53,920
 Yeah.

1607
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:54,920
 I've got it.

1608
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:55,920
 He really just kind of took it all in stride pretty well.

1609
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,920
 I watched, on the plane, I watched Sinners.

1610
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:58,920
 Oh yeah.

1611
01:07:58,920 --> 01:07:59,920
 How was that?

1612
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:00,920
 Michael B. Jordan.

1613
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:01,920
 Love it.

1614
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:05,400
 It's a vampire movie, but I don't know if you, I don't think anyone wants to talk about

1615
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,400
 this.

1616
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,640
 There's like racial undertones to it.

1617
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:09,640
 Oh boy.

1618
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:10,640
 I just, I was very subtle.

1619
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:11,640
 I picked up on it.

1620
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:12,640
 Interesting.

1621
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:18,640
 You know, I saw some stuff in the trailer that made me think that that might be part

1622
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,360
 of what they were going to talk about, but I, but I couldn't really tell.

1623
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:22,360
 Yeah.

1624
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:23,360
 I saw no seeds until I watched the movie.

1625
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:24,360
 I was like, "Wait a minute."

1626
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:25,360
 It's so good.

1627
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,360
 I fucking loved Sinners.

1628
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:29,400
 It's a great, it's really good.

1629
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,600
 Michael B. Jordan is so good.

1630
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:36,200
 He crushes it, yeah.

1631
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:43,600
 And they really kind of, really try to anchor the whiteness of the vampires.

1632
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,240
 They do it with, specifically with like, kind of like Irish music.

1633
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:48,920
 And I felt like a little, a little, a little attacked then.

1634
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:53,400
 Not, not the white part, but the Irish part, the Irish part.

1635
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:54,400
 As you should.

1636
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,400
 Wait a minute.

1637
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:56,400
 But yeah.

1638
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,400
 Oh, that is, that is terrible.

1639
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,400
 Oh gosh.

1640
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:07,240
 Oh, oh shit, it's B. Arthur's candy cooter corn now with nuts.

1641
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:11,560
 Wait, that's a commercial, not a character.

1642
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:12,560
 I agree.

1643
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:20,960
 These people are sneaking in extra commercials into our social media feed.

1644
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,640
 Picture it, Sicily, 1939.

1645
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:28,120
 My daughter's cooter is overflowing with waxy candy.

1646
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:35,680
 We should say that all of these characters are submitted by our listeners on all of our

1647
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:36,680
 social media channels.

1648
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:41,040
 So these were all put on our Facebook and Instagram posts yesterday.

1649
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:46,560
 So if you're not following us on social media, we do the Halloween episode and the Christmas

1650
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,840
 episode where people stop by.

1651
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:49,840
 That's right.

1652
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:53,040
 And we just pimp Paul all episode.

1653
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,320
 That's right.

1654
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,320
 Who's next?

1655
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:02,480
 Whoa, bring it says Paul Paul's like, whoa, ring the bell, Jacob.

1656
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,960
 I could out of that cooter corn.

1657
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,280
 Holy shit.

1658
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,080
 It's Ding Dong Mitch.

1659
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:11,000
 The guy who doesn't understand how to ding dong ditch.

1660
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,600
 Hey, hello.

1661
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,600
 Hey there.

1662
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,600
 Gotcha.

1663
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,600
 Hi.

1664
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:17,600
 Gotcha.

1665
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:18,600
 Gotcha.

1666
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:19,600
 What do you mean?

1667
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,600
 Gotcha.

1668
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,600
 You answered the door.

1669
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,600
 Boom.

1670
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:27,560
 Yeah, gotcha.

1671
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,060
 Did you ring the doorbell again?

1672
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:30,060
 Might've been me.

1673
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:31,060
 Gotcha.

1674
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,060
 We.

1675
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:33,060
 What?

1676
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:34,060
 What?

1677
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:35,060
 How did you get us?

1678
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:36,060
 Gotcha.

1679
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:37,060
 Most people answer their doorbell.

1680
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:38,060
 Hey, check.

1681
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:39,060
 Check this out.

1682
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:40,060
 What's that?

1683
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:41,060
 Gotcha.

1684
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:43,320
 No, I don't think that's how you get me, buddy.

1685
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,320
 I don't know.

1686
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,320
 We saw you ring it.

1687
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:46,320
 I don't feel gotten.

1688
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,320
 Yeah.

1689
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:48,320
 Do you understand?

1690
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:49,320
 Yeah.

1691
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:50,320
 Yeah.

1692
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,320
 Okay.

1693
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:52,320
 Okay.

1694
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,320
 Because my doorbell works.

1695
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,320
 Is that how you got me?

1696
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,320
 Look, is there somebody at the door?

1697
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:56,320
 Yeah, you.

1698
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:57,320
 Yes.

1699
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:58,320
 Better go.

1700
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,320
 Better go answer the door.

1701
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:00,320
 I am.

1702
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,320
 Hey, check it out.

1703
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:02,320
 Hi.

1704
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,320
 Could be your other door.

1705
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:04,320
 Okay.

1706
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:05,320
 I'll walk to my.

1707
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,320
 Did you check your other door yet?

1708
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,320
 I'll go walk to my back door.

1709
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:08,320
 Gotcha.

1710
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,320
 It was this one.

1711
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:10,320
 It was this door.

1712
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,320
 Hey, hey.

1713
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:23,320
 I hate this guy.

1714
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,320
 Still me.

1715
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,320
 Still me in your door.

1716
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:28,320
 Gotcha.

1717
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,320
 Hmm.

1718
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:30,320
 Gotcha.

1719
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,320
 Ding dong.

1720
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,320
 Mitch.

1721
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,320
 Basically a force of nature over here.

1722
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,320
 Check it.

1723
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:36,320
 All right.

1724
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:37,320
 Thank you.

1725
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:38,320
 There you go.

1726
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,320
 Okay.

1727
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:40,320
 You're.

1728
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:41,320
 One more.

1729
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:42,320
 Gotcha.

1730
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:43,320
 Bye.

1731
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:44,320
 I hate that guy.

1732
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:49,240
 I'll see you in a little bit.

1733
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:52,160
 Mike in chat says he submitted characters on our Truth Social account.

1734
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:53,160
 Are you getting any?

1735
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:54,160
 Are you reading from those, Jacob?

1736
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:55,160
 Are you reading any of those, Jacob?

1737
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,160
 Yeah, yeah.

1738
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,160
 No, I've got our Truth Social account.

1739
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,160
 Okay.

1740
01:11:58,160 --> 01:11:59,160
 Yeah, I definitely.

1741
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:00,160
 Truth Social account.

1742
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:01,160
 I'm definitely reading all of those.

1743
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:02,160
 Yeah.

1744
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:05,440
 Oh, actually from the Truth Social account we have the woke truck driver.

1745
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:06,440
 Here he is.

1746
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:07,440
 There he is.

1747
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,440
 Hey, God damn it.

1748
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:12,040
 Where's your pride flag?

1749
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:13,040
 Fuck you.

1750
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,240
 They just, they break down with the wind and stuff.

1751
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,240
 Oh, yeah.

1752
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:17,240
 Oh, yeah.

1753
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:18,240
 Oh, we got a little sun bleached.

1754
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:19,240
 Oh, I just.

1755
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,240
 I just didn't have time to put it up this year.

1756
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,240
 Well, eat shit.

1757
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,240
 Well, I was gonna.

1758
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:23,240
 I was trying to.

1759
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,240
 Uh, yeah.

1760
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,240
 Sure.

1761
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,240
 Sure.

1762
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:27,240
 But I had to get to my, my, uh, my friends.

1763
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:29,280
 I'm going to my, my friend's daughter's basketball game.

1764
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,320
 And so I wasn't able to get the flags up on time, but I gotta go.

1765
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:33,320
 Right.

1766
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:37,080
 I'm sure your friend's daughter's basketball game where I'm sure they've talked a bunch

1767
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:41,960
 of shit about trans athletes participating and they haven't allowed some, isn't that

1768
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:42,960
 right?

1769
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:43,960
 Outrageous behavior.

1770
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:44,960
 Absolutely outrageous.

1771
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,760
 Do you know trans rights are human rights?

1772
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:48,760
 You piece of shit.

1773
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:49,760
 You know that, right?

1774
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:50,760
 Fuck you.

1775
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:51,760
 Okay.

1776
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:52,760
 Apparently you don't know that.

1777
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:58,680
 Why don't you go eat your own shit, you non pride flag having son of a bitch.

1778
01:12:58,680 --> 01:12:59,680
 Wow.

1779
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:00,680
 Okay.

1780
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:01,680
 Yeah.

1781
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:02,680
 I'm so sorry.

1782
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:03,680
 Yeah.

1783
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:04,680
 Okay.

1784
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,680
 Yeah.

1785
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:06,680
 Well, apologize to my fucking fist when it goes to your head.

1786
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:07,680
 I will.

1787
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,680
 Yeah.

1788
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:09,680
 You better.

1789
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:11,960
 Do you want some candy?

1790
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:16,480
 Only if it's been made with LGBTQIA professionals.

1791
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,520
 Okay.

1792
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:19,800
 I want the gayest candy.

1793
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:24,600
 You can give my skills.

1794
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:25,600
 That is it.

1795
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:26,600
 You win.

1796
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:27,600
 Okay.

1797
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:28,600
 All right.

1798
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:33,000
 Back in top of the day to you, top of the day to you.

1799
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,640
 I'm going to taste the rainbow.

1800
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:35,640
 Sounds good.

1801
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:36,640
 Have a good night.

1802
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:37,640
 Thank you.

1803
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:38,640
 Thank you very much.

1804
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:39,640
 You too.

1805
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:40,640
 Yeah.

1806
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,640
 Yeah.

1807
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:42,640
 Fuck y'all.

1808
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:47,200
 Oh, it's Truman Capote Truman.

1809
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,200
 What brings you by?

1810
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:53,880
 Well, I've just terribly excited and I was hoping there'd be some candy here.

1811
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:57,320
 Oh, that last guy just took the last of the Skittles.

1812
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:58,320
 That's all right.

1813
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:05,720
 Those don't feel nearly as good inside of me as a mounds bar does.

1814
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,880
 Sometimes you do feel like a nut.

1815
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:08,880
 I do every time.

1816
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:09,880
 Oh, wait.

1817
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:10,880
 That's all I'm enjoying.

1818
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:11,880
 Sometimes you don't.

1819
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:12,880
 That's mounds.

1820
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:13,880
 Fair enough.

1821
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:17,280
 Now, Truman is a movie out right now.

1822
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:20,800
 Springsteen was obsessed with the Nebraska, the murders in Nebraska.

1823
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:23,400
 You wrote the book in cold blood, right?

1824
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:24,400
 That's right.

1825
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,400
 I did.

1826
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:30,200
 The stock weather events, they were terrible tragedies, but very American, if you know

1827
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:35,240
 what I mean, but ultimately it's good that we're talking of this on Halloween because

1828
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:39,200
 it really comes down to the boy didn't get enough candy.

1829
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:40,200
 That's it?

1830
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,160
 Oh, is that the, that was the root?

1831
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:43,600
 That's really the crux of it.

1832
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,600
 Yes.

1833
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,400
 Stock weather was starved for some chocolate.

1834
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:47,400
 Okay.

1835
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,880
 Well, that's a shame.

1836
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:49,880
 That's good to know.

1837
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:50,880
 Yes.

1838
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:54,000
 So, you know, is that something that could happen to future people if they, if they don't

1839
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,840
 get enough Halloween candy?

1840
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:00,600
 Give your children lots of kisses or they might murder people.

1841
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:03,920
 They might murder people, Hershey it up every Halloween.

1842
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:05,640
 All right.

1843
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,640
 Hashtag can't bury it up.

1844
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:08,640
 You had buried it up.

1845
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:11,040
 I should say you heard it from true.

1846
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:14,840
 You should bury it up.

1847
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,160
 Did I can't bury the lead?

1848
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:18,920
 Now, Truman, did you get to see the Bruce Springsteen movie?

1849
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:24,020
 I certainly did see it was something.

1850
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:27,080
 The boss is the boss.

1851
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:29,280
 Did you have a favorite moment in the, in the film?

1852
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:36,480
 I enjoyed the credits rolling very much people to get their due.

1853
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,120
 My exit of the theater was loved.

1854
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:39,120
 Yes.

1855
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:45,320
 I appreciate seeing all the hard work that went into that mediocrity and just reassures

1856
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:49,600
 me that, you know, even when I'm working with Harper Lee, you know, nothing's guaranteed

1857
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:59,680
 you know, I wrote that book essentially, okay, yes, but I was just saying thank you for coming

1858
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:00,680
 by Truman.

1859
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:01,680
 We appreciate it.

1860
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:02,680
 You would say that.

1861
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:05,320
 Have a good night.

1862
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,920
 This is you did not see the Springsteen movie.

1863
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:08,920
 Is that correct?

1864
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:10,360
 I have not seen the Springsteen movie.

1865
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:11,600
 I'm actually going to watch it tomorrow.

1866
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:12,600
 Okay.

1867
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:13,600
 Okay.

1868
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:19,880
 Paul and I did go see it together the day of the day of the wedding and stuff.

1869
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:23,720
 I did get the re-release Nebraska album though, that I've been listening to.

1870
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:24,720
 Oh cool.

1871
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:27,040
 There's some gems on there.

1872
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,360
 It's a fucking banger.

1873
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:29,360
 Yeah.

1874
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,640
 No kidding around that re-release Nebraska.

1875
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:38,760
 I haven't listened because it's a multi-album release and one of them is the him doing Nebraska

1876
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,080
 at the Count Basie theater.

1877
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,080
 Ooh.

1878
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,120
 I have to check that out myself.

1879
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,120
 Yeah.

1880
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:45,120
 So it's really good.

1881
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:49,880
 I've listened to the 2025 remaster of it so far and it is excellent.

1882
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:53,200
 I have a very exciting interview actually for you guys.

1883
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:55,000
 I haven't told you guys about it.

1884
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,720
 We're closing out the show with it.

1885
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:59,840
 The guests should be here any moment now.

1886
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,520
 This is really going to be exciting.

1887
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:08,440
 It could possibly be the last interview on Ice Cream Social depending on who is touched

1888
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,440
 by who in this.

1889
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:10,440
 Oh good.

1890
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:11,440
 They're here.

1891
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:12,440
 They're here.

1892
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:17,920
 Ah, this is our guest for the end of the show here.

1893
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:20,280
 It is the Death Snail.

1894
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:26,760
 This is the snail that slowly crawls after all of us and if it touches us, we die.

1895
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:27,760
 That's right.

1896
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:31,240
 So we have to avoid being touched by this snail during this interview.

1897
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:33,280
 Thank you for coming by snail.

1898
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,000
 I'm just going to get away.

1899
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,040
 I started walking towards your house last Thanksgiving.

1900
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:43,360
 Oh, well, I'm glad you could finally make it our way.

1901
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:48,000
 Are you aware that you were part of our merchandise sales?

1902
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,280
 Our Kiss the Snail campaign is actually sold very well in our store.

1903
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:54,800
 Yes, I saw.

1904
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:59,120
 Boy, I hope I can one day afford a new shell.

1905
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,720
 Oh, so sorry.

1906
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:05,800
 Is it a burden to kill everyone you touch?

1907
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:08,280
 Burden is a heavy word.

1908
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:10,240
 I do like my powers.

1909
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:14,880
 Oh, you like you kind of like being an arbiter of death.

1910
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:19,880
 When you're an incredibly slow moving mollusk, you have few options in life.

1911
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:26,880
 But having the ability to kill things instantaneously evens the odds a bit.

1912
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:27,880
 I suppose it would.

1913
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:28,880
 I suppose it would.

1914
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:35,120
 Do you do you leave a traditional snail trail behind you after taking these lives?

1915
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:38,680
 It's somewhat traditional, but it has a design in it.

1916
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:43,320
 You know that special S that people always make on their folders and things?

1917
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:44,320
 Oh, yeah.

1918
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,320
 Yeah, sure.

1919
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,680
 That's what I leave behind me.

1920
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:51,520
 You leave the weird little S thing that looks the same no matter how you look at it.

1921
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:52,520
 That's right.

1922
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:54,400
 Because I don't know if you're aware of this.

1923
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:58,080
 I'm also an automobile engineer.

1924
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,080
 I was not.

1925
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:02,320
 No, that's do you work for a specific dealership or anything?

1926
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,960
 No, I'm a self-employed.

1927
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:09,360
 I'm kind of like, you know, make my own sort of deal.

1928
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,600
 The tires have that S on it as well.

1929
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:16,240
 And you know, that's to make the imprint very clear.

1930
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:27,200
 So when you drive one of my autos, everybody knows where your S car goes.

1931
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,360
 I want to thank Pinch Let's Greatness podcast.

1932

 Thanks, Jonas.

1935
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:38,320
 And for staying around for this bullshit.

1936
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:45,800
 If we can't go out on an S car fun, I don't know what we can do.

1937
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:49,560
 Look at that S car go.

1938
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:51,480
 I want to thank the following people.

1939
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:57,060

 It's kind of awesome.

1980
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:42,400
 I actually bake my wheels at a low temperature over a long period and I just sear them at

1981
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:43,400
 the last minute.

1982
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:44,400
 Smart.

01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:46,400
 Smart.

1985
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,400
 You do a reverse sear wheel.

1986
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:48,400
 I do a reverse sear wheel.

1987
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,400

 We love you and we'll see you soon.

 We'll see you soon.

1991
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:53,400
 You cannot be serious.

1992
01:23:53,400 --> 01:24:06,280
 Did you buy this in America?

1993
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:17,680
 It should have American measurements on it.

1994
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:20,320
 I thought he was kidding.

1995
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:21,840
 He wasn't.

1996
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,920
 We are in for a metric ton of bullshit.

1997
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:24,920
 That's all.

1998
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:25,920

01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:26,920
 We're PreachingFun.

2000
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:30,200
 They're going to sell tape measures and they won't have the centimeters on the top side

2001
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:31,200
 of the thing.

2002
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:32,200
 They'll be like, no.

2003
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,200
 They're just crossed out.

2004
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,200
 Get them off.

2005
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:35,200
 They just took a Sharpie to it.

2006
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,200
 A Sharpie.

2007
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:37,200
 Just blacked out.

2008
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:38,200
 Just cheap.

2009
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:39,200
 Just blacked it all out.

2010
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:40,200
 You motherfuckers.

2011
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,200
 It's still there.

2012
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:42,200
 I needed that.

2013
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:43,200
 Just blacked out.

2014
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:44,200
 I needed that.

2015
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:45,200
 I can't do the conversion in my head.

2016
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:46,200
 I need it on the tape.

2017
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,200
 Damn.

2018
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,200
 Oh, no.
