 We get it

20
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,360
 We're about to set up our trick-and-treat

21
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,720
 Deal as soon as we wrap here. We'll be going outside the city of our house here. Yeah, same here and

22
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,520
 I

23
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,320
 Well, we did a test run last night basically Ryre Applethorne built me a

24
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:08,300
 Disguised jack-in-the-box giant jack-in-the-box. Yeah, uh-huh. And so yesterday was trunk or treat

25
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:14,440
 Over at the school. And so everybody had these ornate

26
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,760
 You know trunk design set up their car trunk designs

27
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,040
 Yeah, they do like full-on decorations on their cars and everything right? Yes a trunk look like a monster mouth or all kind of stuff

28
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,240
 Like that. Yeah, and my wife signed signed me up for it. But we

29
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,040
 We've been crazy busy. And so I basically had

30
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,280
 30 minutes to run home and put stuff in my car to make trunk or treat happen and then back to the school

31
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,640
 I had the Halloween parade and I had to teach a theater workshop to the kids there and then trunk or treat was right after

32
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,960
 And so I rolled up in my Corolla

33
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,880
 Yeah

34
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,220
 put down a blanket the skeleton a couple a couple skeletons and

35
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:05,960
 then I gave the controls over to my youngest son who scared the shit out of everybody with a jump scare and

36
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,560
 With with

37
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,240
 With with with basically no decorations. We got third place in the trunk or treat because we were scared

38
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,480
 Yes

39
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,480
 Ryre Appledorn coming through baby. Well poor Ryre Appledorn. I have to get him on the phone

40
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:31,560
 The prop did not hold up to the stress test of a repeated truck or treat thing. Oh really?

41
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:40,160
 How many how many reps did the prop get last night I mean

42
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:48,580
 50 60 reps. Yeah, you know, I don't normally perform that trick 60 times in an hour

43
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,160
 Interesting interesting

44
00:03:52,160 --> 00:04:00,000
 Will that my now my son to his content is the the front door broke off completely and okay

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,880
 then the fish that the clown was holding snapped out of his hand and then the finger got of the one clown got caught and

46
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,140
 Something on one of the reloads and snapped a finger

47
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,480
 It was a real

48
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,280
 It was a day news a day and I was also relying on that tonight today

49
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,600
 so I'm gonna get my neighbor Gary to see if we can fix the front door on the on the

50
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:29,200
 Clown now the clown with a snap finger and a couple of broken things doesn't hurt that doesn't hurt the bit at all

51
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,600
 the vibe is still there for the scare. Yeah and

52
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:39,840
 To Ryre's credit he I for no reason he added two giant loud horns to the prop when I didn't ask for that at all

53
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,640
 And it absolutely makes it and my son was way on top of it

54
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:52,800
 Just blasting people with the horn on the jump scare and just really good really crushing it. And so perfect

55
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,340
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but yes, this is indeed

56
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:05,340
 I gotta I'm gonna see if I can put it to put it back together for the for the for the

57
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,080
 Tonight the don't leave the property reading. Yeah. Yeah

58
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
 Oh

59
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,320
 Paul you're already dressed for trick-or-treat. You got your you got your Ninja Turtles hat on there

60
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,600
 This is actually a winter to that. I just sport when it gets cold. I was outside doing some chores today

61
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,280
 It's freezing out here. It's in the 40s. You're full on Ninja Turtles hat. I'm sorry. It's not a costume

62
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,960
 It's just your regular hat. Yeah, it's just a regular hat. I wear my phone. Yeah, of course

63
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,160
 I mean I wore Ninja Turtle pants on the airplane for years. That's how that's how I roll. I'll give shit

64
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,560
 Yeah

65
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,840
 No, somebody was just asking me if I would open up my own comic book store at some point

66
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:52,120
 I don't think I want the hassle. It's too much hassle my guy. My guy is in a new location now and

67
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,640
 It's just been challenge after challenge for him getting it all squared away

68
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:02,920
 It's a great new space, but just brick-and-mortar retail is thriving like no other time in history

69
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,160
 Right now, you know what comic shops are actually doing better this year than they have in a long time. I

70
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,280
 Think they're up something like 30 sure. No, seriously. It's a believe you but I'm

71
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:23,960
 That's a not a great comparison to what comic book shops a few years ago weren't doing well at all, right? Uh

72
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:30,680
 Yeah, I mean, yeah, they've certainly had their ebbs and flows. Yeah, that's all I mean, but they're yeah, I guess that's true

73
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,480
 I mean, there are a lot of them in town now that you're right there. I've seen a lot of them just pop up

74
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:41,740
 Anecdotally across Vegas. Yeah coming up coming up from the bottom, but it's a it's a you know, relatively inexpensive form of of

75
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,280
 entertainment and

76
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,520
 Every comic book shop has always been a labor of love. There's nobody for sure

77
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,560
 That is nobody open the comic book shop being like and then and then I'll buy my island

78
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,400
 More the more to the point when did comic book shops become the collectible shops as well late?

79
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,060
 Seven when we were kids they were they were just comic book shops, right?

80
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,880
 Or were they were they already not late seventies as far as we mean like when it became

81
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:13,360
 About collectibles about the collectibles. I've got like all that all like the toys and gimmicks

82
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,240
 Yeah, the toys from the different things and there aren't the collectible toys and the and the Pokemon cards and all the things

83
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,060
 Don't make me start listing things. I just sound like an old man

84
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:28,280
 There are still some comic shops that are very purist and really hold mostly

85
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,720
 Books and there are the other things that those like those toys and things have a good

86
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,480
 Margin on them. So yeah, everybody kind of thought fair as it out. Yeah

87
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:45,680
 I'm holding the mug from the wedding the wedding favorite mug of the people who nice. Oh nice

88
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,820
 Yeah, I just got out of there. You went you gotta get it. Yeah. Yeah, I have they sent me this one

89
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:55,160
 They sent me this non-descript plastic cup that I'm drinking out of. Yeah

90
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,720
 but yeah, we went and

91
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,720
 Anne and I had a

92
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,760
 Day to go and just kind of do a few little things together

93
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,280
 she's been working like crazy and

94
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:13,760
 so we went to get some food at Applebee's and then we went to the comic book store and

95
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:20,960
 then we went to try out this new ice cream spot that we have in town and

96
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,920
 It was great. This new ice cream store is great. And yeah, it's called

97
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:32,480
 Crispy cone and what's your what's your go-to order at an ice cream shop. I'm usually chocolate

98
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:37,600
 You're just a scoop of chocolate usually but this time the way they do it

99
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,520
 I usually just rob them. They just say give me all the money in the register

100
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,560
 Smart smart. It's very different

101
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:49,000
 This this place very fancy crunk. Oh, he's out there got ice cream shops working for him

102
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,660
 My default is probably chocolate chip cookie dough. That's Anne's that's what Anne likes

103
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,460
 Yep, that's my go-to order is a shake

104
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:07,760
 Okay, shake. Yeah, I want to I want a no labor. No labor for you. Just went down get it done

105
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,580
 No, no, I want to I want to take it. I want to I want to be able to walk and sip

106
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,480
 Enjoy my shake shakes are so good

107
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,660
 And then I feel so terrible with myself after I have them and I don't know why

108
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:25,440
 Big one. I I see people order like the huge ones that everything I'm going to you are a crazy person. That's me

109
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,600
 I love me a big big chocolate milkshake. I just want I want a little like hand-sized

110
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,200
 You know just a little little shake little little chocolate shake or maybe a vanilla or something like that

111
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,440
 I don't have restraint if I get a shake. It's gone. It's gone

112
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,240
 I yeah, it is it is a it is a two-minute treat and then it is I'm with you on that

113
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:49,160
 I I have no ability to like casually take a come you do have to pace yourself on the old shakes a little bit

114
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,320
 not me

115
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
 Now take it take it down

116
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,400
 That not only will not pace himself on the shakes, but they I got one that was

117
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,800
 What he caught cheesecake, oh

118
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:10,000
 Yeah, so they put chunks of cheesecake all on the sides of it and then drizzled strawberry syrup all over it

119
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,880
 Really really fucking good. It sounds like a mess

120
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,840
 It was it was really hard to get home and it was really tricky to juggle

121
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,440
 But it was delicious. You must have been an Anne's car. No, we were in mind. I

122
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,480
 Thought that you would have taken that into your own car. I

123
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,920
 Know I was like, uh, I had well, here's here's what happened

124
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:39,840
 Paul does not like taking food into his car. I don't we're in we're in the ice cream shop and

125
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,560
 I start to get gurgle belly

126
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,520
 And I and I know

127
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,960
 That time is of the essence

128
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:56,320
 The clock has started and we we not only got we each got an ice cream and we got hot chocolates

129
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,520
 So I'm sipping a little bit of hot chocolate eat a little bit of ice cream

130
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:07,080
 Mixing temperature should really help really help suit that belly. Well

131
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,440
 Got a big pot of coffee. I get in the car Edward and as soon as we're driving I'm like and I

132
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:23,480
 Got a bucket of prunes. I got some stuff going on things are things are happening and she's like you're gonna make you're gonna make it

133
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,320
 I'm like, I think so she says is are you gonna shit in your cars? I'm not gonna shit my car

134
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,280
 I just cleaned this car spent three hours the other day cleaning and detailing my fucking good

135
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,600
 I'm glad that factor because if you hadn't cleaned your car, it would have been an option

136
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:44,040
 Not an option. I haven't cleaned my car in months. I might shit in my car. I don't know. I don't know I

137
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,840
 Don't know because here's what happened. We got home. I

138
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:54,840
 Was in dire straits. I got out of the car. I came around the car

139
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:02,600
 Into the house as I'm coming around the side of the car and says are you okay? Are you shitting yourself? And I go

140
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,000
 Oh, no

141
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 As soon as she said it

142
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,440
 Is she did

143
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,360
 Me and I said, oh no

144
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:21,360
 She is happening. It's happening. She dream boarded it. She straight up. This is an impression of me

145
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:28,480
 She's doing impressions of me all day. She goes it's happening. Oh, no. Oh, no, and I go running up the stairs

146
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,040
 At least started making shit filling my pants. I'm throwing my jacket away

147
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:41,960
 Ripping my belt off trying to save my wallet and keys. I can feel it ripping out through my underwear

148
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:47,360
 Into my jeans. I'm like this is going to drip on my stairs if I don't get upstairs

149
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,200
 Run up the stairs run up the stairs

150
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,440
 I'm not doing that to my downstairs bathroom. I

151
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,240
 Get upstairs I

152
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:07,100
 Get up this moment. I am going to the closest bathroom. I get upstairs. I throw my

153
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,060
 Hands off. I throw everything over to the side. I

154
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:17,240
 Completely have ruined my pants my jeans my underwear my socks

155
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,760
 everything I

156
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,120
 Sit on the commode and the commode is just the sides are now just

157
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,860
 Terrible terrible soft serve of death

158
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,920
 And it's just like the stench I'm like, I know I'm sorry I can't control

159
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,040
 Matt Matt checked out Matt has left the zoom

160
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,200
 And is laughing and of course at the same time saying I'm sorry

161
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:50,760
 I know I know I shouldn't be laughing but you're too funny when you're doing this stuff. You're making me laugh. You're killing me smalls

162
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,560
 And I did I made her laugh through the whole thing even though

163
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,360
 Most women would just leave that's what I tell her straight up

164
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,580
 I'm like, this is not the first nor the last time I've shit my pants. You haven't just left me. So it's fine

165
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:11,840
 So yeah, the guy do all that laughter it's just it's just gonna be stuff going to a suitcase. Yeah, that's the trouble

166
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,200
 Yeah, that's gonna be the bad time, but it was fine

167
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,000
 It took me about an hour to get everything

168
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,220
 So real quick Leon Kasab in the chat just got back in. Hey guys, I just came back

169
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,220
 Should I recommend this episode for an obelisk?

170
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,760
 Sure

171
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,960
 It sums us up it appeals to a certain demographic I

172
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,340
 Guess I mean, I'm just I'm just being honest. I'm just being honest

173
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,440
 It was a rough night anyway

174
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,720
 but

175
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,000
 Finally got everything settled down and then yesterday. I cleaned the bathroom top to bottom

176
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,040
 So, you know, I did my part to fix everything. I cleaned the bathroom that day and then I cleaned it again yesterday

177
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,000
 So yes, I did need the muffler. I did not have my muffler muffler would have saved

178
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 But what a muffler have even would have but a muffler have slowed this down. Yes, this sounds like too much for a muffler

179
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 This was pretty intense. I have to say

180
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,400
 Bourbon barrel like every really just

181
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,880
 What are we doing? Yeah. Yeah, I don't know but

182
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,240
 it was just crazy how she was like she seriously was like

183
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,160
 Are you shitting yourself? And then sure enough I was like, oh god, I am

184
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,840
 Wasn't before I wasn't before and now I am and I didn't make it and it was just hell on earth

185
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,440
 Hell on the car is fine

186
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,680
 Cars fine. I was clear from the car

187
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,760
 Everything's fine

188
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,760
 Everything's fine now

189
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:47,640
 Well, no, no some underwear got thrown away. Yeah. Yeah. All right and some socks and

190
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:57,040
 Well, no, I didn't get to my socks but

191
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:04,020
 Socks is an unrelated side effect and some carpeting. No the socks. Here's the sock story

192
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:10,400
 So I have socks we're on I have socks that I've probably been wearing for like ten years some of them and now they're getting

193
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,500
 real rippy. Holy and so I

194
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,080
 Wait rippy. Holy, I bought a bunch of new socks

195
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,080
 And so I was like well as I go through and I find my rippy

196
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,860
 Holy socks, I'll just start throwing them away because I've got a bunch of new socks and

197
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:36,840
 Just so happens this coincided with me wearing some rippy. Holies for their last time and then and it was so bad

198
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:43,560
 Taking off everything is such a rush that the top ring of the sock stayed on my foot like a

199
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,100
 Rippy holies because I was trying to get out of my poop filled clothes

200
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,680
 You have tear away socks

201
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:01,120
 So then I use those socks to start the cleaning process somewhat and threw them away. Oh my god

202
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,600
 Yeah, okay. It was intense. It was an intense afternoon

203
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,400
 It was a heavy heavy

204
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,760
 It was a lot. So wait, wait

205
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,800
 So then was the this cheesecake Sunday in transit with you while this was happening? Yes

206
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,500
 Yes, I said it on the roof of the car and just left it ran

207
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:28,800
 Didn't even get my hot hot cocos till like an hour later. They were not hot by that time. They were delicious

208
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,960
 So yeah

209
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:36,800
 yeah, and and got the sundae and put it in a bowl and put it in the freezer for me and then the hot cocos just

210
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,880
 Sat in my car till I was able to come back downstairs and get my hot cocos out of the car

211
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:49,640
 It was a you know, well for the love of God needs some roughage and that is the following sponsor

 Yeah, there's no coming back from the slobby knobby

225
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,400
 That is a finisher and a half when I heard you were guys. My name is Stephen

226
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:16,880
 I'm the I'm the manager in this hobby lobby. Yeah, and I I am I don't want you guys doing this

227
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,960
 Someone needs to be clothesline

228
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:25,720
 Rippy holy just fucked you up and now you're gonna have

229
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,200
 He's gonna give you a finishing move right on your belly. Yeah

230
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,280
 JD III heard I heard you were coming today. So when I went to do my job

231
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,740
 I stuff cotton in my mouth. I just put a bunch of cotton into my mouth

232
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:45,720
 Furniture it did feel like home. Yeah next time if you could coil a rusty old spring on your tongue

233
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,100
 That would just really put it put it over the edge rusty spring my tag-team partner

234
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:56,840
 Rusty spring and Rippy Holy, I mean I always loved you guys cuz you did remind me of the old furniture

235
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,840
 I used to have sex with

236
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,200
 Don't get me in a goodwill that place would get wrecked

237
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:13,560
 Jacob did you see yes, Springsteen deliver me from nowhere. I

238
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:22,360
 Attempted to oh and then found out that it wasn't streaming anywhere. It's only in theaters. Oh

239
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:28,880
 Yeah, you thought you're gonna watch it at home. I sat down last night to watch it and went to pull it up

240
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,640
 It was like oh, it's not streaming here. Oh, it must be on a different service

241
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,560
 I thought I was gonna have to pay for it. I thought it was I thought it was new

242
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:42,240
 Yeah, but no, that's why I have not seen it that puppy meets theaters my friend

243
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,120
 but I see that that thing needs to blossom slowly in the

244
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:52,960
 Seeds of the tens of 12s of people that are going into theater after theater to see it sit a magic

245
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,160
 I did watch an extended trailer of it last night and I and I listened to

246
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,920
 Nebraska and the count Basie theater. I'll tell you that that the

247
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,680
 The extended trailer is probably as good as the movie

248
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:13,200
 Did genuinely make me want to watch the movie. So I think you might be right. Yeah

249
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,440
 When we saw the movie Paul was a Paul was respectful

250
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,560
 We got in the car and he's like are we waiting to get on air to talk about this and I said

251
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,160
 No, we can talk about the car. We just rehashed it on. Yeah. Yeah

252
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,800
 And he goes wait, you're the springsteen fan. So I'll let you talk first

253
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:39,680
 You should start Paul said and with this conversation I defer I defer. Yes. I yield the floor

254
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,520
 To the gentleman from New Jersey. So first of all to have this conversation

255
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,540
 I'm gonna need you to set the tone first of all spoilers

256
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:53,600
 Let's just yes set that out here now spoilers for deliver me from nowhere

257
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,680
 Which I can't believe that fucking subtitle. It is meaningless

258
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,200
 Meaningless

259
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,440
 It's a lyric reference, but besides that it is meaningless. Yes

260
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,020
 Here's the thing that really sums up this movie for me

261
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:16,760
 I'm watching the film and I'm getting you know as emotionally invested as one can when watching the boss

262
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,080
 Deal with the stuff

263
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,960
 He's got this long time relationship

264
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,740
 multiple-year relationship happening on screen

265
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:34,800
 With this woman and her child and he's very much been become like a father figure to this kid here and there and you know

266
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,480
 All this kind of thing and also just might be to say that that actor Odessa

267
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,800
 last name is

268
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,800
 She's Australian

269
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:50,280
 She kills it. She steals the movie as far as I'm concerned. Yeah, she was great and I was like, okay Matt

270
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:58,560
 So who was this lady? Uh, why didn't they stay together? What what's what's the what's the fallout from that? Oh, that says

271
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,720
 She's a composite character of multiple ways

272
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:08,200
 And I'm like fuck this movie forever then yeah

273
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,840
 Because he doesn't even come off that nice to a composite of his

274
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:21,920
 Went out of its way to fictionalize Springsteen leading on a woman with a child and ditching her that's

275
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,600
 It is the oddest shit the choices they make

276
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:32,880
 Just like if I'm gonna submit my legacy. It's a superstar. I should put out a movie where I'm absolutely

277
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,080
 atrocious

278
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,920
 Yeah, the most sympathetic people in the world a single mother a single working mother in a diner

279
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,840
 Like somebody said somebody in a writing room somewhere said like no

280
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,240
 No, we have to we have to do that like he was convinced to keep that bit in the movie. I'm sure

281
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,640
 I don't know man. It's so weird movie

282
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,120
 Right if you just watch just old-school movie making

283
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:05,880
 Right, right. You are supposed to ride the dip of that and then that person is supposed to evolve and come back to being a better person

284
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,440
 and

285
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,440
 There are scenes that set it up

286
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:15,880
 Informatically, so where they follow all the rules of film writing right up to that that that cliff

287
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,860
 Where the house supposed to turn around and do make the better choice?

288
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:27,040
 It's like nope. Anyways, he went on to go do some concerts. Yeah, it's the craziest thing. He

289
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:34,520
 Mother and child who knows who knows he meets up with her at a diner where she's been working

290
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,160
 Has this big heartfelt conversation?

291
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,560
 Was she the best he had ever had not even close. She cries and

292
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:47,920
 Says she does a heartfelt speech like just pierces right through all of his bullshit

293
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:52,520
 Like I hope you find what you're looking for and he's gone. That's it

294
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,400
 He never even talks to her again the rest of the movie. She never shows up again

295
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:02,000
 He leaves her he leaves her crying next to a dishwashing machine. That's it. It's over. That's the last thing

296
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,220
 She's in there's a scene later

297
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:12,360
 Into the movie is that scene like 90 there's like 20 minutes left. Yeah. Yeah. Oh shit. Yeah, it's almost over

298
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:20,680
 It's a build-up to this moment and this moment is where that speech should make him break down and make the right choice

299
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,360
 Right and it's that it's like but that's not what happened in real life. So goodbye and then

300
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:33,440
 Sure, let me composited this together even has this epic road trip, which is which is hysterically

301
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,680
 Factual and that Springsteen never drove. So someone had a drive to the California

302
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:45,760
 Springsteen and Copperfield are two two huge celebrities who just never really drove and

303
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:55,120
 Like muddling in the diner with his food in the middle of like, you know El Paso or something and he's going like she's right

304
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,880
 She's right

305
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:12,520
 As though she had never spoken he doesn't even move on it's he is absolutely just feather on the wind

306
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:18,960
 He does not do anything. He directs little anything in this film

307
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,800
 Aside from recording an album in his bedroom

308
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:30,240
 That's the only thing that he really does and then that same that same moment of him being out in this

309
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,840
 Road trip the guy after he's seen him get all upset with his food

310
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,720
 gets on the horn to the manager and

311
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:48,480
 Comically, it's the spring scene is like five feet away. He's like, I don't know

312
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,640
 He's gone off the deep end

313
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:59,000
 It's the dumbest thing you've ever seen

314
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:07,880
 It's like they want to talk about all the the the darkness in his soul, but it never really it's just I mean

315
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,440
 They they delve into his childhood abuse

316
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,080
 okay, but

317
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,080
 it's just it's just

318
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:23,200
 Abuse in a way that is like if we if you and I went to film school and we're like, how do we want to?

319
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:30,200
 Want to show you boost? Let's cut to black and white and do the most like standard bad dad

320
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,720
 Scenes you've ever seen in your land the bad dad

321
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:40,640
 His bad dad is a character actor who's been in a lot of stuff and most notably he plays

322
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,080
 Italian gangsters and he played Capone in I want to say Boardwalk Empire

323
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,320
 Capone and also in adolescence. He's the tough dad in

324
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:56,320
 Adolescents, though is they hit the big hit on Netflix that for okay. So very pigeon-holed like you see him

325
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,160
 And you're already like, oh

326
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:03,280
 His father was Al Capone. Okay bad guy bad guy. Yeah, and

327
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:09,360
 Yeah, it's weird. It's weird. He has a breakdown at an amusement park. It's

328
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,280
 Like even Graham is that actor's name? Yes, he's great

329
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,680
 Steven Graham, he was really good

330
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,720
 Look, you know like he put out he put up this big autobiography and there's a big deal

331
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,120
 He does one person show on Broadway and where he was more candid than he'd ever been about his childhood

332
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,520
 and his you know, he was he is the child of an abusive father and

333
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:38,600
 And you know as a rock star, you know that obviously has a different, you know, weird weird way of sitting with people

334
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,600
 but uh, you know, I

335
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,440
 Said to Paul I said basically if you took

336
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,480
 Like this moment, right?

337
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,520
 This is a moment basically like spacing this finally which with the movie's get into but he's passed his lawsuits

338
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,200
 He can finally put out music again

339
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:01,800
 He can finally tour again puts up the river the rivers huge and they're begging him to like come back with another killer album

340
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,280
 And he instead takes this artistic right turn puts up the Nebraska album and all that stuff is true

341
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:12,320
 It's crazy. And so like that is a weird turn and like and I said to Paul like any time

342
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:20,440
 Springsteen fans talk to non-Springsteen fans and they say he's just a cheesy rocker most the first words out of most Springsteen fans

343
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,520
 His mouth is something about Nebraska like that album is this totally different turn

344
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:33,240
 With with beautiful storytelling and songwriting in it that's not pop right and and so

345
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,600
 You know to tell that story as a moment of triumph, you know

346
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:46,240
 Artistically is maybe fascinating and kind of like basically then you pit yourself against the record people and the pressures and all the people

347
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,880
 Wanted to be super famous that feels like more of like a typical story and then he's battling depression during this time

348
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:58,840
 That feels like that would be like an underlying kind of B story, right? And instead this movie makes the

349
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:04,800
 artistic choice to put up the Nebraska album against all the pressures of fame as this kind of

350
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:11,200
 Dragging B story while we watch this very in depth arc of depression in the Jersey Shore

351
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:20,560
 We're the only solution is to run away and move to California forever and like she and like that's not a movie anybody wants

352
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,560
 To see about anyone

353
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:29,480
 Right. Yeah, so that's that's that's my sum up of it. They flipped the a in the B stories in a way that was so strange

354
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:34,600
 It's just it's it's a weird movie. It's not a bad movie

355
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,440
 No, but it's not a good movie. No, it's a problem

356
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,640
 Another thing we said in the car was was like it's as if like a bunch of actors got together and we're like

357
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:48,200
 I want to make a movie where all of us get scenes where we get to act our faces. Oh man

358
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:57,480
 It is acting happening in those fucking mo. Oh my god. Yeah, there's some people just really acting hard hard acting

359
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,120
 No, no feel bad for the you know, the bear Jeremy Allen white or whatever like, you know

360
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:10,680
 You know your your basic book on screenwriting is in the scene a character should feel different

361
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,480
 Than it does in the beginning of a scene, right?

362
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,320
 So it starts off feeling one way and by the end of the scene it feels another because that's how we're watching

363
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,120
 That interaction that's that's we're watching

364
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:26,120
 Situations where people can possibly change right? That's what makes compelling voyeuristic

365
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,840
 Scenic acting movie making work and there are so many scenes where

366
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:38,920
 Bruce is the same exact mood at the start of the scene at the end of nothing changes nothing changes in the scene

367
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,520
 So nothing affects him

368
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,600
 No

369
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,760
 But I did just find out that um

370
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:54,120
 Matt did you know that that nebraska and in cold blood were about the same events? Yes

371
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,840
 I think I think am I the only one who didn't know that I think that common knowledge as a matter of fact

372
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,120
 I believe if you listen back to our halloween episode jacob just the last episode when truman capote stopped by

373
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,360
 I did indeed ask him about that. He did

374
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,600
 It's the start. It's the starkweather murders. Yeah, it's clearly

375
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:17,640
 It's clear that I wasn't listening at that moment of the last show. Yeah, you're juggling you're juggling characters stopping by the doorbell

376
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,880
 I get it. I'm just letting you know that

377
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,840
 Karen and georgia evidence. I just found that out this week

378
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,720
 I didn't I didn't know that karen and georgia on my favorite murder just recently covered the starkweather shit

379
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,480
 It's awful

380
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:35,800
 And oh, yes for a lot, but for a long time it was framed as this sort of bonnie and clyde type situation

381
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:42,600
 Yeah, oh right. Sure more and more we're learning. This was a 13 year old girl who watched her parents murdered in front of her

382
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,440
 It's not like she really had a choice but to go with the psychopath

383
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,640
 Oh, no, no, it's it's horrible. It's dark. It's dark shit

384
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:54,360
 But but I mean it turns out that story of murder is a bad story. Well, but but

385
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,160
 but the fact that we

386
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,160
 Lumped a poor little girl in on it

387
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,680
 This country's just fucking dumb

388
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:08,840
 Of all the things that make this country down it wasn't

389
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:17,240
 It wasn't the starkville murders the starkweather murders that they didn't just blame him a 13 year old dragged along for some murders

390
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,880
 I think we have indeed figured it out

391
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:26,280
 I think we've righted that wrong ball. I think that's maybe maybe I guess I don't know

392
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:34,440
 Paul paul paul. I got you the country is in trouble and those murders were horrible. Yes, those are both true

393
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,560
 They might not be related. I don't know

394
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:42,440
 I don't know. I don't know. It feels like in a lot of ways. It feels like it's just misogyny all the way down

395
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,840
 That's what it really feels like. No, I went to um, I told you guys a couple of months ago. I went down to

396
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,440
 Prim to to look at some of the casinos down there

397
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,960
 So we can just kind of walk through some of the casinos down there before they shut down right and one of the casinos down there

398
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:01,400
 Has uh the bonnie and clied car. Yeah, where where they were where they were shot to death

399
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:06,040
 And you know, it's got all the bullet holes and everything and it's a tourist attraction

400
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,320
 And I I just stood there and looked at this thing and I was like this

401
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,480
 this car

402
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,000
 was uh

403
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 two people's uh death site

404
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 Uh, the evidence of them of them dying is still here

405
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,040
 And uh, they they killed people and they robbed people and they hurt people and they did all these things

406
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,760
 This is not uh, this is not a nice story

407
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:32,280
 And I and I just kind of stood there being disgusted that this car was on display for people to come over and look at

408
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,800
 That's me with the mom museum. People love going to my museum

409
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:41,400
 There's a little like a little little uh, like a mini dock that runs throughout the whole time

410
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:46,920
 And there's one where this mafia guy is is talking about being a consultant on a deniro movie

411
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:52,440
 And they're reenacting the murder and he's describing like how the murder went down and they're like, oh, they're like, oh man

412
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:57,000
 This guy the way he's describing it's like he actually was there and it's like, oh, isn't that awesome? No

413
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:03,400
 Yeah, it's fucking yeah. He was actually there. He was there and he committed fucking brutal murder. I don't know why

414
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:10,060
 That's uh, that's uh, I don't know why that's a taint tickler for you. Oh because matt it's the uh, it's the fedora

415
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:16,200
 If you're wearing a fedora costa nostra

416
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,600
 That's right. That's right

417
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,960
 Oh, and he's not black. It's those it's those two things put together

418
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,200
 Oh, man

419
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,200
 Speaking of vegas icons

420
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,480
 uh

421
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,440
 sarah has to ross was uh filming a music video

422
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,280
 And downtown. Yeah. Yeah, and I was asked if I would play

423
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,920
 Uh, not elvis. This is key

424
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:42,920
 But uh a fremont street elvis impersonator. That's that's the key there. Oh, yeah, that is yeah

425
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,400
 There's a degree in casting there

426
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:53,560
 Um, and if you need an elvis matt donnelly is not your guy if you need somebody on fremont street impersonating elvis matt donnelly

427
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,600
 so I uh

428
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,640
 my wife

429
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,200
 Mistakenly thought I still had this elvis outfit that I used to have

430
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,760
 um, but it eventually just

431
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,840
 Like weathered away and became you know

432
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:10,280
 Uh, well she wore it out. Honestly if we if we're just telling the truth like she just she just fucked the shit out

433
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:21,400
 Oh, i'm gonna call i'm gonna screen it but um, my friend jeff calls it's nevada day, uh here that's right and um

434
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:27,480
 My friend jeff knows all the words to the nevada day song nevada the nevada anthem

435
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:34,040
 And he calls every single friend who still lives in nevada every nevada day and sings the entire song into their voicemail

436
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,960
 Uh, and so I have that that's what's happening right now. It's my favorite thing

437
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,280
 One of the more fun things about nevada is that became a state on halloween. Yeah

438
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:51,480
 Um, anyhow, so, uh, so I went down to star costume and and I was like this is actually it's nothing to do with halloween

439
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,720
 I need I need an elvis costume

440
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,920
 And so I look

441
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,360
 and

442
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,880
 uh

443
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:05,080
 In in my sizes, they had this really nice red one. It's really nice red one. Okay

444
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:09,400
 Uh, that looked really sharp. It was a little pricey but

445
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,440
 I've been asked to dress up like elvis on multiple occasions and I don't know if it will stop

446
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:19,560
 Figured you're going to get another run out of this. Oh, this was a purchase not a not a rental, right?

447
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,560
 This is a purchase because also

448
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:26,040
 When I did virgin voyages and hopefully that went well enough that they'll invite me back

449
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,640
 They do a thing called scarlet night where everyone dresses in red

450
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:34,760
 And I was like, wait a minute if I go with the red one I can wear this

451
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,200
 Yep

452
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:43,880
 On the virgin voyages representing vegas. That'll look good. Yeah. Yeah, um, and so, uh, yeah bought myself a nice elvis outfit

453
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,520
 and then uh went down to

454
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,120
 Fremont and I was like, hey you guys are just shooting on the street, right?

455
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:54,600
 She's like, yeah, like so there's no like dressing area. She's like, no, it's like so basically I should arrive as elvis

456
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,320
 And they're like, yeah, okay

457
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,000
 so

458
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,120
 Me which coincidentally is the same note that every person who hires matt to do any gig tells it

459
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,200
 I knew to ask I knew yeah

460
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:15,480
 It's so common my my my tier my tier of of of acting is so familiar that I know be like no dressing rooms, right?

461
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,120
 no makeup

462
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:22,620
 Matt is an aae actor is what they call him. He arrives as elvis

463
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:27,800
 I

464
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:34,760
 Was just walking up and down fremont street dressed at the toe as elvis and did anyone look at you twice?

465
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,240
 No people were loving it

466
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:41,640
 People were loving it and so then I did this bit with sarah that when the music video comes out

467
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,360
 I think it's gonna look great. So I won't spoil it, but it was super fun

468
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,760
 and um

469
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,960
 As i'm walking back to my car a guy literally goes like hey

470
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,080
 Are you?

471
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:57,000
 Are you like doing stuff here? And I was like, no, no, uh, sorry

472
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,200
 I'm just I just actually just got a music video and i'm just walking back to my car

473
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,920
 He was oh, okay

474
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,720
 Um, can I take a photo of you anyway?

475
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,240
 Sure

476
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,440
 and he's like

477
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,800
 He like gets down like gets a good angle or whatever. Yeah, he's like

478
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,520
 Can't sorry. I mean, can I do is like a self a selfie is okay. Is the selfie okay?

479
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,760
 And I was like, yeah, let's let's do it man

480
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:25,480
 We took a nice selfie whatever and he was like, I gotta give you some money

481
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,880
 And I literally go like no, no, no, no, no, i'm on my way to the car. I can't

482
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,720
 This is you you betta say

483
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:38,600
 You've met a wonderful person I was like

484
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:42,520
 Did you take some money? I hope you took some fucking money

485
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:46,520
 This is the thing I I told the story to sarah and she goes how much you make I said I I said no

486
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,920
 No, i'm okay. I want to just want to get home to my kids, you know

487
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,960
 and uh, uh

488
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,200
 Sarah was like you you're a fool. Yeah

489
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,120
 And I was like, I know i'm dumb every person I talked to has been like

490
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,840
 What was going to give you it? I was like, I don't know. I don't who knows you probably get 100 bucks

491
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:09,640
 I doubt it, but you never know man. People are crazy out there. No jordan campbell says this is how matt started on his only fans

492
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,920
 um jordan this did feel uh

493
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:19,240
 It did feel like a moment of like I I often kind of rack my brain if I could like make extra money or whatever

494
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:23,080
 And so the idea of like oh if I could just go down a free street just like that might be

495
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:29,000
 It felt like too easy like that's it was like I literally was like trying to not do it

496
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,320
 And then someone stopped and like made sure they offered me money and I was getting a lot of attention

497
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,320
 You know, I was walking with purpose to like not get stopped

498
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,600
 But I was causing a lot of attention walking up and down

499
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,840
 Uh fremont street dressed ahead to tow his elbows. Yeah, so real talk

500
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:50,440
 I think you might be able to make some money doing this especially in like the earlier hours on fremont street

501
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:55,240
 Not like 2 a.m. But like the 10 p.m. Yeah, yeah, no, I'm thinking like 9 or 10

502
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,240
 I'm thinking like early early nighttime

503
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,720
 And uh, but when the families are still out

504
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,000
 Yeah

505
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,680
 Because the people the people taking pictures with people on fremont street

506
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:09,320
 If you don't want someone to be naked in your photograph, you're out of luck

507
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:16,280
 Yeah, like you're just you're just out of luck yeah, or if you don't want like palm

508
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:24,040
 Crucifixes palm crucifixes are naked people like your two options crucifixes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So last time I was down there though

509
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,120
 I did stop and watch a a street magician

510
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:31,080
 How was it performed for a few minutes? He was really good. He was really good. Well, that's good news

511
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,120
 It's after some money in his bucket. He was great. It's hard

512
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:41,000
 Because there's there's music playing at all kinds of volumes the entire time. Sometimes it's super loud. Sometimes it's just loud

513
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:48,760
 This guy was a genius. I thought about that while I was watching him. He did it most of it. He did silently, right?

514
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,600
 That's that's what it would take. Yeah

515
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:55,560
 I saw a guy doing that that kind of like uh, they're all silver and money moves them kind of oh, yeah

516
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:01,400
 Yeah with a magic trick kind of attached to that and I was like, yeah, that's what we can do down there. But uh, yeah

517
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,160
 Yeah. Yeah

518
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:08,040
 Um, so yeah, I don't know it may or may not be my point. I think you should start doing this

519
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:14,120
 Just even just just a second time just to see what it's like to actually give it a shot

520
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:19,240
 Really? I think I also want you to go down there without getting a a spot reserve for yourself

521
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:23,320
 And I want to see if you get some shit for not having a reserved spot

522
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:29,000
 You probably will if you that's the thing if you do it with the intention of getting paid you won't get paid

523
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,800
 It's the people talk about it all the time

524
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,280
 Like when when when folks hit the skids and they're out on the street begging for money

525
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,000
 like the first day they feel like oh

526
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,400
 We're gonna be all right here

527
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,080
 And then after that

528
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:48,280
 It's this weird beginner's luck thing and it just gets really really hard fast. Yeah, you're right

529
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,360
 Yeah, that is a lot of stories. That is a lot of people's stories. You're right. I think it's all attitude

530
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,280
 I think it's all the attitude

531
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,720
 I think I think people can I don't even know how to say it because I don't know what it is

532
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,520
 But but I I think that people can uh,

533
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,000
 sense that

534
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,080
 What the one thing as soon as you are be holy energy as soon as you're actually desperate

535
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,120
 That's that rippy holy energy

 Really stumped him on that last one there paul chamberlain. He just left the room

560
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:30,360
 It was an unintentional wallachian impression. I did. Well, I guess wallachian is just a squirrel

561
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:34,200
 I did sound remarkably like wallachian

562
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:40,360
 I've never seen wallachian and a squirrel in a room together. So I I can't uh, I can't say for sure that he's not a squirrel

563
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,720
 There you go. I was trying to surprise you. It did play to my recorder

00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,080
 Go ahead jacob

573
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:31,320
 Oh, I was just going to tag on to the end of fremont street. Uh, I did see a uh

574
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:36,920
 While I was down there the other day. I did see a uh a parent who was watching a performance

575
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,680
 uh whose child I would guess uh,

576
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:46,600
 Six or seven was just sitting on the on the ground at fremont street

577
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:51,320
 While the parent was watching something kind of over there, you know a couple of feet away

578
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:56,040
 It's the first time i've ever wanted to call cps on anymore. Wait now

579
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:03,480
 Oh the parent was letting your small child just sit on the on the on the street on fremont street

580
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,160
 That's that's already disgusting. Yeah, it's pretty gross

581
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:13,800
 Yeah, I was I was not okay. What uh captured their attention so much. Was it one of the giant gorillas?

582
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,920
 No, it was just one of the bands. It was just it was just music going

583
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:21,080
 And the band was great. But did you see any of the giant gorillas while you were down there, man?

584
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,880
 No, they didn't see any giant gorillas. There really really wasn't actually a lot going on. I know

585
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:31,000
 I haven't been down there in months without seeing at least three or four giant gorillas

586
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,960
 I wasn't I was surprised at how little I mean we were there

587
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:39,160
 It was a you know, it was I was there from around uh, like 330 to five

588
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,800
 Maybe of like 5 30

589
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,400
 um

590
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,880
 I was surprised how little was going on. Like I said, there's a lot of uh,

591
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:51,880
 A lot of unhoused people just sitting in the spots that were designated for performers. Uh, just begging and then

592
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:56,920
 Some some some some some crucifixes and then the one guy painted in silver

593
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,920
 Doing his bit

594
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,640
 Oh, this was also maybe a tuesday

595
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,520
 Maybe don't wake up till later

596
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:08,280
 That's probably that's I mean, that's very possibly true. Yeah, also

597
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,880
 Uh, I also went to disco the other night

598
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,440
 Uh, oh nice and drove down

599
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:21,720
 And not since I moved here in 2008 where I stick those back roads through paradise and coval to get down to the venetian

600
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:27,640
 Uh, boy, uh, no one just absolutely no cars just driving around absolutely nothing

601
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:33,640
 I was like i've never seen the streets so empty. That's nice and then I pulled right into the link and uh,

602
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:39,720
 Got in the very first row of self-parking just a space wide open for me at seven o'clock at night

603
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,720
 um

604
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,080
 I was like, uh, the rumors are true. Vegas is dead

605
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,360
 Or everybody is avoiding matt

606
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,400
 No, I don't think that's it

607
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,960
 I could not believe how little uh,

608
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:59,640
 There was anyone around in las vegas. That's so like I drive down those streets all the time

609
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,120
 And they are packed all the time

610
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:06,280
 Yeah, yeah, I used to have to go down there all the time and it's packed all the time

611
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,060
 I had to go down there to get to fucking uh, the flamingo

612
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:13,800
 Which has gotten even harder to get to now, which is crazy

613
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:18,920
 I should note that they did start building the f1 track. So it could just be a lot of people just avoiding

614
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,320
 Uh, that's true

615
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:25,400
 Uh, but that that might be it that could be it but also yeah

616
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:30,680
 There was I mean I walked up and down the link. I was very surprised that that just kind of that's kind of crazy, man

617
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:36,280
 Yeah, yeah, that's kind of crazy. It was weird. It's anecdotal, but it's weird. Sure still

618
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:42,280
 Still i'm gonna go see disco tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it. I haven't seen it since uh since the revamp

619
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:47,720
 Oh, I think yes, I think you'll dig it a lot. I'm looking forward to it. I'll tell you though

620
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,120
 He recently added

621
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:55,000
 uh, our friends, uh d and uh, uh, uh, uh, uh grace

622
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:02,840
 Created, uh these clown characters, uh to perform around the venues that are around disco not in the venue itself

623
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,560
 Um, but two other people were doing their bit

624
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:10,760
 Uh where they're just oh, yeah, two giant disco balls wearing capes and disco mustaches

625
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,600
 and

626
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:18,120
 They were killing it. I I didn't know I literally didn't know who these people were which is weird. I'm surprised. Oh good

627
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,400
 There's two people that were just being uh that I need to find out who they were

628
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,920
 um

629
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:29,320
 But they were being hysterical so people came out of I always get nervous when people create bits like uh, like d and grace did

630
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,640
 And then uh kind of hand them off, right?

631
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:35,800
 The handoff always makes me nervous. So i'm glad to hear that it's going really well. Yes

632
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:42,680
 And so uh, they were just doing a thousand bits and that people nice falling over laughing and I was like, this is great

633
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:50,520
 That sounds oh i'm really looking forward to it. This is gonna be great. Yeah, it's a fun show. I really like that show

634
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:56,040
 Um, it's it's so different and uh, but it's really cool now. It's super it's super streamlined

635
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:00,200
 And it just cooks and our friend. Eli is the uh host

636
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,200
 um

637
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,480
 And uh, he's just so funny. He's just just so funny like a full person

638
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:12,280
 Yeah, well, that's one reason i'm going tomorrow is uh, our another friend of ours nick is in for eli

639
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,800
 I've seen nick do it. Nick's great at it. Nick is great at that. Yeah. Yeah

640
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:22,040
 Yeah, nick from uh, banana fame at scoop fest. Yes, we'll be in disco tomorrow. I drank his milkshake

641
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,920
 You did you drink it up?

642
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:32,840
 I left a little on the floor for for jonas's wheel, but a little surprise for jonas later

643
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:37,000
 Surprise

644
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,360
 But the answer is yes, i'll be dressing up like elvis tonight for my trick and treat i'll be elvis in my neighborhood

645
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,360
 And yes, I was just about to ask you

646
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,800
 How long are you because I know what time your trick and treat is starting today

647
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:51,320
 I saw your wife last night and she said that you guys are starting at 3 pm today

648
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,040
 How late are you planning on going?

649
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:58,120
 We usually go to like nine or ten. Usually the streets get pretty empty at nine

650
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,720
 Okay

651
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:04,520
 And then I just you just run in a front yard party until until until the streets get rolled up

652
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,560
 We have a set time here. It's it's six to eight

653
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:13,480
 Yeah, yeah, that's something the high mark but people come early some people have little kids they go early

654
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:19,320
 While it's still light out and then also just you know teenagers and all those other kids that go late and for me for the trick

655
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,320
 And treating I like the teenagers. Yeah

656
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,880
 Uh, oh, yeah. Yeah

657
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:29,160
 For for for magic trick purposes not for sure. Yeah. Yeah

658
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:34,280
 Yeah, it's it's better to deal with I don't know why matt thinks I mean something else

659
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:39,080
 I'm talking about his magic trick. These teenagers love his magic trick. You want an audience and we disappear

660
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:44,120
 You want an audience that has grasped the concept of object permanence? That's right

661
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,160
 Before you uh perform magic. That's correct

662
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:52,280
 That's why matt's baby magic didn't go well

663
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:58,360
 Yeah, and my my my uh, my big ringer when should I fix the clown in time for it to be a jump scare?

664
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:01,720
 That'd be great. And then uh, uh, I got a duck

665
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:08,360
 A wooden duck that uh, whoa pecks at cards and and snatches your card out of a deck of cards

666
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,080
 Oh, that's pretty good. Whoa

667
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,600
 Is it like one of the one of the happy bird things? Yes. Well, no, no, no nice

668
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:18,440
 It's like it's like a wooden it's like an ornate wooden. There's something you'd see it like a kitschy

669
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:22,280
 Like uh, like a cracker barrel lawn decoration, right?

670
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,080
 But it has it has a uh, uh

671
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:33,000
 Mechanical neck so you push the duck you push the duck's head down and it just and it just opens its beak and snatches a card

672
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,360
 Out of out of a deck of cards. Oh, I wish my wife had that

673
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:43,560
 What it's a what it's an old it's an old it's an old old magic prop. I just bought one. Oh, it is. Okay

674
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:48,440
 Yeah, it's a known thing that the duck. Yeah, the duck card picker dippy duck. I think it's called

675
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:53,960
 Yeah, yeah hippy duck dip dippy duck dippy duck dippy duck. That makes sense

676
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,520
 Hippie dippy duck is a whole different thing

677
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:03,320
 But yeah, you guys want to do a little scoop mail, yes, please let's go let's do a little scoop mail

678
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:06,920
 Message for you, sir

679
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,920
 From winter scoop. This is something i've been wanting to talk about for a week now

680
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:15,080
 The jewelry heist at the louvre has my brain screaming

681
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:19,320
 The guys use the construction ladder to access a balcony to bypass the front doors

682
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:23,000
 They were work vests and helmets and stole the jewelry after the place opened up

683
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,360
 Guests watched them do it and nobody said anything

684
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:31,320
 They just assumed that they were guys there working doing their job the balls on those guys

685
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:37,580
 That's from winter scoop winter scoop. I'm genuinely concerned that the robbers of the louvre are scoops

686
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:45,400
 I have been advocating bring a ladder for years that you can get in anywhere

687
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,200
 These people just took that to the nth degree

688
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:53,640
 So I heard also apparently that that kind of apparatus that long ladder

689
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,200
 Hooked to a little scooter cart kind of deal

690
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:02,760
 Is a lot more commonplace out in france because the buildings are so old that they don't have proper

691
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:07,080
 Places for you to unload cargo in a lot of these places. Sure. Sure

692
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:13,000
 So it's not like in the states if you saw somebody with a ladder up to a window you go

693
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,160
 Wait a minute

694
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,600
 maybe

695
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:20,360
 But I can tell you how you i'll tell you i'll tell you you need uh,

696
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:26,200
 One thing to make it where people don't give you that look in the states when you're when you're doing that and that is

697
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,160
 An orange road cone next to the ladder. Yeah, you're right

698
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:32,760
 I mean the if you put a single orange road cone next to the ladder you're done

699
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:37,880
 The safety vest thing really does a lot does a lot of work. Yep, and if you got a radio

700
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,360
 Like you can just flush this whole thing out

701
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:43,800
 I think this could happen all the time

702
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,000
 I'm really surprised this doesn't happen more often

703
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,440
 Like you just fit in you just fit in and go do whatever you want

704
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:56,280
 Um, let's see we got one

705
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:02,600
 I I know people that in magician's world who are thinking that uh, it's uh, it's a it's secretly a ploy to advertise

706
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,840
 Now you see me the new now you see me movie coming up

707
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,960
 Oh, it could be

708
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:12,920
 That's an elaborate uh elaborate setup, but well, uh

709
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:19,640
 Was was gabriella one of the uh, louvre robbers. She might have been she might have jesse isenberg is

710
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:23,320
 Donating a kidney as part of his promotional work, I guess

711
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,720
 What?

712
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,600
 Yeah, yeah, jesse isenberg is donating kidney to a stranger

713
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:37,320
 And the bit is they stole his kidney no, he's just big into what is it with these magicians and donating blood matt what's going on?

714
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:43,080
 Does playing with cards enough make you just say that oh I've got way too much blood in me

715
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:49,560
 Um, i'm blanking on her name. She made a documentary about this. Uh, basically like how it's been it's difficult

716
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,360
 uh, it's

717
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:58,600
 Some very healthy people have two functioning kidneys and if you are of very good health you don't need them both so to speak

718
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:02,600
 right, and there are a lot of people who need kidneys and um

719
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:10,760
 Just did the one on the satanic temple. Um, why am I blanking on her name? Oh, you don't want penny lane penny lane penny lane

720
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:18,040
 Uh did a doc on this, uh, she found it very difficult to try to donate your kidney to a stranger

721
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:22,040
 She I remember her doing this doc. I never got to see it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

722
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:29,240
 She did a doc about about uh, like rant not even uh random donations, but like random anonymous donations of of organs, right?

723
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,680
 Yes

724
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,320
 So basically like a lot of times you can put out calls if you need a kidney

725
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:38,360
 Then then your friends and neighbors or friends or friends you put on campaigns to do it and that's how most kidney donation works

726
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:44,520
 Uh, but when it comes to just saying like hey, uh, I have an extra kidney find someone who needs it for me

727
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:49,720
 That that operation wasn't streamlined but that has improved over the years

728
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:53,000
 and so now uh people who just kind of are

729
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,560
 You know if you're generally, you know

730
00:57:55,560 --> 00:58:01,320
 Like I said, you don't drink you don't really do do it in crazy shit and you can just be a healthy person

731
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:07,800
 Um, you can go go without go without one of those kidneys. Yeah. No one has ever asked me for one of my kidneys

732
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:14,120
 I don't know. I don't know why it's never come up. Yeah, one of your marinated kidneys

733
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:19,000
 Oh ten scoop in the chat mentions. Uh, it's even harder to donate if you bring it in a cooler

734
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:27,320
 I've been sitting on this thing for a week. Come on. It's a couple of youtube tutorials and now here's my kidney

735
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:31,320
 You made me fill my bathtub up with ice for nothing

736
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:37,320
 Cost me like 23 to get all that ice

737
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:46,200
 We got one from pigasus. Hey matt paul and jacob. Thank you guys and especially all the safety cones helper scoops and performers

738
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:52,520
 For putting together another incredible scoop fest. It was amazing seeing so many weird and wonderful scoops

739
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:57,400
 There is a great mix of new and old slash older scoops to hang out with and go on adventures with

740
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:03,720
 It's incredible how you cannot see a scoop for 18 months and pick right back up where you left off from the last scoop fest

741
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:10,280
 Podcast trivia battles and variety shows, especially hollywood squares were some of the very best ever

742
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:15,640
 Although i'm going to try to avoid being conned into sitting in the front from now on quick scoop fest

743
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,640
 It basically proves that i'm a potato

744
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:24,120
 Sunday night after scoop fest. I was in an elevator at the orleans when two very friendly and drunk women hopped on

745
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:29,880
 They noticed my hot dog necklace right away said how much they liked it and we chatted a bit between floors

746
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:34,120
 They were on vacation and clearly having a great time while I stood there being well me

747
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:39,880
 When I got off the elevator, I overheard one of them say to the other it's okay. I guess he doesn't want to party

748
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:45,720
 It wasn't until much later at mcmullin's that I realized what was actually happening in that elevator

749
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,240
 I just thought they were being polite. I'm already looking forward to the next one

750
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:53,000
 It was great meeting so many new scoops and reconnecting with returning scoop

751
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:59,880
 Thanks again for all the hard work you do to make scoop message a unique and fun gathering pigasus will fly again

752
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:06,680
 Fucking you in the face. That's roger aka the nest scream or nest creamer aka pigasus. All right

753
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:12,280
 Thanks rogers sounds like you saved yourself about six to eight hundred bucks, buddy. Good job. That's right

754
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:17,480
 It's really true. It's probably like you almost you probably were almost about to get rolled

755
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:23,480
 You never know in vegas and you know, I think orleans. It was 350. I thought well hell I think I think

756
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:27,320
 I know for myself just come on

757
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:33,400
 You just kind of default to the no way. This is not happening. This is some candy camera bullshit

758
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:39,880
 I have had multiple friends think that they were doing very well with women

759
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,980
 Uh than to realize on their own that they were talking to prostitutes

760
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:50,360
 That's happened to multiple friends of mine and they're sad every time it happens

761
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:55,320
 They still pay for the the sex and everything they still do that, but you know, they are

762
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,280
 It's a blow to their ego first

763
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:03,160
 First it's a blow to their ego then it's a blow to their you know, you get it. Good deal. Good deal fair

764
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:08,680
 Uh, let's see. Oh, there's another scoop or another uh, uh

765
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:15,240
 What is the thing we do scoop fest now we don't need to do the scoop best email right now from bear scoop

766
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:19,880
 Hey matt paul and jacob in the same vein as the he did what and other tales

767
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:23,320
 I decided to write in with my story of it's actually what?

768
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:29,960
 A time well one of many when my sheer stupidity revealed itself in true glory

769
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:35,000
 For context I live in a somewhat big city not far from vancouver bc

770
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,840
 And for years no decades my commute to and from work

771
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:43,480
 I would routinely see a box truck think a u-haul like a three or four ton with words

772
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:47,240
 diamond delivery plastered on the side and back

773
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:51,240
 Which of course, uh with of course a picture of a huge diamond in the middle

774
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:56,520
 Now, I don't know if I was just in the monotony of my commute every time I saw these trucks

775
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:00,760
 But I always assumed that I made up a story that of course these trucks needed to be this big

776
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:05,820
 They were delivering diamonds throughout my one to two million population bustling metropolis

777
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:11,560
 And the safe the safes used to do this probably take up most of the back of these trucks

778
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:18,040
 That was until my early to mid 30s when I saw one of these trucks parked in my townhouse complex outside of another unit

779
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:23,000
 I found this odd as why would a residential customer be having diamonds be shipped to them?

780
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,960
 Oh dear god as I see them taking plants furniture and other crap out of the back of the truck

781
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:32,760
 Diamond delivery is a delivery company not a diamond delivery company

782
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:41,320
 So anyway, that's my it's actually what story fucking with the face that's a bear scoop

783
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:46,520
 Thank you bear scoop, yeah, I uh

784
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:50,360
 For a little while when I was a kid, we used to have uh, swans

785
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,680
 Did you guys have swans?

786
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,360
 meal delivery

787
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:59,320
 Uh, yeah. Yeah, the like the refrigerated trucks and everything. I I thought it was delivering swans

788
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:03,880
 I thought these people are getting are getting geese

789
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:09,160
 Swans delivery service, yeah

790
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,160
 Yeah

791
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,160
 People used to eat swans, right? That's a thing

792
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:15,880
 I guess you could eat a swan. Why not?

793
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,120
 I mean you did anything with the right attitude

794
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:24,760
 We got one from slurping car. Hey motherfucker greetings face fuckers

795
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:28,680
 I'm writing in response to a conversation or a discussion at scoop fest about bits

796
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:34,920
 And how this community attracts people with a fervent love and commitment to silly bits. Yes

797
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:38,680
 It's it's one of the best things about our community

798
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:45,180
 One of my favorite things this year was being privy to scoops sharing their personal bits with each other giggity

799
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:52,120
 So that we could all go home with fresh road tested material that our spouses and loved ones would still not appreciate

800
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:56,440
 This jogged my my memory of a genius bit

801
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:01,560
 My high school friend nicole invented that I think some scoops will find useful in their everyday life

802
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,960
 Here is what she would do

803
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:08,600
 In the middle of class nicole would tilt her head up crinkle her nose and say

804
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:11,480
 Did someone just microwave popcorn?

805
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:18,520
 Then seconds later everyone sitting around her would start dry heaving and coughing uncontrollably with laughter

806
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:22,360
 While some managed to choke out a faint fuck you

807
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:25,400
 Let me explain

808
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:30,120
 This is a bit nicole and her older sister perfected in a prank war as kids

809
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:36,440
 When one of them had a rancid silent, but deadly fart and they wanted to trick the other into smelling it

810
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:41,960
 Through many iterations they found the foulest trick was priming each other

811
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:49,240
 For microwave popcorn scent as it lowered the victim's defenses and when one's olfactory is expecting a sweet

812
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:57,400
 Buttery scent of microwave popcorn the juxtaposition of the actual scent of a putrid ass gas kicks in bad

813
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,640
 There is also a delay

814
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:07,400
 So the victim will have taken a full-throated drag and had their lungs filled with the flatuous before their senses could

815
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:10,680
 Smell the the rock had actually been cooking

816
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,600
 That's not a result that's a prank

817
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,840
 this is

818
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:22,120
 It's a war crime. It's a hell of a move. I hate I hate what i'm listening. That's a hell of a move

819
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:27,640
 I don't this is actually this is worse than what the u.s is doing out in the pacific. Oh lord

820
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:34,600
 Bong rip levels of coughing and retching from my classmates nicole gave and still gives

821
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:39,480
 Zero fucks as she did this popcorn bit every goddamn time

822
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:44,520
 She farts and it was truly one of the funniest things to watch once you're in on the gag

823
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:48,360
 However, she did it to me so fucking bad with this the first time she did it

824
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:54,440
 Uh to me what i was 10 years ago that till this day. I went when I walked through an amc movie theater

825
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:58,920
 Feel free to use this bit at your own risk ps. I'm curious

826
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:05,240
 What other bits scoops might have to share uh, and if they could be uh, so good to share them in a fucking scoop mail format

827
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:09,800
 Figgity fucking your olfactory glands. That's slurpy ka-ay motherfucker

828
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:14,920
 That's really funny that that's commitment. I mean that is that is commitment for sure

829
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:19,480
 That is like geneva wants to have words with you

830
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:28,520
 That's that's just cruel. I mean to do that once is genius to really commit and do it all the time. That's crazy

831
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:31,000
 Yeah, it's pretty wild

832
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:35,560
 Uh, how are you guys on fart humor?

833
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:42,920
 Well, i'm very happy with fart humor when it is the uh, the sound of the fart

834
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:47,320
 And and the funny like oh this was this was a fart thing. Yeah. Yeah, this is great

835
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:50,760
 As soon as I smell something just rank

836
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:57,560
 I stopped thinking it's funny so quickly there is there is a my favorite murder animated

837
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:00,120
 A letter that somebody wrote into them

838
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:03,880
 About this guy. He was working at a post office

839
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:07,480
 And he let a fart that was so stank

840
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:10,680
 That the post office had to be shut down

841
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:17,800
 And the fucking bomb squad got called because they thought it was some kind of chemical contaminant coming in through the mail

842
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:22,200
 It is wild

843
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,440
 Wild

844
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:30,600
 Yeah, I never was like all that stuff of the farting is it feels like in the in the in the vein of like, uh,

845
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:35,720
 Like bag tagging or like drawing on the face of someone who falls asleep all that all that kind of stuff

846
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:39,080
 Puts me in a weird place. I don't like it. I'm with you jacob

847
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:43,720
 I think the noise is where the funny is the machines that make the sounds and all that are great

848
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:50,680
 But like didn't they just have a teacher get arrested for putting fart gas on his students all the time

849
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,280
 What?

850
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:53,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah

851
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:56,040
 There's a story about uh

852
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:59,000
 To the internet jacob

853
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:06,840
 When I typed in teacher arrested the autofill was for fart spray. Okay, this was it so share with it

854
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:13,080
 I don't know the exact what what happened, but uh, let's see when it comes to the smell stuff. That's when it starts to get

855
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:15,480
 criminal

856
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:23,000
 A 32 year old assistant teacher in west florence high school in south carolina was arrested for spraying a foul smelling substance

857
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:29,400
 Through the school's ventilation system his actions which occurred nearly over nearly a month long period

858
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:33,080
 Led to six students and over

859
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:40,360
 55,000 and damages to the school's air conditioning system lewis faced the charge of disturbing schools and malicious intent

860
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:43,240
 malicious injury to property

861
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:46,760
 Uh

862
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:51,240
 I question the quality of that ac system if fart spray

863
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,560
 If fart spray takes it out

864
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:56,840
 Yeah, that's not hepa approved. That's for sure

865
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:03,720
 This was and then have you seen the the the cruel thing that the people do for the people who are in the inflated costumes?

866
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:08,040
 Yes, because you got a little you got the vent there you fart into the fart at the vent

867
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:11,880
 Or you put some stinky at the vent and they're just stuck inside

868
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:16,600
 Can you imagine just farting on somebody's vent and they're just like

869
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:22,680
 I've seen people take like like fish bait and just throw it up against the fan

870
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:28,780
 My favorite example of that comes from the harlan williams

871
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:31,000
 rocket man movie

872
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,160
 Where he does it he he's connected via a tube to another astronaut

873
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:42,360
 He cuts apart and there's this whole back and forth where they're stuck in there with the fart. Oh

874
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:47,400
 Oh, it's funny when it's on tv and it's a sound and you can't smell it

875
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:50,440
 But I think you're right. Jacob when you smell it, it's just

876
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:55,580
 I just don't want to smell shit. Yeah, this is why I don't hang out in paul's bathroom

877
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:58,280
 Yeah

878
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:59,720
 Just don't want it

879
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,000
 Just don't want it

880
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,520
 What were you about to say matt?

881
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:06,600
 I thought I was at a kids halloween parade. Uh yesterday

882
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:13,000
 Where I saw a lot of the idea of seeing these adorable children being uh assaulted with farts is is really it's just not comforting

883
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:17,720
 Because you because you saw a lot of inflatable costumes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

884
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:21,240
 So if you yeah, you're going to get them just hit them with a little fart spray right on the

885
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:24,600
 That's it. They're done. Just do it the old-fashioned way and fart on them

886
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,640
 Just go in there and fart on them

887
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,120
 Let's do a little jock versus nerd

888
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:38,840
 I'm on the hunt for balls

889
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:45,480
 On the hunt for balls

890
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:51,320
 Explosion up the stairs. Oh, no, it's happening

891
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:53,880
 No, it's happening

892
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:55,880
 It's happening

893
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:58,040
 I'm gonna have to throw these socks away

894
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:07,560
 We got an old-school jock versus nerd coming to us today from king scoop king scoop has sent us a

895
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:11,240
 Timeline jock versus nerd. I think he sent us another one of these a long time ago

896
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,840
 This one also might be from a long time ago. I didn't see what the date on the email was

897
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:20,360
 Uh, but this is i'm going to give you an event and then i'm going to give you two other events

898
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:26,120
 And then you're going to tell me which of those happened closer to the primary event. Oh, right. Yeah, these are interesting

899
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:31,080
 So the first one and he he made this so I can't see the answers until I highlight them too

900
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,080
 So this is great head trippy

901
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:38,520
 Yeah, so the first one the first san diego comic con took place

902
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:43,160
 Comic con took place. So that's the main event. That's the primary event

903
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:50,680
 Is that closer in time to the berlin wall being built or the fall of the berlin wall?

904
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:55,000
 Ooh

905
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,640
 Uh paul, you want to go first on this one? You seem like you got a uh, sure

906
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:02,840
 Some got a handle on does anybody know when the berlin wall was built?

907
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:07,960
 Well, it came down in the 80s so before that

908
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:11,800
 I asked when it was built. Yeah, it was built before that

909
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:17,720
 But it's like the 90s or right out it was not built in the 90s

910
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:20,840
 It got built in like

911
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:24,520
 In like the 50s, right

912
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:28,840
 After the war right

913
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:35,320
 Oh boy, uh, it's gonna be close

914
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:41,400
 Close close close, uh, I guess i'm gonna say it's closer to the building of the wall

915
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:44,280
 Do you know when the first comic con was?

916
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:46,200
 78 I think

917
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,480
 oh

918
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:50,520
 Well, then I would also say it's closer to the to the building of the wall

919
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:57,640
 Matt what do you think so I have to get which event is closer to the wall or comic con

920
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:01,480
 Yeah, it's comic con is the is the primary event

921
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:06,520
 Is that closer to is it closer in time to the berlin wall being built or the berlin wall being taken down?

922
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:09,160
 I'm gonna say berlin wall taken down

923
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:12,680
 All right. So paul and I both think built matt thinks

924
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:15,880
 taken down

925
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:19,000
 It is the berlin wall being built, okay

926
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:24,920
 Comic con first done in 1970. Oh 70 was built in 61

927
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:28,040
 So off on that one came down in 89

928
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:30,760
 Okay

929
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:36,840
 Uh, let's see. We got uh, the first major league baseball world series took place

930
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:42,840
 Is that closer to joseph stalin coming to power or coca cola is first sold in bottles?

931
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:51,640
 Uh, i'll go first on this one. I think this is going to be closer to uh, the coca cola

932
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:54,120
 What what's the main event again?

933
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:57,320
 Uh major league baseball first world series, okay

934
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:00,360
 World series stalin or coke

935
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:02,440
 Yeah

936
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:05,400
 So i'm going world. I'm going, uh coke cola

937
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:08,040
 there's stories of like, uh

938
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:12,600
 I think it was like shoeless joe jacks in order for being like an early investor in coke

939
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,760
 So i'm gonna go with coke as well

940
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:17,880
 Really? Okay. I feel like coke is super old

941
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:20,680
 And so is the world series

942
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:27,000
 I'll just but this is this isn't coke. This is bottles. This is this is bottled coke. I'll go contrary and i'll say stalin

943
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,640
 All right. Let's see

944
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:33,660
 It is coca cola, uh world series 1903

945
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:37,640
 Stalin 1924 coke cola first bottled

946
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:39,640
 1894

947
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:46,040
 Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's it. Oh, that's the other bottling. I know. Okay. That's that bottling thing

948
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:48,760
 uh

949
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,760
 I think that's the non carbonated

950
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:56,840
 Bottling of coca cola and you had to you had to have the thing to add you had to have a nation into

951
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:01,320
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you had to add the seltzer water in maybe okay, um

952
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:07,880
 I think I might be I might be off on those dates. I should know this my my granddad worked for him. Um

953
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:14,040
 The first disco world novel by terry pratchett was published disc world. Is that closer to

954
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:20,520
 That does say disc world, you're right you got disco on the mind

955
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:25,080
 No, it's a uh, well, yes, also I have disco on the mind. Uh, yeah

956
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:33,000
 So anyway, uh disc world novel was published. Is that closer to israel becoming an independent jewish state or donald trump becoming president?

957
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:38,600
 I have

958
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:42,920
 I don't have a guess on this really at all. I know that terry pratchett is a fairly modern

959
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:45,240
 author

960
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:46,920
 So i'll say trump

961
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,840
 disc world was

962
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:50,760
 in the 80s

963
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,360
 Oh, okay

964
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,360
 I believe

965
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,160
 Late 70s early 80s

966
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:00,920
 Uh

967
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:10,280
 I'll go with israel. Yeah, of course this is about israel

968
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:14,120
 Matt I think it's also about israel

969
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:16,680
 Let's see

970
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:19,240
 Point for jacob donald trump, uh

971
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:26,060
 Disc world published in 83 right on that paul israel becomes an independent jewish state in 1948

972
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:30,440
 And donald trump becomes president in 2016. Okay, so there you go. Okay

973
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:37,480
 The first time a player wilt chamberlain scored 100 points in a basketball game

974
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:43,500
 Is that closer to orson welles war of the worlds being broadcast or facebook's founding?

975
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:49,400
 Oh

976
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:55,560
 Chamberlain scores 100 points with the still that's the 70s the big dipper. Yep

977
01:16:55,560 --> 01:17:03,000
 No three-point line just scored 100 points two points at a time that thing was in the 50s

978
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,880
 the world of worlds

979
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,880
 Yep

980
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:10,840
 And

981
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:15,640
 Facebook was found in the late 90s. I think facebook was like, yeah

982
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:22,760
 Something like that. Yeah, it had to been like yeah, very late 90s like 98 or something 97

983
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:26,200
 I'm gonna go with facebook. I think the war of the worlds is older than that

984
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:29,800
 I'll go with war of the worlds

985
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:32,520
 Oh

986
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:34,520
 You put me in a predicament

987
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:37,400
 I'll go

988
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:40,680
 I'll go facebook as well

989
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:42,840
 Let's see here

990
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:46,440
 War of the worlds poll gets a point. We go. Yay back on the board

991
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:48,500
 uh

992
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,500
 1960 or sorry, uh

993
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:56,440
 War of the worlds is that uh the hundred point score from wilt is in the 60s. It's 62 not in the 70s

994
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,920
 We were off on that. I also thought that was in the 70s

995
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:04,120
 Uh war of the worlds is 38 facebook 38 in 2004

996
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:09,960
 So, uh, basically every single date we said about anything in that question was wrong

997
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:15,880
 Yeah, we were just wrong about everything well and that and that tracks that I would get it right for not having the right math

998
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:20,920
 That's how it works the first ever video game tennis for two was created

999
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:27,240
 Is that closer to the ussr launching sputnik or the movie jaws opening in theaters?

1000
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:32,040
 Tennis for two is the video game. Is that closer to sputnik or jaws?

1001
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:40,700
 Sputnik was 60s jaws was what 78?

1002
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:44,680
 Something like that

1003
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:54,920
 And what do you think and what's the main thing the no the tet in the game, uh, yeah tennis for two

1004
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:57,000
 Tennis for two was like 60

1005
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,760
 I'll go with the sputnik

1006
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:05,320
 Your sputnik matt your jaws, yeah

1007
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:09,960
 Tennis for two

1008
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:14,520
 That's gotta be early I think sputnik i'll go sputnik. Yeah, it's earlier than you think

1009
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:17,240
 Let's see here

1010
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:23,420
 Wait, it's hard to read this, uh sputnik. Oh, it is sputnik. Yay tennis for two 1958

1011
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:26,700
 Uh, oh sputnik was launched in 57

1012
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:31,640
 Okay, and then jaws opened in 75. So sputnik was really close. Yeah

1013
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:38,600
 Rocky marciano retired having gone undefeated in 49 boxing matches

1014
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:46,920
 Is that closer in time to computer game space invaders being released or the gi bill is signed providing financial aid to veterans?

1015
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:55,640
 Rocky marciano closer to uh space invaders or the gi bill

1016
01:19:55,640 --> 01:20:03,720
 That's gotta be the gi bill i'll go i'll go gi bill i'll go space invaders just because i'm already losing this game

 I'll try space invaders, too

1018
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,920
 Let's see here. No, I think it's the original space invaders paul

1019
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:14,200
 Okay, oh you meant space invaders also. Yes

1020
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:17,320

 It's the gi bill. Oh

 Rocky is uh 1956 the gi bill is 1941 space invaders is 78

1023
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:33,160
 78

 Uh, let's see. Let's do one more dungeons and dragons was first published is that closer to the international space station being opened
