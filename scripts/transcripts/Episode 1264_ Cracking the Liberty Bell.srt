1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
 You want to go for it? Want to go for it? Twerk off right now?

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,840
 She goes, "Oh, I see a twerk off, all right."

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:16,280
 Oh, hello there! I am so glad you're here! It's time to thank you, the ice cream truck drivers!

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:22,000
 Thank you so much, ice cream truck drivers! Right now, I'd like to thank Dr. Scoop Little, Elkin Magic Scoop,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,920
 Fifi, Frankie's Tiki Scoop, Galactic President Scooper Star McScoopsalot, Ice Blue Scoop,

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,320
 I Wanna Scoop Baby, Jacob Dick Laker, Jake Schneider, Jason Klepper, and Jeff Harris!

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,120
 If you want to be an ice cream truck driver just like these fine folks and help deliver that fucking ice cream

 Here's a show!

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,320
 Hey, Johnny! Do you want to go to an ice cream social?

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,920
 Yeah, I'd love to!

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,520
 Great, let's go!

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,920
 Broom, broom, broom!

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,920
 Big sewer plate strikes again!

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,920
 No way! Did it happen again?

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,920
 Manhole cover messes up F1, uh, again.

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,920
 Stop it!

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,920
 Stupid ass.

20
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,920
 It's time for Matt and Mattingly's ice cream social in Las Vegas!

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,920
 That's Matt Donnelly! In Pittsburgh, that's Paul Mattingly!

22
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,920
 In Las Vegas, it's me, Jacob the Audio Guy! We're Preaching Fun!

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,920
 We are Preaching Fun.

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,920
 Yes.

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,920
 Let's get silly. Oh my god, Manhole versus car 2-0, huh?

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,920
 It was again, there was two different rounds of practice laps yesterday, and the second

27
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,920
 round of practice laps was called off because of a loose Manhole cover for the second time

28
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,920
 in three years.

29
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,920
 Two out of three years!

30
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,920
 Newman didn't pay this time to come to it, so at least that part didn't happen.

31
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,920
 That's crazy, though.

32
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
 That's good, at least.

33
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,920
 The money they spend on that thing, and then to just have that happen again, that's got

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
 to be.

35
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,920
 According to Newman, he got a hundred dollar F1 credit, which he spent at the store and

36
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,920
 got five-eighths of a hoodie.

37
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,920
 He got nearly all of a hoodie.

38
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,920
 I was, you know, like, I get these, uh, I'm doing a gig for F1, uh, this year, and we'll

39
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,920
 talk about it more in a sec, but on the break, I walked around and saw the store, and sure

40
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,920
 enough, you just see this beautiful merch, you know, booth, and you're like, "Oh, maybe

41
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,920
 I'll get myself a nice, like, F1 sweatshirt."

42
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,920
 And they're so expensive, and then you're like, "Wait, where am I, where am I going

43
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,920
 to wear this?"

44
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,920
 Right.

45
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,920
 Not only where am I going to wear this, but who's going to respect me in Las Vegas for

46
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,920
 wearing this?

47
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,920
 Oh, no.

48
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,920
 It is so strange, okay?

49
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,920
 So, like, there's so much local anger and hatred towards F1.

50
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,920
 Oh, yeah.

51
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,920
 Just a ton.

52
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,920
 Uh, was the Rio put up a billboard?

53
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,920
 We got 99 problems, but F1 traffic ain't one.

54
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,920
 Nice.

55
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,920
 Uh, you know, our pal, Jonas Robertson said a happy F1 to everyone.

56
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,920
 It's a picture of him giving two fingers to the camera.

57
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,920
 Um, and, uh, and I, and Jacob, you know, uh, your, your commute has been, you know,

58
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,920
 fucked up for weeks, right?

59
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,920
 Oh, yeah.

60
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,920
 Oh, my God.

61
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,920
 I'm just, I'm just losing hours out of my day every day.

62
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,920
 And so I am feeling guilt, Paul.

63
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,920
 I'm feeling guilt about, like, how fun and cool it is to be in the middle of F1 for the

64
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
 race.

65
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,920
 Hey, I understand, but this is the life of the performer, right?

66
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
 This is how it goes.

67
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,920
 Yeah.

68
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,920
 We have lots of our friends who are doing the stuff with the Sphere.

69
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,920
 The Sphere is sucking the very life marrow out of entertainment in Las Vegas.

70
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,920
 What can you do?

71
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,920
 You gotta ride the devil, the devil, the devil for a while.

72
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,920
 I don't know.

73
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,920
 Yeah, yeah.

74
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
 I don't know either.

75
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,920
 Paul Mattingly, gotta ride the devil.

76
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,920
 We gotta ride the devil.

77
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,920
 Uh, and that's what I tell everyone when I ride it, when I go.

78
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,920
 All right, guys, time to ride the devil.

79
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,920
 When the cab driver says, I can't drop you off at the West and the road is closed, I

80
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,920
 say, ride the devil, ride the devil.

81
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,920
 If we can get a Paul Mattingly ride the devil shirt in time, that'll be our Black Friday

82
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
 sale.

83
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,920
 Great.

84
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,920
 Great.

85
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,920
 That'd be a good one.

86
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
 Yeah.

87
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,920
 Black Friday.

88
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:19,920
 So, uh, Spiegelworld is a hired partner of Mercedes, uh, and for many years, uh, not

89
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,920
 many years, for now three years, um, they've been doing events here and also sometimes

90
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,920
 at the Miami location as well.

91
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,920
 And this is where, this is, this is, Jacob, you've been in the employee of Spiegelworld

92
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,920
 for quite some time.

93
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,920
 We've all been in the, in the employee of Spiegelworld for here and there.

94
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:42,920
 Um, this is my first time since the pandemic officially in their, in their employee.

95
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:49,920
 It is both amazing how much talent they attract in front of and behind the stage and how much

96
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,420
 there's attention of, of always of like, what are, what are we, what are we doing and why

97
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,000
 are we doing it?

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,560
 That's the whole thing.

99
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,620
 And yet, right.

100
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,360
 So what I'm a part of in Mercedes is like why you do hire a Spiegelworld is because

101
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,460
 they make strange decisions, right?

102
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,960
 So it's Spiegelworld, but they're like, Hey, you know, the circus act thing is pretty cool,

103
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,160
 but can you do something totally different for us?

104
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,080
 We want our Mercedes people to feel special.

105
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,880
 Their answer was let's build a ski lodge.

106
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,240
 Let's build a giant ski launch.

107
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,080
 Let's have a Yeti.

108
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,400
 Let's have fake snow going.

109
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,360
 Let's just totally transport people to something inappropriate to both Miami and Las Vegas.

110
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,360
 Right.

111
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,360
 Right.

112
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,400
 And people fucking love it.

113
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,400
 People.

114
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,600
 It is such a treat to the eye.

115
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
 They eat it up.

116
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,960
 It's, it's incredible.

117
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,960
 Ski Lodge.

118
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
 We are so jaded.

119
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,960
 Yeah.

120
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,400
 Ski Lodge was one of the best things about super frico.

121
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
 Yeah.

122
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
 Right.

123
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
 Oh, and it's still there and it's still, it's still rocking.

124
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
 It's still great.

125
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
 Yeah.

126
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,700
 Ski Lodge is super frico.

127
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:05,880
 I think there's just a market to expand on this and just grow it out.

128
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,320
 He just needs to open up ski lodge diners.

129
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:14,320
 No, Ross just needs to make some standout, some ski lodge diners.

130
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,400
 It's the diner part that he needs a little work on, but, um, why, because they don't

131
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
 know how to make food.

132
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,080
 The one diner they opened, they turn it into a steakhouse.

133
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,080
 So they're not there.

134
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,080
 They're diners.

135
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,080
 Oh, no, no, no.

136
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,920
 It needs to be pizza only, it needs to go the Chuck E Cheese route.

137
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,040
 You got already, you already got the animatronic abominable snowman.

138
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,560
 You add some other, you add some other animatronics.

139
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,640
 If you add a bunch of animatronics, but half the animatronics are live performers that

140
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,200
 pop out every now and then and freak people out.

141
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,700
 Holy crap.

142
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,920
 I was, I was, I need a meeting with Ross.

143
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,000
 Let me get a meeting with Ross.

144
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,680
 I need to sit down and we need to talk about this whole revitalization.

145
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,380
 You are accelerating like an F1 race car right now and I'm telling you to pump your brakes.

146
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,380
 You know what I'm doing?

147
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,380
 You know what I'm doing?

148
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,380
 What's that?

149
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,380
 I'm riding the devil.

150
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,380
 Riding the devil!

151
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,380
 That's what I'm doing.

152
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,120
 I was just to say, I was worried they might be listening to this, but as soon as you said

153
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,080
 Chuck E Cheese pizza, I'm positive they turned it off.

154
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,440
 Bullshit.

155
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,440
 It needs to happen.

156
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,320
 That guy who did Evil Pie said he was going to do it and he never did it because he dropped

157
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,580
 the fucking ball on a billion dollar idea.

158
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,400
 It needs to happen and it needs to be one of those things where you don't know, is that

159
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,480
 an animatronic or is that a real person, and that's going to be the best thing when that

160
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,080
 thing walks off the stage and freaks children out and scares everybody in the restaurant.

161
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,960
 Where are the children coming from?

162
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,920
 It's going to be a family friendly restaurant.

163
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,120
 I've lost track as to where you think this is happening.

164
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,480
 Where is this going?

165
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,600
 This is worldwide, son.

166
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,080
 Okay, okay, okay.

167
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,080
 Franchised.

168
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,080
 Not for the F1 track.

169
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
 I got it.

170
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,080
 Yeah, yeah.

171
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,080
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

172
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,080
 Was that what you thought I was talking about?

173
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,080
 Yep.

174
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,520
 Oh, I've, no, I've taken this story all the way.

175
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,520
 He's left that behind.

176
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,520
 No, this is my whole thing.

177
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,520
 No, no.

178
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,560
 Once you ride the devil, you go to different places.

179
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,560
 Very different places.

180
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,560
 Oh man.

181
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,560
 All right, all right.

182
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
 Ride the devil.

183
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,360
 Let's bring it back to the enchantment of this current iteration of the Ski Lodge, which

184
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,560
 has yet to reach its full animatronic potential.

185
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
 Go ahead.

186
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,640
 Well, there's no animatronic, so by potential, I mean-

187
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,640
 That's what I'm saying.

188
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,640
 Yeah, yeah.

189
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,780
 It has not reached its full animatronic potential.

190
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,080
 All those billionaires hang out and chat together anyway.

191
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,360
 Isn't he talking with Elon?

192
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,880
 You know, China's replacing their entire workforce with robots.

193
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,960
 Get on it, son.

194
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,680
 I don't think that's happening.

195
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,680
 I'll just-

196
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,680
 I'm-

197
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,960
 Doesn't seem like it is.

198
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,720
 Very hopeful and happy that it's not.

199
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
 No, I don't.

200
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
 I know, I know.

201
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:47,160
 For all the comparisons of our crazy, wily CEOs, there's a gigantic divide when it comes

202
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,160
 to-

203
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,160
 A gulf.

204
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,160
 A gulf of humanity.

205
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,160
 Yes.

206
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
 A chasm.

207
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,280
 A chasm of humanity.

208
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,100
 Respect for artists and all that kind of stuff.

209
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,100
 Did you see-

210
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,100
 Yes.

211
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,100
 He's such a chode.

212
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:06,960
 Did you see Elon got completely ratioed on Twitter recently, someone, and I was terrible,

213
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,760
 I can't remember the name of the lady, but she called him out and she was like, "This

214
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,240
 guy has everything.

215
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:21,800
 He's got the whole," you know, oh God, there he is, smoking a cigar with all the billionaires.

216
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
 He-

217
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,800
 Quit distracting Paul.

218
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,080
 No, it's fine.

219
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:30,760
 But he's got all the money in the world and yet he has no passions.

220
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,760
 He's not interested in literature or film or art.

221
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,860
 He's never even complimented a movie.

222
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,080
 He's never even talked about a movie he likes.

223
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,520
 And he got so butt hurt, he started listing movies and like, "This is a good movie.

224
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,520
 This movie's good."

225
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,520
 Oh no.

226
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

227
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,520
 Oh, that's terrible.

228
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,240
 He is such a loser, such a loser.

229
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,240
 Hold on here.

230
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
 Hold on here.

231
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,240
 We can fix this.

232
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
 Let's see here.

233
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,960
 Yeah, let's do this.

234
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:14,040
 Elon, buddy, don't list movies that you like when people say you don't like movies.

235
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,500
 That's a bad move.

236
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,720
 That's like listing your black friends.

237
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,080
 It works just as well.

238
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,080
 What are you doing?

239
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,080
 It's exactly the kind of move-

240
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,080
 If only you had black friends.

241
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,000
 It's exactly the kind of move.

242
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,640
 It's exactly how it read too.

243
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,400
 It came off so hollow and so ridiculous.

244
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,920
 He started talking about movies from like 2003.

245
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,320
 Titanic was a good movie.

246
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,320
 Yeah, that's exactly like the stuff he was like, "What?"

247
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,320
 News broke.

248
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,560
 Obviously there was going to become a trillionaire, right?

249
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,560
 Right.

250
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,560
 Right.

251
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
 Right.

252
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:56,160
 He wrote, "I will carry the light of consciousness to other planets and to Mars and beyond."

253
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,160
 Bullshit.

254
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,160
 Something like that.

255
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
 Yeah.

256
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
 Bullshit.

257
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,360
 Someone just wrote, "Can you just pay taxes on it?

258
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,920
 Can you just pay your fair amount of taxes on it?"

259
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,920
 Yeah.

260
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,920
 It was weird.

261
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,320
 It's like, if you think you take your trillions, which no one singular human should ever have,

262
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,120
 it is a sickness.

263
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:20,720
 Having a billion dollars seems like the weirdest, craziest thing in history.

264
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,000
 Having a trillion dollars, I don't even know what that means.

265
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 That's just it.

266
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,760
 It is the biggest flaw of Americans to not properly fathom the wealth gap and what obscene

267
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,760
 wealth means.

268
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,760
 Oh, yeah.

269
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,760
 It is the biggest problem.

270
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,720
 We should be ... I don't understand why we're not in the streets right now.

271
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,320
 We have a podcast where it's fall.

272
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,320
 Yeah.

273
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,320
 It's raining out.

274
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,320
 It's raining here too.

275
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
 Wow.

276
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,320
 Give me an hour.

277
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,040
 When it stops raining in an hour, I'll go to the streets.

278
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,040
 No problem.

279
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,040
 Yeah.

280
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,040
 Okay, great.

281
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,040
 Great, great, great.

282
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,040
 Yeah.

283
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,180
 A trillion dollars is meaningless, coffee bean scoop.

284
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,160
 It does lose objective reality for most human beings.

285
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
 We can't fathom it.

286
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,100
 I think we're all human beings.

287
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,100
 I don't think anybody can.

288
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,100
 Yeah.

289
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:07,800
 It is anti-capitalist because capitalism is money reentering the flow of commerce.

290
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,160
 These are weird dragons hoarding wealth that never gets recycled into the environment.

291
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,160
 It never gets back.

292
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,560
 It'll never trickle down.

293
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,360
 I don't want to get into it, but at any rate, he's a douche.

294
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,400
 Oh, that reminds me.

295
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:28,560
 And also speaking of hoarding wealth, we owe an apology as a podcast and as a group

296
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,880
 to Jake Paul.

297
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,840
 Last week we called Jake Paul a douche bag.

298
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:41,240
 He announced that he has just purchased a 364 carat diamond necklace ahead of his upcoming

299
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,400
 fight and it looks like diamond bullets hanging off of his neck.

300
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,920
 So sorry, Jake Paul, that we called you a douche.

301
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,800
 I think I said it about Logan Paul.

302
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
 Our bad.

303
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,240
 I think I said it about Logan Paul.

304
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,240
 They're both awful.

305
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,240
 They're both monsters.

306
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,240
 No.

307
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,880
 Paul, did you not hear what I just said?

308
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
 Let me tell you about his necklace again.

309
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,880
 Oh, wait.

310
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,880
 No, no, no.

311
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
 I miss heard you.

312
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,880
 Think of the children.

313
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,880
 I misheard you.

314
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,880
 Gold plated bullets.

315
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,880
 Gold plated bullets.

316
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
 Okay.

317
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,880
 Great.

318
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,880
 Oh, sorry.

319
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,880
 I got so wound up in my anger.

320
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,040
 Use that money to save this planet instead of worrying about putting it on other planets.

321
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:21,320
 Like that actually is enough money to probably do a lot for this planet.

322
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,240
 When I was a younger man, everybody could just have food.

323
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:31,760
 When I was a younger man and fully locked in with Star Trek and sci-fi and all that,

324
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:38,240
 I really was a proponent of space travel, and I still am to a degree.

325
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,720
 There have been great discoveries that we as a species have made through the advancement

326
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,040
 of space traveling technology.

327
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,120
 Velcro is just one.

328
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:58,700
 However, having said that, when I became a somewhat older, wiser man, have you guys ever

329
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,280
 heard Gil Scott Heron's, "YD's on the Moon?"

330
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,280
 Yes.

331
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,280
 It's perfect.

332
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,080
 It's perfect.

333
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,920
 That always keeps resonating in my head whenever I hear these motherfuckers talking about going

334
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,920
 to space.

335
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,920
 It's like, man, we've got way more shit to handle here.

336
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,000
 It's literally because they don't know what to do with their money.

337
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,640
 It is too much money because when you have hundreds of millions of dollars, you can afford

338
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,940
 every single house that you want on the planet.

339
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,240
 You can travel privately to every single place on the planet.

340
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,760
 You can afford every single meal that anyone could possibly prepare on the planet.

341
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,360
 You can afford everything, every watch, every piece of clothing, every car.

342
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,320
 I always say you don't have to consider money.

343
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,880
 Money becomes not a consideration in life.

344
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,880
 It's crazy.

345
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:47,320
 The only reason to go higher is strictly insane ego bullshit.

346
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,800
 To want that insane ego bullshit and still want to do nothing or barely anything for

347
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,920
 humans on the planet is just ridiculous.

348
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,400
 Yeah, it's grotesque.

349
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,400
 All right.

350
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,120
 But you can't accumulate.

351
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,520
 There's no great fortune without some great crime.

352
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,360
 That's what it comes down to.

353
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:12,360
 Also, just bitching about these things and not acting on them, that's just a waste of

354
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,840
 our time and your time.

355
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,960
 We here at Matt and Madeline's Ice Cream Social, we want to act on this.

356
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,320
 Here's what I propose.

357
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:30,240
 I propose that our Patreons give each of us $1 billion and we're each going to use that

358
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,340
 billion dollars as we think a billionaire should.

359
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:41,520
 Do you know how hard pressed I would be to even do this podcast if I had even a million

360
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,640
 dollars in my bank account?

361
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,000
 Oh, nothing.

362
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,240
 Nothing will stop me from wanting to hear the sound of my own voice, Paul.

363
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,040
 There isn't a bad amount of money on the planet.

364
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,040
 That would be really fun.

365
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,600
 If I had like crazy money, I would be setting up random live events with us all the time.

366
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,800
 That's what we would do, actually.

367
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,800
 That's true.

368
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,800
 That actually is.

369
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,760
 We would just just do events all over the place.

370
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,600
 That's why a lot of these celebrity podcasts are making that loot and catching on because

371
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:14,360
 they have the money to go set up live events all over the world and get more interest.

372
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,160
 Amy Poehler did her first live podcast.

373
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,160
 It's pretty great.

374
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,160
 Go check it out.

375
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
 I listened to it.

376
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,160
 Man of Scalco.

377
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,160
 Is that?

378
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
 Did I say that right?

379
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,960
 They said no, but I don't have a I don't have a better way to say it.

380
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
 Man of Scalco.

381
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,960
 Meta Scalco.

382
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
 Meta Scalco.

383
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,960
 I don't know.

384
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,960
 Medicine.

385
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
 Calico.

386
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
 Calico.

387
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,960
 Calico.

388
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:46,560
 So anyway, Preachingfun.com, we need three billion dollars after Patreon fees.

389
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,760
 Sebastian Meta Scalco, especially nailed the last name and blew the first name with the

390
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,320
 hard part versus the easy part there.

391
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,320
 Sebastian Meta Scalco.

392
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
 That's so funny.

393
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,200
 I only listen to the last name because that's the part that I just have no idea.

394
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
 Yeah.

395
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,200
 Yeah.

396
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
 Yeah.

397
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
 Or go to will show them.org.

398
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,200
 Oh my God.

399
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:11,480
 And and we can show how it's done.

400
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,480
 Org.

401
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,720
 It lemur creamers with more animatronics, it would be more animatronics as soon as I

402
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
 had like crate.

403
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,680
 If I had crazy, I would have me a showbiz pizza slash Chuck E. Cheese.

404
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,640
 I'd have you would have a basically an animatronic music.

405
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,640
 It would be.

406
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,120
 I've got that showbiz pizza.

407
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,720
 I've got that Chuck E. Cheese.

408
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,800
 I've got that combination showbiz pizza and Chuck E. Cheese.

409
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,440
 It would be both for sure.

410
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,840
 I would have all of them.

411
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:43,160
 I'd have Chuck E. and the and the pizza time theater band with Pasquale and all the other

412
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,800
 dips and I'd have everybody with the rocket fire explosion.

413
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,800
 Forget about it.

414
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
 Oh, man.

415
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
 Guys.

416
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
 Amazing.

417
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
 Some sense really come up in the chat.

418
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,480
 I mean, if you take a billion, we usually get at least, you know, 200 people to come

419
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,480
 out to Scoop Fest.

420
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,280
 We just charge five million a ticket.

421
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
 It's done.

422
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
 But billion.

423
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
 Done deal.

424
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,280
 All right.

425
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:08,960
 I'm going to tell you what, for the five million dollar VIP ticket, yes, you're going to get

426
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,400
 a lot of attention from us.

427
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,320
 You would get away with a lot of personal attention.

428
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,400
 You would get away with a lot.

429
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,080
 Speaking of which seems to be the case with our entire governmental system.

430
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,400
 Speaking of five million dollar Scoop Fest.

431
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,400
 Yes.

432
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
 We have a guest here.

433
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
 We're going to have have him pop on here.

434
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:36,240
 JD, would you unmute yourself, please?

435
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:44,040
 I said, JD, would you meet yourself, please?

436
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,040
 Good to see you, JD.

437
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,040
 How are you?

438
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:52,240
 I'm going to leave that entire pause in everyone's going to assume like some episode error happened.

439
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,240
 I'm good.

440
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,240
 Very good.

441
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:01,800
 We're we're working on the documentary and we're going to launch a go fund me to kind

442
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,960
 of help raise some finishing funds.

443
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,880
 So remind everyone about the documentary in general.

444
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,880
 What is the documentary?

445
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,760
 The documentary is about the Scoops.

446
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,760
 So we were at Scoop Fest.

447
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,440
 A lot of you there did interviews with us and we got some great footage and we're probably

448
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,360
 about seventy five percent to eighty percent there as far as what we need.

449
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:30,080
 Right now, we have like a four and a half hour rough cut that we still need to fill

450
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,080
 in those spots.

451
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,480
 So we need to interview Jacob, S.J., Matt, Sarah and Penn.

452
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,560
 We couldn't get Penn at Scoop Fest because he was sick.

453
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,160
 Oh, you get that crew back to Vegas.

454
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:47,160
 They were a volunteer crew, friends of friends, and they're all in L.A. So to get them back

455
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,840
 at some point when everybody's schedule lines up and get all these interviews again, we

456
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,740
 also need a little bit cash for our art musicians.

457
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,640
 So Spadoni is doing the music.

458
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,560
 We got Brogan and Ryar doing some logos for us and we want to make sure that people get

459
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,520
 a little cash in their pocket.

460
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:13,520
 And then at the end, we're going to submit the film to festivals, actual festivals.

461
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,880
 So we want to take it old school like we used to do about twenty five years ago and hopefully

462
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,160
 we can travel around and show it or maybe we'll end up selling it.

463
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,160
 We'll see.

464
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,160
 Oh, it's so exciting.

465
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,160
 Yeah, it's super fun.

466
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,160
 So I'll post the GoFundMe link.

467
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:40,080
 We're going to post the GoFundMe link in the chat here so the people on Zoom can see it.

468
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,600
 And we will post that along with the episode description for this very episode that everybody

469
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,960
 is listening to and of course, all over the social medias and everything.

470
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:55,480
 So yeah, go check that out.

471
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,960
 This is the part of the show where we listen to JD figure out how to copy and paste.

472
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,200
 It's pretty great.

473
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
 It's solid.

474
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
 It's solid material.

475
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,000
 He turned his camera off for a second.

476
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,260
 It's pretty exciting.

477
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:16,240
 The coolest thing, the coolest thing is that, you know, with any luck, this gets a little

478
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,640
 traction somewhere and generates a little buzz.

479
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,800
 And then who knows what could happen with the podcast?

480
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:29,400
 Maybe we could start doing some live shows around the country tour with the with the

481
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:36,800
 movie maybe even the goal is for two thousand six hundred dollars.

482
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
 That's the start.

483
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,040
 The way that GoFundMe tears it up.

484
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:46,600
 So the full goal is ten thousand, but you need to pay it out before that.

485
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,600
 Got it.

486
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,600
 OK, OK, OK.

487
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,920
 It's actually it's way better than like Kickstarter or anything, especially for this.

488
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:57,240
 We don't have to get randos to find it and be interested that we can kind of community,

489
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,720
 hopefully community raise some money for that.

490
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,720
 It's a reasonable.

491
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,160
 It's a reasonable amount of money to fundraise.

492
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,200
 It's not it's not it's not astronomical.

493
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,200
 Yeah.

494
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:11,320
 And, you know, I kind of maxed out my friend JD for the production.

495
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,320
 Right.

496
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,320
 Yeah.

497
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,840
 If you promise to take the light of consciousness to Mars and beyond, you can ask for a trillion

498
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,840
 dollars.

499
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,840
 Do you know that?

500
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:25,240
 What would you do with the other $999 billion?

501
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,240
 Don't worry about that.

502
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,640
 We got that covered.

503
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,840
 We have a very interesting experiment we're going to do.

504
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,560
 I think a lot of people are going to be very interested.

505
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,560
 I have some plans.

506
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,560
 I have like, you know how you can like eat sushi off of people at fancy restaurants,

507
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,560
 JD?

508
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,560
 Yeah.

509
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,480
 Just like a lot of people, like a lot of people like a train track, so many people sushi on

510
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,480
 them.

511
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,640
 It's called I'm going to launch my dream, which is spicy tuna train to Chicago, where

512
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,440
 we just eat our way.

513
00:22:51,440 --> 00:23:01,040
 I'm on, hey, hey, we're on a spicy to the train to Chicago and the musical rights itself

514
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,520
 and those rights are just hours afterward, like we can't stop making money once we do

515
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,520
 it.

516
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:12,560
 Can't stop, won't stop, but it all starts with this GoFundMe.

517
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,560
 Yeah.

518
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:21,400
 And we're going to get it in front of Netflix because we have connections there and, um,

519
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:28,960
 we have, we know people from, uh, the, uh, the nearest film festival in, uh, Tribeca

520
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,960
 in New York.

521
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,960
 Wow.

522
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,460
 Can we ask you, JD, when you go in front of your friends, because I know you brought,

523
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:39,900
 you brought investors to see me at the Magic Castle, um, what do you tell them when you

524
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,880
 tell them you want to make a movie about us?

525
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,520
 What do you say to these people?

526
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,680
 That's, that's very funny that you bring up.

527
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,960
 So, uh, those were our producers that you met and they were at Scoop Let's with us.

528
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,800
 And, uh, I told him I wanted to do this and he just said, yeah, I'll help you.

529
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
 Whatever you need.

530
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
 Let's do it.

531
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,600
 And I said, okay, Matt's going to be in LA.

532
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
 Let's go take a look.

533
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,200
 And he was the Hemen and Han about it.

534
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
 He wasn't very interested.

535
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,200
 I said, you know, send them the podcast.

536
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,200
 They didn't listen to it.

537
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:10,760
 And then when they saw you, when they saw you perform, I saw him get excited.

538
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,760
 They're already smart people.

539
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,760
 Yeah.

540
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,760
 And he went, oh, now I kind of get what you're doing.

541
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,760
 And that was just, yeah, yeah.

542
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,880
 He got excited and, and, you know, he's one of my oldest friends in the world.

543
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,080
 And once I saw him, he got up on stage with you doing something and you saw the eyes light

544
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,080
 up.

545
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,080
 And then I had them.

546
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,080
 So good.

547
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,920
 And then I pulled out the fish and the light bulb turned up.

548
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,600
 The clown was in that show.

549
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,040
 Matt busted out the clown jump scared clown.

550
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,760
 I think I had a fish and a clown in that one.

551
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,760
 Yeah.

552
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,760
 Yeah.

553
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,280
 You know, me production, production, baby, production, production, production.

554
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,280
 Yeah.

555
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:52,800
 But my, my pitch to people about it is like, this is a very unique community that I'm just

556
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,120
 starting to find out about.

557
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,200
 And now I've just found out about a doctor scoop and all the stuff they do there in holidays.

558
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,480
 It's fucking amazing.

559
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:07,760
 And the, the amount of love and acceptance and joyfulness is that in this community just

560
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,760
 blew me away.

561
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,080
 And that's why I asked to do it.

562
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,000
 If this doc can get made and really get out there and a lot of people can see it, it will

563
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,880
 be doing Matt and Paul and I, a personal favor on a different level that I think anybody

564
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,440
 has really thought about.

565
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,200
 And that is when we have to explain to people who aren't in this community, what this community

566
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:36,280
 is like, we can now just point at a documentary and say, watch this because I don't know how

567
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,280
 to explain it.

568
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,280
 Yeah.

569
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,280
 Yeah.

570
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,280
 Yeah.

571
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,280
 That was the hardest thing.

572
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,280
 People are like, what are you doing?

573
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,280
 And even the scoops when I, when we were at script fest and get everybody to, uh, sign

574
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,280
 the releases, several people are like, I don't know what you're doing.

575
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,280
 What is this?

576
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,280
 What is this about?

577
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,280
 And then I have to try to explain it that this is about exploring this, this amazing

578
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,280
 community.

579
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:54,880
 That's grown organically over the past 10, 12 years and they're like, Oh, okay, that

580
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,880
 makes sense.

581
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,880
 Yeah.

582
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,880
 Um, yeah.

583
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:04,360
 Myra makes a good point in the chat, which is like a scoop speeding up outside of scoop

584
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,360
 fest.

585
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,360
 Like without us, they just all get up together and meet with each other.

586
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,520
 We love seeing that and people let us know that they got together.

587
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,520
 It's like the coolest feeling.

588
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,520
 Yeah.

589
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:19,160
 We got a couple of those stories in their interviews and I was just, like I said, it's

590
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
 the whole community.

591
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,360
 Like Carl, Carl Jabelbis, Carl is welcome to this community and he's not welcome in

592
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,360
 any other community.

593
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:31,400
 He's not welcome to hang out with anyone and there's a tolerance level in this community

594
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:36,720
 that's higher than anyone he's ever worked with any group, any bowling team he's joined.

595
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:44,400
 I mean, any poker club, like they've all gotten rid of him and his family, he's still just

596
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:52,920
 thriving here.

597
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,800
 We should say that a JD's plug for the go fund me is also sponsored and it's brought

598
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,920
 to you by the following, the following.

599
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,920
 That's right.

600
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,920
 It's brought to you by the following sponsor.

601
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,920
 No heavens.

602
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
 Today's show.

603
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,920
 Nope.

604
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,920
 I'm sorry.

605
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:13,840
 The documentary go fund me is brought to you by Billy from Boston's baked bean ice cream.

606
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,840
 That's right.

607
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,840
 That's from Florida man in 2024.

608
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,480
 That's Billy from Boston's baked bean ice cream.

609
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,120
 Hey there.

610
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,120
 How you doing?

611
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,120
 I'm Billy from Boston.

612
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,880
 I got baked beans, ice creams.

613
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,880
 You want some?

614
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,880
 Yeah.

615
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,880
 You would chuckle head.

616
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,880
 Yeah.

617
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,040
 All right, go ahead and sample a little taste, how's your sister?

618
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,120
 Won't you let her know I'm looking for, huh?

619
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,120
 Yeah.

620
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,120
 Trying to talk to her.

621
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,120
 I'm trying to talk to your sister.

622
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,120
 What's going on?

623
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,120
 Yeah.

624
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,120
 Yeah.

625
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,120
 I just came in for ice cream.

626
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,120
 How did you know I had a sister?

627
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,920
 Oh, I can tell by the rings on your neck, you brony.

628
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,520
 All right.

629
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:57,240
 Well, yeah, if I don't have to pay, if I can just get ice cream.

630
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,240
 Oh, you're going to pay.

631
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,240
 Oh, you're going to pay pal.

632
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,240
 Yeah.

633
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,240
 Oh, you're going to pay big time.

634
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,240
 How about them apples?

635
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,240
 Whoa.

636
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,440
 Hey bro, did you get me my ice cream yet?

637
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,440
 You know what?

638
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,440
 You know what?

639
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,440
 Get back in the car.

640
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,440
 You know what?

641
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,440
 Bring her over here.

642
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,440
 Hurry up.

643
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,440
 Oh no.

644
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,440
 That's your sister I'm trying to talk at.

645
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,440
 Hey, come here.

646
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,440
 Come here, cute sister.

647
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,440
 Come here.

648
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,440
 Oh, who are you?

649
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,800
 Don't worry about it.

650
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,320
 I'm the guy.

651
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,320
 Come on over here and have some of my baked pilliaries.

652
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,320
 How mysterious.

653
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:35,040
 I got some mystery baked bean ice cream in the back.

654
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,040
 I can't wait.

655
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
 Oh, you got to wait.

656
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,440
 That's my favorite kind of ice cream.

657
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,440
 Yeah.

658
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,440
 Yeah.

659
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,440
 All right, pal.

660
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,440
 It's on the house.

661
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,440
 Cause I got a date with your sister now.

662
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,440
 All right.

663
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,440
 Thank you.

664
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,240
 Billy from the baked bean ice cream company.

665
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,240
 You're welcome.

666
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,240
 How about them apples.

667
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,240
 I'll get my own ride home, Matt.

668
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,240
 I'll see you later.

669
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,240
 That's right.

670
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,360
 I'm going to crack her like the Liberty bow.

671
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,360
 What do you think?

672
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,560
 Yeah, uh, what?

673
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,560
 Philly.

674
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:06,360
 I was just going to say the Liberty bell is not a Boston reference.

675
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,360
 No, it's Boston.

676
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,360
 It's totally Boston.

677
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,360
 It's totally.

678
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,680
 I'm going to, I'm going to get her wedded in a T the T Harbor.

679
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,680
 There we go.

680
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,680
 How about that?

681
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,680
 Yeah.

682
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
 Yeah.

683
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,680
 Yeah.

684
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,680
 Boston teapot.

685
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,680
 I'm already halfway there.

686
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,680
 Yeah.

687
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,680
 I'm going to turn her into a fricking tea party.

688
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,680
 Oh, it's the same color too.

689
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,680
 That's right.

690
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,680
 Get ready.

691
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,960
 I'm going to hear about my sister's tea Harbor.

692
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,400
 Oh, you don't know.

693
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,360
 I can tell you already have a bunch since last Christmas.

694
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,840
 Well, we all, of course, every Christmas we update the family on our D harbors.

695
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,840
 That's a given.

696
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,120
 Nobody's talking to you anymore.

697
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,120
 Stack of dimes.

698
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,760
 You need to hit the arches.

699
00:29:43,760 --> 00:30:10,560
 That was more drifting than the Tokyo drift on that accent there.

700
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:18,200
 I mean, it was like, ah, we're going out to the, to the barber shop.

701
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,600
 We're going to go get a bar.

702
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,400
 We're going to go to the barbershop.

703
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,000
 You think you're better than me.

704
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:32,520
 You think you're better than me, eh, eh, Boston tea party, fasten pack your car.

705
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,520
 That's it.

706
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,520
 There you go.

707
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,120
 Car in the habit.

708
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,960
 Bring your sister over here.

709
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,960
 Pencil neck.

710
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,960
 Come over here.

711
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,960
 Dimes.

712
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,520
 Let's go back pack your car.

713
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,080
 That last sponsor ran so long.

714
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,120
 It's time for the next sponsor.

715
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,000
 Oh jeez.

716
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Wow.

717
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,440
 Boston represent, really brought it home.

718
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,440
 Okay.

719
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,400
 I have, I have a serious, your mayor Quimby, you need a mayor Quimby to get through.

720
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,200
 Is that, is that, but they're not, he's Boston, he's Kennedy's Massachusetts.

721
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,200
 He's Kelly.

722
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,200
 Does that work?

723
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,200
 Yeah.

724
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
 Better than what you did.

725
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
 Yeah.

726
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,200
 Oh my God.

727
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,400
 Well, if I had known that I would have done that.

728
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,400
 All right.

729
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,400
 All right.

730
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
 Take two.

731
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,400
 Hey there.

732
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,360
 I got a Boston baked bean, a delicious ice cream.

733
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,560
 Go ahead and sample some.

734
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,520
 How about them apples?

735
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,520
 Would you like some?

736
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,700
 Hey, I'd like to date your sister.

737
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,240
 Bring her over here.

738
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,720
 Nobody's talking to you anymore.

739
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,000
 Stack of dimes.

740
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 Come over here.

741
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:43,400
 I'm going to crack you like the Liberty bell still out, Liberty.

742
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,400
 Come on over here.

743
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:50,800
 I'm going to go under and through you like the great arch, like the great arch.

744
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,160
 No, that's St. Louis.

745
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,160
 No, come on.

746
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,160
 I'm sure that was there.

747
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,960
 I'm pretty sure I could be wrong.

748
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,160
 Park your car, park your car, spot on.

749
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,400
 Get me some ice cream with baked beans in it.

750
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,760
 Your accent is so authentic.

751
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,120
 I'm so desperate to crack you like the Liberty bell.

752
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,120
 You freak.

753
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,600
 You little freaky thing.

754
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,680
 You, you weird little sister girl.

755
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,160
 Come explore my Grand Canyon.

756
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,160
 Yes.

757
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:26,720
 Just like our majestic Grand Canyon, one of the wonders of Boston, the Grand Canyon, one

758
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,120
 of the wonders of the, of the world, Boston's Grand Canyon.

759
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:34,800
 Oh look, it's the Mississippi, here in Boston.

760
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,680
 Turns out it's your mom.

761
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,720
 Your mom is the Grand Canyon of Boston, you stack of dimes.

762
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,440
 Planes can see you when they're flying overhead.

763
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,440
 They go, hey, check it to your left.

764
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:52,760
 Look out the window and you might just see the most cavernous VJ that ever walked.

765
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:59,080
 You've actually got grad students still stuck in your vaginal cavity.

766
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,880
 I know you do.

767
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,120
 Don't lie about it.

768
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,760
 I'm going to crack you like the Liberty bell.

769
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,560
 Oh, good news.

770
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,360
 Twitch just gave us a big upgrade on our, no, nevermind.

771
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,360
 They took it away.

772
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,360
 Oh, no.

773
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,360
 Oh no.

774
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:21,120
 We're going to crack them like a stack of dimes.

775
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,320
 I love stack of dimes.

776
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,960
 I think that's my favorite insult.

777
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,440
 I think I'm going to just keep using it.

778
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,520
 Production meeting.

779
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,520
 Good.

780
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,520
 Okay.

781
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,480
 No, I have a serious question for JD.

782
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,080
 Ah, okay.

783
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,480
 JD, come on back.

784
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,400
 This is good because we were supposed to put it in the last episode, so now we're putting

785
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,400
 them twice in this episode.

786
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,400
 Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.

787
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,400
 Unless he left.

788
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
 Did he leave?

789
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,400
 No, he's there.

790
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
 He's there.

791
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
 He's on mute.

792
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,400
 Oh, there he is.

793
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,880
 So JD, I am a physical media snob.

794
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:03,480
 Is there a chance that there is a tier for production of a DVD or a Blu-ray?

795
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,480
 There's no tiers on a GoFundMe.

796
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,480
 Huh?

797
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,520
 There are tiers on a GoFundMe's.

798
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,520
 Aren't there?

799
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,520
 Oh, no.

800
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,520
 I'm thinking Kickstarter.

801
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,520
 Yes, you are.

802
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,520
 I'm thinking Kickstarter.

803
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,520
 Sorry.

804
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,520
 I got confused.

805
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,520
 Paul, I'm in the same boat with you.

806
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,520
 I love physical media.

807
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,720
 I like buying music on vinyl.

808
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:24,140
 So I have two goals with this, and one of them definitely is to put it to Blu-ray.

809
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:28,920
 And the other one is to get your album printed to vinyl.

810
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:33,720
 Well, that's good because we owe like 25 people that.

811
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,440
 We owe people some vinyl copies.

812
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,440
 We really do.

813
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,080
 That could kill two birds with one stone.

814
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,640
 I still feel bad about that.

815
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,280
 That's like one of the only things we've ever kind of really fucked up.

816
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,040
 I think it's the only thing that we ever missed.

817
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,040
 Yeah.

818
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,040
 Like never fully missed.

819
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,040
 And people are very kind about it.

820
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,080
 The company that we were going to use to make the vinyl no longer is a company.

821
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,680
 Yeah, that's a strike against this.

822
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,680
 Yeah.

823
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,800
 It's actually pretty easy to do nowadays.

824
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,320
 There's lots of companies that will do it for you.

825
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,400
 It really has changed even since we recorded the album.

826
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,880
 Like it's a lot more prevalent even in just a couple of years here.

827
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,880
 Yeah.

828
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,680
 We recorded the album 18 years ago.

829
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,680
 So yeah.

830
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,680
 I did.

831
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,680
 Oh, that'd be awesome, JD.

832
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,920
 But don't need doing the music for the documentary as well.

833
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,920
 Tag that on, make it a soundtrack, collaboration album, whole big thing.

834
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,920
 Yeah.

835
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,920
 We'll figure it out.

836
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,920
 Deluxe haste book thing.

837
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,920
 Yeah.

838
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,920
 I would love to do that kind of stuff.

839
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,120
 I do love comic books and stuff like that.

840
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,120
 Yeah.

841
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,680
 And well, with you mentioning there's a four hour rough cut already, are we going to be

842
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,640
 able to get like behind the scenes deleted footage and all that too?

843
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,640
 That's what I'd love.

844
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,640
 JD, I think what Paul's asking for is final cut.

845
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,640
 Can he have...

846
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,640
 Yeah.

847
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,640
 Final cut.

848
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,640
 I do not.

849
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,640
 No.

850
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,640
 Okay.

851
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,640
 Last question.

852
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,640
 What's the working title?

853
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,640
 Is there a working title?

854
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,920
 Working title right now is just Hey Scoots the Movie.

855
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,520
 I haven't come up with anything better, but I like it and it kind of, it is what it is.

856
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,520
 Yeah.

857
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,040
 It says everything and it directs people to our website.

858
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,040
 So...

859
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,040
 JD.

860
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:13,040
 Paul, always thinking about shuffling people to their own website.

861
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,040
 JD.

862
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,560
 I don't know what the fuck they even...

863
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:24,720
 JD, how far can Paul put this cart ahead of the horse before you can't see the cart anymore?

864
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:37,280
 How much is a booth at Comic-Con and what are we giving out?

865
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:43,920
 Hey, that's a great idea, man.

866
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:51,640
 I'm here for it all.

867
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:56,800
 If we did a booth at Comic-Con, you know what we could do, seriously?

868
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,040
 We could doctor it up like a stage and we could put on 15 minute improv shows every

869
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:06,080
 hour and it would be one of the most popular booths in all of Comic-Condom.

870
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,080
 There we go.

871
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,080
 Actually, a while back, remember we really were trying to figure out a way to do improv

872
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,080
 shows, bucket shows at Comic-Con.

873
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,080
 We did look at that.

874
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,080
 I know.

875
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,080
 It would've been a good idea.

876
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:19,760
 There's a rumor that Comic-Con's moving to Vegas, too.

877
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,520
 Yeah, that's a rumor.

878
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,520
 And maybe...

879
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,360
 That'll make it easier to do the show, for sure.

880
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,800
 It will make it easier.

881
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:33,800
 I think maybe we'd even need to look into PAX or some other smaller video game cons might

882
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,800
 be fun.

883
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,440
 Smaller cons would be the way to go and it would be interesting that we're supplying

884
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,640
 entertainment at a con that doesn't really have evening entertainment.

885
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,640
 Yes.

886
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,640
 That would be a smart way to go.

887
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,640
 That's the way to go.

888
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,640
 That's the way to go.

889
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,640
 All right.

890
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:51,160
 One other person I wanted to shout out real quick on is Wayne Gio, who is doing our animation.

891
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,160
 Joe Bonazzi.

892
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,160
 And he's...

893
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,160
 That's my Boston accent.

894
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,160
 He's done how many movies?

895
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,160
 He's done an intro to our movie.

896
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,160
 Oh, wow.

897
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,160
 Oh, so cool.

898
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,160
 He's done an intro.

899
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,160
 Yeah, and it's fucking hilarious.

900
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,160
 Oh, no.

901
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,160
 He's great.

902
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,160
 I love his style.

903
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,160
 He's so good.

904
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,160
 That's so cool.

905
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:12,920
 That really, that makes me kind of jump a little bit.

906
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:17,920
 That makes my heart really happy because one of my all-time favorite films is Christmas

907
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,920
 Vacation, and that whole intro is animated.

908
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,920
 Yeah.

909
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,600
 And a lot of great films started with animated stuff.

910
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,600
 So that's awesome.

911
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:33,600
 One of the greatest artistic casualties in my life, I think, is just being able to do

912
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,560
 this.

913
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,160
 Artistic casualties in my life is that when I stopped wearing overalls and started wearing

914
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,520
 a performance tuxedo, I stopped being amused to Joe Bonazzi.

915
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,000
 I stopped appearing in his cartoons.

916
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,200
 It's good to know that at least we can pay him to get back on the wagon, so that's good.

917
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,200
 Yeah.

918
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,200
 It's pretty epic.

919
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,200
 I can't wait to show people.

920
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,200
 It's spectacular.

921
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,200
 Great.

922
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:03,040
 Well, that alone makes me thrilled, too, that you're already pleased with the product and

923
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,000
 excited about how it's going to go with the final edit and everything, so yeah.

924
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 Yeah.

925
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,200
 That's really fun, crowdsourcing this within the Scoop community and making sure that they

926
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:16,600
 have input on this and are along for the whole ride.

927
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
 Yeah.

928
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,480
 It's been an awesome experience, but I can't wait to finish it and show everybody.

929
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,480
 Well, there you go, guys.

930
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,240
 We're almost across the finish line with the movie, so please help out if you can.

931
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,420
 Even a dollar will probably help us get to that goal quicker.

932
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,420
 But not that much.

933
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,680
 I mean, it won't help that much.

934
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,680
 Nah, yeah.

935
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,680
 I mean, it'll help.

936
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,680
 It'll help.

937
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,680
 It won't be nothing.

938
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,680
 Yeah.

939
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,680
 It won't help that much.

940
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,680
 Yeah.

941
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,680
 Every little bit.

942
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,680
 Kick it up to two dollars.

943
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,680
 But you're going to take all the time to fill out the form for a dollar, and then they're

944
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,680
 going to take their piece.

945
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,680
 I will.

946
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,680
 I will fill it out for a dollar.

947
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,680
 Do ten bucks.

948
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,680
 Yeah.

949
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,680
 Ten bucks.

950
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,880
 It's on GoFundMe.

951
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,880
 Go check it out.

952
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,440
 It's HeyScoops the Movie.

953
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:57,200
 The campaign is called Help Finish HeyScoops the Movie, so if you're searching for it,

954
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,200
 do that.

955
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,260
 Also, the link for it is up on our social media.

956
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:03,040
 It's up on the episode description for this show.

957
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,040
 Go over there.

958
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,040
 Help it out.

959
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,480
 It's going to be a really interesting project, and I think everybody's going to be super

960
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,000
 interested and fascinated in how it turns out.

961
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 I know I'm going to be.

962
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,360
 It's like, however you acquire that dollar, just do that five more times before you fill

963
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,360
 out the form, is what I'm saying.

964
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,920
 There you go.

965
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,400
 Just find a way to make that dollar $5, I think.

966
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,640
 Maybe like a couple of you go in, like a couple of you people who are doing the dollars go

967
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:35,480
 in together, like find four friends, and all of you go in together on a fiver.

968
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,120
 This is starting to sound like a pyramid scheme, Jacob.

969
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,520
 No, no, no, no, no, this is a GoFundMe.

970
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,520
 It's a whole different thing.

971
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,800
 Jacob, if those five people just find five more people each, then that'll make it much

972
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,800
 easier.

973
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
 And they find five people.

974
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,840
 When it comes out of your mouth, Paul, I hear it.

975
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,840
 I hear it.

976
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,840
 Yeah.

977
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,840
 Yeah.

978
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,840
 Especially when he does that tone of voice.

979
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,480
 Boy, that's not the first time I've heard that.

980
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,920
 It was usually about the pet bird that we had as kids.

981
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,820
 What the hell are you talking about?

982
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,920
 When it comes out of your mouth, Paul, I hear it.

983
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,920
 That was otherwise.

984
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,520
 Otherwise, you couldn't hear the bird.

985
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,520
 Yeah.

986
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,520
 Yeah.

987
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,520
 Yeah.

988
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:18,960
 Uh, we, we had no bird for long.

989
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,120
 No, we had no bird.

990
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,120
 What?

991
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,280
 You're being Sylvester.

992
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,280
 Good God.

993
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,280
 I would not know.

994
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,120
 I mean, they told me it was a swallow, so no, we had no bird.

995
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,120
 We had no bird.

996
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,040
 Why are you yelling at us?

997
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,800
 Because I don't want people thinking I put a bird in my mouth for prolonged periods of

998
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,200
 time as a child.

999
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,200
 I didn't.

1000
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,200
 It was just for a joke.

1001
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,720
 He did, but he doesn't want you to think that.

1002
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,080
 Look, it was for a joke.

1003
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,120
 The more you say it, the more we think you actually probably had a bird in your mouth

1004
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,120
 as a kid.

1005
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,120
 I know.

1006
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,120
 I know.

1007
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,120
 No one else brought this up.

1008
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,120
 Which is now an even better bit.

1009
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:00,400
 Now it's weird, which I love it because now it's like, did he put a bird in his mouth

1010
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,600
 for a long time?

1011
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,600
 Probably.

1012
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,080
 I mean, also it was Kentucky, right?

1013
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,080
 Who can say?

1014
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,080
 Yeah.

1015
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:14,800
 It'd be like, I'd be the Roger Whitaker sing, sing, sing, Kentucky songbird wing, wing,

1016
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,800
 wing.

1017
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,800
 Your love to me.

1018
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,920
 I spent too much time traveling on my own Kentucky songbird.

1019
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,920
 I'm coming home.

1020
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,320
 Now I put it in my mouth.

1021
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,280
 He can't hear it anymore.

1022
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:37,800
 You know who else is very excited about that Kentucky songbird as well as JD's second appearance

1023
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,260
 on this episode.

1024
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:45,120
 And that is the following sponsor, Paul Mattingly's illustrated guide to feeding a fed horse.

1025
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:52,080
 That's PETA approved idiom edition slash Boston edition.

1026
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:56,520
 If you're interested in feeding this horse, I'm about to crack it like the Liberty bell.

1027
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:00,440
 Go ahead and get yourself some birds and stick it in the horse's mouth.

1028
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,760
 Two birds in the horse is worth one in the bush, which I just cracked like the Liberty

1029
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,760
 bell.

1030
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,800
 Horse bush cracking, horse bush cracking.

1031
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:20,200
 You can lead a horse to a bird's nest, but you can't make him put a bird in his mouth.

1032
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,600
 So hey scoops, a check out nest.

1033
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:29,000
 That was the PETA approved version of that horse nest.

1034
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,320
 This is a horse house.

1035
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,000
 That was from frozen cusser by the way.

1036
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 Frozen.

1037
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 Thanks.

1038
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 Frozen cusser.

1039
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 Good stuff.

1040
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,380
 I did not ever put a bird in my mouth for prolonged periods of time.

1041
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,380
 No one believes you.

1042
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,380
 Great.

1043
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:43,380
 This is what I'm saying.

1044
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,380
 This is my new bit.

1045
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:45,380
 This is my new thing about me.

1046
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,800
 Maybe or maybe not putting a bird in my mouth.

1047
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,640
 He definitely did.

1048
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:56,320
 I'm not saying one way or the other now, like we were backstage for the first hillbill shows.

1049
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,240
 Those baby chicks, they would come out kind of wet.

1050
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,240
 Oh yeah.

1051
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,240
 Yeah.

1052
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:10,880
 I think Paul put them in his mouth from my mouth juices.

1053
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,640
 I think we had an episode.

1054
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,880
 I thought we already had the episode title, but Paul's mouth juices.

1055
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:24,420
 The thing is, the birds don't realize it because they're in there and it's warm and it's nice

1056
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:32,460
 and it's dark, but the digestion process has begun.

1057
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,040
 That's wave one of the digestion process.

1058
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,040
 Right.

1059
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,040
 The mouth juices.

1060
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,040
 Yeah.

1061
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:42,880
 Our stone faces aren't because we don't understand what you're saying.

1062
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,360
 Okay.

1063
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:48,960
 Remember when that one bird came out and looked all like it was plucked.

1064
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,720
 Listen, as someone who owns the owner of Shmeeky and Shmooky, all this bird talk is really

1065
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,720
 kind of just brings back memories.

1066
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,720
 Oh my God.

1067
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:01,320
 How many more birds has escape artist Shmeeky gotten away with now because they're getting

1068
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,000
 out and killing birds at night now, right?

1069
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,600
 Well, she was at it again last night.

1070
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:13,140
 I had to literally put like a bunch of things in front of the door.

1071
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,140
 Wait a minute.

1072
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,140
 Hold on.

1073
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,960
 I want to hear this.

1074
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,320
 But Nick Newman has just shared an astounding fact.

1075
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,520
 He claims horse saliva does not have digestive properties.

1076
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,520
 What?

1077
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,720
 Again, that's why I had to breaking news this.

1078
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,960
 So like, how do they wait?

1079
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:34,960
 So they chew, chew, chew.

1080
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,920
 So they're just totally chewing.

1081
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:42,000
 No additional help from inside their gut.

1082
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,400
 And it unlike with humans, where with humans, the digestive process begins with the mouth

1083
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,400
 juices.

1084
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,400
 All right.

1085
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,400
 Where is, where is Newman?

1086
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,400
 See here?

1087
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,640
 It'd be weird if he wasn't because he's typed in the chat.

1088
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,640
 Right.

1089
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:58,640
 Right.

1090
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:03,640
 It'd be really weird if he's just typing random stuff and just guessed on that.

1091
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,640
 He wouldn't have guessed on that.

1092
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,880
 Not in a million years could you guess about mouth juices.

1093
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,400
 He might be at work and not able to talk though.

1094
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,400
 Where did he go?

1095
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,400
 Hey, what's going on?

1096
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,400
 There he is.

1097
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,400
 There he is.

1098
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,400
 Okay.

1099
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:21,160
 Well, how the hell does a horse digestive work if there's saliva doesn't have any

1100
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,160
 digestive properties?

1101
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,160
 Yeah.

1102
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,160
 Their saliva has had no enzymes.

1103
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:31,720
 It is, it is just a lubricant and the digestion doesn't start until their guts.

1104
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,980
 Yeah.

1105
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:33,980
 It's just a lubricant.

1106
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:36,720
 Please don't be so dismissive of a lubricant.

1107
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,640
 That is just a lubricant.

1108
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,720
 That's why they're big old mushy snout.

1109
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,360
 It's more cushion for the pushing.

1110
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,360
 Okay.

1111
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,480
 We give medicine.

1112
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,800
 We have to be aware of that, that the medicine will not start.

1113
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,120
 You can't give sublingual medication to a horse.

1114
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,840
 It has to get to their gut before it can.

1115
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:55,840
 Wow.

1116
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,840
 Podcast.

1117
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,840
 Okay.

1118
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:02,240
 Now, now that we have you here and with your horse facts, okay, we discussed that a wolf

1119
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,640
 used someone else's crab trap, right?

1120
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,440
 My cats have learned to escape from their own cat.

1121
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:13,160
 Now in Sweden, birds have figured out how to convert litter into food.

1122
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,160
 Have you seen this?

1123
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,160
 No.

1124
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,160
 No.

1125
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,160
 Litter?

1126
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,160
 In Sweden.

1127
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,160
 Like cat litter?

1128
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,160
 No.

1129
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,160
 Like refuse.

1130
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,160
 Like regular trash?

1131
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,160
 Yes.

1132
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:30,680
 So they have, so they've set up machines where if you bring basically garbage to this machine,

1133
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:35,480
 the machine will take it in and then give out bird seed as a thank you.

1134
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:39,240
 And so birds are sort of cleaning up around parks in Sweden.

1135
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,720
 Oh my, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1136
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,240
 So they're not actually converting.

1137
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,840
 They're not like, it's not Mr. Fusion type science.

1138
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,480
 They're not converting.

1139
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,080
 I thought you were, I thought you were saying like they're learning how to eat cigarette

1140
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,080
 butts.

1141
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,080
 No, no, no.

1142
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,080
 That's what I thought.

1143
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,640
 And then I thought, man, I'm never going to put one of those nicotine, nicotine addicted

1144
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:08,160
 birds in my mouth again, but the birds collect trash, put it in a receptacle.

1145
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:14,400
 The receptacle once having obtained the trash gives out some bird seed as a reward for the

1146
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,400
 bird doing it.

1147
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,240
 Crows are going to love this.

1148
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:21,920
 It's a startup project in Sweden by a company called Corvid Cleaning.

1149
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:27,520
 And yet in the wild crows to pick up litter, what did I just say?

1150
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:33,760
 And I certainly have not put a crow in my mouth all the way, all the way, all the way.

1151
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,640
 So some of the way you have, I didn't say that.

1152
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,640
 Okay.

1153
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:41,680
 It seems that the qualifier implies that you can't ever know.

1154
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,680
 You'll never know.

1155
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,080
 It's like a weird thing to bring up.

1156
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,240
 You'll never know.

1157
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,240
 That's between me and author James Obar.

1158
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,240
 Yeah.

1159
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:53,160
 Newman, what is the smartest thing you've ever seen a horse do?

1160
00:48:53,160 --> 00:49:00,640
 I had a horse, he's a race horse named King Sonic, and if we didn't fill his water bucket,

1161
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:06,240
 like if his water bucket in the stall got too low, he would shit in it.

1162
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,240
 Whoa.

1163
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:15,320
 And I believe he would recognize that I was irritated with the shit I cleaned out of this

1164
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,320
 bucket.

1165
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:24,120
 And he'd be like, he was talking that like, if you don't, you're going to clean and he

1166
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:27,560
 had full bucket at all times.

1167
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:33,120
 Matt, did you ever have any patrons like that when you were a bartender?

1168
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,120
 Yes.

1169
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,440
 If there's like holding their empty beer glass, if I took too long, they just shat their beer

1170
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:43,840
 glass and put it up on the thing and be like, Oh, you want to get me a beer?

1171
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:48,320
 That's why Matt stopped allowing patrons with kilts into the restaurant.

1172
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:53,520
 I really got to keep my, keep up my laps around this Tierney's bar or else it would be glasses

1173
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,520
 of poop.

1174
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,240
 I did not get me beer for like three minutes.

1175
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:01,360
 So here you go, sonny, you got a pint of Guinness crap.

1176
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:10,400
 You got a pint of poop, a pint of poo, a pint of the old hot brown.

1177
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,400
 Enjoy it.

1178
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:16,960
 You'd have a woman who would come into the bar, typically on Sunday afternoons and she

1179
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:24,960
 loved the tastes of a bass beer, bass, yeah, best sale.

1180
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:32,760
 And but if she had too much beer, she would blow up the restroom, like blood, like just

1181
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,720
 destroy it.

1182
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,160
 Yeah.

1183
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:46,960
 Like hover and destroy, turn the women's bathroom into a super fun site.

1184
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,640
 Oh, somebody gave her her fifth get by sale.

1185
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:56,200
 I didn't realize she's about to crack that bathroom, like the Liberty bill.

1186
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:01,800
 And because she was, because she was a tiny, she cracked it like the Liberty bill.

1187
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,760
 How about them apples?

1188
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,520
 That is a spot on Boston accent ball.

1189
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,520
 That's right.

1190
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,520
 Whoa.

1191
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:12,440
 Look out for the grand Canyon known as your mama's twat.

1192
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,440
 What?

1193
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,440
 That's right.

1194
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,440
 That's a grand Canyon Scottish.

1195
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,440
 Yeah.

1196
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,440
 Are you Scottish?

1197
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,160
 I didn't know.

1198
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:26,160
 I didn't know.

1199
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,520
 I don't know.

1200
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:34,120
 Scooping over girls, piffier.

1201
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:39,760
 So because she was a petite woman, it took us a very long time to tune two together.

1202
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:45,180
 This was happening because the Sunday day crowd didn't attract a lot of women.

1203
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:48,920
 So therefore we weren't going to the women's bathroom very often in the shift to check

1204
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:49,920
 things out.

1205
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,920
 Right.

1206
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:51,920
 And it took us.

1207
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:56,920
 It was a Pat, my buddy, Pat, who finally was figuring out this woman, if she had a second

1208
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:07,000
 beer with like shit herself, my question to you, man.

1209
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
 Here's my question to you.

1210
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,640
 So we all like feverish flashbacks, right?

1211
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,360
 Cause you know, someone finishes a beer, you go, you want another one or whatever.

1212
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,240
 And I always make fun of the fact that she would giggle back.

1213
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,240
 Oh really?

1214
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,240
 Oh, oh shoot.

1215
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,240
 Like always.

1216
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,280
 Like, uh, yes, I suppose.

1217
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:25,240
 Like she got really excited about getting that second beer like because she was playing

1218
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,280
 Russia roulette with her asshole.

1219
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,280
 Yes.

1220
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,280
 Look, as I was like, Oh my God, that explains why she was so fucking weird.

1221
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,960
 Every time I offered her a second beer.

1222
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,500
 That's really funny.

1223
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:40,480
 This is my question to you in your, in your theorizing, well, this is what I'm wondering.

1224
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,640
 Jacob is, what do you guys envision?

1225
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:51,760
 Are we thinking like a whoopee cushion type flapping action or are we talking like a hole

1226
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:57,360
 so tight it's like putting your thumb over the end of a garden hose, thus causing all

1227
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:03,200
 the crazy is that was she just really clenched back there and that was what caused everything

1228
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,920
 going crazy or was it all flippity flappity?

1229
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,360
 No, I think she's too loose.

1230
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,240
 I think you're, I think you're flippity flappity is flippity flappity.

1231
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,240
 All right.

1232
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,240
 She's flippity flappity.

1233
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,240
 All right.

1234
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,240
 There's no way she's going to make it home.

1235
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,240
 Right.

1236
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:19,720
 Well, I tell you what I'm going to start peeping on the girls drinking the bass ale at the

1237
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:25,480
 bars because I got the flippity flappity going on because you like that hot brown flippity

1238
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:30,280
 flappity.

1239
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:45,680
 Nobody tell Anne, she, she's like, yeah, Paul Mattingly will go to a bar any minute now.

1240
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,360
 That's really funny, man.

1241
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,360
 Yeah.

1242
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,520
 And then, and then that really explained her odd behavior.

1243
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,240
 Yes.

1244
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:56,320
 Did she ever cop to blowing up the bathroom?

1245
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,120
 How was she subtle enough?

1246
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,240
 Could you smell it on her when she got out?

1247
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,940
 You say it was, it went everywhere.

1248
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:02,940
 She was still pretty clean.

1249
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,800
 Did she, she did not come out looking like a girl.

1250
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,840
 I think she didn't come out like a poop scarecrow.

1251
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:08,840
 Yeah.

1252
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:19,360
 Can you imagine, she came out covered in shit and hay and she's just like, I don't know

1253
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,360
 what happened.

1254
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,360
 What happened in there?

1255
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,360
 I don't know what happened.

1256
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,360
 I got attacked.

1257
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,360
 Second bass ale.

1258
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:32,200
 I got attacked by someone dressed up like the wizard of Oz.

1259
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:36,080
 I believe she would leave after she fucked the bathroom up.

1260
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:39,320
 So, so you couldn't get a real good look.

1261
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:45,520
 It was, did anybody see any, did she ever like trail anything out of the restaurant?

1262
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:53,760
 Was there ever like a, it's not that I don't appreciate your questions, Paul.

1263
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,000
 He signed an NDA.

1264
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,240
 The answer to all these questions means we would have figured it out was her sooner than

1265
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,240
 we did.

1266
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,280
 It took us a while to decipher.

1267
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:06,720
 It doesn't necessarily, you wouldn't necessarily have been able to follow the trail.

1268
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,720
 I don't know.

1269
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:14,920
 I mean, if you look at the floor of Tierney's tavern, it's from the same floor, 1938.

1270
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:18,800
 She might have walked backwards to throw you off.

1271
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,840
 She might've done some weird tricky.

1272
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,920
 Gestured to things on the, on like the shelves and stuff, just pointing.

1273
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:31,200
 And then suddenly you look down and there's just, she was doing card tricks.

1274
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,200
 On her way out.

1275
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,920
 You couldn't look at her feet.

1276
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:40,240
 There's this thin stream going all the way from the bathroom and like, what the hell?

1277
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,240
 No.

1278
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:45,320
 I've heard of a snail trail, but this is ridiculous.

1279
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:50,240
 So we eventually kept the one beer rule that she would come in, we'd have a beer and then

1280
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:54,440
 we would just ignore her until she left.

1281
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:59,680
 I bet she was relieved in a lot of ways and then not relieved in some other ways.

1282
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,920
 She was more relieved after a second bass.

1283
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,720
 Oh, yeah.

1284
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,120
 We're like ass ale.

1285
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,560
 Am I right?

1286
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,560
 Exactly.

1287
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,560
 Ass ale.

1288
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:12,560
 Ass bail.

1289
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:15,560
 Move the be over.

1290
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:22,280
 I've been, uh, I've been doing searches while we've been talking because my Google search

1291
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:28,080
 history is not weird enough and apparently a lot of people complain about bass, uh, making

1292
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:32,000
 them shit themselves.

1293
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,320
 Apparently is not an uncommon, uh, critique of what has sale.

1294
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,640
 What is the diuretic in pass sale?

1295
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,720
 Well, all liquor is, is a bit of a diuretic.

1296
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,720
 Oh, really?

1297
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:52,680
 Professor Jacob do tell I just, that's, that's where, that's where you're suspicious of Jacob

1298
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:59,600
 science and say I just want to know more because apparently someone, I mean, I didn't have

1299
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,600
 to ask him anything.

1300
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,600
 He's just like right off the cuff.

1301
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,600
 He's like, Oh yes.

1302
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:08,440
 Well, it turns out that all liquor has certain medicinal properties that I did not use my

1303
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:17,280
 Boston accent cause the, they cause the flappity flappity to go very short and Brown yeast

1304
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:24,240
 and alcohol, alcohol increases your gut modally, uh, things move through you faster.

1305
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,240
 I don't know.

1306
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:37,320
 M O T I L I T Y modality, what's how that's M O T I L I T Y motility, motility.

1307
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,320
 Yeah.

1308
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,320
 Motility.

1309
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,320
 Yeah.

1310
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,320
 I guess.

1311
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,320
 Sure.

1312
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,320
 Motility.

1313
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,320
 Things move through you faster.

1314
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:49,280
 Motility to absorb water and that makes a looser, quicker bowel movements.

1315
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,000
 All right.

1316
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,720
 Well, if you're bound up like a cat in a cage, maybe have a bass.

1317
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:00,160
 They should start branding it that way.

1318
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,400
 Why don't they start branding it?

1319
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,400
 Why?

1320
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,320
 Big mouth, Billy bass.

1321
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:09,480
 Why is there not bass sale next to the prune juice in the old person's section at the store?

1322
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,480
 Why isn't there?

1323
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,480
 Yeah.

1324
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,480
 Why isn't there?

1325
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,240
 Probably because of liquor laws, but it's stupid.

1326
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,120
 Ah, okay.

1327
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:19,880
 Maybe they could put prune juice next to the bath sale in the liquor cabinet so people would

1328
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:20,880
 get the idea.

1329
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:21,880
 I'm also curious, like black.

1330
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,880
 It was black and tans, right?

1331
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:27,280
 That's where that's where like people do have no way to speak of her.

1332
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,320
 Half get us half bath sales, call the black and tan.

1333
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,320
 Oh, is that right?

1334
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,320
 Okay.

1335
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:34,320
 Okay.

1336
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,320
 Yeah.

1337
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,320
 I thought for a second you were turning into an ice agent.

1338
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,320
 Go ahead.

1339
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,320
 Uh, oh my God.

1340
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,320
 Have you heard that song?

1341
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,320
 Oh yeah.

1342
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,320
 Uh, Jesse Elms.

1343
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,320
 Is that his name?

1344
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,320
 Yeah.

1345
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,320
 That's fucking great.

1346
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:47,320
 I've been following him on Tik Tok for a minute.

1347
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,320
 Really well-written.

1348
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,320
 On a lot of different social.

1349
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,000
 He has some really cutting song.

1350
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,960
 I guess his first album just came out.

1351
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:54,960
 He's blowing up.

1352
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:55,960
 Jesse Wells.

1353
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:56,960
 Oh, good for him.

1354
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:57,960
 Jesse Wells.

1355
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:58,960
 Jesse Wells.

1356
00:58:58,960 --> 00:58:59,960
 He's so good.

1357
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:00,960
 Have you heard any of his stuff?

1358
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:01,960
 Jacob?

1359
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:02,960
 Yeah, I have.

1360
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,320
 I, I, I know him from social media.

1361
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,320
 Uh, yeah.

1362
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,320
 Folk singer.

1363
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,320
 Really, really strong.

1364
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,320
 Uh, poignant.

1365
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,320
 No, I didn't know he had an album.

1366
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,320
 That's really cool.

1367
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,320
 His joint.

1368
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:17,920
 His joint ice song is South park level scathing and well-written.

1369
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,920
 Yeah.

1370
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,920
 I did hear, I heard clips of this.

1371
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,480
 This was, it was amazing.

1372
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,480
 Yeah.

1373
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,560
 I'm, that's interesting.

1374
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,280
 That's an interesting thing to note, uh, Matt.

1375
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:31,280
 I would be surprised if he doesn't get, uh, tapped to put together some sort of musical.

1376
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,280
 Yeah.

1377
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,280
 I mean, uh, yeah.

1378
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,280
 He's really good.

1379
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,280
 You say right for South park, it's like, which is not the gift that you think.

1380
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,280
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1381
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,280
 No, no.

1382
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:39,280
 Put together his own musical.

1383
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,280
 I've talked to anyone who's ever.

1384
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,280
 Yeah.

1385
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,680
 I just think it's a fun fact for people to know is if you ever listen to anyone who's

1386
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:48,560
 ever been tapped by South park to be a writer, it is a brutal, uh, crazy ass process to be

1387
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:51,280
 unless you're, unless you're a hater, right?

1388
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,600
 He had, he's the only one that had fun with it.

1389
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,600
 Yeah.

1390
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:55,600
 Yeah.

1391
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,600
 Yeah.

1392
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:57,600
 But he'd already made his bones so he didn't have to sweat it.

1393
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:58,600
 He was already bill hater.

1394
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,600
 Yeah.

1395
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,600
 Yeah.

1396
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:05,520
 Um, uh, but yeah, anyhow, sorry, I got distracted cause I heard it this morning and I was just

1397
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,400
 was like, my jaw was on the floor.

1398
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,320
 I was like, good Lord, this song.

1399
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,480
 So a black and tan.

1400
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:13,480
 Yes.

1401
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,960
 You think that would be a proper diuretic remedy?

1402
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,760
 Um, it would, it would, it would slow things down, right?

1403
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:21,960
 Cause the poor, uh, I don't think stout has the same effect.

1404
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:30,440
 Oh, oh, so it's like, no, I'm saying, no, I don't even know what mortality means.

1405
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:33,800
 So maybe I shouldn't be saying what it's like going to Chili's.

1406
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:38,320
 I down a fifth of Pepto Bismol before I eat my triple dipper.

1407
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,200
 So it all kind of works out in the wash.

1408
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,200
 I got you.

1409
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,680
 That's why he is a motherfucking professional.

1410
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,560
 I mean, yeah.

1411
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,560
 Pre Pepto.

1412
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,000
 I call it my Pepto talk.

1413
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,200
 I've given my system the Pepto talk.

1414
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:55,960
 I guess, Oh, what I was going to get at is that like, I don't go to bars nearly as often,

1415
01:00:55,960 --> 01:01:00,960
 but I don't even think that I don't, I don't think bass is still on tap at Tierney's.

1416
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,880
 I haven't, what was the last time I've seen bass on tap anywhere is what I was trying

1417
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:04,880
 to think of his bass.

1418
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,440
 He'll still like a bass around very, very often.

1419
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,080
 I think, I think it's, I think it's a, I think it's an old,

1420
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:16,760
 I think it's gone the way of the, does it have, does it have fish in it?

1421
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,760
 Fish.

1422
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,760
 Yeah.

1423
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:19,760
 Fish oil.

1424
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,760
 That's what really gets it going.

1425
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,760
 It's the fish oil.

1426
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:22,760
 Yeah.

1427
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:23,760
 What do they call it?

1428
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:24,760
 What do they call it?

1429
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:32,440
 Omega three and Omega six fats and the, and the bass omega three fatties.

1430
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:35,040
 That was your nickname for that, that crazy shitter lady.

1431
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:39,240
 That's the name of this mega three fatty.

1432
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,600
 If Jacob would put on a few LBs, we could be an omega three fatty.

1433
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,600
 I'm sorry.

1434
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,600
 God damn it.

1435
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,600
 I'm trying.

1436
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,600
 Omega three fatty?

1437
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:47,600
 I had dinner.

1438
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:54,480
 We're the alpha three fatty.

1439
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,480
 Thank you very much.

1440
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:56,480
 That's right.

1441
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,480
 Who are we kidding?

1442
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,480
 We're the beta three fatties.

1443
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,480
 We're the beta three family.

1444
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:06,480
 Speaking of betas, let's do a little jock versus nerd.

1445
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:29,440
 And the beta three fatties, ladies and gentlemen, it is time, beta three fatties, time for jock

1446
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:30,440
 versus nerd.

1447
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,440
 Explosion.

1448
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,240
 A very slippery poop.

1449
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:39,040
 We got a scooperty coming to us today from Keister Sunday.

1450
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,540
 Ah, Keister Sunday.

1451
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:41,540
 Thank you.

1452
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:42,540
 Been a minute.

1453
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:45,680
 Yeah, this is a, uh, uh, uh, what's the, what's the thing?

1454
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,080
 The, uh, the, uh, the second movie sequel.

1455
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,320
 That's the movie where I can't think of.

1456
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,920
 This is the sequel to Keister Sunday's last scooperty.

1457
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,960
 Keister Sunday says, like most sequels, uh, less work was put into it.

1458
01:02:55,960 --> 01:03:00,920
 The categories are more eighties comedy, more eighties horror, more eighties action and more

1459
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:01,920
 eighties sci-fi.

1460
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,840
 Matt, you're up first.

1461
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:04,840
 What you want?

1462
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:09,960
 Um, I will do action please for 200 about that action.

1463
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:14,280
 I'm too old for this shit.

1464
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,280
 Name that film.

1465
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,960
 Uh, it's not, I'm getting too old for this shit.

1466
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:19,960
 I saw I'm too old for this.

1467
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:20,960
 Right.

1468
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,640
 I thought it was, I'm getting too old for this shit, but it might be, I'm too old for

1469
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:23,640
 this shit.

1470
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:28,160
 Uh, it's a, a, a lethal weapon.

1471
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,680
 Yeah.

1472
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,640
 Lethal weapon is correct.

1473
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:38,720
 I will take sci-fi for 800.

1474
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:39,720
 Let's go.

1475
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,720
 Ooh.

1476
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:41,720
 Yeah.

1477
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:46,220
 It may be a case of being too ambitious for a single movie, which is why the recent adaptation

1478
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:47,640
 is multiple films.

1479
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:55,040
 But this 1984 sci-fi epic is the only movie David Lynch regretted making for he is the

1480
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,040
 quits.

1481
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:05,040
 It is back, it is Dune Arrakis, my Dune, man.

1482
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:09,660
 I tell you, those are becoming my favorite bedtime flicks.

1483
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:10,660
 I throw them on.

1484
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:11,660
 Yeah.

1485
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:13,160
 That'll put your right to bed.

1486
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,160
 I mean it.

1487
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,160
 No, it's great.

1488
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:18,240
 I love playing them in the background, but they're really, I love those movies though.

1489
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,880
 I got them on the blue ray.

1490
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:22,520
 I love the new ones are the old ones, the new ones.

1491
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:26,520
 Are you watching, uh, alien earth?

1492
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:30,000
 I watched the first like four episodes.

1493
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
 It kind of, it kind of faded for me.

1494
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,720
 It started really strong.

1495
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:35,720
 I still like it.

1496
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:37,720
 Are you, did you, are you in?

1497
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:38,720
 Yeah.

1498
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,320
 It took me a while to get through the first episode that I really like the second and

1499
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:41,320
 third episode.

1500
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:45,280
 And that's where I am app up to is I still enjoy a lot of the concepts that are going

1501
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,320
 on with it.

1502
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:49,320
 I wasn't a watch it, except I found out the guy behind it's the guy behind all the Fargo

1503
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:52,840
 uh, uh, series shows.

1504
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:53,840
 Okay.

1505
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:55,680
 I haven't watched any of the Fargo shows.

1506
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:56,680
 So,

1507
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:57,680
 Oh, those are great.

1508
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:58,680
 Okay.

1509
01:04:58,680 --> 01:04:59,680
 Yeah.

1510
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,680
 Oh, let's see.

1511
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:01,680
 I'll try.

1512
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:06,840
 Um, uh, 80s comedy, 200 Lloyd bridges picked the wrong week to quit drinking, doing amphetamines

1513
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,880
 and sniffing glue.

1514
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:09,880
 He sure did.

1515
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:10,880
 He did that on airplane.

1516
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:11,880
 Yep.

1517
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:12,880
 Yeah.

1518
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:13,880
 Nice.

1519
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:14,880
 Matt.

1520
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:18,520
 Uh, I'll go back to action, please.

1521
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:19,520
 Back to action.

1522
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:22,720
 Donnelly for 400 daily doubles, all of it, Jacob.

1523
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,960
 I want to bet all of it.

1524
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:34,920
 I feel the need, the need for speed tally day and night.

1525
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,040
 My Coke head Vegas bachelor party.

1526
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,040
 Yeah.

1527
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,560
 Um, uh, that is top top gun.

1528
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,000
 That is top top gun is correct.

1529
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,440
 I would have messed that up.

1530
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,440
 What did you think it was?

1531
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,800
 I really thought it was, uh, days of thunder.

1532
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,040
 Oh, there you go.

1533
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,200
 There you go.

1534
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,200
 Paul, you're up.

1535
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,640
 Uh, sci fi, please.

1536
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:55,640
 For six.

1537
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:56,640
 For 600.

1538
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:57,640
 Yeah.

1539
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:04,160
 This 1982 Disney date load classic starring the dude is way more boring than you remember.

1540
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,160
 Boo.

1541
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,160
 Tron.

1542
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,600
 Tron is correct.

1543
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,040
 I love Tron.

1544
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,320
 That's a nice one to go to sleep to too.

1545
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,320
 That is another good one.

1546
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,760
 It's a good, but it's such a good movie.

1547
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:16,760
 It's so beautiful.

1548
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:20,400
 I feel like it's not the phrase you think it is.

1549
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,640
 The filmmakers don't want to hear that.

1550
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:22,640
 That's for sure.

1551
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,220
 I love Tron.

1552
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:25,220
 I know.

1553
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:26,220
 I hear that.

1554
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:30,800
 I hear people say, but I, but to me there's, that's a high level of praise that I fall

1555
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:35,160
 asleep to your movie because it means it's my, it's a comfort movie for me and I've watched

1556
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,160
 it a lot.

1557
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,160
 So anyway.

1558
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,160
 All right.

1559
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,360
 I'm telling you, it doesn't sound good.

1560
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,360
 I realize you're right.

1561
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,680
 I know that you're right.

1562
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:45,920
 I could have killed them all.

1563
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,640
 I could have killed you in town.

1564
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,080
 You're the law out here.

1565
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,280
 It's me.

1566
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:51,400
 Don't push it.

1567
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,440
 Don't push it.

1568
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,360
 Or I'll give you a war.

1569
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:58,800
 You won't believe this.

1570
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:01,240
 Was that a, was that a truth social tweet?

1571
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:02,240
 What?

1572
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:08,520
 I believe this is, uh, first blood.

1573
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:09,520
 First blood is my answer.

1574
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,520
 Oh, good.

1575
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:11,520
 Good job, Jacob.

1576
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:16,640
 Yeah, don't ask me Rambo questions.

1577
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,120
 I will answer them.

1578
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,120
 Matt.

1579
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,120
 Johnny Rambo.

1580
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:26,540
 I do declare, uh, eighties action 800 please.

1581
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:28,440
 You cold blooded bastard.

1582
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,160
 I'll tell you what I think of it.

1583
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:35,960
 I live to see you eat that contract, but I hope you leave enough room for my fist because

1584
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:42,080
 I'm going to ram it into your stomach and break your goddamn spine.

1585
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,080
 It's mommy dearest.

1586
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,080
 Isn't it?

1587
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:47,600
 This is, uh, this is just from succession.

1588
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:52,360
 I actually, I actually know this one.

1589
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,560
 Am I right that Arnold Schwarzenegger is saying this?

1590
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:55,560
 You got it.

1591
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:56,560
 You got it.

1592
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:59,520
 That was, I was going to, I was going to read it in that voice because that's how it goes.

1593
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,520
 That's how it gets.

1594
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:04,200
 I hope you leave enough room for my fist because I'm going to ram it in your stomach and break

1595
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,200
 your goddamn spine.

1596
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,800
 I said, break your goddamn spine.

1597
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:09,600
 I remember being such an awkward for them spine.

1598
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:10,600
 Yeah.

1599
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,880
 Now the thing is, I'd still don't know what movie this is, but the contract makes me think

1600
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,880
 it's running man scooper Nova girl is saying twins.

1601
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:19,720
 I think that's a good guess.

1602
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:28,160
 No, I think, I think you're dead on a running man is my guest, Jacob running man is I'm

1603
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,160
 sorry, Matt.

1604
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,160
 It's the running man.

1605
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,160
 Damn it.

1606
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:32,160
 Running man.

1607
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:33,160
 I'm sorry.

1608
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:34,920
 They're remaking the running man.

1609
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:37,800
 It's already out and flopped, dude.

1610
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:40,040
 It's already, it already came out and made no money.

1611
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,240
 No, no, Paul.

1612
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:42,800
 I hear they're remaking it.

1613
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:43,800
 Man.

1614
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:44,800
 You say so.

1615
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:47,320
 Maybe the third time's a charm.

1616
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:54,240
 They're already making, remaking the Glenn Powell version of running man.

1617
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:57,920
 I'll keep at the, the sci-fi please for 400.

1618
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:58,920
 All right.

1619
01:08:58,920 --> 01:08:59,920
 Daily double.

1620
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:04,800
 Now comes the big windfall daddy.

1621
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:11,880
 My name is Jacob in this fun eighties romp Cardinal Blick from dogma guides Neo and one

1622
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:17,500
 of the lost boys to passing their history exam and creating world peace through the

1623
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,960
 power of rock music.

1624
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,760
 Bill and Ted's excellent adventure.

1625
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,560
 Oh, I'm sorry.

1626
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,560
 It's bogus journey.

1627
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:25,560
 I'm sorry.

1628
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:30,360
 It's bogus journey is what it's the first one bogus journey involves death adventure.

1629
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:31,360
 That's true.

1630
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,360
 Yeah.

1631
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:41,160
 And even a raps, um, I'll do, um, eighties comedy 400 a year before killing those people

1632
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,160
 in Ireland.

1633
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:47,880
 Abe Froman sausage King of Chicago is guilty of truancy, but don't worry.

1634
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:53,840
 All around swell human being, uh, Jeffrey Jones is on the case.

1635
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:56,920
 Oh my God.

1636
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:59,920
 Oh my God.

1637
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:00,920
 That question.

1638
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:04,960
 I am so confused by that question.

1639
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:09,000
 Oh, I think I, I think I even get the, no, I get the references.

1640
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,760
 I don't even know what it's talking about here before killing those people in Ireland.

1641
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:16,640
 Abe Froman sausage King of Chicago is guilty of truancy, but don't worry.

1642
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:17,640
 All around swell human being.

1643
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:20,160
 Jeffrey Jones is on the case.

1644
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:23,760
 So do you know who Jeffrey Jones is?

1645
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,120
 That's the, that's the part that I'm missing.

1646
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,480
 I think I got to pass Matt.

1647
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:32,340
 Oh, uh, so this is all Matthew Broderick, uh, the movie is Ferris Bueller's day off

1648
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:35,280
 and a year before King all those people in Ireland is Matthew Broderick when he was an

1649
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:39,440
 actor, uh, killed a bunch of people in Ireland and they basically paid off and covered up

1650
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:40,440
 the case.

1651
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:44,800
 Uh, he plays, he said he lies and says he's a Roman sausage of Chicago.

1652
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,800
 That's his alias in that.

1653
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:47,800
 That's right.

1654
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:53,800
 And Jeffrey Jones, I think, uh, Cameron is the one that provides the voice for Abe Froman.

1655
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,960
 Oh, I think you're right.

1656
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:59,680
 And then who is Jeffrey Jones is the guy that kicked out of the, he's plays the principal.

1657
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:03,680
 He's the one who kicked out the Beatles movie because he, he's a child.

1658
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:04,680
 Yeah.

1659
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:05,680
 Yeah.

1660
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:06,680
 Yeah.

1661
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,680
 Yeah.

1662
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:08,680
 Yeah.

1663
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:09,680
 There you go.

1664
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:10,680
 There you go.

1665
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:11,680
 Ferris Bueller's day off.

1666
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:12,680
 That's correct.

1667
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:13,680
 Matt and, uh, Matt, it's your turn.

1668
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:16,820
 Uh, eighties comedy 600 please.

1669
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:21,120
 The director of the smash hit dark shadows also made this little known film in the eighties

1670
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:27,120
 starring Batman, Thelma and Stephen Baldwin's less talented brother.

1671
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:40,160
 Uh, so that's Michael Keaton, uh, uh, Michael Keaton, Alec Baldwin and, uh, who plays Ferris

1672
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:41,160
 Bueller.

1673
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,160
 But I got this one.

1674
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:44,440
 Well, I mean, you just talked about it, man.

1675
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,440
 The movie.

1676
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:46,440
 Yeah.

1677
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:47,440
 Essentially.

1678
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,840
 Well, there's an, you talked about.

1679
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:50,840
 Yeah.

1680
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:51,840
 Yeah.

1681
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,320
 You talked about it.

1682
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:54,320
 Okay.

1683
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:59,120
 Uh, Oh, this is Beetlejuice.

1684
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:02,200
 There you go.

1685
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,080
 It's Beetlejuice.

1686
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,440
 Now I get it.

1687
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:14,280
 Paul, I'll do horror for 800 and the sequels to this entirely unproblematic 80 slasher

1688
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,280
 movie.

1689
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:20,080
 The boss's sister plays a mentally deranged slash abused camp counselor obsessed with spreading

1690
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:23,320
 summer camp spirit with murder.

1691
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:29,800
 For some reason, James Earl Jones's dad was in the first one.

1692
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:38,120
 Oh, uh, huh.

1693
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:42,560
 Uh, the sequels.

1694
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:46,720
 Oh, uh, I think this is a sleepaway camp.

1695
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,800
 All right.

1696
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:49,800
 It's sleepaway camp.

1697
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:50,800
 Wow.

1698
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:51,800
 Got there.

1699
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:52,800
 Oh, it's me.

1700
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:53,800
 I'll try.

1701
01:12:53,800 --> 01:13:01,480
 I'll close out comedy 800 Woody, Princess Leia and rock and roll megastar Corey Feldman

1702
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:07,320
 suspect their new neighbors, brother Theodore and his family of killing Mr. Moody.

1703
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:10,120
 That's the fucking burbs y'all.

1704
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,120
 Yeah, it is.

1705
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,920
 That was a weird one.

1706
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:14,320
 The weird one.

1707
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,320
 How dare you?

1708
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:16,320
 I never liked the burbs.

1709
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,320
 I'm sorry.

1710
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,120
 Oh, I like the burbs.

1711
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,120
 Tom Hanks.

1712
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:21,120
 Fine.

1713
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,360
 Enjoy the burbs.

1714
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:26,360
 Thank you, Paul.

1715
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:33,200
 Also, I never put the burbs in my mouth.

1716
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,200
 Not all the way.

1717
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,200
 I would.

1718
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,200
 You would bring it up.

1719
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:39,200
 I would need to get all of the leftover questions to beat Paul.

1720
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,200
 Oh yeah.

1721
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:45,600
 Paul has 3600, Matt has 2400, I have 1600 and there are no more daily doubles left.

1722
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,360
 There are four questions left.

1723
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:48,360
 Just try it.

1724
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,840
 That's a grand total of 1400 points total.

1725
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:51,840
 Yeah.

1726
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:52,840
 And I'm down by 1200 to Paul.

1727
01:13:52,840 --> 01:14:05,480
 So I will do I will do 600 or Rodney Dangerfield son and back to school plays a bullied teen

1728
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:17,000
 who falls in actual love with his 58 Plymouth Fury in this carpenter classic is a good flick.

1729
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:23,680
 God, Christine, Christine.

1730
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:24,680
 That's it.

1731
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:32,080
 I'm sitting over here in my head going like Nadine, Charlene, Christine, Christine, Christine,

1732
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,080
 Christine.

1733
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:36,600
 Please don't put unleaded in my tank.

1734
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:39,600
 What's the what's the what's the I could be like, Carrie is not Carrie.

1735
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,600
 Carrie is not Carrie.

1736
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:41,600
 Carrie is not Carrie.

1737
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:42,600
 That's what my brain was doing.

1738
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:43,600
 That's that's a good loop.

1739
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,600
 It's still not Carrie.

1740
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:45,600
 It's definitely not Carrie.

1741
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:46,600
 It's definitely not Carrie.

1742
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:47,600
 I'm on it.

1743
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:48,600
 There's a lady with a C name.

1744
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:49,600
 That's right.

1745
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:53,760
 What'd you say about my mom?

1746
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:56,000
 I said she's like the Grand Canyon.

1747
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
 I crack.

1748
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:03,880
 I like the Liberty Belle 80s or for 400.

1749
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:05,520
 All right.

1750
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:11,800
 In this film directed by the author of the novella, it's adapting a fun melanin challenged

1751
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:16,080
 fella just wants to share the joy of playing with his Rubik's Cube.

1752
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,080
 I kind of want.

1753
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,080
 Wait, this is horror.

1754
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,080
 Yes, that is the question that you.

1755
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,080
 Ah, yes, yes, yes.

1756
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,080
 This would be, uh, I think it's a good one.

1757
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:22,080
 I think it's a good one.

1758

 I think it's a good one.

01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,080
 I think it's a good one.

1765
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:30,080
 I think it's a good one.

1766
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,080
 I think it's a good one.

1767
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:32,080
 I think it's a good one.

1768
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,080
 I think it's a good one.

1769
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:34,080
 I think it's a good one.

1770
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:35,080
 I think it's a good one.

1771
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,080
 I think it's a good one.

01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,080
 I think it's a good one.

1773
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:49,080
 I think it's a good one.

1774
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,080
 I think it's a good one.

1775
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,080
 I think it's a good one.

1776
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,080
 I think it's a good one.

 It wasn't a nightmare.

1858
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:39,080
 It's all happening for real.

1859
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,080
 It wasn't a nightmare.

1860
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,080
 It's all happening for real.

1861
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,080
 For real.

1862
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,080
 I am for real.

1863
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,080
 On this road that I live on.

1864
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,080
 I am for real.

1865
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:46,080
 Never meant to kill you in your dreams.

1866
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,080
 Never meant to kill you in your dreams.

1867
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,080
 I am sorry for your terrible screams.

1868
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,080
 I am sorry for your terrible screams.

1869
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,080
 I am sorry for your terrible screams.

1870
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,080

 I am sorry for your terrible screams.

1875
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:56,080
 I am sorry for your terrible screams.

1876
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,080
 Ah, Matt, that's your question.

1877
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:58,080
 Oh, it's me.

1878
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,080
 Oh, Nightmare on Elm Street.

1879
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:00,080
 Sorry.

1880
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,080
 There you go.

1881
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:06,080
 Nightmare on Elm Street.

1882
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,080
 It is a Nightmare on Elm Street.

1883
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:08,080
 I thought it was yours.

1884
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,080
 I'm so sorry.

1885
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,080
 Oh, no worries.

1886
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,080
 No, it was the last one.

1887
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:12,080
 That is the game.

1888
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:13,080
 Paul wins with 4,000.

1889
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:14,080
 Matt is in second with 3,200.

1890
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,080
 I'm in third with 1,800.

1891
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:16,080
 And that's from Keester Sunday.

1892
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,080
 Thank you, Keester Sunday.

1893
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:18,080
 Keester Sunday.

1894
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:19,080
 Thank you.

1895
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,400
 If you want to send us in a Scoopery or a Price of Skryte Jock vs. Nerd or an Obelisk

1896
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:26,640
 Jock vs. Nerd or some Scoop Mail, you can do all those things right over there at heyscoops.com.

1897
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,640
 Go over there.

1898
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:28,640
 It's on the home page.

1899
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:31,440
 It's Jock vs. Nerd, send us some Scoop Mail.

1900
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:32,440
 We love to hear from you.

1901
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:33,640
 We need to hear from you.

1902
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:39,040
 It's part of the whole show.

1903
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:42,160
 I was basically lost in trying to find how to say the Kevin Spacey thing and not leave

1904
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:48,680
 a curiosity and worse things happening going to a future episode.

1905
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:52,000
 On the one hand, he was acquitted of everything.

1906
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
 He was never convicted.

1907
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,560
 He had one conviction in a foreign court that was overturned.

1908
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:02,960
 And on the other hand, you're not entitled to be a movie star.

1909
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:04,840
 Being a working actor is one thing.

1910
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:10,200
 Being a star involves affection and you can lose affection, right?

1911
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:14,820
 And there are many people who have had their career take a downturn for less controversial

1912
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:17,560
 reasons who simply can't be actors anymore, right?

1913
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:25,520
 So the idea that Kevin Smith, Kevin Spacey, let's not mix those two up.

1914
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:33,320
 The idea that Kevin Spacey is homeless to me just simply says he's not willing to work

1915
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:35,320
 at any other job.

1916
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:41,440
 You can do other things besides act and make money.

1917
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:42,440
 Do something else.

1918
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,280
 Yeah, he's getting what he deserves.

1919
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,280
 What a joke.

1920
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:57,720
 I don't believe that he is destitute or anything like that, so I just don't care about the

1921
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:00,200
 story at all.

1922
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:03,960
 It also means like, did you do nothing with your money while you were making all that

1923
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,960
 money?

1924
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:09,100
 Including just putting it in a mattress or something, nothing?

1925
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:11,800
 Like Shaq owns like 400 Annie Anne pretzels.

1926
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:14,440
 Like get yourself a franchise, buddy.

1927
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:16,920
 He has a pizza named after him.

1928
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,480
 Get some Buffalo Wild Wings going.

1929
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,480
 Yeah.

1930
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:20,480
 Shaq Arone.

1931
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,440
 We could be eating Space Arone pizza right now.

1932
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:23,440
 We're wondering what it's named for.

1933
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:24,440
 We don't remember.

1934
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:27,440
 Why aren't we taking the streets yet?

1935
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:30,440
 There's a trillionaire.

1936
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:33,720
 Oh, no, no, it's still raining.

1937
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:34,720
 It is still raining.

1938
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:38,040
 That is a fine point.

1939
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:41,760
 Scoop Jesus with a very slick investment opportunity.

1940
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:46,960
 He could have invested in storage units, called it Kevin Spacey's.

1941
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,960
 You're right.

1942
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:50,960
 He did miss that one.

1943
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:54,920
 I want to thank JD for coming on the podcast.

1944
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:55,920
 Go check it out.

1945
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:56,920
 Go fund me.

1946
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,120
 And for putting together the documentary.

1947
01:20:58,120 --> 01:20:59,120
 Yeah.

1948
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:05,040
 The link is in the episode notes, and I want to thank all the people who support us over

1950
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:11,340
 In fact, I have a list of them right now, and all these people could do something else

1951
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:14,200
 besides try to revive House of Cards on Netflix.

1952
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,200
 That's gross.

1953
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,760
 Is he even trying that really gross?

1954
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:22,840

1971
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:01,600
 because he's here in the chat and probably didn't get thanked another time.

1972
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,280
 There you go.

1973
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,280
 Well done.

1974
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:06,080
 Well, good catch on that one.

1975
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:10,080

1994
01:24:52,840 --> 01:25:06,280
 what all this is to other people, head over to fartsinabag.biz.

1995
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:10,960
 That along with preachingfun.com takes you over to our Patreon page where for as little

1996
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:13,560
 as $3 you can help keep this show on the air.

1997
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:16,240
 This show is dependent on our Patreon supporters.

1998
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:22,680
 So if you think this show is worth more than $0, preachingfun.com, fartsinabag.biz, those

1999
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:24,080
 are the places to go.

2000
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:28,640
 Also, of course, you can always help us out by going to our shop.

2001
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:31,420
 That's over there at heyscoops.com/shop.

2002
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:33,560
 How do you get there?

2003
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:44,360
 And that's part of our billionaire plan because the percentage we get from our shop, we just

2004
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:47,400
 need to sell a billion t-shirts and we'll become a billionaire.

2005
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:53,760
 Hey, you know, I've been getting inundated with T-Fury discount stuff.

2006
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:55,220
 They're having sales.

2007
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:56,680
 They're having sales constantly.

2008
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:59,640
 So now is the time during this holiday.

2009
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:05,360
 Come on there, get go through, please go through our shop storefront.

2010
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:09,480
 And even if you don't buy any of our merch, we get to wet our beak a little bit.

2011
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:11,420
 And we really appreciate that.

2012
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:15,280
 Heyscoops.com/shop or storejingle.com.

2013
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:22,100
 Also the Patreon has now made it easier to give subscriptions as gifts.

2014
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:24,760
 So if you don't know what to ask for, for Christmas, people are like, what do you want

2015
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:25,760
 for Christmas?

2016
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,760
 And you're like, I don't know.

2017
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:31,680
 You can give a Patreon subscription to our show as an idea for one of your gifts that

01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,680
 you'd like.

2019
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:33,680
 There you go.

01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:34,680
 Oh, nice.

2021
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:35,680
 Yeah.

2022
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:39,600
 And if you're at the $10 a month level or more, you get to come and hang out with us

2023
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,540
 on an unrecorded zoom hang.

2024
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:47,640
 The next one, this month's one is happening next Wednesday, the day before Thanksgiving,

2025
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:50,120
 believe it or don't it happening.

2026
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:51,120
 My time.

2028
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:53,120
 Yes.

2029
01:26:53,120 --> 01:27:00,360
 The, the time when the, the line between the worlds is at its thinnest.

2030
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:09,160
 So because, because on Thanksgiving you get fat, thin goes out the window.

2031
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:13,080
 You know, we can join you in that chat now, Sarah Fowler-Wolf, who just upped her Patreon

2032
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:14,880
 pledge to the $10 tier.

2033
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:15,880
 Fantastic.

01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:40,080
 It's going to be a hootenanny.

2041
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:42,080
 We're going to just chill and talk.

2042
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,080
 Hootenanny.

2043
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:46,000
 Well, I'll probably, I'll probably bust out some toys.

2044
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,880
 We'll see what's going on.

2045
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:51,920
 I think that's my plan is maybe just build some, some Lego or something.

2046
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,600
 I don't know.

2047
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,600
 Nothing too.

2048
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:55,600
 Nothing too heavy.

2049
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:56,600
 We're just going to talk.

2050
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:59,160
 We're just going to hang out and chat and you know, no big whoop.

2051
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:00,160
 No big whoop.

2052
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:01,160
 Just very heavy.

2053
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:03,940
 It'll be very heavy, but it's going to be a lot of fun.

2054
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:04,940
 It's going to be a lot of fun.

2055
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:05,940
 Uh, yeah.

2056
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:06,940
 Yeah.

2057
01:28:06,940 --> 01:28:07,940
 Yeah.

 Yeah.

01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:09,940
 Yeah.

2060
01:28:09,940 --> 01:28:10,940
 Fun, not guaranteed.

2061
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:11,940
 All right.

2062
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:12,940

 Hey, Scoot, the movie.

2066
01:28:15,940 --> 01:28:16,940
 Don't fund me.

2067
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:17,940
 Let's make some magic, y'all.
