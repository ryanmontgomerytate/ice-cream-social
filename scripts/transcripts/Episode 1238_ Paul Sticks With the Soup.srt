33
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,640
 Very exciting, very exciting stuff guys.

34
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,640
 Yeah!

35
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,640
 What happened?

36
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:51,560
 Um, I'm being sarcastic, but uh, no, I'm in LA doing a little run at the Magic Castle.

37
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
 Nice!

38
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,560
 Nice!

39
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,240
 Have you already started that or is that coming up soon?

40
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:01,080
 No, I started it. We did it on Wednesday night and Thursday night so far.

41
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,200
 What room are you in?

42
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:08,080
 The Peller Theatre, which is funny because it's a theatre that features duos, so people

43
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,320
 think Peller is a combination of Penn and Teller, but it's not true. Just by coincidence,

44
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:18,240
 the guy who pwned it up the cash to make it happen was a guy named Albert Peller, got

45
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,800
 the theatre named after him. And uh, yeah, it's-

46
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,640
 But you know the interesting thing about Albert, right?

47
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,640
 Go ahead.

48
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,640
 Did you know Albert?

49
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,640
 No.

50
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,120
 I don't know if you knew Albert or not, but he actually changed his name to represent

51
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,760
 Penn and Teller. He was such a big fan of Penn and Teller that he changed his name to

52
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,440
 celebrate Penn and Teller, and then by coincidence, that theatre was named after him.

53
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:49,960
 Originally, his last name was Angel Field, but then he found more magic people to change

54
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,960
 his name to, so-

55
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,080
 His name used to be Shithouse!

56
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,560
 He changed it in the third century.

57
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:06,720
 But yeah, and so I'm playing with my buddy Nick Paul, a very funny guy, and one bit we

58
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,400
 always do in the show is we say we have an improv background, and so we do improv during

59
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,600
 a magic trick where I basically just try to mess with him while he does a magic trick.

60
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,280
 I love- I still haven't seen this idea live. I love this idea.

61
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:28,280
 It's really fun. It's really fun. Last night, I was messing with him and I actually messed

62
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
 up the trick.

63
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
 Good!

64
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,720
 You got into it so you're playing the bit too hard.

65
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,720
 Exactly.

66
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,800
 I'm honestly not interested in you fucking with him during the set if you've never fully

67
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,400
 messed up a trick while fucking with him.

68
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,240
 No, and I did this bit during my magic live show, so when I messed up and he really had

69
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,000
 to reset, I go, "Don't worry. I can handle this. I'm an improv guy, a master of crowdwork.

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,040
 Sure, I mostly work cruise ships, but crowdwork is universal. Hands up, who's celebrating

71
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:08,200
 their 50th wedding anniversary?"

72
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,120
 Crowdwork is the same no matter where you go. Quick!

73
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,760
 Who's celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary?

74
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:24,200
 Where are my people who are turning 100 right now? Hey, there they are. There's always a

75
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,960
 group of them no matter where I go. There's always a group of people turning 100.

76
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:37,180
 Look at that. There's the man himself, Arthur Peller, at 110. There he is.

77
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,140
 How old is he? He dead?

78
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,320
 Little is known about him. Little is known about him. He's an enigma.

79
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,180
 No one knows. No one knows.

80
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,800
 Is that right? No.

81
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,360
 It depends on how wide you want the scope to go.

82
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,540
 No one on this show knows. Yeah, no one playing the Peller Theater this

83
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:10,200
 week knows. That's what I know. Yeah, but we're doing a show. I have a new bit. I put

84
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:18,240
 a new bit in the show with Ray Applethorne's fine craftsmanship again, but I'm not going

85
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:25,040
 to give too much away because I'm going to perform it at ScoopFest. We'll talk about

86
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,240
 it after. I'm sure we'll be talking about it after ScoopFest, so there you go.

87
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,520
 Look at us. We're talking about it now. It's super fun. It's a super fun bit. Yeah, it's

88
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,040
 been a great run so far. It's always fun to be back out here.

89
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,120
 Nice. Yeah. Nice, nice, nice.

90
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:50,720
 I've had a comic booky week. You got exposed to radiation and now you can turn green at

91
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,880
 will. Well, I told you guys I saw Thunderbolts, yeah?

92
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,680
 Oh yeah. Yeah, you needed that.

93
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,400
 Didn't really like it. I just saw Superman.

94
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,520
 Any better? What did you get, the soup or the man?

95
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:13,680
 I stuck with the soup and I don't regret it. Waiter, there's a man in my soup. That's

96
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,560
 Superman. Has that been done before? That's a good one.

97
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:26,480
 I know. My brain went to the same exact thing. That's a good joke.

98
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,320
 That's just a simple turn. That has to be done before, but it's really nice.

99
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:35,200
 That has to have been done before by somebody. Yeah, that's Superman. Oh, okay.

100
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:44,280
 It's all right. It's okay. It's fine. I'm a Marvel guy, not a DC guy.

101
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:50,520
 I was going to say, some people are finding it very emotional seeing that movie.

102
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,680
 Really? Yeah.

103
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,360
 The last couple minutes, the old James Gunn heart string machine fires up.

104
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,240
 Oh, that's right. It is a James Gunn one, isn't it?

105
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,840
 It fires up on full cylinders in the last couple moments.

106
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,320
 At some point in the movie, there's a baby raccoon that they're torturing and he's crying.

107
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:21,280
 He throws babies, dogs, squirrels, everything. He throws everything at the fucking screen.

108
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,200
 He hates automatically his emotions. No, no, no, it's fine.

109
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,520
 Waiter, scoop and chat with a bold opinion that this man was a lot better than the Snyder

110
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:36,040
 Man. Wow. Wow. Whoa. The famously bad Snyder Superman.

111
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,560
 I was going to say, so is everything. Yeah.

112
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:49,120
 So is me just telling you about Superman. Jesus. So bad. But yeah, it's all right.

113
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,360
 But I don't know. I don't see how they're going to build the franchise off all this,

114
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,720
 but we'll see. Now, we'll see. Yeah, I don't care about that, though.

115
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,680
 But that's the whole thing. No, no, no, no, no. James Gunn's in charge

116
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,740
 of making new DC films. Fact. This, this supposed, you know, the Superman has to be responsible

117
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,000
 for every single movie that's going to come out after this. I think it's just not something

118
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,400
 that has to happen. Okay. All right.

119
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:22,600
 I think the DC is fucking up timing wise bigger than bigger than just will they be able to

120
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:29,720
 do a sequel or universe around this? I think everybody is ready to take a break from superhero

121
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,080
 movies. I think that I think yes, the majority of people around are ready to be done with

122
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,640
 superhero movies for a little while. I know, which, which I know leads me to why DC is

123
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,840
 such a terrible company. The best movie they've made recently is just too little too late.

124
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,520
 Yeah, it is. Like a good superhero movie. Everybody's

125
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,800
 tired of watching superhero movies. Shit. And it really is a matter of timing. Like

126
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:58,040
 you say, Jacob, and I think it's more to the point of at least for me, my personal self,

127
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:05,200
 not only am I a little bit done with the whole onslaught of superheroes, but I think more,

128
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:14,720
 more for me, I feel like I can't even, I can't even believe in this shit at all at this point

129
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:22,240
 because no one's stepping up to do shit. When did you believe in the end? The Superman?

130
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,300
 Oh, I, I don't believe in the Superman. I believe in the spider-man. Ah, there it is.

131
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,640
 But just leave sticky webs everywhere, everywhere that you go. But I don't know. It's just,

132
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,920
 it's just hard to, to, to get your gumption up for that, uh, you know, truth and justice

133
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,400
 stuff when truth and justice is under such direct attack in a lot of places, name one

134
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:49,320
 place that it's not going the way you think. The fucking Smithsonian? Uh, no, uh, yeah.

135
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,280
 I mean, it's, it's preposterous. That's the thing. And I just kinda like, well, all right.

136
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,440
 Listen to this podcast though, that I was trying for a while to have a no sarcasm rule,

137
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,680
 uh, when I was talking about things and it's just too overwhelming. I can't. Agreed. I

138
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,880
 can't. Agreed. 100% agreed. I can't. I can't be genuine all the time, people. You don't

139
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,920
 want to hear us speaking earnestly about this. And I don't want to, I don't want to speak

140
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,960
 earnestly about it at this point, but I want to, I want to make my opinion known to a point,

141
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,480
 but I mean, I, yeah, hold on. I'm going to take a moment and just speak earnestly about

142
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,680
 it. You know, Vern, I'm really tired of the Smithsonian getting changed around to show

143
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:34,040
 what other people are. That's right, Vern. I'm super tired of it. I'm going to say Christmas

144
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:40,200
 and go to jail. Vern. I went to the convenience food Mart the other day and they done changed

145
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,000
 it up. They called the Super Gulp the big sipper. Damn it, Vern. And they're racing

146
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,800
 our history, Vern. Anyone young listening to our podcasts, uh, sorry. That means under

147
00:11:52,800 --> 00:12:01,000
 40. Yeah, just did a, a very good Jim Varney, a pull there. Uh, Jacob, I like that. Yes.

148
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,320
 Ernest goes to camp was a thing. Yeah. And then Ernest does anything became a thing.

149
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:14,120
 And Ernest goes to jail where he got electrical superpowers. Ernest goes to camp crocodile.

150
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,080
 That's the new one. Uh, I remember actually, I remember watching this movie. I remember

151
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,080
 watching Ernest goes to camp. Uh, we would have different, uh, different, different families

152
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,560
 would step up sometimes, take care of, uh, take care of us, you know, uh, give my dad

153
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,120
 a break when he was just raising us as a single dad. And, uh, I remember being at the Chadwicks,

154
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,240
 uh, they were lovely family that would take care of my, my little brother and I for weekend.

155
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:46,360
 And um, uh, they had, uh, a daughter who was like eight years older than us. Yeah. Oh man.

156
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:52,160
 She was, she was gorgeous in taste of like, uh, you know, whatever. And so you were all

157
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,040
 in love with her. Yeah, exactly. And everybody was in love with the daughter and we're sitting

158
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:01,480
 there at, uh, you know, 11 and 12 being like, you want to want to hang. And I remember,

159
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:09,080
 I remember torturing her, um, as, uh, uh, me loving and pointing out every single joke

160
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:16,040
 I loved. And Ernest goes to camp to her. Like she was trying to like, just for minutes on

161
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,520
 him and be like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. She was

162
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,680
 trying to like leave the room and I was like, no, no, the golf cart came back. That's the

163
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:32,080
 same ghost golf cart from the beginning. Amazing. That's amazing. That daughter name was Sarah

164
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:39,760
 Lowe. His name was Saint Mother Teresa. I mean like all she's thinking is like these

165
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,280
 poor kids with their dead mom, I guess I can sit here and listen to the fucking breakdown

166
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:49,840
 of Ernest goes to camp. Is this what dead moms do to kids brains? I can turn them onto

167
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:55,640
 this Jim Varney shit. Jesus Christ. He got mushed out in the head real quick. I either

168
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:01,720
 volunteered as a boy soup kitchen, or I guess listen to this drivel for an hour. Let's just

169
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:11,080
 do that. Oh damn it. Well, Saturday, uh, keeping on my comic book theme, my local guy, he's

170
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:17,720
 moving soon and he's having a, he's having a big sale on a bunch of his, uh, dollar books

171
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:23,680
 and what, what have you. And, uh, so he's got his cheap bins and then, uh, he, he made

172
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,920
 them all his dollar books. He sold them for a dime a piece for this one day sale. Yeah.

173
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:38,080
 That's less than a dollar. I got 160 some books for like 16 bucks. It was amazing. That's

174
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,200
 awesome. Uh, so yeah, I, I, I had a real good sweep there. Got a bunch of X men and X force

175
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,920
 and a bunch of little Nicky nacks, all kinds of weird stuff. Uh, some, somebody swooped

176
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,120
 in before me and got all the Spider-Man, but that's all right. Uh, I've got a lot enough

177
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,720
 Spider-Man, but, uh, yeah. So it's been very, uh, very comic book heavy week for me here,

178
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,640
 which is nice. Um, and then I went to, and let me go to another comic book shop. We went

179
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,680
 together out at the Pittsburgh mills, the Pittsburgh mills. Have I told you guys about

180
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,960
 the fucking Pittsburgh mills? No baseball team. So the Pittsburgh mills is an almost

181
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:22,720
 abandoned mall. Okay. They've got, it's a dead mall, but it's got like three stores

182
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:30,240
 still left in it. And currently it has a spirit Halloween, a Macy's and a giant comic book

183
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,160
 shop. And that's about what it's good. Then I say giant comic book shop. I mean, giant

184
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:43,880
 comic book shop. It is huge. Takes up like five storefronts, ginormous anyway. Uh, when

185
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,240
 because there's also a lot of eateries right there around the Pittsburgh mills mall. That's

186
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,520
 where we go to Chili's sometimes. So we were going to go, if you do a Google search for

187
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,840
 the Pittsburgh mills mall, the first thing that comes up is why did the Pittsburgh mills

188
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:04,360
 mall close? Yeah. And it's, and it, exactly. This mall is closed. Go ahead and look up

189
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,400
 Pittsburgh mills mall potholes. Because as soon as I suggested, let's drive out to the

190
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:14,840
 mills and Anne agreed, I said, I'll drive if you're not going to give me guff about

191
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:23,840
 the potholes. And she's like, I'll drive because there are God sized cracks in the earth that

192
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:31,640
 await await your vehicle. And Anne just can't, she's like, ah, anytime I hit one the wrong

193
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:38,400
 way, it's like, forget it. She will drive around the whole parking lot. So the, the,

194
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:44,040
 the place closed quote unquote, the mills closed and everything's in this weird litigation

195
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:50,680
 space, right? And it comes down to the stores that are renting their quick timeout aren't

196
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,460
 just clear. You said I'll go if you don't complain about the potholes. And her answer

197
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:02,160
 was I'll drive. Yes. So yes. And was like, no, no, I'm going to complain about the potholes.

198
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,160
 So I guess I should drive. That's it. Like, yeah, she's like, I'll just, I'll just drive.

199
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,440
 She's like, here's the other thing. She's like, I'm going to complain about them. That's

200
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,440
 a non-starter. You know, you can't put that on the table. I wouldn't, I'm going to veto

201
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:21,400
 that right away. That was done. If the only way that my husband can drive me is if I don't

202
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,640
 complain about the potholes, I suppose I'll do the drive. That's what she said. And I'm

203
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:33,240
 like, okay, fine. Now I heard that conversation happen. I accepted it and I moved on because

204
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:40,520
 I have been a part of that conversation word for word. Absolutely. And to, to her credit,

205
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,040
 she's been having to go from store to store all around this district, right? Yeah. So

206
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,720
 she goes, there's a cup, there's a store out by the mills that she goes to. So she knows

207
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:56,320
 these streets. So she knows where the killer potholes are. So she has some sense of the

208
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:02,720
 navigation of the streets and I don't knows the streets. Don't ever question it. Don't

209
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,380
 ever question it. Anne McPheeters knows the street. It was like, uh, I think it's called

210
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:12,560
 like a Harbor pilot or whatever, but basically, um, when you bring big ships into, to ports,

211
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,080
 they, they, they, they take a small boat. They shepherd out a guy who knows how to navigate.

212
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,880
 Yeah. Yeah. The tugboat to get you away from the rock. Yeah. I like that. And they could

213
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,320
 fucking use that out there. And as the Harbor pilot of potholes getting to this thing, like,

214
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,360
 no, no, we're going to, we're going to go sideways here for about 25 feet. We're going

215
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,200
 to drift for a while. Look up the fucking potholes. I'm crazy. The Pittsburgh mills

216
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,480
 mall is currently experiencing a significant pothole problem with a recent lawsuits filed

217
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,040
 by the mall's owners, uh, and even by neighbor, uh, neighboring businesses due to the poor

218
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:57,140
 condition of the roads on the private property. Yes, it is terrible. We, we finally got and

219
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:03,360
 went long ways around to go to the chilies. And then when we finally got out of the chilies,

220
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,920
 we, we, we had our dinner and then we're heading out of the chilies. She waited for traffic

221
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:15,480
 to stop to be done. They were still in the mall complex. She pulled out into the wrong

222
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:25,680
 side of the street, drove down the wrong side of the road for about 90 feet. I know these,

223
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:31,240
 I know these streets like the back of my hand. She's just like, she's like, we're not even,

224
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:37,320
 I'm not even playing that game today. She's like, I'm not even doing it. Oh, and the dance

225
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:42,340
 we have to do all around. It's insane. You know, like, uh, it was like the, they'll tell

226
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,920
 like, uh, some of, you know, if someone's as late with their, their pregnancy, like,

227
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,200
 like, like they're nine months and it's just so, oh no, they'll tell you to go get on a

228
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,800
 rough road to go on a wagon ride. I'm saying we should, we should monetize this on the

229
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:01,660
 rough road. They say going like a hay wagon ride. You're right. The Pittsburgh mills pregnancy

230
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:09,960
 popper, the labor maker, labor maker, the labor maker tour, the baby bringer, the Pittsburgh

231
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:18,360
 mills pothole baby bringer tour, the baby popper router. Come on over. My God. I can

232
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:25,440
 only imagine driving around, riding in a wagon, being pulled in that parking lot. You would,

233
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,600
 you would injure your spine. You would not come out of that without serious injuries.

234
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:36,120
 Yeah. You know, who else is willing to rattle babies out of mothers? And that is the following

235
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:42,560
 sponsor today's show. Man Manley's ice cream social is brought to you by Roald Dahl's guide

236
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:49,400
 to writing about abnormally large objects. That's right. That's from boson scoop pronounced

237
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:56,000
 a boson scoop in a 20, 23. That's when he gave it to us. This is Roald Dahl's guide

238
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:04,520
 to writing about abnormally large objects. Hello. It is I famed children's author and

239
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:13,980
 raconteur Roald Dahl. You may remember me from such wonderful child's tales as James

240
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:22,600
 and the giant peach. Well, that was my final draft after I experimented with several other

241
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:34,800
 large objects before I landed on James and the giant peach, there was Kevin and the gargantuan

242
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:48,920
 grapes. And there was also Stephen and the abnormally rotund orange. I also wrote one

243
00:21:48,920 --> 00:22:09,000
 called Bethany and the big old snowball. Catherine finds a fucking huge quarter. That last one

244
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:16,040
 turned out to just be a silver dollar. Silver dollar the dumb lady. She was just a dumb

245
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:27,160
 person. He was a dumb person. I went on to write more dumb stories later. But finally,

246
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:35,920
 of course, I landed on James and the giant peach. Yes. Now, if you want to come up with

247
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:46,240
 your own person and the large thing story, I encourage you to do so. But don't you dare

248
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:54,240
 use the name James? Don't you dare use the adjective giant? Don't you dare use peaches?

249
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:02,640
 Those are my intellectual properties. Hi, I'm Jimmy the large nectarine. And I would like

250
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:14,240
 to tell you guys a sort of tale. Go ahead, Jim. Jimmy the large nectarine. Yes, that's

251
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:21,720
 right. I feel you may be dangerously encroaching upon my IP. In what way? In what way? Rolled?

252
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:32,520
 How do I say your name? Say it how you want, you philanderer. I'll see you in court. Listen,

253
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:39,880
 what you've done is you've gone around my idea of having an individual involved with

254
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,880
 a large object. Yeah, no, I am the large object. And you yourself have become the personification

255
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:49,800
 of the object. Yeah. So you have anthropomorphized. That would be like me having a book called

256
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:58,120
 James the giant peach. I'm just hearing dollar signs. That's all I'm hearing. That's absurd.

257
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:07,720
 And you are your Jimmy the giant nectarine. That's right. Originally, it was me and the

258
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,120
 giant nectarine. But the book, not to spoil it, is about us finding a device that combined

259
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:20,560
 us into the giant object you see before you now. Like the fly. Yes. Like the modern adaptation

260
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:29,380
 of the fly. So you're Brendal, Jimmy. Yeah. Yes. Oh, I like this. Say, would you like

261
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:38,600
 to come to my writing cottage that I have out in the back of my house? Sure. But just,

262
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,660
 you know, there's a lot of odd things to being a giant nectarine that maybe your house is

263
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:48,080
 not prepared for. What do you mean? Every time I sit down, I squeeze juice everywhere.

264
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:56,640
 Oh, yeah. Do go on. Oh, that seems like a feature of the book to you, Ralt. Oh, we're

265
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:04,800
 about to have some sweet, sweet times, I think, you and I, James. Mr. Jim. Mind if I dip a

266
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:14,400
 finger in that peach pit of yours? My gosh. My gosh. Sure. Enter a scoops of checkout.

267
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:27,520
 And if I put a finger in your navel orange? That's just upsetting. Yeah. Just upsetting.

268
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:33,240
 Nectarines. I went to a music gig the other night and there was a fan there. There was

269
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,560
 a woman who is a fan of this music group and I guess follows them around from different

270
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:45,680
 gigs and had made them all baked goods, had made the entire band baked goods. The fan

271
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:52,840
 cakes as the fan cakes. Tiff likes to say. But I mean, brought them a veritable buffet

272
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:58,320
 of baked desserts. It was so much. It was so many cookies. There was a cake. It was

273
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:04,720
 all this stuff. And yeah, I was like, I am a little jealous of this right now. There's

274
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:12,280
 a fan of this band who brought in enough baked goods for at least 10 people. Oh, wow. Dedication.

275
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,920
 Yeah. Well, what were the things? Did you eat it? What's going on? Oh, I ate some of

276
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,820
 it for sure. I definitely ate some of the fan cakes. You know me. I eat the fan cakes.

277
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:24,720
 You know I eat the fan cakes. So then you can't be jealous. There were cookies. There

278
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,200
 were brownies. I can be jealous. I can be jealous of what I want to be jealous of, Paul.

279
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,800
 Don't tell me what I can be jealous of. You got the benefit. That's true. That is true.

280
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:43,280
 I did get the benefit. It was like lemon bars. It was really good. Oh yeah. Real good lemon

281
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:50,400
 bar. Oh yeah. Real good lemon bar can be great. We got the Wagner's market right up the street

282
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,160
 from us, right? On an unrelated note, my stomach is completely pregnant now. Oh no. Swallowing

283
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:09,680
 so much sperm. I got a I got only fan cakes. Wait a minute. Clumsy. Oh God. Only fan cakes.

284
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,520
 Well you know what we got to do, Jacob? We got to get you on a wagon. We got to get you

285
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,520
 on a wagon in the Pittsburgh Mills parking lot real quick. Rattle something loose. Get

286
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:30,220
 that get that cake baby out of you. Time to rattle it loose. Do it. Do it. Do it. Oh man.

287
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:35,800
 That same night I discovered that several of the Fremont Street performers are now trying

288
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,600
 you know when they when they shut all the lights down on Fremont Street and they do

289
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,300
 the shows on the canopy. They do like the video shows on the canopy above there. Right.

290
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:51,320
 So I guess several of the street performers have now instead of taking a break while the

291
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:58,480
 canopy does its thing, they try to dance along to it. Okay. Because I guess they're not allowed

292
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:05,720
 to do their act while the canopy is playing, but they can just dance along to the canopy.

293
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,560
 And so they stop doing several people stop doing whatever act they're doing on Fremont

294
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:16,320
 Street and just start awkwardly dancing along with whatever is happening on the big Fremont

295
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:22,880
 Street canopy. And they expect people to continue tipping them and or stay at their location

296
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:31,120
 to watch the show restart after the canopy stops doing its thing. That's like y'all

297
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:37,780
 have the wrong idea on what to do with this situation. I appreciate y'all trying something.

298
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:42,440
 This isn't it. My heart goes out to those poor motherfuckers. Oh my god. That is the

299
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:50,040
 worst gig on planet Earth. I think I did stop yesterday and watch a street magician though

300
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:56,160
 on my on my stroll of the strip yesterday. There was a street magician in front of Bellagio.

301
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:04,480
 And so I saw that guy. Oh, maybe he Yeah, he made my faith in humanity disappear. He

302
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,640
 wasn't that bad. No, no, no, no, no. I'm just saying in the general that the poor performers

303
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:15,840
 have to be out there. Oh, Huskin and buskin. Oh, man. Oh, Jeff Loomis points out that the

304
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:21,160
 top five Fremont Street performers pull in some bank. There is sure there is a real cottage

305
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:26,000
 industry that happens in Las Vegas with the street performers, especially down at Fremont

306
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,480
 Street. Yeah, we don't know whether the guy used to get paid 20 bucks to get kicked in

307
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,920
 the balls. We don't know whether he stopped that for medical reasons or whether he's now

308
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:38,520
 retired to a lavish island. We don't know. Yeah, I think or because he died. They did

309
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,200
 some kind of ordinance on it. I think they actually I think that guy that Matt's talking

310
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:51,000
 about died. Oh, really? Oh, the nut kicking guy. I think he did from a nut kick. I someone

311
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:04,480
 kicked his nuts into outer space, just fucking Thanos did just. The legend of moon nuts.

312
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:12,280
 Your testicles are like planets. Boom. No, I think I don't I don't I don't know. I don't

313
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,240
 remember anything about him dying, but I did think that I think they stopped him doing

314
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,760
 that. Yeah. Oh, you think they probably died because he had because he stopped. That was

315
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:26,120
 the only thing keeping his balls from growing out of control over his body. Secretly restarted

316
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:31,080
 his heart every time. It was the it was the only way he could keep his balls from becoming

317
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:37,400
 so big that they would keep him in his house. They found him in his house stuck. He woke

318
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:42,840
 up one morning like Kafka and he couldn't get him like he's like Gregor Samsa. And he's

319
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:47,880
 like, Oh shit, it happened. The balls got too big. I can't get out the door. And I left

320
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:54,400
 my phone in the kitchen. Like, what would you do if your balls were too big to get through

321
00:30:54,400 --> 00:31:01,120
 the door? Yeah. And you left your phone in the kitchen. You're dead. Yeah. Yeah. You're

322
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,800
 dead. Because you're not over. You're not gonna What are you gonna pull your balls off,

323
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:18,000
 make them? No, no, you're right. I'm dead. It's the only option. Chaotic. But Chad says,

324
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,280
 Sure. But if I make a living kicking men in the nuts, I'm a sex worker, quote unquote.

325
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:29,440
 Right? Well, someone was a savior for that man to keep his balls in check. Because otherwise,

326
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:35,840
 they were gonna just keep going. Yeah. Oh, according to chat GPT, the the guy on Fremont

327
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:41,920
 Street who got kicked in the balls has indeed passed away. Wow. Oh, no. Yeah. But we don't

328
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:52,680
 know what from what? I don't know what from. Yeah. I particular torsion. That's it. I passed

329
00:31:52,680 --> 00:32:00,560
 away after hospitalization, according to a social media claim. No mainstream, blah, blah,

330
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:08,360
 blah. Not allergy. This is a good time to mention the zoom chat. If you are a patreon

336
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,480
 the chat is pointing this out. Now I can't let's see it either. He was really thrown

337
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,820
 because your Las Vegas hat. If you look at it differently, that logo, the LV can look

338
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:47,460
 like a four seven. And he thought you were wearing a Donald Trump. Oh, yeah, totally.

339
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:55,080
 It totally can look like a 47. It really does. I don't see it at all. So look with the L

340
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:59,960
 and the V connect that can be the four and then the that's a four outer crop of the V

341
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,960
 cover up be a seven up the far side of your of your set of your V. Okay, cover the far

342
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,160
 side of your V. There you go. You see the four? Okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah. See the four.

343
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,440
 Okay. And then he said if you let that go, you see that one's got the little thing of

344
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:19,120
 it. So it looks like a seven. Oh, and that looks like a seven. It kind of does look like

345
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:31,900
 a 47. Another reason to be in the zoom chat. Preaching fun.com. I can't unsee it now.

346
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:36,660
 That's really fun. Who said that first cloud on a brothel? Who is the person that I'm angry

347
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:45,960
 at for ruining that? Man, I like this. All you got to do is black out that little dot

348
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:51,040
 at the top of the V. All I've got to do is put a piece of tape over the hat and not wear

349
00:33:51,040 --> 00:34:03,080
 it ever again. That's all I've got to do. Set this cap on fire. Easy peasy living squeezy.

350
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:08,840
 Nothing that kerosene in a match can't fix. No problem. Oh, shit. You know who else is

351
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:15,160
 going to show up and ruin things that I previously liked? And that's the following sponsor. Today's

356
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:51,400
 dumb things like saying no to people in authority. Well, okay, fine. Do it. Do what you want

 to do. I don't care. It's fine. It's free country, sorta. So anyway, all you got to

360
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:14,560
 the old four bar hospital, the old, what are the other nicknames for the jail? The slammer?

361
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:24,240
 Yes. What else they call it? The crossbar motel, huh? The stinky place where you go

362
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:32,880
 when you're in jail. What's the other nicknames for the jail? Dr. Hassan Pfeffer's Fart Box?

363
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,140
 You know, those classic, classic nicknames. Oh, I am going to Dr. Hassan Pfeffer's Fart

364
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:45,480
 Box. Oh, well then you're in need of my services. I am. If you end up in Dr. Hassan Pfeffer's

365
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:51,520
 Fart Box, all you got to do is call me and I'll get you out lickety split. Oh, I don't

366
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:56,000
 want to get out. I've been waiting for months to go in there. You've been trying to get

367
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,560
 into Dr. Hassan Pfeffer's Fart Box for a while. I love the smell. Yeah. Not a lot of people

368
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:09,640
 do. It's the hottest club in town. I can vouch for, I can vouch for the bail bondsman, Corey

369
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:17,800
 here. Thank you. I was, true story, wrapped up in a Las Vegas sexting rig and as an Israeli

370
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:25,760
 citizen, I got bailed out and then just got on a plane and flew the country. All right.

371
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:33,080
 And that was shortly before he became president of Israel. Another success story, everybody.

372
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:38,440
 This happened last week in Las Vegas. Wait a minute, what happened? All right, commercial

373
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:44,360
 over. Hey, he's good to check out. Matt, go ahead. Oh, also Dr. Hassan Pfeffer's Fart

374
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:52,120
 Box. That's a great costume idea. Oh, yeah, yeah. Because that's open to interpretation.

375
00:36:52,120 --> 00:37:01,120
 There has to be a Dutch oven costume on Amazon. No, there was a child sex ring arrest. They

376
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:05,560
 arrested like eight people in connection with a child sex ring here in Las Vegas. There's

377
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:11,520
 a big- Eight children? Eight people, eight- They didn't arrest them fucking kids. They

378
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:17,240
 arrested those children. It wasn't ICE. Those kids are still running the streets. It wasn't

379
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:22,680
 ICE. It wasn't ICE. They weren't arresting- These are actual police. Okay. These are the

380
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:33,800
 police that don't arrest children. Yeah. But yeah, so one of them was an Israeli citizen

381
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,120
 and they put his bond at like, I don't know. I don't know the amount, but it was a low

382
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:42,520
 amount. So he just paid it. He just paid it and went to the airport, got on a plane and

383
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:48,880
 just left the country. Okay. You know, he probably didn't realize that he wasn't technically

384
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:56,280
 allowed to do it. So there's a bit of a dust-up over, you know, with all the people involved.

385
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:02,000
 Be like, how the hell did you let that happen? It's a big controversial story here in local

386
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,440
 Los Angeles. Oh, Leon Kassab is saying this was not just an Israeli citizen, but a government

387
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,840
 official. Ah. So that makes it a little more sticky. And I don't guess we have any kind

388
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:17,600
 of extradition deal there. Oh, you know, if anything Israel does, it's played by the rules.

389
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:26,480
 So- Right. Holy, an Israel government official was arrested in Las Vegas earlier this month

390
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:34,480
 on charges of luring a child for sex. Yeah. Like full on. Yeah. Like with a straight up

391
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:40,880
 fishing pole. Yeah. Candy bar. There was a bobber and everything. Wow. You know what

392
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,200
 I mean, Vern? Yeah. If we're going to make bobber jokes, I might as well go back and

393
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:52,200
 make earnest jokes too. It was Lake Mead. A lot of people stock their ponds with fresh

394
00:38:52,200 --> 00:39:03,840
 fish. We stock Lake Mead with children, hungry children. Let's see. Oh, he had a $10,000

395
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:12,440
 bail. He had a $10,000 bail. He posted that, uh, that standard amount for the charge. Didn't

396
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:16,320
 appear before the judge was not required to surrender his passport and returned to Israel

397
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:23,840
 two days later on a pre-scheduled flight. They could have just looked at flights he

398
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:29,140
 already had scheduled. The chat is filling in the mad details here. Winter scoop says,

399
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:35,640
 we do have an extradition treaty with Israel. They're claiming he wasn't the right guy.

400
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:40,520
 They're claiming and then Newman comes in and says, this is an earnest Lexington, Kentucky

401
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:46,400
 native. Wow. This guy was from Kentucky. Oh, this is really government official, but he's

402
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:52,040
 from Kentucky. He's originally from Kentucky. Apparently. Well, that's what Newman's saying.

403
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:56,400
 Yeah. Right. Well, I trust Newman. I, you know, if it comes, if it's, if it's a Kentucky

404
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,840
 history thing, Newman knows it. That's what we know. That is true. Well, I mean, we know

405
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:10,120
 how to fish for children. Right.

406
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:17,640
 Speaking of children, this is a good segue, right? Um, so I was recently, uh, haunted

407
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:24,320
 with, uh, what, what, you know, nature versus nurture genetics versus whatever as, uh, one

408
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:30,920
 of my children, one of my children has started wearing a gold chain around his neck. Oh,

409
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:35,160
 you took the kids out of Jersey, but you can't take the Jersey out of the kids. I like to,

410
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:39,840
 I, I was, I bit my tongue because I wanted to be like, Oh my God, you look so Jersey

411
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:46,480
 right now. You fucking T neck reject, get that shit off of you. Have you seen the South

412
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,080
 Park where one of the boys finds out he's originally from New Jersey and, uh, and the

413
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:57,200
 mother goes full New Jersey for him. Oh my God. I was doing a show last night and I brought

414
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,440
 up San Antonio and the crowd all cheered for San Antonio. And I said, are you all from

415
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,040
 San Antonio? And they go, no, or whatever. Like they're just for cheering or whatever.

416
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:10,280
 It's just a nice place. Next girl gets up. She says she's from Jersey and no one applauds

417
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:20,200
 at all. Not, not a single clap. One boo from the back. I was like, wow, we just love hearing

418
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:25,080
 the word San Antonio that we burst into applause. But you know, Jersey just kills it. Kills

419
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:34,000
 the mood. I get it. I get it. There are rules. And then, uh, my other child, this is really

420
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,320
 daunting. Wait, wait, younger, younger, worse than a, you're still in a gold chain. Olders

421
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:45,720
 were in the gold chain. Great. What else is, is there anything on the gold chain? No, that's,

422
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:57,120
 that's what makes it simple and elegant. Yeah. Slow your roll. I got questions. I got questions.

423
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:01,800
 Am I going to start giving gold chains to Matt's oldest son? Yes, I am. Has he been

424
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:08,080
 watching the A team? Uh, no, he's just been watching, uh, I rock Z for furbishing videos

425
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:16,040
 on YouTube. Okay. Well he's coming by it natural. You know, this one has the tee tops on it.

426
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,640
 A lot of people don't like the tee tops on it. I tell those people, go fuck yourself.

427
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,560
 That's what I tell people. If they tell me they don't like the rock with the tee top

428
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:34,240
 on it, you can fuck yourself right now. Come down to the shore and say, you don't like

429
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:50,160
 the tee top. Oh shit. No. Okay. So if that channel doesn't already exist, somebody hates

430
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:55,960
 money. Oh, I'm sure it does. If fucking is this situation from Jersey shore is not doing

431
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:04,360
 I rock Z restore videos on YouTube, then the situation hates money. Let's go down. Let's

432
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:09,360
 take a drive out here to the dump. Okay. Let's go to the dump and let's see what we can get

433
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:14,720
 on our I rock mission. Hey, look at this piece of shit over here. It looks like a flattened

434
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,840
 piece of garbage. Looks like your mom's boy. I got to, but what do you know? It's an old

435
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:25,040
 Iraq that's been through the crusher, but we can dig some gold out of these here Hills.

436
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:31,800
 Look here, friend. Look at that. Oh, we got ourselves a volume knob. That's a legit factory

437
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:38,120
 Iraq volume knob. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Weren't you on the Jersey shore? Was I ever, I am

438
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:47,000
 the fucking Jersey shore. Yeah. I wrote, I wrote shampooed on Snooki. How about that?

439
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 How about that? I still got the other name. I couldn't think of all I can think of the

440
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:00,600
 other. I still got basically a shroud of Turin on my belly from where that lady went to town

441
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:15,160
 on me. I got the Snooki shroud of Turin on my Fupa. I got the Snooki shroud of Turin

442
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:29,480
 blazing on my Fupa forever from a fake tan juice and her hay scoops at checkout. Oh,

443
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:40,880
 that is upsetting. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Matt. Yes. Is this the beginning? Is this, is this

444
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,960
 the end? Is this, is this it? Or is it now I gotta get a bracelet. Now I gotta get a

445
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:51,480
 hearing. Now is this just, are we testing the waters? What's happening? His ears pierced.

446
00:44:51,480 --> 00:45:01,480
 He wants, he wants two sleeve tattoos. Wait, on one arm. Is this for real? He wants two

447
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:08,680
 sleeve tattoos, but on the same arm. No, no, no. Uh, no. What, what do you, has he asked

448
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:14,240
 for a tattoo? No, I wouldn't put it past him, but no. He has asked for a lot of tanning

449
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:20,440
 lotion though. What do you, damn, I need a bunch of self tanning lotion. Latter day scoop

450
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:27,280
 found the fucking shroud of, shroud of Snooki. Oh, no. Oh, that's, that's as upsetting as

451
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:38,560
 the story. That's exactly what it looked like. Do, do you think, what do you think his tattoo

452
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:48,960
 request might be? Um, he would probably get a Spider-Man tattoo or, uh, uh, uh, something

453
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,360
 with, with the band or something like that. He's really into music. All right. Drumming.

454
00:45:53,360 --> 00:46:00,000
 The Spider-Man is the way to go. That's eternal. Yeah. All right. The naked lady, uh, mud flaps,

455
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,520
 uh, the, the, the silhouette naked lady on the mud flaps. He did say he wanted, uh, three

456
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:13,320
 different tribal symbols on his lower back for peace, tranquility and, uh, and money.

457
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:21,640
 But from different, but from different tribes, three different tribes. The mud flap tattoo.

458
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,960
 That eliminated the, that, that area of the tattoo, right? Like you don't get tattoos

459
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,960
 in your lower back anymore, right? Like that, calling it tramp stamp eliminated. I think

460
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,280
 the tramp stamp is out. Yeah. Yeah. The cleave sleeve is what's coming through now. The cleave

461
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:38,360
 sleeve is in for sure. I see a lot of cleave sleeves, but I don't see a lot of tramp stamps.

462
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:42,760
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've also started seeing a lot of, uh, a lot of ladies here

463
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:47,520
 in Las Vegas walking around in the, in the very short dresses with the, uh, with the

464
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:53,560
 leg tattoos, like the leg sleeve. Oh, leg sleeves. What do you, what do you call the

465
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,800
 leg sleeve tattoo? Is there a name for that? Somebody in the chat tell me if there's a

466
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,440
 name for that. But it's where they do the whole leg, just like you do like the sleeve

467
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:08,080
 of the arm. Hot? The gam glam. Where the scoop just says milk leg. I'm sorry, that's scooper

468
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:16,240
 Nova girl. That's the milk leg. Pant leg. The ink leg. Ink leg. Ink leg. Ink leg. Or

469
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:24,560
 just leggings. Gam glam. Actually the unconsolidated. Gam glam. That's it. Gam glam. It's a gam

470
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:35,920
 glam. Glam, gam, gam, glam. Yeah. Yeah. A mistake. The mistake. Yes. That's pretty handy. Uh,

471
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,120
 and my youngest son, we have like, uh, this is, you know, this is going to sound a little

472
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:46,840
 bougie guys, but we have, we have, we have toaster tongs. Do you have toaster tongs? Toaster

473
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:50,240
 tongs. Yeah. They're like basically like wooden. To take your thing out of your toaster? Yeah,

474
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,480
 like wooden, like little wooden tongs. They're smaller than like classic tongs. They're wooden.

475
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,760
 Yeah. They're almost like, like, uh, people who can't use chopsticks, you know, use fake

476
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:05,680
 chopsticks. Oh, I got you. I got you. But why would they go with wood for a hot thing?

477
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,320
 It doesn't conduct electricity. Yeah. So if you jam it. You can stick that all the way

478
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:18,320
 down the toaster and not kill yourself. Yeah. I see. Yeah. Okay. And, um, uh, there's two

479
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:23,440
 because I one time used it to get food out of, uh, some other object and my wife got

480
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:30,320
 angry that I use the, the toaster tongs on another food object on the improper thing.

481
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:37,600
 So I was never in the toaster and a bit of like, you know, 20% rage, 50% sarcasm bought

482
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:43,920
 a second pair of toaster tongs. Good. Okay. To be like, I'll use these however I please.

483
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:51,960
 And, um, uh, my son spontaneously grabbed both toaster tongs and started moving around

484
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:59,700
 my kitchen like a crab. Oh, no. And I was like, it was like, I saw a ghost. I was like,

485
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:05,920
 wha, what are you? Have you, you've never done that for, right? He does not know my,

486
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,280
 my, that I was the crab at Starbucks. I was, when I worked at Starbucks, I used to move

487
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:18,920
 around the whole store and cower into a corner with the two pastry tops. Nurture versus nature.

488
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:25,560
 That memory straight up came out of your ballsack. That's just, there's just nothing else to

489
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:31,880
 that. Yeah, it's science. Your tongue. Yeah, it is science. It is science. Well, you know,

490
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:36,800
 they're finding out more and more of that crazy shit about just how much, yeah, how

491
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:41,840
 much DNA memory there is and how much, and I mean, you know, cause like, like with, with

492
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:47,920
 women, uh, they're born with, uh, easy now we're going to be in a Sarah Hester Ross clip

493
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:55,200
 right now. We're three guys talking about women. Right, right, right, right. Uh, how

494
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,960
 about, uh, female presenting individuals? Okay, go for it. Okay. Okay. Male presenting

495
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:10,880
 individuals are, are, are born with the microphone that that, you know, that's from there, you

496
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:16,640
 know, they have them in the womb. All right. I mean, yeah. Like as the, as the zygote develops.

497
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:23,080
 Yeah. Yeah. No zygotes develop into babies, into a fetus. Yeah. Like early on you've got

498
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:28,800
 that genetic material that's going to make the next generation and they're discovering

499
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:36,600
 more and more that events that occur during pregnancy to the mother can translate genetic

500
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:44,760
 information habits, different stuff. Like, uh, like they did a study on like, uh, groups

501
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:51,320
 of people who are experiencing famine and how their progeny were affected by that. And

502
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:56,520
 not even that first generation, that second generation sometimes too. I don't know. It's

503
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:02,080
 interesting. It is interesting. I mean, I'm always blown away by animals learning behavior,

504
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:06,880
 right? Or like all of a sudden all these animals, like, no, like crows in a certain region all

505
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,560
 know how to like navigate traffic lights and things like that. Right. Or like, yeah, things

506
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:15,440
 with it. And, and the light fly over them. That, but by the way, that's how they navigate

507
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,280
 the traffic lights. Yeah. Yeah. They've, they've, yeah. Whereas crows in the past would just

508
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:27,800
 fly right into them. Right, right. They've, they've evolved, but, uh, uh, they're learning.

509
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:32,280
 Did you, did you see not, they are evolving now, Jacob, did you hear about that? I'm being

510
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:36,760
 stupid, but I know what's actually happening too. No, no, no, no, no. Did you, did you

511
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:44,160
 read this article, uh, Matt, about the crows that have all gone mute? No. Yeah. So there's

512
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:50,880
 this whole region, uh, of crows that have gone completely mute and the scientists are

513
00:51:50,880 --> 00:52:14,720
 looking for the cause, the cause, the cause, the cause. Oh, it's over. Oh, I killed Jacob.

514
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:26,920
 I killed Jacob, everyone. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. There's just sad emojis coming in on the chat

515
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:34,200
 now. Just depression. Uh, let's just go live feedback in the chat. You got some LOL, some

516
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:39,400
 laughing faces, you got, but you didn't get one side. Andy said I murdered that one. So

517
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:46,020
 thank you. You have three sad faces. This is looking like a 60% hit of a joke. We've

518
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:52,680
 got it. We've got to see you at the cone. Hey man, I'll take 60% any day. That joke

519
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:59,900
 is for the birds. Yes. I'm raving about it to my wife. Leon. See, now we're rolling.

520
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:05,640
 Now we got it going. Oh, Mr. Head Scoop thought that it was a real fact coming through. Yeah,

521
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:11,420
 Mr. Head Scoop, that is your fault. That's just on you. I, I hate to blame the victim

522
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:17,320
 on this, but that is your fault. Brogan says 60% of the time I'm funny every time. Yeah,

523
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:29,200
 that's generous. Thank you Brogan. That's generous. I don't give a flock. Boo. At any

524
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:39,720
 rate, I will submit my youngest son for genetic studies for comedy transference. Good. Oh

525
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:49,000
 my God. That's so crazy. I've never been a prouder dad. I've never been a prouder dad.

526
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,340
 That's pretty amazing. That's pretty amazing. Yeah. Has all of the strife about you getting

527
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:58,060
 the wrong thing out of the, with the toaster tongs, has all of that been settled or is

528
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:01,960
 there still tension in the house? I don't know. I never see my wife. I don't know. I

529
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:11,200
 don't know. Oh, I saw her yesterday. She was angry. She was mad about something. I couldn't

530
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:19,660
 tell what, but she was hot about something. But yeah, yeah, yeah. You should do Cisco's

531
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:28,640
 the tong song. Oh, tong to tong tong tong. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, someone already memed you Paul slaking

532
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:36,180
 fool. It's not a murder of crows unless there's probable cause. There you go. Oh, slaking

533
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:46,760
 classic. Now I'm mad at you too. Now I'm mad at you. So, uh, one of my kids is now in middle

534
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:56,200
 school. Uh huh. They start middle school at seven a.m. Because they hate you. That's it.

535
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:00,580
 Wait a minute. They say, they say cause the bus schedule. So like grade school starts

536
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:06,820
 at nine a.m. And middle school starts at seven a.m. And they say it's now busing. This is,

537
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:11,900
 this is something where I legit have beef with the way they do it because there are

538
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:17,820
 tons of studies that say this is terribly detrimental. And it's especially detrimental

539
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:24,860
 to children in that age range. I know what beef is. I have had beef experience. I know

540
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:32,780
 adolescents need more sleep. They've proven that man. It's fucked up. Oh, I, I agree.

541
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:37,260
 Uh, it's, it's, it's a real, I know you do. I know it's not on you. It's a real game changer.

542
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:41,260
 Uh, I would be so awkward if this is where Paul found out that Matt was the one who set

543
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:47,660
 that rule up. I was like, look, it's the buses guys. You the one? You son of a bitch. I'll

544
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:54,940
 never forgive you. This podcast is finished. Uh, it was even worse. What's up with them

545
00:55:54,940 --> 00:56:01,700
 not looking out for kids is, uh, middle school, they had signups for cross country. And so

546
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:11,220
 Mike signed up for cross country and it is 105 degrees out right now. Yeah. And so I

547
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:15,580
 figured they can't be, they must have them inside of the gym or they must like, you know,

548
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:21,260
 take it easy or do something different. And I go to pick up my kid from after cross country

549
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:28,460
 and his face is just bright red, like a tomato, like absolutely. Oh no. Your son is a, uh,

550
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:35,540
 a fair skin young man. Yes. Also anyway. Yeah. He is porcelain, uh, skin. Yeah. And, uh,

551
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:40,840
 it was a bright red tomato. And I was like, I said, is that sunburn or from exhaustion

552
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:46,460
 of running? And he says, I combo. He says, I don't know that I don't, I honestly don't

553
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:51,580
 know. Probably is the answer. Probably. Oh, this was like, I don't know why I look like

554
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:56,060
 I'm a tomato right now. That's horrible. I said, why are they having you run when it's

555
00:56:56,060 --> 00:57:02,540
 above a hundred and, uh, five degrees. And he said, Oh, cause you know, we're, we're

556
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:06,140
 part of the national program. And so we have to, we have to compare what we're doing to

557
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:11,620
 all the other schools who are doing it. And most schools don't, uh, aren't in a hot area

558
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:17,180
 like ours. And so it's like a false sport on the national. Oh, I got you. I said, that's

559
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:21,860
 not a good enough answer for me. Just so you're just so we're clear. I don't care. I don't

560
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:27,500
 care how you fare nationally. My child. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care how

561
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:33,060
 you fare nationally in this thing that I already don't care about. I don't care about children's

562
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:37,860
 cross country running. So why would I care about how you line up against other kids from

563
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:43,440
 Milwaukee? Yeah. I just, I was like, what are we doing? And even, uh, my youngest son

564
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,300
 was like, uh, we did recess indoors. Cause the principal said we won't, we won't go do

565
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:54,140
 recess outdoors if it's, uh, if it's a 102 or above. And I said, somebody at the school

566
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:59,940
 has figured it out, but I said a hundred and two, who gave that two degree variance to

567
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:04,940
 like, I was thinking a hundred degrees. That's the official number, Matt. That's the number

568
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:10,700
 that you want to pay attention to is the one oh two. That's really crazy. Amateurs pay

569
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:17,380
 attention to a hundred professionals pay attention to one Oh two. It's a, it's 101 boys roll

570
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:24,620
 out the soccer balls. Let's go. We got an iron thermometer. If it, if it takes up to

571
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:29,420
 one Oh three, we're heading inside and it's madness. I mean, they're, uh, the soccer practices

572
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:33,380
 start next week. And I'm like, it is still August. Why are we pretending like it's not

573
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:40,380
 August in Las Vegas? Why are we like, why are we doing this cargo cult of education?

574
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:46,340
 It's still October. It can still be October in Las Vegas and be that hot. Um, Oh my God,

575
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:53,560
 that's awful. It is, it is ridiculous. That, that is why when I joined the cross country

576
00:58:53,560 --> 00:59:03,580
 bear jamboree, I didn't fuck around. I just, I just did the animatronic jug band. I was,

577
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:10,140
 I was an animatronic jug band, a fat bear that sat down. I was like, Oh, can I just

578
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:18,900
 sign up for cross country bear jamboree? Paul ran cross country a couple of times in the

579
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:23,420
 suit. It didn't end well. No, that was awful. Yeah. I have an update for some of the scoops

580
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:28,460
 who told me, uh, basically there's a, there's a, a K-pop Disney show where they do K-pop

581
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:32,700
 versions of different Disney songs and stuff, because my kids have ever since they went

582
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:37,900
 to that concert have not stopped listening, just cannot stop listening to the soundtrack

583
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:41,860
 to zombies and descendants movies. Oh, so you're trying to switch it up on them. And

584
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:46,140
 so they said some people said the music from the K-pop one's actually pretty good. And

585
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:50,180
 uh, so I try to turn my kids onto that and they saw it coming a mile away and they were

586
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:56,500
 like, no, no, no, thanks. Have you tried black pink? I was like, Hey, I heard there's like

587
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:01,900
 a K-pop show on Disney. Maybe we should watch that tonight. And they were like, no, fuck

588
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:12,980
 you old man. Did you try black? Nice try. Nark. Do some like black pink concert footage

589
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:17,380
 on YouTube and stuff. I bet they'll like that. All right. Yes. I think keelers of the age

590
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:20,660
 where I think black pink will turn his head. Okay. Yeah. Black pink is good. He'll be like,

591
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:26,020
 and they are, and they are legit good music too. Yeah. Yeah. You'll like they are. They're

592
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:31,460
 really, all right. I'll, I'll, I'll do my best. I'll do anything to stop listening to

593
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:36,300
 throw on black pink and throw on some fucking baby metal, dude. Like some baby metal concert

594
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:41,180
 footage is awesome. As you know, uh, early in the summer, you know, we took them to MJ

595
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:44,940
 the musical. So Michael Jackson was pretty prominent and the thing now we have mixed

596
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:49,540
 emotions about Michael Jackson's legacy, but separating artists. I don't mind some Michael

597
01:00:49,540 --> 01:01:02,020
 Jackson music in my car. Um, his propofall from Michael Jackson, uh, Michael Jackson

598
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:07,460
 no longer played at all. Alive, uh, no longer alive, but also no longer played in my car.

599
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:10,780
 And I guess I can't complain. It'd be like, I, what happened? I want my kids listening

600
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:18,600
 to Michael Jackson. I can't really, can't really, can't really pound that. No. Chaotic

601
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:28,380
 clumsy. If Jacob could wear a 47 hat, you can listen to Michael Jackson. What has this

602
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:36,540
 podcast? So man, that does just look like a four. God damn it. God fucking damn it.

603
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:39,900
 Jacob, are you like now retroactively looking back at a couple of weird thumbs up you've

604
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:47,180
 gotten walking to Caesar's, you know, walking about a lot of people just yelling things

605
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:56,180
 about, uh, like January 6th to me. Peaceful protest. Am I right? High five. Yeah. Oh shit.

606
01:01:56,180 --> 01:02:01,580
 Uh, let the protesters out of jail. A lot of people say that to me. Fuck the Smithsonian.

607
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:07,580
 Huh? Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's come up a lot. Man, it all makes sense now. Wait, like,

608
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:14,020
 okay, here's what that's like. Seriously. We've lost the plot. We can not, we can not care

609
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:19,500
 about a Cracker Barrel logo. We just can't. No, you just can't. We can't. We can't. By

610
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:23,500
 the way, how weird was it that I called this weeks ago when I was in Mesa, Arizona, I made

611
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:29,500
 a joke that it was going to be just called barrel after. Yeah. And, uh, and I, I, I predicted

612
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:36,300
 a dust up with, with manga and, uh, and Cracker Barrel. Of course. Just, just like the Simpsons,

613
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:42,020
 we predict everything. That's right. They're looking, they're looking for anything to distract

614
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:52,460
 from a certain dead pedophile. What? Uh huh. Uh huh. But Maxwell died? Like it wasn't even

615
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:56,900
 like they changed the name to something like, you know, like General Mills and like Antrimima

616
01:02:56,900 --> 01:03:01,660
 and all other stuff. Like they changed, they changed stuff. They just took off the weird

617
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:04,780
 guy that you couldn't really see that kind of looked like a shotgun, but kind of looked

618
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:09,460
 like a person leaning against barrel. So here's the thing. It just says Cracker Barrel now.

619
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:20,200
 With that logo, as a kid, I always thought that that was a big strapping man, man spreading.

620
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:24,780
 You thought he was straddling a barrel. I thought he was straddling, side straddling

621
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:30,100
 a barrel. Yeah. Only in my later years, I really looked at it. He's got, it's, it's

622
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:34,500
 not, it's not one leg. It's both his legs and they're withered. See, I look like, it

623
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:38,700
 looks like he's straddling a barrel. You're right. I always saw him as a straddler. Yeah,

624
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:44,380
 yeah. No, he's, he's, he's an old grandpa. He's a withery old grandpa with both his legs

625
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:51,300
 on one side. And so taking, taking away the weird old white dude that you can't quite

626
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:58,420
 see, just going with the actual name of the company, created chaos. I mean, the, the loss

627
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:04,960
 as it should, the company lost hundreds of millions of dollars. Shit. Really? Yeah. So

628
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:11,420
 dumb. Yeah. And people are just mad that they changed the logo. But you know what? Also,

629
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:17,180
 that shit is just fucking straight up stock manipulation. Yeah. Yeah. When you get right

630
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:21,580
 down to it, all this shit is just, they're just playing these games. I, okay. I work

631
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:28,660
 for a certain company that has several concentric circles around it. Uh, that the head of that

632
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:35,220
 company just, uh, stepped down. Yeah. Oh, right. This, the CEO just stepped out. That's right.

633
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:41,300
 Yeah. But, but he didn't leave the company. He's in a pole works for the Olympics. Several

634
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:47,300
 concentric circles. Yeah. He works for, he works. He still works there. He's just in

635
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:52,420
 a different role. So it's all just optics and games, man. Ain't nobody losing nothing

636
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:59,460
 except for us. Exactly. I got over that woman was like, we, uh, the viral clip of the woman

637
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:03,500
 saying, look, you got a lot more in common with these immigrants being picked up off

638
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:08,180
 the street than you do with the billionaires causing this mess. Oh, yeah. Hey baby. That's

639
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:14,500
 the goddamn, there was, but I'm stepping down. You won't hear me anymore. I'm going to be

640
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:20,580
 right over there. That's why guys. So you cannot talk to me. I'm going to be look. Yeah.

641
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:25,660
 Uh, I've been doing this role shittily for 11 years. I'll take my golden parachute now.

642
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:33,860
 Thank you very much and continue to work here. Perfect. That's, that's trying to make what

643
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:42,500
 two bucks off of, uh, Brogan. That's it. Yeah. Five. Yeah. Thank you. We get, I do. I get

644
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:47,980
 the PayPal emails. You play spawn and Brogan Paypal's us and then the spot tax. I get the,

645
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:54,900
 I get the, uh, the emails. Um, anyway. All right, let's get into some scoop mail or something.

646
01:05:54,900 --> 01:06:03,980
 Let's do it. Let's do a little scoop mail. Oh, we don't have any physical scoop mail.

647
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:10,220
 We just have regular scoop mail from Valerie. Good morrow churned denizens. I haven't written

648
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:14,180
 in a while as life has gotten in the way. The last thing I wrote was about the lady

649
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:20,280
 wanting a CSI team to investigate the mysterious shit in her shed toilet. I'm a little behind

650
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:26,200
 in on episode 1234. Uh, there was a proposal to add, see you at the cone as a sign off.

651
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:30,300
 This reminded me that I hadn't actually written in to propose an alternative use of cone.

652
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:34,560
 My partner's work life doesn't allow him to be a scoop. However, he's very supportive

653
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:38,500
 enjoys the bits and stories from ICS that I curate for him. And he knows a few of the

654
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:45,020
 running gags. What do you mean? Your partner's work life? Does it allow him to be a? Wait

655
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:49,700
 a minute. What's going on? What's the conflict of interest? We present, we pose your partners.

656
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:54,900
 Does it allow your partner to listen to podcasts? Well, I don't know. There must be something

657
01:06:54,900 --> 01:07:00,220
 going on there. Uh, he also enjoys meeting scoops. Everyone will be known for, uh, known

658
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:05,260
 or met thus far has been amazing, kind and fun as my partner supportive and scoop adjacent.

659
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:09,300
 I have taken to referring to him as my cone in a few of the scoop gatherings that we have

660
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:14,980
 been a part of. I would like to propose the cone be used for a non-scoop supportive partner

661
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:21,580
 and that the new sign off be one of the following. See you in the parlor, wink and tap on nose

662
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:29,740
 optional or see you at the soda fountain jerk, optional handshake like pulling a soda. That's

663
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:37,760
 the fountain jerk. I like to see at the set of fountain jerk is good. Yeah. I like that.

664
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:42,080
 I think there's room for all of these things and I love that you've got, I've already gone

665
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:48,120
 ahead and just started calling your supportive partner, your cone. I do like that. Let's

666
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:58,100
 hope they don't waffle. Just coming through. Ka-ching. Brogan's the best. Oh, we got one

667
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:02,420
 from Andy. Hi churn. It's just a short one today. I wanted to write to ask for a trophy

668
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:07,260
 or statuette or merit badge or whatever it is that you give out to improvisers for a

669
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:13,580
 chanting outstanding achievement in improvisation. Here's the scenario. My wife and I had been

670
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:17,460
 married for a little while now and we have been meaning to update our wheels. I came

671
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:21,860
 home one day, Kevin carrying heavy grocery shopping bags and walked straight past her

672
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:26,360
 into the kitchen to dump them on the table. My wife followed me into the kitchen and from

673
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:32,780
 behind said in a bright and proud voice, Hey honey, I got my new will signed off and finished.

674
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:39,180
 So now you will get everything. Before she could even finish her sentence, I turned on

675
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:45,300
 her and used a piece of produce to pretend to stab my wife directly in the heart. Somehow

676
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:53,100
 she didn't see the funny side of this and I was sleeping on the couch. That's Andy.

677
01:08:53,100 --> 01:09:05,860
 Oh no. Andy? Good bit. That was a good bit. Good timing. It sounds like you were fast

678
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:13,620
 too. I think she was mad that you were fast. Yeah. Well, was it a banana? Ooh. Was it a

679
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:21,060
 cucumber? Was it celery? Could have been the type of produce. The type of produce. A piece

680
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:29,500
 of raw chicken. Just poultry. No. Salmonella. A piece of raw chicken. A flappy old chicken

681
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:38,100
 breast. I challenge you to a duel and you smack them with chicken breast. Ow. That really

682
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:44,920
 hurt. I just saw that episode of the Simpsons the other day where Homer goes around slapping

683
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:52,340
 people and challenging them to a duel and gets in a gunfight. Well, that's what we used

684
01:09:52,340 --> 01:10:05,340
 to do on this show. Now we just do Jock vs. Nerd. Oh yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, it is

685
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:24,820
 time for Jock vs. Nerd. Explosion. Explosion. Of chicken breast that will slap you. Whoa.

686
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:34,180
 Oh, we got a Price of Skrite today. Let's see. Matt, the Magnum Scoopus wrote this Price

687
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:41,020
 of Skrite for us, said that they know that Matt really hated all of the Jock vs. Nerds

688
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:45,800
 where there were the infinite wrong answers. So we made the Price of Skrites. Apparently

689
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:50,820
 Magnum Scoopus made this Price of Skrites specifically so that Matt would hate Price

690
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:56,180
 of Skrite by the end of this game as well. Wow. So let's see what happens. This is some

691
01:10:56,180 --> 01:11:05,540
 fucking saw shit right here. Yeah. What number is the fourth law of thermodynamics? Hint,

692
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:14,700
 it isn't four. What are you? I'm first. I don't even know what this question means.

693
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:22,300
 What number is the fourth law of thermodynamics? Hint, it isn't four. Yeah. I don't even know

694
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:26,380
 what that means. Means it's not number four. It's got to be number five, right? Yeah, I'm

695
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:33,740
 going to guess number five. Paul, what's your guess? I'll guess number three. All right.

696
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:46,620
 Matt? Four. Let's try it. Zero. Oh, well shit. Huh. All right. Oh, we were all over. At

697
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:52,820
 what temperature in Kelvin does all motion stop? I mean, absolutely stop. Paul, you're

698
01:11:52,820 --> 01:12:05,660
 first. Absolute zero. Absolute zero. Matt? Negative one. Oh, that might win. I'll say

699
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:16,620
 one. It's zero. Paul got two points. Hey. A blank day is a vulnerability in software

700
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:22,740
 or hardware that is typically unknown to the vendor and for which no patch or other fix

701
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:31,740
 is available. Matt, you're up first. Zero. Zero. A zero day. Oh, a zero day. That's pretty

702
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:36,580
 good. Right. I think you're right. That's a Jack Reciter. I'm going one. Paul, what

703
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:43,020
 are you going? Not two. Matt, do you hate this yet? It's zero. Matt got two points.

704
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:50,820
 It's all zero. That's the bit. Oh, yeah. Yeah, we got it too. Okay. This year predates the

705
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:56,540
 birth of Jesus, which is one AD or one CT, et cetera, and is used for astronomical calculations.

706
01:12:56,540 --> 01:13:12,500
 I'm first. I'm going to guess zero. Paul? I'll guess. Well, no. Oh, what was it? No.

707
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:18,980
 What was the BC? What did it go up to? I don't know. I know what you're talking about, but

708
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:30,900
 I don't know. I'll guess 230. 230. Chinese dentists, please. One. One. Good guess. Good

709
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:36,500
 guess. Jacob was exactly right. Zero. Two points. All right. Jacob, what's the scores

710
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:44,140
 now? We're all tied at two. And here is the fifth question. Paul is first on this one.

711
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:49,660
 This numerical nickname was given to school-aged Samuel Joel M. Well before his Tony award-winning

712
01:13:49,660 --> 01:14:02,300
 performances. Oh, zero. Mustel, right? Great. Zero. Zero. Matt's going to guess one. The

713
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:10,700
 M stands for Mustel. Paul was exactly right. P-31, P-38, B-17, B-29, Spitfire, Mosquito.

714
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:15,940
 These are all well-known WW2 aircraft of the Allies. But what is the most famous Japanese

715
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:22,300
 aircraft, Matt? Zero. That's the zero. I'm going to guess one. Paul's going to guess

716
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:29,680
 two. And Matt was exactly right. In Pulp Fiction, the rapey pawn shop guy had a chopper with

717
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:35,700
 his name on the key chain. His name can sometimes mean a number in British English. What was

718
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:44,560
 his name if it was a number? Hilarious. That's the best question in this Price is Right right

719
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:49,660
 there. His name was Zed, which is zero. Paul's going to guess one. Matt's going to guess

720
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:55,780
 two. And Jacob was right. It's time for the bonus round. We all have four points each.

721
01:14:55,780 --> 01:15:00,580
 It's me first. I'm going to wager all four. I'm going to do a high-powered spin. If you

722
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:05,420
 can hear my dogs barking, it's because the yard guys are here. Oh, yard guys. The yard

723
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:12,700
 guys. Oh, yard guys. And I lost the wager. Oh my God, Jacob, what a catastrophe. I'm

724
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:18,260
 down to zero points. Paul, what are you betting? I'll wager it all, Bill. Wager? No, it's Jacob.

725
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:23,460
 My name is Jacob. All right. Let's go. Mid. Mid spin. Oh, Paul is a medium-paced kind

726
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:29,100
 of spinner. We all know that. You know me. And Paul, I almost lost his wager, but he

727
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:32,500
 got two times the wager. Oh, shoot. Two times my wager. Look the fuck out. Paul's got eight

728
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:43,860
 points. Matt. I wager all my points. Betting it all. Low, please. A low pace. A nice lack

729
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:52,700
 of daisical spin. A lazy spin. And Matt gets four points. You know what that means. Matt

730
01:15:52,700 --> 01:16:01,180
 and Paul are tied. Eight points apiece. Jacob wins. Oh no. Cats game. Jacob wins. Oh, traditional

731
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:07,900
 Scoopity rules. That was a Price is Skryte sent in by Magnum Scoop. If you want to send
