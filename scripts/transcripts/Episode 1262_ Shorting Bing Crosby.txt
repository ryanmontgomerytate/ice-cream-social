 of those those perfumes they're big money some of them I bet they are I bet
 how much is a like like a standard bottle of cologne now how much about a
 standard bottle of cologne 20 bucks well I spent I spent almost nine for my
 generic I'm ahead of you on this one what we have done is we have ordered
 ambergris in bulk and we're gonna do a DIY cologne kit in our backyard because
 it's cheaper to just order the whole whale eat the meat and get the ambergris
 out then to just buy the ambergris separately and plus that gives you oil
 for your your whale oil right if you like the home if you like the meat you
 might as well just buy the whole whale that's it why fuck the ambergris when I
 can fuck the whale for free wait is that how how does it go that's not an
 expression anywhere but yeah no I'm making in my new expression why smell
 the ambergris when I can fuck the whale for free there you go there you go yeah
 we're gonna put a bunch of vats in the backyard but like you know bourbon in
 one and then like you know some kind of weird floral arrangement and another
 we'll just see how it goes yeah this is this is smart this is this is that Matt

 up I told him to step it up and I haven't just put muscle cream on just to
 make him smell more mature yeah smell like he just worked out I figured
 that's the way to get the ladies is like he wouldn't be wearing muscle cream
 unless he did work it out right he's a real what's that Charles Atlas kind of
 guy yeah okay okay here's where here's where the rubber meets the fucking road
 okay there is a limited edition special deluxe Dior okay and this Dior
 fragrance comes in a special trunk okay okay all right now it's a little case
 yeah and that trunk goes inside a collectible canoe and then you put the
 canoe into the ocean you say how do I how do I steer it and you say use Dior
 this is this is actually just a trunk it doesn't nothing from Mattingly nothing
 from Mattingly on the ore oh I'm you're too excited facts off your phone I got
 confused because I thought it was the expensive clone it's just a box for your
 cologne oh the cologne box is expensive guess how much that fucking box cost
 that Christian Dior limited edition cologne box and you I don't think I
 don't think you can kick this one in the dick nope higher twelve hundred dollars
 hundred hundred dollars no twelve thousand dollars six thousand dollars
 for that one hundred twenty eight million dollars to just hold my cologne
 just your cologne in a box how does that so for that purpose I'm supposed to walk
 into like work or wherever or a party am I supposed to walk into a party with my
 cologne bar this is where you put my briefcase I just walk in what do you
 call it what you call it before your your fragrance wardrobe this is where
 you store your your scent wardrobe I don't understand spending that much on
 something like look you spend a lot of money on a watch people see the watch
 yeah I don't I don't think you bring your cologne with you to other places
 right I mean if you're traveling all the time you want something nice to keep
 your smells in Matt you're traveling all the time I didn't realize that my client
 he's got fish to keep his smells in you are the target demographic if you if you
 see me three weeks on a cruise ship holding up that box with the title I
 work for free you'll know why you'll know why there's that Jean Paul Gaultier
 the mail that one that looks like a dude's torso yeah and 20 bucks so yeah
 some of these things are fucking oh my god Creed Royal English leather Jesus
 Christ from the band yeah I just heard I just from the band I just smelled as
 much as a day we can do this the whole pod but I think you can continually find
 things that are too expensive in the perfume world if you keep searching the
 internet I didn't search very hard and it already gave me a lot just thought
 that was the very first spray with arms wide open those are the instructions
 oh I'm so alone I sprayed too much cologne and now I'm on alone hey off
 air we came up with the best solution for yesterday's sorry last episodes
 rather excuse me last episode scoop mailer saying what do you tell people
 when they ask about your son's circumcision right and off-air I said
 oh you should check out this podcast I listened to called some other kids dick
 Chronicles turn them on to that podcast curious about other kids dicks you should
 check it out you podcast clearly into it yeah yeah yeah other kids dicks I already
 know you love other kids dicks I love this ML Kennedy is batting a thousand
 here at the Creed cologne smells like a worse version of Pearl Jam's use my
 atomizer it's got step let it spritz you clean and clear step spray me with that
 spritz use the atomizer off-air we're gonna do it yesterday which was I've had
 I've had a couple of clips go maybe virals too strong of a word but my most
 popular clips clips I've taken off I get stats right and so these these one a
 couple of clips do well a couple comes do well and also I get stats that say
 you know 75% of people watching and commenting are not your followers right
 that's like a sign that's a sign that's what you want right right yeah external
 engagement and it's one where I'm handling a dickhead it's just two videos
 part one and part two I'm handling some dick at one of my shows this is the
 state of the world man all people want is crowd work and I and it's funny
 because when things go popular means I'm gonna get criticized right so there's a
 lot of like you're thin-skinned you're a terrible person that guy's making
 reasonable requests to a show that guy went to a show and then during the show
 opened his mouth and just had a conversation with the person on stage
 about what he wasn't doing these are the people who are on their phones the
 entire time that a movie is happening and we'll do some backstory I'm at
 Mystique dining and Folsom when with that clip right and they just have like
 a security camera and if you know basically for like liability purposes
 like his a magician loses it which I came close to so that's not my camera
 that's just the the don't get sued camera at Mystique dining so a couple
 things he's one in the first clip he's lecturing me about how he saw some other
 magician and he went to bed that night he figured out the card trick and he
 won't let me move on my show unless he tells me the story and Mystique dining
 is a parlor environment right so it's me at a table surrounded by 24 people in a
 room right and I perform at the is that a stage where the front row is 30 feet
 away so when you when you told me the story yeah there was more to the story
 than I went to bed and figured it out in my sleep there is more to the story in
 that like okay so what happens is I start going I said the first joke is like
 and no one cares right and it gets this it gets this big laugh from the audience
 and the reason why it's because the way Mystique dining works is you you go
 there and you have this opulent beautiful meal with everybody in the room
 before the magician comes out the magician is the last 45 minutes of the
 of the experience right so this gentleman had been the mayor of dinner
 yes so when he told me that story it was probably the fourth time the audience
 was hearing that oh my god and I'm hanging out right I'm back I'm on the
 backstage area waiting for the things so I know this I've already been told this
 guy keeps telling the story about how he figured out a magic trick and he won't
 stop telling people he told the he told the one waiter told the other waiter he
 told Steve the the emcee and Booker Steve Branham who runs the room told him
 and then interrupted my show while I was trying to start a card trick to do it
 and so it just been blitzing people the story the whole time so when I start
 laying in him I it's getting these huge laughs because they've freaking hurt it
 they're done with it yeah they're done with it now it's weird to have this clip
 take off for me personally like I I mean he's an old guy right it's like I am
 picking on an old guy right like I do feel bad like he's not he's not being an
 egregious drunk heckler you know he's just make himself mayor of the room yeah
 right and then the second clip is when I start to get into my card trick he
 starts busting my balls for not having a sealed deck to start off the thing with
 okay and some other magicians have chimed in going like it's a reasonable
 request that is magician bullshit magician to magician abuse and you don't
 have to take it man man there's oh oh I feel you brother I feel you that is that
 is a nonsensical that is awful this business too long bullshit magician
 responses I've been performing for other magicians too long also is the only
 people that that would be reasonable from is another magician at like a magic
 conference or something like that or in a fool us type setup where they're doing
 any of that bullshit because what you're doing isn't doing you're not teaching
 people how to do fucking card tricks you're doing a show but not even that
 it's one of those things that speaks to ignorance because any magician worth
 their salt knows that sealed or not it doesn't really matter yes you can gimmick
 a deck to be sealed yes sealed it's an ignorant comment it comes from a place
 of ignorance and trying to be ignorant it's trying to wind up it's trying to
 want it one up no I don't even mad at some I dealt with some similar shit at
 the guy who disrupted the show I'm really angrier at the magicians who are
 defending I don't know in a in an improv way recently and it got me it sent me to
 11 immediately I'm just like shut your teaching no no no no no discussing
 discussing intros of all things oh and I was just like shut the fuck up you are
 you are just talking shit to talk shit now yes yeah it's just like the like
 devil's advocating on the fly to make it seem like you're being smart apps of
 fucking giving giving an exam oh my god my dogs are going crazy yeah no I was
 just I was talking about it too they're angry no no I want to I want to hear
 your opinion on this Matt so I was just talking about introing and one of these
 simplify an intro because we had previously done an interview and the
 interview got really dark and so at the end I grabbed your line which the this
 is all intended to be comedic in nature yeah yeah to get us out of that death
 spiral yeah and we and we were fine but I said hey in light of the fact that I
 don't think anyone has any fun stories to tell right now about their day-to-day
 yeah why don't we just go with song titles or rather song lyrics for a git
 right yeah and and I was describing the thing and this is the way I put it I was
 like so we'll get a song you know we'll get a lyric and I want you guys to just
 think about a lyric that you're gonna call out don't you know really pondered
 think about something that actually means something to you don't just shout
 out who let the dogs out just give me a lyric and you know what as a matter of
 fact give me a couple give me like two or three and I'll pick my favorite one
 let's see what we do and I got oh you don't want to be fishing yeah wait yeah
 someone is accusing you of trying to cherry-pick the most immediate just in
 the description of how we could do how we could do it not in doing it just in
 the description of saying hey no just give me three I'll pick my favorite and
 was saying oh we don't want to be fishing I'm like you are so wrong on
 this you couldn't be more wrong I know that that's and so I kind of laughed
 because I was mad to the point of explosion and I was like well you know
 there's burning kind of - we're burning the who let the dogs out yeah that kind
 of thing and and you know I did I couldn't in the moment get my head back
 around but like like even Liz the great Liz Allen has articulated to me you can
 do that you can pick you know it's not like you're not I'm not you know first
 of all look most of the time the audience shouts out a bunch of different
 suggestions at the same time anyway usually exactly you heard any yes so you
 end up you end up assessing the situation anyway the idea no but the
 idea is that you were you were disparaged that's what happened and it
 precisely and it made you so angry in the moment you couldn't get your words
 back around on you and I get that completely yeah but the idea that
 someone would use you of like you're literally trying to like you he
 literally just like made you into some kind of cheap cheaper artists some sort
 of hack yeah yeah meanwhile you're actually like trying to spread a wide
 net yeah that that would drive me crazy yeah I needed I needed some validation
 from a fellow it's not a quiz it's not it's not a test it's not like let's see who the
 best improper is by seeing who can tell suggestions the fact is it not and do
 this is a goddamn show no shit dude well that's that the ultimate the
 entertaining the that's the ultimate thing is like okay let's go around all
 this loop-de-loop and then the end of the day you're gonna you're gonna show
 me something on stage worth a fucking right it reminds me the time the
 emphasis brigade was on Conan O'Brien early days right so so they were on the
 the core for including Amy or Amy Poehler were on the stage and they go
 like Conan brought us out there cuz he you know we really love improv and I got
 hooked into this I was like oh they're gonna let them do improv on Conan like
 this is awesome and they go like oh can we just have like you know a setting or
 whatever and they're like oh the Swiss mountains they're like oh and then can
 we have like a character from fix you know history like Buddha and like oh
 and then we have like you know whatever something you might get it's like it's
 like cakes or whatever and like okay we take you to a mountain where Buddha is
 having a birthday cake and they make like noise in the curtain raises up they
 have a perfect set of the perfect set just made exactly for that thing right
 exactly so the idea like so this is you're like you're like oh wait let me
 see if I can get it close to my my right yeah yeah yeah I'm really hanging on to
 ain't no holla back girl soon as I get no holla back girl then I can strike
 because I've got a great I've got a great Gwen Stefani in the pocket like
 what the fuck I came here to do a Gwen Stefani impression and I'm not leaving
 until I do it it just made no fucking sense to me I'm just like you want to
 see what you're finishing what environment was this where were you I've already said
 okay okay it's a weird that's a weird one yeah so I should just say like more
 more on the the clip because I told everybody in the zoom there was more to
 it the clip goes on I do get it I do get a sealed deck so like right part of part
 of the things that I'm like grappling with as I take on the dumb internet
 comments is I think I'm being funny the whole time I know I'm I know that I'm
 I'm being upset but I think I'm being upset in an amusing way if I thought I
 was being upset in a way that wasn't amusing I would have stopped I would
 stop and that's the hardest thing to convey right like like if you look at
 the who dat goat episode that we did with the with the guys right if you go
 back and listen that episode on our feed I am the butt of that episode and I tee
 myself up for it numerous times you you open that door over and over again yeah
 but it's what the show needed right so I'm purpose and you served it yeah I do
 it right so a couple people came up to me and they're like hey man that was
 really tough up there I go what no that was exactly everything went exactly the
 way we wanted you know I'm addressing Robert Young shooting people like no you
 don't know what's going to go away stop talking to him like no I did what was
 supposed to be done in the show right I'm very happy and so it's very hard to
 convey that like I am taking the piss out of the guy I think he knows it a
 little bit I know it and the audience is going with it and so I thought the
 odds would go with it on the internet as well and for the most part they have
 right I'm pointing out the the few dicks but I will say what my social media team
 edited out what's me finally opening up a sealed deck which probably took forever
 because that's another thing about the that's the other joke about like why
 are you using a sealed deck the primary reason is that it is a pain in the ass
 open a fucking back of cards and I used to open sealed decks for my tricks and it
 would sometimes take forever and deal with the cellophane yes you got to deal
 with cracking the box yeah then you got to dispose how many just that cellophane
 the two tops and the two bottoms you have the two jokers on the bottom and the
 two cards on the top instruction cards yeah and then you got to shuffle them and
 else other stuff right and so I do I do I do oftentimes skip ago here's here's
 the deck I've been using from last night look they're all shuffled and I have the
 person look at them and I give them a quick shuffle or they can give a quick
 shuffle and it's just for time it's just for time yeah it's just but also
 if you look and you see that it's a real deck and if you're handing it to other
 people that's it's 99% of the time that's gonna be just a deck you're not
 gonna hand a gimmick deck to a person right there are tricks I do where I
 don't have the deck sealed but if they if they're looking at the deck and
 they're able to shuffle that deck and hand it back to you that is better than
 an un-freshly unsealed deck that is as clusterfucky as you can get mathematically
 right so it's so it's edited out as I finally get all the cards out and do
 whatever and I put the cellophane and the advertising cards and the stuff
 right in front of his face okay I go here I'm gonna shuffle while you inspect
 this garbage I actually thought it was fun for the eyes to actually be annoyed
 but then follow through on all of his demands right so like I did I did I
 actually did yes and him and do my card trick under test conditions but that's
 not social media right so so that's the hard part is so I'm getting accused of
 like not playing fair with the guy and you're like no I actually if you saw the
 whole thing you did another guy goes I don't get it every every clip I see you
 and you're just some thin-skinned guy losing it and I was like that means you
 just saw two clips yes because my other clips don't show that my other clip
 don't have it at all so I was like all right Jesus it's called a brand so yeah
 I got the report like I have a tick-tock page I don't even look at that my social
 runs entirely goes that clip killed on tick-tock and I was like oh man this is
 not it's always the stuff you don't expect though right I know no I mean I
 put that up there thinking it was gonna be something I when I said the because
 like I said it's a security camp footage so I said right I said this is this is
 bad this bad quality but I think this will play and so I was actually right in
 that yeah I'll tell you else only wants to see seal dicks today's show Matt and
 manly's ice cream social is brought to you by night as in nights of the
 roundtable nightmare the night mayor dedicated to wordplay that is hopefully
 still funny when I'm sober that's from goofs scoop in 2023
 let's over it up that is nightmare the nightmare that's the product hello tis I
 nightmare the night mayor yes I'm the mayor of the night how about that I'm a
 mayor drunk and this is the funniest thing I've ever heard in my life I'm a
 mayor I'm also a mayor and a night and a mayor of the night and a nightmare this
 is the mayor of the night the mayor of the night do we have any old business
 oh yeah all right the council will adjourn after we dedicate a tree oh tree
 oh yeah the mayor of the night yeah better haze groups check out I'd like to
 apologize to all of our listeners there the mayor of the night was really
 cherry-picking what business he wanted to attend I'm sorry it was what was
 offended by it was in fact a cherry tree I was planting a cherry tree so that I
 could cherry pick the whole thing yeah yeah yeah so there's someone reporting
 their tin scoop part two of me with the sealed deck it's got 217,000 views on
 tiktok and that'll be great as soon as tiktok starts to monetize I would tell
 you also the weird thing about it is because I've had some of those clips do
 well but they've not gained me followers this one's gaining me a bunch of
 followers which is a weird which is a weird moment as well and I can't chase
 this right you can't go like after oh I should start busting everyone's balls
 then you will just be a thin-skinned magician like we're gonna experiment with
 this company with our podcast right we're gonna give them a little month run
 and see what they do it and they asked me they're like is your brand on ice
 cream social like like similar to your brand as a magician like do they
 compliment each other and I said oh not at all no no I'm a relatively clean
 magician and I am absolutely filthy on this show so no it does not not exactly
 brand synergy now I started off as a magician I was filthy when I started
 there so originally it did it did compliment each other right right but I
 don't I was remembering that I used to ask for a borrowed iPhone by asking for
 a hand jobs machine right yes for the hands jobs machine I asked for the hand
 jobs machine I still haven't donated my Halloween candy I got to look for a
 place to do that still I got 20 pounds of candy download just send it with a
 Sarah to work she'll bring to work it'll be gone in 20 minutes European
 acrobats will eat the shit out of that candy we already got we already got snow
 up here oh no yeah yeah yeah we already got snow and it actually stuck to the
 ground so I'm very concerned about what's coming this winter yeah yeah yeah
 but I'm also pleased to say that my Christmas decorations went up at a very
 timely time because half the neighborhood is up and cooking now a week
 after I put my stuff up so it's it's all good you're a trendsetter buddy I was I
 was speaking of our regional news Jacob are you excited that the shuck era has
 begun down in New Orleans what's happening so is this a is this a ball
 player of some kind yes let me say some my kids are suddenly into football
 enough that they're curious about watching it when I watch it okay but part
 of was we were sitting around two quarterbacks came up one was Michael
 from Atlanta my kids literally were like does that say Phoenix and they were
 hysterical that someone's playing football has a robot penis called my
 called the Phoenix and we just made robot penis jokes if the Atlanta Falcons
 were smarter they would follow your lead oh yeah and then then there was the
 beginning of the Tyler shuck era in New Orleans and which my kids are really
 loving being part of the shuck era they don't give a shuck they're part of the
 mother shuckers they're ready to rock isn't his name pronounced show is that
 true I don't think it I don't think you say the C at all in his name oh I have
 only listened to anyone pronounce it Chuck is it pronounced is it
 mispronounced I thought it was Tyler show I don't know okay I just as easily
 be the person wrong here is it Patrick wah is that right yeah there's some new
 ones too there's a new rise out there are there more was there are there's one
 who plays for Vegas now yeah but yeah no that's that's great and to answer the
 question you're really asking I can't get behind the New Orleans Saints this
 year at all they're just so bad I get I mean we're on we're on our own text
 message shades and everything so Matt sees that I get genuinely aggravated
 when New Orleans wins the game what are you guys doing we want the draft pick
 yeah stop it yeah are you guys sincere feelings now that the FBI has come out
 and said that all of all of organized sports is a psyop is there I guess you
 haven't really lost interest it hasn't changed my view on it in any way okay
 because there's not a single part of what they're saying that I'm surprised
 about right I don't know what you're talking about Paul oh that's a just you
 know the the corruption of bedding throughout all the coincides with the
 fact that like games are fixed and rigged and yeah fixed by the Mafia
 leaning in on on individual players so it's scarier than it being rigged like
 ha ha ha they wrote a book of football or something like oh it's scarier yeah
 but it's yeah but it's funny so what's crazy to me is specifically the
 pitchers indicted for throwing a first pitch ball on purpose right because that
 I know it sounds strange but the competitive balance of that is really
 funny to me because everyone's happy right so if you're betting the first
 pitch is gonna be a strike that's a really hard task for the pitcher right
 but but the batter also wants the first pitch to be a ball right and the and the
 other team wants the first pitch to be a ball so the idea that like I'm gonna
 throw a ball first the catcher is to just go like oh let me just stick my
 glove over here no problem like it's like the ease of everyone making money
 off of a first ball is hysterical to me it's like it was like great that's just
 easy and fun and for basketball and for basketball it's hysterical where people
 were betting unders mean that like I'm gonna go in and not rebound I'm not
 gonna grab a ball I like that to me is like hysterical and as you uncover the
 stories like these are people who are making a lot of money suddenly making
 money on like dumb bets that don't pay in the in the arena of the money that
 they're making right and so like one of the players it turns out like he just
 had never paid his taxes on his crazy NBA salary and had just a crazy ass tax
 lien that he was trying to get out of and so that's why he got into it people
 being roped into illegal poker games the poker game thing with like Chauncey
 Billups and all those yes that's that's bizarre and what this one Paul no so
 it's literally like sports celebrities luring just other motherfuckers into
 playing poker games with them and then not playing an honest poker game yeah so
 so illegal poker yes I did hear about that illegal poker rooms and states that
 the guys gambling of the ice poker running illegal poker game so they're
 running these crazy rooms using celebrities basketball players to lure
 in people with money yeah and then using literally like microchipped cards and
 like technology I saw like right they had these glasses on and you could see
 every card like every card was clearly visible from the back like I knew what
 everybody had the whole time yeah it's wild and I was laughing at someone who's
 one of the sports podcast listen to is a big card collector and stuff he goes to
 card collecting conventions and he goes I mean I don't want to say nothing but I
 was wondering why Chauncey Billups was at every one of these events why it's
 this active NBA coach and Hall of Fame basketball player finding time to go to
 every card event there he's getting paid like 50 G's each time yeah fucking job
 because coaches make the fucking donuts coaches make millions right so like the
 idea there's no way these card things are paying and like that's actually worth
 this time but yes they are in a way they are in a way yeah right yeah it's just
 free money that's crazy what's crazier is the argument so like what happens is
 this is this is a thing where both sides think they're totally correct right we
 should stop all this legalized gaming gambling on sports it's gonna mess with
 people's lives right and then the fucking degenerates that are like no no
 no by having the best out there and we and we're catching these these spikes of
 weird bets we're exposing what could be happening behind the scenes or off off
 books and smaller books other places like you want to keep it out in plain
 sight you want to get some I feel like that's a really good point I think it's
 a good point with all of them except for first pitch ball that's the only one
 that I'm like you just can't everyone's favor to do it like it's just everyone
 will take it it's the worst what do you think about the always go into game seven
 thing or often going to game seven thing oh I don't we've tried to rig that I
 don't I don't think those stuffs can be that on that level I don't think things
 can be rigged on that level I just don't that's tough I mean especially with this
 world series which was crazy great the amount of ones I went to extra innings I
 mean you can't say let's have one game go to 18 innings when they have to play
 the next day at 5 o'clock like yeah no one's no one's writing that right like
 no one's rigging that but the fact that three of the games that went went to
 extra innings I think in the World Series including including one literally
 literally a bonus game they literally did 18 innings they accidentally played
 yeah they doubled they played eight games so I think it's just I think it's
 it's just a testament to the competitiveness of you know these
 athletes are still athletes so they're still psychotic to be professional
 athlete you have to be a psycho like we have to remember right so I don't I
 think you'd only rig it so much football being the hardest one right like that's
 the one where like you you can't oh football is is just impossible to rig
 the full game without like truly cooperation well that yeah very level
 cooperation and if you like these real dumb plays where you're like oh that was
 an intentional fuck up but the thing is the thing is it's so precious right so
 like if you drop a pass on purpose yeah to underperform to pay a bet you you
 might get yanked out of a game for good like like like you're right it's so the
 marketing that ego for those guys too yeah like a team maybe scores four or
 five times you know an entire game you know they basically get like eight to
 ten chances at driving it's just not there's just not enough leeway for
 someone to purposely underperform and then not suffer dramatic professional
 consequences for it yeah it's just not it's just not the this is the I could be
 proven wrong I would be some of the stuff that's come out it's been baffling
 I reserved the right to be corrected but so far I mean look look at me like the
 Giants are trying the hardest and for three quarters they'll do well and then
 for the fourth quarter guess you could you could probably that's your best
 argument it's that the Giants are paid by the Mafia to stop trying in the
 fourth quarter there's really not a lot of evidence to support against yeah I
 again I have made good on my promise not to watch any NFL this season and I
 haven't but I do see the memes keep coming up in my feed because I am in the
 Pittsburgh area and you can't avoid it and it's just every week I see them I
 see Steelers shame themselves like stuff like that like Steelers embarrass and in
 prime time and I'm like of course you hired a schlocky freak to be your new QB
 they are a confusing team they're using team you ain't kidding why I'm glad I'm
 not watching this year because it's just every time they're like these guys are
 dirt they come out and they score like a thousand points and they look like a
 juggernaut and then right you go like oh I guess they're good and then they're
 like oh we can't score at all no no no 10 scoop says the Giants are great it's
 the damn game that's too long yeah you're right we've got that fourth
 quarter out yeah three-period game why don't we just if they just copied hockey
 to be under three quarters in my in my family in my family in my family text
 read my oldest brother said he doesn't trust anyone who dies their beard anyway
 and I said I feel attacked and then the goes right though and the coach got
 fired tonight this week and I just thought up it's bad week for the beard
 dye boys bad bad one my brother's in beard die that adds up quick man that
 ain't cheap yeah no it's not like cologne you know I actually you should
 see that I just bought a seven thousand dollar case for my beer tie for my just
 for men right in yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yes different beard
 dyes for different events sure well some days you're going all gray some days
 you're going yeah yeah and instead of having like a 1 through 10 for the for
 the for the for the case lock it's just different jewels right it's just diamond
 ruby emeralds you just go through it real jewels yeah yeah it's all hold your
 eight dollar just for men okay that's right that's right that shit is such a
 mess to do too I've only done it like twice yeah I was in 50 Shades I was
 using the brush and stuff and that was easier so III do I do both yeah now
 we're getting into yeah now we're getting into it I the the brush in one
 can feel like a little a little cakey on the yes it definitely does and so I find
 it like makeup yeah I find it hard to go to bed right like oh yeah you got to
 wash that shit off your face right but then you're trying to scrub it and when
 you do comb in beard dye when is it washed like when is it done I don't like
 I don't have a base of all white do you know what I mean so like right I just
 simply go from yeah it'd be easy for me greyer to know there's there's my all
 white beard then I go to bed with like a big scratchy face and but it looks so
 much better the the the comb and beard dye looks so much better than the just
 for men diet it does look sharp right yeah someone pointing out just for men
 not the most woke name and the modern selling points right yeah I mean that's
 just that's just on them they're just they're just losing money by still
 having it called just for men right yeah that's the whole that's the whole men

 didn't I did a bad job of 46 ish great a museum in Australia is being forced to
 allow men into art into an art exhibit originally conceived for women only
 after a tribunal ruled discriminatory following a complaint by a disgruntled
 man who was design a denied entry right let's see so Tasmania's museum of old
 and new art Mona has been ordered to stop refusing entry to persons who do
 not identify as ladies to its ladies lounge exhibit within 28 days after
 ruling was made blah blah blah does it say why she's doing it yeah it's hard
 to find out why she did it yeah experimental artwork by artist and
 museum curator Kersha kaech ele is billed by the museum as a tremendously
 lavish space where women can indulge in decadent nibbles fancy tibbles and other
 ladylike pleasures hosted and entertained by the fabulous butler some
 fella from New South Wales had paid the $35 Australian entry fee it's about
 $23 u.s. and was barred from entering the exhibit on April 1st last year so was
 barred on April Fool's Day according to the documents he said that it made an
 equal rights argument yeah there you go there's basis a priceless like Picasso
 was like in the women's restroom was the her first argument for putting it as
 women's only okay but I thought it was done in response to something but I
 might be I might be just trying to find it here yeah Nick Newman you're in the
 chat unmute yourself if you can are you walking around where are you I'm here
 fellas what can I do for you I was realizing the other night why we came up
 with the turn barn and you can tell me if I'm wrong on this all right I'm
 learning this as you are yeah yeah because if you said horse house it gets
 really confusing I'm only gonna call it the horse house from now on please bring
 all that hay to the horse house please who built the horse house oh we should
 call it something else people think sex workers in my backyard I love it hey
 speaking that I just got my tickets to a great show for January 23rd jokers of
 magic yeah oh awesome you're coming out oh this is Lexington you come you'll be
 back in town I'm back in town and that's my birthday oh wow we got to go off to
 your birthday yeah let's do that yeah cuz you are now you're at your other
 horse job right now right you're at West Coast where it doesn't rain it does not
 rain what's what's what's what's the horse news out there what's what's going
 on out there on the West Coast you know it is a whole different ballgame out
 here this ain't Kentucky kids now Kentucky I think Kentucky is like very
 like lavish horse farms a lot of like crazy money going into these like
 perfect conditions for horses and that kind of stuff it's right out there if
 you're on the West Coast and you have that kind of money you will buy a two
 bedroom house or groceries different different level of investment I want to
 grab like is here in Solana Beach it's a it's an upscale place mm-hmm and I want
 to grab people by the shoulders and go you know that very small house you live
 in you can buy entire horse farm in Kentucky that's exactly what happened to
 Las Vegas post-pandemic before the pandemic is to say it all the time I was
 like wait till people from California realize they can sell one of their
 houses and buy two out here and then just commute as needed as soon as the
 work from home thing took off that's exactly what happened out here is
 everyone oh we can't even get one house in Vegas but we could get one in
 Pennsylvania right absolutely well it's close to Pennsylvania that West
 Virginia is one of the few states that have a uptick in in population because
 the one thing people left those these terrifying hell scapes and went to West
 Virginia and bought all the land you can have right now the big the big race out
 there's the Breeders Cup the Breeders Cup just wrapped up so that it just the
 first week in November it wrapped up so that's the world was what was the big
 news what was the big scuttlebutt from the Breeders Cup last-minute scratches
 horses got all the way to the gate and they they were not allowed to participate
 because of due restrictions because one person is federally oversight it now we
 have federal oversight gate it got all the way to the gate and they were like
 no not you there's like leading horses off the track yes and it's like okay and
 then like owners just embarrassing it's really embarrassing when your horse has
 to be led off the track by the pony without a saddle on what were the
 reasons the differing reasons but but veterinarians seeing signs of soreness
 or or not okay unsound horses but oh okay the track that they run it at the
 particular track had a problem for a couple of seasons of an unusual amount
 of horse deaths not that particular track the okay the track you're thinking
 of is Santa Anita which is in Los Angeles oh yes you're right the track
 here I have to say has one of the highest safety ratings in the world it's
 it's it's San Diego got it okay okay I'm mixing it I'm mixing my West Coast
 tracks this track was built this and I'm Paul if you want to warm up this track
 was built on in 1939 on a loan taking against taking against the life
 insurance policy of Bing Crosby that's true so somebody just bet against Bing
 living and won 100% they shorted Bing Crosby's life insurance to build this
 track it was a friend of his name Pat O'Brien fucking friend yeah boy gotta
 let you know this cough isn't getting any better go ahead and take a shot
 hey that sounds well all right nobody I've said it for years nobody does a
 better Pat O'Brien impression the Nicholas name that's it go ahead and load
 my body I like it let's have some more horses coming up and they're wearing
 makeup like a beat-up person just like don't mind me I'd sure like to race
 today I fell in the paddock I I should have cooked the dinner right I should
 have cooked the oats right oh you you don't know Bob Baffert like I do he can
 change I can change him everyone the other claim to fame of this of this track
 is that this is the place where Chris Jenner and Robert Kardashian first met
 oh so everybody brings it up like that's that's this boy is that what's going on
 I didn't hear you go ahead is is it an old cursed Indian burial ground as well
 as that what's going on with that fucking place God might as well be it was it was
 Shawnee ghost popping up in the middle race during World War two this track was
 used as a as a plane wing assembly factory where was the where was the fancy
 wing assembly factory really interesting Beverly Hills here in Del Mar that's a
 really interesting tidbit I wonder what they use Santa Anita for and then
 everybody immediately was like don't ask so then I looked it up and it's like what
 was it it was an internment camp yeah and I was like well that's not that's
 good not gonna be on the tour that they at least get to race the horses you
 chipped neck up on that one Paul so what were the big horses that won and should
 we keep keep an eye on them for upcoming not for long episodes and then also what
 was the attendance like oh absolutely so the attendance was was was a like a
 thousand down from last from last year okay a thousand fewer guests which is
 hardly noticeable in a place like that you're talking about 63,000 people over
 two days okay okay okay okay okay and then the so your current world champions
 are the Japanese are the current world champions of horse racing oh they the
 the current world champion is a horse named forever young from from Japan okay
 did Japanese horses usually do well in these races so I last year they sent
 19 horses to this event and and they won none of the 14 races no that's a tough
 that's and I said they could have sent 19 hermit crabs and got the same result
 so this year guess who called Newman's bluff and sent 19 hermit crabs literally
 they can't they sent nine horses this year and just absolutely crushed oh wow
 okay okay all right well then that's exciting we'll have to look out for so
 they're figuring it out and then I I got to briefly talk to Mike Rapoli listen to
 not for long Mike Rapoli is a real character a real treasure so Mike on
 Twitter has named himself the Commissioner of horse racing as he walked
 by me we made knowing eye contact and I said a good luck Kamish three paths on
 the back and a smile so that's there you go he got so Frankie to Tory had
 himself a nice weekend Frankie to Tory this is the best thing if you again not
 for long podcast the show tries to make it crazy that Frankie's still racing at
 his age and then we find out that it's very common for racers to race at his
 age they say down those lock and he's just trying to clutch it any opportunity
 he gets and he ends up working with Bob Baffert one of the world's most famous
 trainers and they give him a horse and the Breeders Cup so it's like really
 that's the it's the last the last that's that hard Scrabble Road we're following
 with him he's just fallen on hard times but possibly due to his suspension and
 we will just say for legal purposes made up the fact that we also think he's a
 cocaine and so we often make jokes about that as well total fabrication we're
 just a comedy show we're just wacky guys we made Robin Lee to cut the maniac we
 just do these things and so we can't be held responsible for things that we make
 up Frankie Dettori's bread surrogate so Frankie he would never eat bread get
 real that man hasn't seen a carb in 30 years so Frank he did not he was not
 riding the Japanese horse I imagine he was not all right well I'm still looking
 out for that tough luck kid I feel like he's still gonna find a place to shine
 he's gonna land on his feet somewhere all four of them well thank you thank you
 Newman for I want I wanted my Breeders Cup update oh wait also how's the how's
 the horse you and my dad bought claims in how's that horse still training well
 looking for that first start should be fine that's where your dad's gonna have
 a lot of fun with that it should be fun what's the site you guys went to yeah my
 race horse calm calm you can buy really small shares micro shares of race
 horses so my dad owns like $120 $120 share of like a five hundred thousand
 dollar is your father the world's oldest brony at this point my dad yeah world's
 oldest like that's a bonus brony he's basically a My Little Pony fanboy yes
 he's basically living out of My Little Pony fantasy this is amazing yes yeah
 does he have does he have a small statuette replica of the horse that's
 what I should get him for Christmas actually get him a custom pony get him a
 little get him a My Little Pony with whatever share it is like one you know
 three thousand some horse hair in an envelope my little ponies like they do
 custom the the if only there was a way that you could figure that out oh my god
 well before you pop is there any what's Briarfest okay so Briar horses are the
 the collectible horse action figures what they're made by the Briar company
 and they're not getting into that that fucking bullet I bet and they have a
 full-blown like week-long festival for these plastic horses here in Lexington
 every year oh my gosh and they are fanatical to the point where we think
 about closing to tours during that time oh there's so many people come out for
 the for the for the horses for the toy horses they will they'll buy two hotel
 rooms at the clarion and they will get permission to remove the furniture from
 one of them and right and they just turn it into a store a store for any other
 people who will do your your plastic horses hair for you like a salon yes
 dude and and and the nice website they've got like pictures of these of
 these this horse yeah that they are I guess introducing the 2026 Briarfest
 celebration horse Corgi Hill Flinka and it's a real yeah yeah yeah it's just a
 picture of a real horse and then right below it they've got like the plastic
 things that they've made of that horse and they and the kids I get a good job
 the adults will fist fight over that horse right I can't picture someone
 getting their horses dolls hair done to present it to another person like huh
 oh you can't my world would do you show off the grooming of the hair of your
 figures it's all about customization yeah so you get your base you get your
 base bucks yo like this is your standard buck and then it's all about people who
 can trick these things out there's a guy I follow on YouTube his channel is mr.
 home arcade this cat has got money and he gets four of everything basically
 yeah and he also pays all these other awesome creators to send him customs so
 the stuff that he has is one-offs totally unique but really cool really
 well done but a lot of it is you take the base figure and then just build on
 it ah that yeah yeah true it's all about that base true or false Newman that one
 of the biggest briar collectibles is just a Katherine the great with her legs
 wide open yes the great playset would sell like hotcakes
 talking about this place is the longest saddest fistfight so I'm gonna be two
 punches me hit you and you hit the bed me hitting you and me your surface and
 yes good Jesus with legs wide open but then you like custom satellite there's a
 person make it tiny little saddles out of real leather see that's where that's
 when it gets really yeah yeah yeah yeah see with with the Masters of the
 Universe especially that's my forte it gets to like characters and people that
 were featured in the cartoons that have never been made into figures which
 that's getting that list is getting smaller and smaller and smaller of
 course years of yeah yeah Masters universe figures for that but there are
 still some and these people want these one-off figures it's been their dream
 like oh I really want this figure from this episode and if it's never been made
 people will make it but then the interesting thing is the fandom will
 respond and if it's a nice enough custom and enough people go oh well I really
 wish I had that figure too Mattel follows those boards and they build out
 figures based on fan demand and that's how we get a lot of these really rare
 weird one appearance I'm telling you right now the person making custom
 leather saddles for those Briar outfits doesn't know that there's a whole
 battle cat saddle universe out there oh yeah I don't know I thought they might be
 they might know they might know looking at some of those Mondos but but that's
 it that's the fact too is I would not be surprised if some of those what do you
 call that Newman the whole on Psalm I guess it's a lot of livery right the
 tack the livery the tack is that what it's called it can be liver yeah so that
 would encompass the what the jockey rides what the jockey wears the colors
 oh that's sure yes and then the saddling and all that kind of stuff would be tack
 so I mean I'm gonna go out on a limb and say there's probably been an occasion
 where a model tack maker has inspired a real-life replica oh sure oh yeah I'm
 sure I was worried we were gonna look at this like as a strictly parasitic
 relationship but no no no it's copacetic
 yeah yeah yeah no these guys these guys absolutely inspire you know the big boys
 to make the big toys that's how it goes all right does have three battle cat
 saddles already you're right rich scoop I have more than three so past Breeders
 Cup how long is your season out there Newman I'd get right ahead home just
 okay just for it to be cold in Kentucky and then what's the next big race on the
 radar for for possible Triple Crown people because the Breeders Cup starts
 at all right starts at all the Breeders Cup juvenile starts at all and then the
 next in March there there are some there are lots of there's the the Arkansas
 Derby there's the rebel stakes there's a Florida Derby but what everybody's
 really got their eye on because of the international horses that are making a
 bigger impact is the Dubai World Cup the the United Arab Emirates Derby is
 probably gonna be the next that's that's early early March okay flying horses
 makes me scared mayor force one so cuz do Americans and other best horses to
 Dubai or is it always this thing oh always you said a horse flights the most
 boring flight in the world right I hate it so much it's not that boring it's
 like a it's like fucking Russian roulette the way you described it yeah
 standing on there with with a needle with a put down and a dope up in both
 hands that reminds me of how I used to describe being a fireman oh yeah it was
 just long periods of just complete boredom and then every once in a while it
 goes freestyle crazy so that's about what it is okay back to chili chili chili
 don't work it up I forgot about the put down juice Paul somebody you can murder
 a horse at 30,000 feet that's amazing that's it numerous times someone has
 spent tens of thousands of dollars to ship a horse to somewhere and have it
 arrived dead that's what this was that is what has happened the numbers that
 makes me sad about that is just like my recent experience with the injected die
 I'll wager that if you put death juice in a horse you can't really go glue or
 meet with that bad boy either that's pretty best you're pretty much just
 throwing him on a fire pit or great question Paul Nick how edibles a horse
 after you kill it so it's okay yeah all right the half life's pretty low there
 is well it's kind of like it's kind of like how much rat feces they'll let into
 a McDonald's hamburger how much how much how much phenol barbital they'll allow
 into an average mix of puppy chow I don't know what's going on skippies just
 kind of low key today breakfast I don't know a lot of horse meat man he had his
 he had his purina he had his kennel ration I don't know thank you Newman
 thank you Jack vs. nerd buddy thank you guys go get them pure Reno failure here
 we go of irradiated horses oh they didn't make it
 oh that's too bad I paid a lot of money for this flight do I get any of that
 money back or anything oh no no no no I I guess she did I guess you did
 transport the horse that is that is all I paid you to do that seems totally fair
 by the way the ladies lounge is the name of the Tasmanian Museum Mona that's the
 name of the art installation in Mona it was ruled illegal by the the first
 judges who dealt with it it has gone through to the Tasmanian Supreme Court
 who did uphold the legality of the exhibitions women-only policy there are
 now ways that men can see it there are a couple of different ways that they've
 made it so that male visitors can go in and see the display there are it features
 what you were saying Matt it features expensive jewelry and art including
 Picasso canvases as a comment on sexism and historical exclusion though some
 pieces were later revealed to be fakes or replicas I guess you're making the
 point yeah oh man that was that was it he inadvertently made the point of you
 know how dare you exclude me oh yeah while women had been excluded from male
 spaces forever and there are still so many of those things still on the books
 today yeah so it's almost like that guy didn't didn't get it he really we got a

 fur triangular ears with black tufts at the tips and broad snowshoe like paws is
 that a Lynx that sounds good to me I'll go links oh my goodness Jacob Tari's
 failed system let's do a score check Jacob score check Paul and I are tied in
 the lead with 800 apiece but Matt is right on our heels with 600 there aren't
 any more daily doubles left but there are three questions left provinces for 6
 and 800 and Canadian actors and actresses for 800 it's gonna be tough
 you're up hmm do I want to leave the two province questions for you two or not
 of course let me just remind you that I got Ontario I'll take Canadian actors
 please for 800 who had a career spanning 60 years he appeared in more than 100
 films and 150 television programs portraying more than 220 actors and die
 or characters and died in 2010 I have to remember a Canadian actor who died in
 2010 that's that is precisely what the question is asking you to do yes I'm
 just okay where was I in 2010 and let me try to picture when I was grieving the
 loss of Canadian actors let's see I had been really upset about 9/11 for nine
 years at this point I can't I pass like that I can't Paul John Candy died before
 that right yeah yeah yeah I think so yeah who else is kind of like John Candy
 lemurs screamer creamer says or name one of the 220 characters oh man it's red
 green no I have to pass I don't know it passes to me I definitely know this but
 I'm passing anyway out of sportsmanship Leslie Nielsen oh that was who I was
 thinking of hilarious but I was like no you just have airplane on the brain
 because the earlier questions oh it is Leslie Leslie Nielsen okay yeah that was
 who I was thinking of that's so funny Wow there you go could have one to cost
 me the game guys cost me the game well Paul and I could both miss our questions

 category and the game provinces for 600 will Jacob win this game who knows

 created for the expo 1986 huh oh pass it Jacob is Montreal a city or
 province mmm great question I I think Montreal is wait is Quebec a province

 Quebec British Columbia well played I really have to say this might be one of
 my least impressive wins and I owe it to just the fact that Jacob could just just
