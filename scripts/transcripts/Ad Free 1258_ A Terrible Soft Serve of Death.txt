 That's right. That's right
 We get it
 We're about to set up our trick-and-treat
 Deal as soon as we wrap here. We'll be going outside the city of our house here. Yeah, same here and
 I
 Well, we did a test run last night basically Ryre Applethorne built me a
 Disguised jack-in-the-box giant jack-in-the-box. Yeah, uh-huh. And so yesterday was trunk or treat
 Over at the school. And so everybody had these ornate
 You know trunk design set up their car trunk designs
 Yeah, they do like full-on decorations on their cars and everything right? Yes a trunk look like a monster mouth or all kind of stuff
 Like that. Yeah, and my wife signed signed me up for it. But we
 We've been crazy busy. And so I basically had
 30 minutes to run home and put stuff in my car to make trunk or treat happen and then back to the school
 I had the Halloween parade and I had to teach a theater workshop to the kids there and then trunk or treat was right after
 And so I rolled up in my Corolla
 Yeah
 put down a blanket the skeleton a couple a couple skeletons and
 then I gave the controls over to my youngest son who scared the shit out of everybody with a jump scare and
 With with
 With with with basically no decorations. We got third place in the trunk or treat because we were scared
 Yes
 Ryre Appledorn coming through baby. Well poor Ryre Appledorn. I have to get him on the phone
 The prop did not hold up to the stress test of a repeated truck or treat thing. Oh really?
 How many how many reps did the prop get last night I mean
 50 60 reps. Yeah, you know, I don't normally perform that trick 60 times in an hour
 Interesting interesting
 Will that my now my son to his content is the the front door broke off completely and okay
 then the fish that the clown was holding snapped out of his hand and then the finger got of the one clown got caught and
 Something on one of the reloads and snapped a finger
 It was a real
 It was a day news a day and I was also relying on that tonight today
 so I'm gonna get my neighbor Gary to see if we can fix the front door on the on the
 Clown now the clown with a snap finger and a couple of broken things doesn't hurt that doesn't hurt the bit at all
 the vibe is still there for the scare. Yeah and
 To Ryre's credit he I for no reason he added two giant loud horns to the prop when I didn't ask for that at all
 And it absolutely makes it and my son was way on top of it
 Just blasting people with the horn on the jump scare and just really good really crushing it. And so perfect
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but yes, this is indeed
 I gotta I'm gonna see if I can put it to put it back together for the for the for the
 Tonight the don't leave the property reading. Yeah. Yeah
 Oh
 Paul you're already dressed for trick-or-treat. You got your you got your Ninja Turtles hat on there
 This is actually a winter to that. I just sport when it gets cold. I was outside doing some chores today
 It's freezing out here. It's in the 40s. You're full on Ninja Turtles hat. I'm sorry. It's not a costume
 It's just your regular hat. Yeah, it's just a regular hat. I wear my phone. Yeah, of course
 I mean I wore Ninja Turtle pants on the airplane for years. That's how that's how I roll. I'll give shit
 Yeah
 No, somebody was just asking me if I would open up my own comic book store at some point
 I don't think I want the hassle. It's too much hassle my guy. My guy is in a new location now and
 It's just been challenge after challenge for him getting it all squared away
 It's a great new space, but just brick-and-mortar retail is thriving like no other time in history
 Right now, you know what comic shops are actually doing better this year than they have in a long time. I
 Think they're up something like 30 sure. No, seriously. It's a believe you but I'm
 That's a not a great comparison to what comic book shops a few years ago weren't doing well at all, right? Uh
 Yeah, I mean, yeah, they've certainly had their ebbs and flows. Yeah, that's all I mean, but they're yeah, I guess that's true
 I mean, there are a lot of them in town now that you're right there. I've seen a lot of them just pop up
 Anecdotally across Vegas. Yeah coming up coming up from the bottom, but it's a it's a you know, relatively inexpensive form of of
 entertainment and
 Every comic book shop has always been a labor of love. There's nobody for sure
 That is nobody open the comic book shop being like and then and then I'll buy my island
 More the more to the point when did comic book shops become the collectible shops as well late?
 Seven when we were kids they were they were just comic book shops, right?
 Or were they were they already not late seventies as far as we mean like when it became
 About collectibles about the collectibles. I've got like all that all like the toys and gimmicks
 Yeah, the toys from the different things and there aren't the collectible toys and the and the Pokemon cards and all the things
 Don't make me start listing things. I just sound like an old man
 There are still some comic shops that are very purist and really hold mostly
 Books and there are the other things that those like those toys and things have a good
 Margin on them. So yeah, everybody kind of thought fair as it out. Yeah
 I'm holding the mug from the wedding the wedding favorite mug of the people who nice. Oh nice
 Yeah, I just got out of there. You went you gotta get it. Yeah. Yeah, I have they sent me this one
 They sent me this non-descript plastic cup that I'm drinking out of. Yeah
 but yeah, we went and
 Anne and I had a
 Day to go and just kind of do a few little things together
 she's been working like crazy and
 so we went to get some food at Applebee's and then we went to the comic book store and
 then we went to try out this new ice cream spot that we have in town and
 It was great. This new ice cream store is great. And yeah, it's called
 Crispy cone and what's your what's your go-to order at an ice cream shop. I'm usually chocolate
 You're just a scoop of chocolate usually but this time the way they do it
 I usually just rob them. They just say give me all the money in the register
 Smart smart. It's very different
 This this place very fancy crunk. Oh, he's out there got ice cream shops working for him
 My default is probably chocolate chip cookie dough. That's Anne's that's what Anne likes
 Yep, that's my go-to order is a shake
 Okay, shake. Yeah, I want to I want a no labor. No labor for you. Just went down get it done
 No, no, I want to I want to take it. I want to I want to be able to walk and sip
 Enjoy my shake shakes are so good
 And then I feel so terrible with myself after I have them and I don't know why
 Big one. I I see people order like the huge ones that everything I'm going to you are a crazy person. That's me
 I love me a big big chocolate milkshake. I just want I want a little like hand-sized
 You know just a little little shake little little chocolate shake or maybe a vanilla or something like that
 I don't have restraint if I get a shake. It's gone. It's gone
 I yeah, it is it is a it is a two-minute treat and then it is I'm with you on that
 I I have no ability to like casually take a come you do have to pace yourself on the old shakes a little bit
 not me
 Now take it take it down
 That not only will not pace himself on the shakes, but they I got one that was
 What he caught cheesecake, oh
 Yeah, so they put chunks of cheesecake all on the sides of it and then drizzled strawberry syrup all over it
 Really really fucking good. It sounds like a mess
 It was it was really hard to get home and it was really tricky to juggle
 But it was delicious. You must have been an Anne's car. No, we were in mind. I
 Thought that you would have taken that into your own car. I
 Know I was like, uh, I had well, here's here's what happened
 Paul does not like taking food into his car. I don't we're in we're in the ice cream shop and
 I start to get gurgle belly
 And I and I know
 That time is of the essence
 The clock has started and we we not only got we each got an ice cream and we got hot chocolates
 So I'm sipping a little bit of hot chocolate eat a little bit of ice cream
 Mixing temperature should really help really help suit that belly. Well
 Got a big pot of coffee. I get in the car Edward and as soon as we're driving I'm like and I
 Got a bucket of prunes. I got some stuff going on things are things are happening and she's like you're gonna make you're gonna make it
 I'm like, I think so she says is are you gonna shit in your cars? I'm not gonna shit my car
 I just cleaned this car spent three hours the other day cleaning and detailing my fucking good
 I'm glad that factor because if you hadn't cleaned your car, it would have been an option
 Not an option. I haven't cleaned my car in months. I might shit in my car. I don't know. I don't know I
 Don't know because here's what happened. We got home. I
 Was in dire straits. I got out of the car. I came around the car
 Into the house as I'm coming around the side of the car and says are you okay? Are you shitting yourself? And I go
 Oh, no
 As soon as she said it
 Is she did
 Me and I said, oh no
 She is happening. It's happening. She dream boarded it. She straight up. This is an impression of me
 She's doing impressions of me all day. She goes it's happening. Oh, no. Oh, no, and I go running up the stairs
 At least started making shit filling my pants. I'm throwing my jacket away
 Ripping my belt off trying to save my wallet and keys. I can feel it ripping out through my underwear
 Into my jeans. I'm like this is going to drip on my stairs if I don't get upstairs
 Run up the stairs run up the stairs
 I'm not doing that to my downstairs bathroom. I
 Get upstairs I
 Get up this moment. I am going to the closest bathroom. I get upstairs. I throw my
 Hands off. I throw everything over to the side. I
 Completely have ruined my pants my jeans my underwear my socks
 everything I
 Sit on the commode and the commode is just the sides are now just
 Terrible terrible soft serve of death
 And it's just like the stench I'm like, I know I'm sorry I can't control
 Matt Matt checked out Matt has left the zoom
 And is laughing and of course at the same time saying I'm sorry
 I know I know I shouldn't be laughing but you're too funny when you're doing this stuff. You're making me laugh. You're killing me smalls
 And I did I made her laugh through the whole thing even though
 Most women would just leave that's what I tell her straight up
 I'm like, this is not the first nor the last time I've shit my pants. You haven't just left me. So it's fine
 So yeah, the guy do all that laughter it's just it's just gonna be stuff going to a suitcase. Yeah, that's the trouble
 Yeah, that's gonna be the bad time, but it was fine
 It took me about an hour to get everything
 So real quick Leon Kasab in the chat just got back in. Hey guys, I just came back
 Should I recommend this episode for an obelisk?
 Sure
 It sums us up it appeals to a certain demographic I
 Guess I mean, I'm just I'm just being honest. I'm just being honest
 It was a rough night anyway
 but
 Finally got everything settled down and then yesterday. I cleaned the bathroom top to bottom
 So, you know, I did my part to fix everything. I cleaned the bathroom that day and then I cleaned it again yesterday
 So yes, I did need the muffler. I did not have my muffler muffler would have saved
 But what a muffler have even would have but a muffler have slowed this down. Yes, this sounds like too much for a muffler
 This was pretty intense. I have to say
 Bourbon barrel like every really just
 What are we doing? Yeah. Yeah, I don't know but
 it was just crazy how she was like she seriously was like
 Are you shitting yourself? And then sure enough I was like, oh god, I am
 Wasn't before I wasn't before and now I am and I didn't make it and it was just hell on earth
 Hell on the car is fine
 Cars fine. I was clear from the car
 Everything's fine
 Everything's fine now
 Well, no, no some underwear got thrown away. Yeah. Yeah. All right and some socks and
 Well, no, I didn't get to my socks but
 Socks is an unrelated side effect and some carpeting. No the socks. Here's the sock story
 So I have socks we're on I have socks that I've probably been wearing for like ten years some of them and now they're getting
 real rippy. Holy and so I
 Wait rippy. Holy, I bought a bunch of new socks
 And so I was like well as I go through and I find my rippy
 Holy socks, I'll just start throwing them away because I've got a bunch of new socks and
 Just so happens this coincided with me wearing some rippy. Holies for their last time and then and it was so bad
 Taking off everything is such a rush that the top ring of the sock stayed on my foot like a
 Rippy holies because I was trying to get out of my poop filled clothes
 You have tear away socks
 So then I use those socks to start the cleaning process somewhat and threw them away. Oh my god
 Yeah, okay. It was intense. It was an intense afternoon
 It was a heavy heavy
 It was a lot. So wait, wait
 So then was the this cheesecake Sunday in transit with you while this was happening? Yes
 Yes, I said it on the roof of the car and just left it ran
 Didn't even get my hot hot cocos till like an hour later. They were not hot by that time. They were delicious
 So yeah
 yeah, and and got the sundae and put it in a bowl and put it in the freezer for me and then the hot cocos just
 Sat in my car till I was able to come back downstairs and get my hot cocos out of the car
 It was a you know, well for the love of God needs some roughage and that is the following sponsor

 Rusty spring and Rippy Holy, I mean I always loved you guys cuz you did remind me of the old furniture
 I used to have sex with
 Don't get me in a goodwill that place would get wrecked
 Jacob did you see yes, Springsteen deliver me from nowhere. I
 Attempted to oh and then found out that it wasn't streaming anywhere. It's only in theaters. Oh
 Yeah, you thought you're gonna watch it at home. I sat down last night to watch it and went to pull it up
 It was like oh, it's not streaming here. Oh, it must be on a different service
 I thought I was gonna have to pay for it. I thought it was I thought it was new
 Yeah, but no, that's why I have not seen it that puppy meets theaters my friend
 but I see that that thing needs to blossom slowly in the
 Seeds of the tens of 12s of people that are going into theater after theater to see it sit a magic
 I did watch an extended trailer of it last night and I and I listened to
 Nebraska and the count Basie theater. I'll tell you that that the
 The extended trailer is probably as good as the movie
 Did genuinely make me want to watch the movie. So I think you might be right. Yeah
 When we saw the movie Paul was a Paul was respectful
 We got in the car and he's like are we waiting to get on air to talk about this and I said
 No, we can talk about the car. We just rehashed it on. Yeah. Yeah
 And he goes wait, you're the springsteen fan. So I'll let you talk first
 You should start Paul said and with this conversation I defer I defer. Yes. I yield the floor
 To the gentleman from New Jersey. So first of all to have this conversation
 I'm gonna need you to set the tone first of all spoilers
 Let's just yes set that out here now spoilers for deliver me from nowhere
 Which I can't believe that fucking subtitle. It is meaningless
 Meaningless
 It's a lyric reference, but besides that it is meaningless. Yes
 Here's the thing that really sums up this movie for me
 I'm watching the film and I'm getting you know as emotionally invested as one can when watching the boss
 Deal with the stuff
 He's got this long time relationship
 multiple-year relationship happening on screen
 With this woman and her child and he's very much been become like a father figure to this kid here and there and you know
 All this kind of thing and also just might be to say that that actor Odessa
 last name is
 She's Australian
 She kills it. She steals the movie as far as I'm concerned. Yeah, she was great and I was like, okay Matt
 So who was this lady? Uh, why didn't they stay together? What what's what's the what's the fallout from that? Oh, that says
 She's a composite character of multiple ways
 And I'm like fuck this movie forever then yeah
 Because he doesn't even come off that nice to a composite of his
 Went out of its way to fictionalize Springsteen leading on a woman with a child and ditching her that's
 It is the oddest shit the choices they make
 Just like if I'm gonna submit my legacy. It's a superstar. I should put out a movie where I'm absolutely
 atrocious
 Yeah, the most sympathetic people in the world a single mother a single working mother in a diner
 Like somebody said somebody in a writing room somewhere said like no
 No, we have to we have to do that like he was convinced to keep that bit in the movie. I'm sure
 I don't know man. It's so weird movie
 Right if you just watch just old-school movie making
 Right, right. You are supposed to ride the dip of that and then that person is supposed to evolve and come back to being a better person
 and
 There are scenes that set it up
 Informatically, so where they follow all the rules of film writing right up to that that that cliff
 Where the house supposed to turn around and do make the better choice?
 It's like nope. Anyways, he went on to go do some concerts. Yeah, it's the craziest thing. He
 Mother and child who knows who knows he meets up with her at a diner where she's been working
 Has this big heartfelt conversation?
 Was she the best he had ever had not even close. She cries and
 Says she does a heartfelt speech like just pierces right through all of his bullshit
 Like I hope you find what you're looking for and he's gone. That's it
 He never even talks to her again the rest of the movie. She never shows up again
 He leaves her he leaves her crying next to a dishwashing machine. That's it. It's over. That's the last thing
 She's in there's a scene later
 Into the movie is that scene like 90 there's like 20 minutes left. Yeah. Yeah. Oh shit. Yeah, it's almost over
 It's a build-up to this moment and this moment is where that speech should make him break down and make the right choice
 Right and it's that it's like but that's not what happened in real life. So goodbye and then
 Sure, let me composited this together even has this epic road trip, which is which is hysterically
 Factual and that Springsteen never drove. So someone had a drive to the California
 Springsteen and Copperfield are two two huge celebrities who just never really drove and
 Like muddling in the diner with his food in the middle of like, you know El Paso or something and he's going like she's right
 She's right
 As though she had never spoken he doesn't even move on it's he is absolutely just feather on the wind
 He does not do anything. He directs little anything in this film
 Aside from recording an album in his bedroom
 That's the only thing that he really does and then that same that same moment of him being out in this
 Road trip the guy after he's seen him get all upset with his food
 gets on the horn to the manager and
 Comically, it's the spring scene is like five feet away. He's like, I don't know
 He's gone off the deep end
 It's the dumbest thing you've ever seen
 It's like they want to talk about all the the the darkness in his soul, but it never really it's just I mean
 They they delve into his childhood abuse
 okay, but
 it's just it's just
 Abuse in a way that is like if we if you and I went to film school and we're like, how do we want to?
 Want to show you boost? Let's cut to black and white and do the most like standard bad dad
 Scenes you've ever seen in your land the bad dad
 His bad dad is a character actor who's been in a lot of stuff and most notably he plays
 Italian gangsters and he played Capone in I want to say Boardwalk Empire
 Capone and also in adolescence. He's the tough dad in
 Adolescents, though is they hit the big hit on Netflix that for okay. So very pigeon-holed like you see him
 And you're already like, oh
 His father was Al Capone. Okay bad guy bad guy. Yeah, and
 Yeah, it's weird. It's weird. He has a breakdown at an amusement park. It's
 Like even Graham is that actor's name? Yes, he's great
 Steven Graham, he was really good
 Look, you know like he put out he put up this big autobiography and there's a big deal
 He does one person show on Broadway and where he was more candid than he'd ever been about his childhood
 and his you know, he was he is the child of an abusive father and
 And you know as a rock star, you know that obviously has a different, you know, weird weird way of sitting with people
 but uh, you know, I
 Said to Paul I said basically if you took
 Like this moment, right?
 This is a moment basically like spacing this finally which with the movie's get into but he's passed his lawsuits
 He can finally put out music again
 He can finally tour again puts up the river the rivers huge and they're begging him to like come back with another killer album
 And he instead takes this artistic right turn puts up the Nebraska album and all that stuff is true
 It's crazy. And so like that is a weird turn and like and I said to Paul like any time
 Springsteen fans talk to non-Springsteen fans and they say he's just a cheesy rocker most the first words out of most Springsteen fans
 His mouth is something about Nebraska like that album is this totally different turn
 With with beautiful storytelling and songwriting in it that's not pop right and and so
 You know to tell that story as a moment of triumph, you know
 Artistically is maybe fascinating and kind of like basically then you pit yourself against the record people and the pressures and all the people
 Wanted to be super famous that feels like more of like a typical story and then he's battling depression during this time
 That feels like that would be like an underlying kind of B story, right? And instead this movie makes the
 artistic choice to put up the Nebraska album against all the pressures of fame as this kind of
 Dragging B story while we watch this very in depth arc of depression in the Jersey Shore
 We're the only solution is to run away and move to California forever and like she and like that's not a movie anybody wants
 To see about anyone
 Right. Yeah, so that's that's that's my sum up of it. They flipped the a in the B stories in a way that was so strange
 It's just it's it's a weird movie. It's not a bad movie
 No, but it's not a good movie. No, it's a problem
 Another thing we said in the car was was like it's as if like a bunch of actors got together and we're like
 I want to make a movie where all of us get scenes where we get to act our faces. Oh man
 It is acting happening in those fucking mo. Oh my god. Yeah, there's some people just really acting hard hard acting
 No, no feel bad for the you know, the bear Jeremy Allen white or whatever like, you know
 You know your your basic book on screenwriting is in the scene a character should feel different
 Than it does in the beginning of a scene, right?
 So it starts off feeling one way and by the end of the scene it feels another because that's how we're watching
 That interaction that's that's we're watching
 Situations where people can possibly change right? That's what makes compelling voyeuristic
 Scenic acting movie making work and there are so many scenes where
 Bruce is the same exact mood at the start of the scene at the end of nothing changes nothing changes in the scene
 So nothing affects him
 No
 But I did just find out that um
 Matt did you know that that nebraska and in cold blood were about the same events? Yes
 I think I think am I the only one who didn't know that I think that common knowledge as a matter of fact
 I believe if you listen back to our halloween episode jacob just the last episode when truman capote stopped by
 I did indeed ask him about that. He did
 It's the start. It's the starkweather murders. Yeah, it's clearly
 It's clear that I wasn't listening at that moment of the last show. Yeah, you're juggling you're juggling characters stopping by the doorbell
 I get it. I'm just letting you know that
 Karen and georgia evidence. I just found that out this week
 I didn't I didn't know that karen and georgia on my favorite murder just recently covered the starkweather shit
 It's awful
 And oh, yes for a lot, but for a long time it was framed as this sort of bonnie and clyde type situation
 Yeah, oh right. Sure more and more we're learning. This was a 13 year old girl who watched her parents murdered in front of her
 It's not like she really had a choice but to go with the psychopath
 Oh, no, no, it's it's horrible. It's dark. It's dark shit
 But but I mean it turns out that story of murder is a bad story. Well, but but
 but the fact that we
 Lumped a poor little girl in on it
 This country's just fucking dumb
 Of all the things that make this country down it wasn't
 It wasn't the starkville murders the starkweather murders that they didn't just blame him a 13 year old dragged along for some murders
 I think we have indeed figured it out
 I think we've righted that wrong ball. I think that's maybe maybe I guess I don't know
 Paul paul paul. I got you the country is in trouble and those murders were horrible. Yes, those are both true
 They might not be related. I don't know
 I don't know. I don't know. It feels like in a lot of ways. It feels like it's just misogyny all the way down
 That's what it really feels like. No, I went to um, I told you guys a couple of months ago. I went down to
 Prim to to look at some of the casinos down there
 So we can just kind of walk through some of the casinos down there before they shut down right and one of the casinos down there
 Has uh the bonnie and clied car. Yeah, where where they were where they were shot to death
 And you know, it's got all the bullet holes and everything and it's a tourist attraction
 And I I just stood there and looked at this thing and I was like this
 this car
 was uh
 two people's uh death site
 Uh, the evidence of them of them dying is still here
 And uh, they they killed people and they robbed people and they hurt people and they did all these things
 This is not uh, this is not a nice story
 And I and I just kind of stood there being disgusted that this car was on display for people to come over and look at
 That's me with the mom museum. People love going to my museum
 There's a little like a little little uh, like a mini dock that runs throughout the whole time
 And there's one where this mafia guy is is talking about being a consultant on a deniro movie
 And they're reenacting the murder and he's describing like how the murder went down and they're like, oh, they're like, oh man
 This guy the way he's describing it's like he actually was there and it's like, oh, isn't that awesome? No
 Yeah, it's fucking yeah. He was actually there. He was there and he committed fucking brutal murder. I don't know why
 That's uh, that's uh, I don't know why that's a taint tickler for you. Oh because matt it's the uh, it's the fedora
 If you're wearing a fedora costa nostra
 That's right. That's right
 Oh, and he's not black. It's those it's those two things put together
 Oh, man
 Speaking of vegas icons
 uh
 sarah has to ross was uh filming a music video
 And downtown. Yeah. Yeah, and I was asked if I would play
 Uh, not elvis. This is key
 But uh a fremont street elvis impersonator. That's that's the key there. Oh, yeah, that is yeah
 There's a degree in casting there
 Um, and if you need an elvis matt donnelly is not your guy if you need somebody on fremont street impersonating elvis matt donnelly
 so I uh
 my wife
 Mistakenly thought I still had this elvis outfit that I used to have
 um, but it eventually just
 Like weathered away and became you know
 Uh, well she wore it out. Honestly if we if we're just telling the truth like she just she just fucked the shit out
 Oh, i'm gonna call i'm gonna screen it but um, my friend jeff calls it's nevada day, uh here that's right and um
 My friend jeff knows all the words to the nevada day song nevada the nevada anthem
 And he calls every single friend who still lives in nevada every nevada day and sings the entire song into their voicemail
 Uh, and so I have that that's what's happening right now. It's my favorite thing
 One of the more fun things about nevada is that became a state on halloween. Yeah
 Um, anyhow, so, uh, so I went down to star costume and and I was like this is actually it's nothing to do with halloween
 I need I need an elvis costume
 And so I look
 and
 uh
 In in my sizes, they had this really nice red one. It's really nice red one. Okay
 Uh, that looked really sharp. It was a little pricey but
 I've been asked to dress up like elvis on multiple occasions and I don't know if it will stop
 Figured you're going to get another run out of this. Oh, this was a purchase not a not a rental, right?
 This is a purchase because also
 When I did virgin voyages and hopefully that went well enough that they'll invite me back
 They do a thing called scarlet night where everyone dresses in red
 And I was like, wait a minute if I go with the red one I can wear this
 Yep
 On the virgin voyages representing vegas. That'll look good. Yeah. Yeah, um, and so, uh, yeah bought myself a nice elvis outfit
 and then uh went down to
 Fremont and I was like, hey you guys are just shooting on the street, right?
 She's like, yeah, like so there's no like dressing area. She's like, no, it's like so basically I should arrive as elvis
 And they're like, yeah, okay
 so
 Me which coincidentally is the same note that every person who hires matt to do any gig tells it
 I knew to ask I knew yeah
 It's so common my my my tier my tier of of of acting is so familiar that I know be like no dressing rooms, right?
 no makeup
 Matt is an aae actor is what they call him. He arrives as elvis
 I
 Was just walking up and down fremont street dressed at the toe as elvis and did anyone look at you twice?
 No people were loving it
 People were loving it and so then I did this bit with sarah that when the music video comes out
 I think it's gonna look great. So I won't spoil it, but it was super fun
 and um
 As i'm walking back to my car a guy literally goes like hey
 Are you?
 Are you like doing stuff here? And I was like, no, no, uh, sorry
 I'm just I just actually just got a music video and i'm just walking back to my car
 He was oh, okay
 Um, can I take a photo of you anyway?
 Sure
 and he's like
 He like gets down like gets a good angle or whatever. Yeah, he's like
 Can't sorry. I mean, can I do is like a self a selfie is okay. Is the selfie okay?
 And I was like, yeah, let's let's do it man
 We took a nice selfie whatever and he was like, I gotta give you some money
 And I literally go like no, no, no, no, no, i'm on my way to the car. I can't
 This is you you betta say
 You've met a wonderful person I was like
 Did you take some money? I hope you took some fucking money
 This is the thing I I told the story to sarah and she goes how much you make I said I I said no
 No, i'm okay. I want to just want to get home to my kids, you know
 and uh, uh
 Sarah was like you you're a fool. Yeah
 And I was like, I know i'm dumb every person I talked to has been like
 What was going to give you it? I was like, I don't know. I don't who knows you probably get 100 bucks
 I doubt it, but you never know man. People are crazy out there. No jordan campbell says this is how matt started on his only fans
 um jordan this did feel uh
 It did feel like a moment of like I I often kind of rack my brain if I could like make extra money or whatever
 And so the idea of like oh if I could just go down a free street just like that might be
 It felt like too easy like that's it was like I literally was like trying to not do it
 And then someone stopped and like made sure they offered me money and I was getting a lot of attention
 You know, I was walking with purpose to like not get stopped
 But I was causing a lot of attention walking up and down
 Uh fremont street dressed ahead to tow his elbows. Yeah, so real talk
 I think you might be able to make some money doing this especially in like the earlier hours on fremont street
 Not like 2 a.m. But like the 10 p.m. Yeah, yeah, no, I'm thinking like 9 or 10
 I'm thinking like early early nighttime
 And uh, but when the families are still out
 Yeah
 Because the people the people taking pictures with people on fremont street
 If you don't want someone to be naked in your photograph, you're out of luck
 Yeah, like you're just you're just out of luck yeah, or if you don't want like palm
 Crucifixes palm crucifixes are naked people like your two options crucifixes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So last time I was down there though
 I did stop and watch a a street magician
 How was it performed for a few minutes? He was really good. He was really good. Well, that's good news
 It's after some money in his bucket. He was great. It's hard
 Because there's there's music playing at all kinds of volumes the entire time. Sometimes it's super loud. Sometimes it's just loud
 This guy was a genius. I thought about that while I was watching him. He did it most of it. He did silently, right?
 That's that's what it would take. Yeah
 I saw a guy doing that that kind of like uh, they're all silver and money moves them kind of oh, yeah
 Yeah with a magic trick kind of attached to that and I was like, yeah, that's what we can do down there. But uh, yeah
 Yeah. Yeah
 Um, so yeah, I don't know it may or may not be my point. I think you should start doing this
 Just even just just a second time just to see what it's like to actually give it a shot
 Really? I think I also want you to go down there without getting a a spot reserve for yourself
 And I want to see if you get some shit for not having a reserved spot
 You probably will if you that's the thing if you do it with the intention of getting paid you won't get paid
 It's the people talk about it all the time
 Like when when when folks hit the skids and they're out on the street begging for money
 like the first day they feel like oh
 We're gonna be all right here
 And then after that
 It's this weird beginner's luck thing and it just gets really really hard fast. Yeah, you're right
 Yeah, that is a lot of stories. That is a lot of people's stories. You're right. I think it's all attitude
 I think it's all the attitude
 I think I think people can I don't even know how to say it because I don't know what it is
 But but I I think that people can uh,
 sense that
 What the one thing as soon as you are be holy energy as soon as you're actually desperate
 That's that rippy holy energy
 I'll tell you who else has got that rippy holy energy and that's the following sponsor

 Uh, no, you should just get you know, the regular cheeseburger the plain one
 oh
 Okay, enter hey scoops check
 Really stumped him on that last one there paul chamberlain. He just left the room
 It was an unintentional wallachian impression. I did. Well, I guess wallachian is just a squirrel
 I did sound remarkably like wallachian
 I've never seen wallachian and a squirrel in a room together. So I I can't uh, I can't say for sure that he's not a squirrel
 There you go. I was trying to surprise you. It did play to my recorder
 So jacob has already played to my recorder, but I was playing the home is nevada day theme is if I get them both my mics here
 Holy shit
 Is
 Every word every word you get the idea you get the you get the amazing amazing who's that singing jeff my friend jeff
 Well done jeff. Yeah
 Got some pipes on him. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah
 Um
 I uh, oh
 Go ahead jacob
 Oh, I was just going to tag on to the end of fremont street. Uh, I did see a uh
 While I was down there the other day. I did see a uh a parent who was watching a performance
 uh whose child I would guess uh,
 Six or seven was just sitting on the on the ground at fremont street
 While the parent was watching something kind of over there, you know a couple of feet away
 It's the first time i've ever wanted to call cps on anymore. Wait now
 Oh the parent was letting your small child just sit on the on the on the street on fremont street
 That's that's already disgusting. Yeah, it's pretty gross
 Yeah, I was I was not okay. What uh captured their attention so much. Was it one of the giant gorillas?
 No, it was just one of the bands. It was just it was just music going
 And the band was great. But did you see any of the giant gorillas while you were down there, man?
 No, they didn't see any giant gorillas. There really really wasn't actually a lot going on. I know
 I haven't been down there in months without seeing at least three or four giant gorillas
 I wasn't I was surprised at how little I mean we were there
 It was a you know, it was I was there from around uh, like 330 to five
 Maybe of like 5 30
 um
 I was surprised how little was going on. Like I said, there's a lot of uh,
 A lot of unhoused people just sitting in the spots that were designated for performers. Uh, just begging and then
 Some some some some some crucifixes and then the one guy painted in silver
 Doing his bit
 Oh, this was also maybe a tuesday
 Maybe don't wake up till later
 That's probably that's I mean, that's very possibly true. Yeah, also
 Uh, I also went to disco the other night
 Uh, oh nice and drove down
 And not since I moved here in 2008 where I stick those back roads through paradise and coval to get down to the venetian
 Uh, boy, uh, no one just absolutely no cars just driving around absolutely nothing
 I was like i've never seen the streets so empty. That's nice and then I pulled right into the link and uh,
 Got in the very first row of self-parking just a space wide open for me at seven o'clock at night
 um
 I was like, uh, the rumors are true. Vegas is dead
 Or everybody is avoiding matt
 No, I don't think that's it
 I could not believe how little uh,
 There was anyone around in las vegas. That's so like I drive down those streets all the time
 And they are packed all the time
 Yeah, yeah, I used to have to go down there all the time and it's packed all the time
 I had to go down there to get to fucking uh, the flamingo
 Which has gotten even harder to get to now, which is crazy
 I should note that they did start building the f1 track. So it could just be a lot of people just avoiding
 Uh, that's true
 Uh, but that that might be it that could be it but also yeah
 There was I mean I walked up and down the link. I was very surprised that that just kind of that's kind of crazy, man
 Yeah, yeah, that's kind of crazy. It was weird. It's anecdotal, but it's weird. Sure still
 Still i'm gonna go see disco tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it. I haven't seen it since uh since the revamp
 Oh, I think yes, I think you'll dig it a lot. I'm looking forward to it. I'll tell you though
 He recently added
 uh, our friends, uh d and uh, uh, uh, uh, uh grace
 Created, uh these clown characters, uh to perform around the venues that are around disco not in the venue itself
 Um, but two other people were doing their bit
 Uh where they're just oh, yeah, two giant disco balls wearing capes and disco mustaches
 and
 They were killing it. I I didn't know I literally didn't know who these people were which is weird. I'm surprised. Oh good
 There's two people that were just being uh that I need to find out who they were
 um
 But they were being hysterical so people came out of I always get nervous when people create bits like uh, like d and grace did
 And then uh kind of hand them off, right?
 The handoff always makes me nervous. So i'm glad to hear that it's going really well. Yes
 And so uh, they were just doing a thousand bits and that people nice falling over laughing and I was like, this is great
 That sounds oh i'm really looking forward to it. This is gonna be great. Yeah, it's a fun show. I really like that show
 Um, it's it's so different and uh, but it's really cool now. It's super it's super streamlined
 And it just cooks and our friend. Eli is the uh host
 um
 And uh, he's just so funny. He's just just so funny like a full person
 Yeah, well, that's one reason i'm going tomorrow is uh, our another friend of ours nick is in for eli
 I've seen nick do it. Nick's great at it. Nick is great at that. Yeah. Yeah
 Yeah, nick from uh, banana fame at scoop fest. Yes, we'll be in disco tomorrow. I drank his milkshake
 You did you drink it up?
 I left a little on the floor for for jonas's wheel, but a little surprise for jonas later
 Surprise
 But the answer is yes, i'll be dressing up like elvis tonight for my trick and treat i'll be elvis in my neighborhood
 And yes, I was just about to ask you
 How long are you because I know what time your trick and treat is starting today
 I saw your wife last night and she said that you guys are starting at 3 pm today
 How late are you planning on going?
 We usually go to like nine or ten. Usually the streets get pretty empty at nine
 Okay
 And then I just you just run in a front yard party until until until the streets get rolled up
 We have a set time here. It's it's six to eight
 Yeah, yeah, that's something the high mark but people come early some people have little kids they go early
 While it's still light out and then also just you know teenagers and all those other kids that go late and for me for the trick
 And treating I like the teenagers. Yeah
 Uh, oh, yeah. Yeah
 For for for magic trick purposes not for sure. Yeah. Yeah
 Yeah, it's it's better to deal with I don't know why matt thinks I mean something else
 I'm talking about his magic trick. These teenagers love his magic trick. You want an audience and we disappear
 You want an audience that has grasped the concept of object permanence? That's right
 Before you uh perform magic. That's correct
 That's why matt's baby magic didn't go well
 Yeah, and my my my uh, my big ringer when should I fix the clown in time for it to be a jump scare?
 That'd be great. And then uh, uh, I got a duck
 A wooden duck that uh, whoa pecks at cards and and snatches your card out of a deck of cards
 Oh, that's pretty good. Whoa
 Is it like one of the one of the happy bird things? Yes. Well, no, no, no nice
 It's like it's like a wooden it's like an ornate wooden. There's something you'd see it like a kitschy
 Like uh, like a cracker barrel lawn decoration, right?
 But it has it has a uh, uh
 Mechanical neck so you push the duck you push the duck's head down and it just and it just opens its beak and snatches a card
 Out of out of a deck of cards. Oh, I wish my wife had that
 What it's a what it's an old it's an old it's an old old magic prop. I just bought one. Oh, it is. Okay
 Yeah, it's a known thing that the duck. Yeah, the duck card picker dippy duck. I think it's called
 Yeah, yeah hippy duck dip dippy duck dippy duck dippy duck. That makes sense
 Hippie dippy duck is a whole different thing
 But yeah, you guys want to do a little scoop mail, yes, please let's go let's do a little scoop mail
 Message for you, sir
 From winter scoop. This is something i've been wanting to talk about for a week now
 The jewelry heist at the louvre has my brain screaming
 The guys use the construction ladder to access a balcony to bypass the front doors
 They were work vests and helmets and stole the jewelry after the place opened up
 Guests watched them do it and nobody said anything
 They just assumed that they were guys there working doing their job the balls on those guys
 That's from winter scoop winter scoop. I'm genuinely concerned that the robbers of the louvre are scoops
 I have been advocating bring a ladder for years that you can get in anywhere
 These people just took that to the nth degree
 So I heard also apparently that that kind of apparatus that long ladder
 Hooked to a little scooter cart kind of deal
 Is a lot more commonplace out in france because the buildings are so old that they don't have proper
 Places for you to unload cargo in a lot of these places. Sure. Sure
 So it's not like in the states if you saw somebody with a ladder up to a window you go
 Wait a minute
 maybe
 But I can tell you how you i'll tell you i'll tell you you need uh,
 One thing to make it where people don't give you that look in the states when you're when you're doing that and that is
 An orange road cone next to the ladder. Yeah, you're right
 I mean the if you put a single orange road cone next to the ladder you're done
 The safety vest thing really does a lot does a lot of work. Yep, and if you got a radio
 Like you can just flush this whole thing out
 I think this could happen all the time
 I'm really surprised this doesn't happen more often
 Like you just fit in you just fit in and go do whatever you want
 Um, let's see we got one
 I I know people that in magician's world who are thinking that uh, it's uh, it's a it's secretly a ploy to advertise
 Now you see me the new now you see me movie coming up
 Oh, it could be
 That's an elaborate uh elaborate setup, but well, uh
 Was was gabriella one of the uh, louvre robbers. She might have been she might have jesse isenberg is
 Donating a kidney as part of his promotional work, I guess
 What?
 Yeah, yeah, jesse isenberg is donating kidney to a stranger
 And the bit is they stole his kidney no, he's just big into what is it with these magicians and donating blood matt what's going on?
 Does playing with cards enough make you just say that oh I've got way too much blood in me
 Um, i'm blanking on her name. She made a documentary about this. Uh, basically like how it's been it's difficult
 uh, it's
 Some very healthy people have two functioning kidneys and if you are of very good health you don't need them both so to speak
 right, and there are a lot of people who need kidneys and um
 Just did the one on the satanic temple. Um, why am I blanking on her name? Oh, you don't want penny lane penny lane penny lane
 Uh did a doc on this, uh, she found it very difficult to try to donate your kidney to a stranger
 She I remember her doing this doc. I never got to see it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
 She did a doc about about uh, like rant not even uh random donations, but like random anonymous donations of of organs, right?
 Yes
 So basically like a lot of times you can put out calls if you need a kidney
 Then then your friends and neighbors or friends or friends you put on campaigns to do it and that's how most kidney donation works
 Uh, but when it comes to just saying like hey, uh, I have an extra kidney find someone who needs it for me
 That that operation wasn't streamlined but that has improved over the years
 and so now uh people who just kind of are
 You know if you're generally, you know
 Like I said, you don't drink you don't really do do it in crazy shit and you can just be a healthy person
 Um, you can go go without go without one of those kidneys. Yeah. No one has ever asked me for one of my kidneys
 I don't know. I don't know why it's never come up. Yeah, one of your marinated kidneys
 Oh ten scoop in the chat mentions. Uh, it's even harder to donate if you bring it in a cooler
 I've been sitting on this thing for a week. Come on. It's a couple of youtube tutorials and now here's my kidney
 You made me fill my bathtub up with ice for nothing
 Cost me like 23 to get all that ice
 We got one from pigasus. Hey matt paul and jacob. Thank you guys and especially all the safety cones helper scoops and performers
 For putting together another incredible scoop fest. It was amazing seeing so many weird and wonderful scoops
 There is a great mix of new and old slash older scoops to hang out with and go on adventures with
 It's incredible how you cannot see a scoop for 18 months and pick right back up where you left off from the last scoop fest
 Podcast trivia battles and variety shows, especially hollywood squares were some of the very best ever
 Although i'm going to try to avoid being conned into sitting in the front from now on quick scoop fest
 It basically proves that i'm a potato
 Sunday night after scoop fest. I was in an elevator at the orleans when two very friendly and drunk women hopped on
 They noticed my hot dog necklace right away said how much they liked it and we chatted a bit between floors
 They were on vacation and clearly having a great time while I stood there being well me
 When I got off the elevator, I overheard one of them say to the other it's okay. I guess he doesn't want to party
 It wasn't until much later at mcmullin's that I realized what was actually happening in that elevator
 I just thought they were being polite. I'm already looking forward to the next one
 It was great meeting so many new scoops and reconnecting with returning scoop
 Thanks again for all the hard work you do to make scoop message a unique and fun gathering pigasus will fly again
 Fucking you in the face. That's roger aka the nest scream or nest creamer aka pigasus. All right
 Thanks rogers sounds like you saved yourself about six to eight hundred bucks, buddy. Good job. That's right
 It's really true. It's probably like you almost you probably were almost about to get rolled
 You never know in vegas and you know, I think orleans. It was 350. I thought well hell I think I think
 I know for myself just come on
 You just kind of default to the no way. This is not happening. This is some candy camera bullshit
 I have had multiple friends think that they were doing very well with women
 Uh than to realize on their own that they were talking to prostitutes
 That's happened to multiple friends of mine and they're sad every time it happens
 They still pay for the the sex and everything they still do that, but you know, they are
 It's a blow to their ego first
 First it's a blow to their ego then it's a blow to their you know, you get it. Good deal. Good deal fair
 Uh, let's see. Oh, there's another scoop or another uh, uh
 What is the thing we do scoop fest now we don't need to do the scoop best email right now from bear scoop
 Hey matt paul and jacob in the same vein as the he did what and other tales
 I decided to write in with my story of it's actually what?
 A time well one of many when my sheer stupidity revealed itself in true glory
 For context I live in a somewhat big city not far from vancouver bc
 And for years no decades my commute to and from work
 I would routinely see a box truck think a u-haul like a three or four ton with words
 diamond delivery plastered on the side and back
 Which of course, uh with of course a picture of a huge diamond in the middle
 Now, I don't know if I was just in the monotony of my commute every time I saw these trucks
 But I always assumed that I made up a story that of course these trucks needed to be this big
 They were delivering diamonds throughout my one to two million population bustling metropolis
 And the safe the safes used to do this probably take up most of the back of these trucks
 That was until my early to mid 30s when I saw one of these trucks parked in my townhouse complex outside of another unit
 I found this odd as why would a residential customer be having diamonds be shipped to them?
 Oh dear god as I see them taking plants furniture and other crap out of the back of the truck
 Diamond delivery is a delivery company not a diamond delivery company
 So anyway, that's my it's actually what story fucking with the face that's a bear scoop
 Thank you bear scoop, yeah, I uh
 For a little while when I was a kid, we used to have uh, swans
 Did you guys have swans?
 meal delivery
 Uh, yeah. Yeah, the like the refrigerated trucks and everything. I I thought it was delivering swans
 I thought these people are getting are getting geese
 Swans delivery service, yeah
 Yeah
 People used to eat swans, right? That's a thing
 I guess you could eat a swan. Why not?
 I mean you did anything with the right attitude
 We got one from slurping car. Hey motherfucker greetings face fuckers
 I'm writing in response to a conversation or a discussion at scoop fest about bits
 And how this community attracts people with a fervent love and commitment to silly bits. Yes
 It's it's one of the best things about our community
 One of my favorite things this year was being privy to scoops sharing their personal bits with each other giggity
 So that we could all go home with fresh road tested material that our spouses and loved ones would still not appreciate
 This jogged my my memory of a genius bit
 My high school friend nicole invented that I think some scoops will find useful in their everyday life
 Here is what she would do
 In the middle of class nicole would tilt her head up crinkle her nose and say
 Did someone just microwave popcorn?
 Then seconds later everyone sitting around her would start dry heaving and coughing uncontrollably with laughter
 While some managed to choke out a faint fuck you
 Let me explain
 This is a bit nicole and her older sister perfected in a prank war as kids
 When one of them had a rancid silent, but deadly fart and they wanted to trick the other into smelling it
 Through many iterations they found the foulest trick was priming each other
 For microwave popcorn scent as it lowered the victim's defenses and when one's olfactory is expecting a sweet
 Buttery scent of microwave popcorn the juxtaposition of the actual scent of a putrid ass gas kicks in bad
 There is also a delay
 So the victim will have taken a full-throated drag and had their lungs filled with the flatuous before their senses could
 Smell the the rock had actually been cooking
 That's not a result that's a prank
 this is
 It's a war crime. It's a hell of a move. I hate I hate what i'm listening. That's a hell of a move
 I don't this is actually this is worse than what the u.s is doing out in the pacific. Oh lord
 Bong rip levels of coughing and retching from my classmates nicole gave and still gives
 Zero fucks as she did this popcorn bit every goddamn time
 She farts and it was truly one of the funniest things to watch once you're in on the gag
 However, she did it to me so fucking bad with this the first time she did it
 Uh to me what i was 10 years ago that till this day. I went when I walked through an amc movie theater
 Feel free to use this bit at your own risk ps. I'm curious
 What other bits scoops might have to share uh, and if they could be uh, so good to share them in a fucking scoop mail format
 Figgity fucking your olfactory glands. That's slurpy ka-ay motherfucker
 That's really funny that that's commitment. I mean that is that is commitment for sure
 That is like geneva wants to have words with you
 That's that's just cruel. I mean to do that once is genius to really commit and do it all the time. That's crazy
 Yeah, it's pretty wild
 Uh, how are you guys on fart humor?
 Well, i'm very happy with fart humor when it is the uh, the sound of the fart
 And and the funny like oh this was this was a fart thing. Yeah. Yeah, this is great
 As soon as I smell something just rank
 I stopped thinking it's funny so quickly there is there is a my favorite murder animated
 A letter that somebody wrote into them
 About this guy. He was working at a post office
 And he let a fart that was so stank
 That the post office had to be shut down
 And the fucking bomb squad got called because they thought it was some kind of chemical contaminant coming in through the mail
 It is wild
 Wild
 Yeah, I never was like all that stuff of the farting is it feels like in the in the in the vein of like, uh,
 Like bag tagging or like drawing on the face of someone who falls asleep all that all that kind of stuff
 Puts me in a weird place. I don't like it. I'm with you jacob
 I think the noise is where the funny is the machines that make the sounds and all that are great
 But like didn't they just have a teacher get arrested for putting fart gas on his students all the time
 What?
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 There's a story about uh
 To the internet jacob
 When I typed in teacher arrested the autofill was for fart spray. Okay, this was it so share with it
 I don't know the exact what what happened, but uh, let's see when it comes to the smell stuff. That's when it starts to get
 criminal
 A 32 year old assistant teacher in west florence high school in south carolina was arrested for spraying a foul smelling substance
 Through the school's ventilation system his actions which occurred nearly over nearly a month long period
 Led to six students and over
 55,000 and damages to the school's air conditioning system lewis faced the charge of disturbing schools and malicious intent
 malicious injury to property
 Uh
 I question the quality of that ac system if fart spray
 If fart spray takes it out
 Yeah, that's not hepa approved. That's for sure
 This was and then have you seen the the the cruel thing that the people do for the people who are in the inflated costumes?
 Yes, because you got a little you got the vent there you fart into the fart at the vent
 Or you put some stinky at the vent and they're just stuck inside
 Can you imagine just farting on somebody's vent and they're just like
 I've seen people take like like fish bait and just throw it up against the fan
 My favorite example of that comes from the harlan williams
 rocket man movie
 Where he does it he he's connected via a tube to another astronaut
 He cuts apart and there's this whole back and forth where they're stuck in there with the fart. Oh

 I asked when it was built. Yeah, it was built before that
 But it's like the 90s or right out it was not built in the 90s
 It got built in like
 In like the 50s, right
 After the war right
 Oh boy, uh, it's gonna be close
 Close close close, uh, I guess i'm gonna say it's closer to the building of the wall
