00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,840
 yes but Annie is Annie is moving on from us our dear friend Annie is moving on

23
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,960
 with us promise she has been with us since the beginning of patreon at the

24
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,480
 very least yeah launch our patreon and then immediately expressed how

25
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,840
 overwhelmed we are by our own creation yep yep and she emailed us and said I

26
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,480
 will help organize this for you and then continue to do so for I guess I don't

27
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,040
 even know how long I mean I have I mean it's really over 10 years I mean we

28
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,400
 probably did patreon on our own for like a month before she swooped in and was

29
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,520
 like yeah here let me just let me just take care of you sweet sweet children

30
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,840
 lost in the woods and it's very important to note you know and I think I

31
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,600
 really think is just Annie being respectful like I think she's just a

32
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:58,080
 first-class person start to finish it's simply that like when we started we had

33
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,000
 like seven tears we had a bunch of bonus rewards for people who were on for more

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,760
 than three months right we had all kinds of different deliverables that we were

35
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,000
 thought you know that we could do if we had all the time in the world and then

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,240
 quickly realized that we don't have all the time in the world but Annie kept all

37
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:23,880
 of these things organized for us all the time and more importantly fielded emails

38
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:30,680
 from patrons yes I ordered what is happening I ordered all you can eat video

39
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:42,300
 whatever hands-free eating video and so long ago when we were first figuring out

40
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,480
 what our patreon was going to look like this is great we're just gonna go down

41
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,920
 memory lane now that we're talking about any when we first figured out what our

42
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,200
 patreon was gonna look like we just threw so many ideas at the wall and I

43
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,520
 think Paul I think Paul said the hands-free eating yeah yes I'm sure I

44
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:04,080
 did and Matt and I just went both of us like Paul explained to us what he was

45
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,160
 thinking he said well we'll make a video where we go to a restaurant we will

46
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,960
 order food and then we'll eat that food without using our hands and and Matt and

47
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:19,400
 I just said like oh yeah yeah that is something we should do yeah no problem

48
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,440
 and no thought about it no issue just right on there because our early patron

49
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,400
 was like hey let's pay for our gas and a meal once in a while that was our goal

50
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:39,560
 for the patreon and so yeah no I mean it was ridiculous and you know all the

51
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,920
 things we've learned we've talked to other people who started patreon or

52
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,400
 sort of podcast you know it's interesting and then now we've really

53
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,480
 simplified things here on our patreon more than ever most because we kind of

54
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,680
 discovered that we're such a community that like watching us do stuff or

55
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,300
 making us do stuff it seems to be less interesting to our listeners than

56
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,240
 making sure that we all hang out or create social opportunities for each

57
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,520
 other like all you have to do to get us to do a hands-free eating video now is

58
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:16,560
 convince us that it's gonna be funny and we'll probably just do it if we can if

59
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:23,040
 you want a video for me you sent me the money to buy food you're getting the money

60
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,720
 to buy an Aldi hot dog oh no no no no it's gotta be more money than an Aldi

61
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:39,440
 hot dog I need a skateboard and a stick a set of jumper cables to create a ramp

62
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:45,600
 of food that can go down towards my mouth oh a new competitor entering the

63
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:53,960
 arena between team slide and team swing skateboarding skateboard with a skateboard

64
00:05:53,960 --> 00:06:01,760
 catapult yeah or the west was to your oh somebody else if we hit a goal we

65
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,320
 actually came close this month to hitting a bonus goal for the first time

66
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:10,080
 in a long time we felt everyone just short which would be maybe means a bonus

67
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,160
 episode and just before we got on there we even brainstorming new ways to do

68
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,400
 bonus episodes and what about so we're in good shape to work I think we had a

69
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,600
 good idea we're in good shape without any to deliver a brand new bonus

70
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,440
 episode should we get there so please don't let this reorganization hold you

71
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:33,240
 back for supporting us we still need you and by need you I mean we are completely

72
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:40,320
 reliant on you but yeah I mean you know yes we gave her a stipend but it was a

73
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,680
 charitable stipend and so I mean it really was just her helping us out for a

74
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,960
 decade and so she will be I feel like she wrote off the time that she worked

75
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,880
 for us as a charity donation on her time yeah and that'd be fair we would back

76
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,560
 that up at the IRS yeah I was sure I don't think any court would convict her

77
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,760
 no we're basically when it comes to us running a company we're basically make a

78
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:12,120
 wish but it's I just got a random link texted to me from a random phone number

79
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,280
 wanting me to reset my Instagram password so I got that from Google today

80
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:28,360
 too yeah I think I don't know you know I think maybe yeah maybe the one the US

81
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:34,560
 infrastructure might be hanging by thread no I think we're probably fine

82
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,960
 moving on thank you Annie you have been our champion for years we are going to

83
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,640
 miss you in ways that we don't understand yet so so thank you so much

84
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,280
 we're gonna run into issues over the next weeks and months and we're gonna be

85
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,760
 like fuck Annie was just taking care of this and we didn't realize it I know

86
00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:00,220
 that's going to happen so thank you so much Annie we very much appreciate you

87
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,440
 and everything you have done for us and for this community over the years she

88
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,920
 was a huge part of making this the success that it is yeah and always will

89
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:14,280
 be Annie Annie will henceforth be always welcome at any ice cream social event

90
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,720
 yeah anything that we ever do for all time Annie is forever welcome yeah and

91
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,080
 is just in yarn and sticks is saying I hope Annie gets free membership for life

92
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,760
 I think we can get her she might be sick of us guys so it's not easy up on the

93
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:34,720
 rewards but she wants to stay away from us I get that too well I don't think

94
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,400
 we're you know I think she has access to the patreon stuff to a degree I don't

95
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,720
 think we're taking that away so we're not we're not scouring to reset all the

96
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:53,120
 passwords resetting the door codes this morning I'll need your keys in your badge

99
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,640

100
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:20,960

 her was expressing thank yous and all the stuff and like and maybe could you

102
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,680
 just put a list together

103
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,960
 thank you so much Eddie that was so wonderfully appreciated mm-hmm yeah so I

104
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,000
 had a weird week I went to um went downtown the other night went on town on

105
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,600
 Monday night we're not starting there I tell you where we're starting okay you

106
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,680
 went to a football game with with pod therapy is where we're starting I did I

107
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,720
 went on Sunday I went to a football game with pod there this is where

108
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,600
 football why why football rules like like when you look at American sports

109
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,240
 like football is just in its own fucking category in terms of success you I would

110
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,040
 say I three three other friends JD who directed is directing the hey scoops

111
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,120
 movie short from our friend Alice who has the offensive crayon purpose the

112
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:27,360
 offensive crayons all went to this game and I went to bust balls with everyone I

113
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,240
 think so maybe JD after the fact during the game because you were at what I

114
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:39,400
 would think is the dumbest football game on earth so if you don't follow sports

115
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,920
 it's the last week of the season uh-huh the Raiders were already the most

116
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,800
 terrible team number one draft gets locked up they're bringing but at the

117
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,120
 beginning of the day we didn't know that we thought the only thing that was gonna

118
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,880
 matter on the day was that the Raiders needed to lose to lock up the number one

119
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,760
 draft pick and then right before the game started they come over the PA in

120
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,440
 the stadium they're like hey the Giants just upset the cow or just lost to the

121
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,240
 Cowboys or upset the Cowboys or which ever one they did yeah Giants just beat

122
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,080
 the Cowboys which solidifies the Raiders getting that number one draft pick now

123
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,480
 that's not even on the table and that's anything on the table the Chiefs come to

124
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,160
 town there's no Mahomes he's injured Patrick Mahomes is injured he's out

125
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:27,000
 tells he's in probably because he's last game did they come to the game there

126
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,800
 yeah homes yeah he was at the game I'm out there wasn't he I don't know I

127
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,760
 thought he was there I thought somebody told me he was there I don't fucking know

128
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,360
 I don't watch your breaks you asked us then Jacob and I were clarifying with

129
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:46,320
 each other can you just give us a second I thought he was there I thought

130
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,160
 somebody told me that he was there because it was probably Kelsey's last

131
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:56,940
 game yeah both ever names started yes yeah Kelsey might retire retiring Travis

132
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:04,800
 Kelsey yeah he's my age he's old he's also married to the good zillionaire

133
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:11,400
 that Brady that's true that is true yeah but he's already made the second most

134
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,320
 money and it but somebody made the second most amount of money in his

135
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,880
 marriage and that did not stop him I don't know because he hated his family

136
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:26,120
 he had to go back to my kids anybody hiring Giselle is a witch I'll spend

137
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:32,440
 time in Tampa Giselle is a certified which careful also now as a black belt

138
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,480
 buddy she'll kick your ass I ain't saying anything negative about it I was

139
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:43,320
 wondering how powerful which Taylor Swift is in comparison I wonder I guess

140
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,920
 pretty powerful under as well either way I feel like Travis Kelsey's gonna land

141
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,460
 on his feet somewhere I'm saying there's absolutely nothing on the line Raiders

142
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,720
 absolute worst team they're playing they are the worst both teams played

143
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:01,120
 multiple not one but multiple backup quarterbacks oh so many quarterbacks and

144
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:09,080
 no one could score a touchdown nope and it was just a field goal festival for

145
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,660
 the first half and I'm texting you and I'm texting out and I'm busting balls

146
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,880
 like alright happy field goals yeah like basically like why are you at this game

147
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,400
 it's so dumb that sounds like an old that sounds like a Steelers game which

148
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,760
 is Bosworth playing the whole game with nothing on the line it comes down to a

149
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:38,000
 field goal and the Raiders win drill it 14 to 12 they scored 14 points with no

150
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,680
 touchdowns which is a miracle they scored a safety at some point scored a

151
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:49,500
 safety in there and people went fucking wild like it was great and all of my

152
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,040
 ball busting fell on deaf ears because it was like whatever that was fucking

153
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:01,220
 amazing and I was like this is why football wins like that is by far the

154
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,920
 dumbest game like right now it's a Brooklyn Nets beat the Wizards on a last

155
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,000
 second shot no one would give a shit right like like when when the NBA has

156
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,440
 futility it is futility yes when you were watching the backup of backups play

157
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,640
 against each other to win by a field goal kick and everyone is like best day

158
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:32,720
 of my year yeah it's like what what this is why football has won this is how

159
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,360
 football has won I mean we went in large part because it was a meaningless game

160
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,240
 we bought the tickets she bought tickets that morning yeah yeah we were on the

161
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:49,000
 13th row on the on the 40 yard line so we had killer seats right and yeah we

162
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,400
 just had we went to we went knowing it was a meaningless game knowing that

163
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:58,200
 neither team was gonna really care the backups were gonna be the ones that care

164
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,640
 they are the guys they're playing for jobs they care and of course everybody's

165
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,920
 professional so I mean they're they're still going out there and doing the

166
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:10,740
 thing and yeah it was it was so much fun it was the most relaxed sporting event

167
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,960
 I've ever been to there were Kansas City Chiefs fans sitting directly in front of

168
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,440
 us we were just having nice conversations the whole game and would

169
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,040
 like razz each other with that when our team did well of their team didn't do

170
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,800
 well like just everybody was just having a good time just a quick check in with

171
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,680
 our listeners here Jeff Loomis in the chat says I'm so disconnected from the

172
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,000
 NBA this the first time I heard the Nets are now in Brooklyn and not New Jersey

173
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:43,440
 Jeff they moved there before I moved to Las Vegas I used to be that's fair you

174
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,080
 are behind on that I used to be a Nets fan and they and they moved to Brooklyn

175
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,760
 and I'm such a Jersey guy that I was pissed because there was a superior deal

176
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,240
 offered to them for them to play in Newark yeah and they took this really

177
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,440
 shady real estate deal so this guy Bruce Ratner could basically own all the

178
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,840
 property around the stadium and Bruce Ratner moved the team to Brooklyn and

179
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,200
 immediately sold the team and kept the rights to the land and everything around

180
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,160
 it it was such a fucking it was such a fucking piece of shit deal I mean I know

181
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,600
 it moved them out of New Jersey but have you ever heard of a more New Jersey

182
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:23,720
 deal than that they finished in style as they say they finished doing what they

183
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:30,720
 love but yeah Jeff it's been at least before 2008 I don't know what year but

184
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,880
 it's been a minute I always think that uh that they moved just so they could

185
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,080
 rename their dance team you know the name of the dance team for the Brooklyn

220
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:33,320
 door jelly right? What's that? I don't. I don't either. Okay. So Monday night we uh we

221
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:38,360
 went downtown SJ and I we go downtown we had a rare night off together and so my

222
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,920
 wife and I said oh we're gonna go out and hit the town we'll go find some

223
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,360
 dinner we called a couple of friends and said hey we're gonna go down to

224
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,680
 Fremont Street and walk around maybe find a little music find a little food

225
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:55,200
 see what see what the night brings us so we went down we went downtown head down

226
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,840
 to Fremont Street. What would we say gentlemen would we say this is version 5 version 6 of

227
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:08,120
 Fremont at this point? It's a resting version 5 it's a it's a slightly slightly

228
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,560
 adjusted improved like you know they do like the point the decimal points on

229
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:17,320
 different versions of stuff okay I'd say I'd say we're like 5.5 of that makes

230
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:25,000
 sense okay I think so Jeff Loomis you are not completely wrong I am I am in a

231
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,840
 small minority of Las Vegas locals that goes and does stuff on the strip in

232
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,720
 downtown that's true mainly I mean the strip part is because my my work takes

233
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,160
 me there it's rare that we go to the strip without work taking us there but

234
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,800
 downtown is a different animal but yeah so we head down we listen to a little

235
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,080
 bit of music there's a band that SJ might work with a little bit and we

236
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,040
 wouldn't listen to them a little bit which was nice and and then we see we

237
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:55,680
 did a very Las Vegas tourist thing we saw a billboard for a special at one of

238
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,840
 the steak houses at the I should give a shout out here the Fremont the Fremont

239
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:08,380
 casino down on Fremont Street they had a special starting at 9 p.m. 1799 for a

240
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:14,280
 steak and lobster dinner hey that is that's a nice old-school Vegas touch

241
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,200
 right there can't beat that with a stick so we just because you can't beat that

242
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,940
 they're trying to be old Vegas and we talked that we've talked about like

243
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:29,240
 Vegas a lot on the obviously and there's a hearing this week local businesses are

244
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:36,160
 trying to stop Las Vegas the town from raising parking prices and expanding

245
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:58,520
 paid parking I follow of course our good buddy Troy heard who is one of the key

246
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,640
 motivators down there in the Arts District yeah with with the theater and

247
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:10,600
 majestic doing his thing and his you know his feed has just been so sad to

248
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:15,620
 keep up with they are just trying to fuck the Arts District yeah and they're

249
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:20,040
 just trying it's just nickel and diamond it's just the worst kind of nickel and

250
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:25,960
 diamond and it is being done with it seems it sure seems like from an outside

251
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,760
 point of view it's being done with zero for thought not only zero for thought

252
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:36,980
 Jacob it seems with some level of malicious intent as there are now

253
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:44,840
 security guards parking security guards out there who are former police and they

254
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:50,240
 are carrying guns like it's one thing to have a meter made on duty it's another

255
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,680
 thing to have an armed guard patrolling your parking spaces just me getting

256
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:01,760
 pistol whipped as my as my chip won't scan on the parking meter right it's

257
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,880
 like it's like I just came down here to watch my kid in a new version of

258
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:12,000
 Cinderella I hear what you're sure I know what you're saying dance I hear

259
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,880
 what you're saying and I appreciate what you're saying I don't see that as a

260
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:22,920
 change Las Las Vegas security guards it is easy to have the to have the license

261
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:28,640
 here to be an armed security guard and also it's an open carry state so like

262
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,840
 having more having more guns around is what while I don't love it it's not a

263
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,400
 surprise but do you do either of you recall running into that on the regular

264
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:46,960
 in the Arts District I arts district is so new relatively okay but I mean but

265
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,560
 like I I oh no no it's definitely changing I don't I'm saying I'm not

266
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:58,680
 saying armed guards by the parking lots down in the arts district ever you know

267
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,400
 that that's I mean the argument likely isn't like I guess I want to be able to

268
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:08,720
 fucking pull heat on some you know scoff laws it's that right if you're gonna

269
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,840
 send me downtown working late at night I would like to be armed is what they're

270
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,720
 doing because it yeah outside I'd like to be armed everywhere I go but that's

271
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:30,680
 not good well I mean I'm just taking a quick vote and nobody wants Paul to be

272
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:35,600
 armed I've got my ad man tium claws that retract and you know so I can we're

273
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,720
 actually gonna take those away from you oh no I'm not I'm not comfortable with

274
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:44,200
 you having grafted to my bones nope sorry we're taking them this is on fire

275
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,000
 in the chat today Jeff insists you know what raising parking prices means that

276
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,800
 this might be a spot available and I'm willing to pay a premium for it Jeff if

277
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,840
 you lived here I tell you to move but you don't even live here oh shut up and

278
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:03,320
 get lost and Jeff I'll tell you the the downtown parking situation I don't think

279
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:08,080
 again just looking at from an outsider point of view it sure doesn't seem like

280
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:13,160
 it has been affected the business side of it has been affected by these parking

281
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:18,040
 rate changes yeah it's the local businesses that are saying let they want locals to

282
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,280
 come on down there breeze in grab a bite to eat see you see a show go home no

283
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,320
 problem and that should be the way our arts district work it's us it's locals

284
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,000
 it's for us also we are like our taxes already paid for the fucking streets

285
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,200
 why I'm having to pay again to park on my street yes we're Jacob you're ready

286
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:43,720
 Jacob no we are triple fucking taxed in this country it's insane yeah there is a

287
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,160
 meeting happening today we're not gonna be able to go to it but there is a

288
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,840
 community meeting happening in my neighborhood today about a new church

289
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,960
 that is wanting to be built nearby people are up in arms

290
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:06,280
 argument it should be I hope fuck off get the fuck out how close to your house

291
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:13,160
 pretty close okay like other side of kind of the the block and everything from

292
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:19,240
 me but like as the crow flies should this should this go through and get

293
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:25,760
 squirrely in your neighborhood how much of a possibility is there for us as ICS

294
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:33,720
 to try and file for church status try to try and solve some things I mean it

295
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,920
 would it would automatically lessen our tax burden which I mean we would

296
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,440
 definitely get away with it at least through the current administration

297
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:47,800
 until the IRS gets beefed back up yeah you're right we'd have three good years

298
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,840
 of skating so I would have minimum three good years probably more like 10 so yeah

299
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,960
 let's let's fucking go I mean this is let's fucking also like the way your

300
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,040
 neighborhood is set up right like you have a wall there and stuff you can put

301
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,720
 whatever st. Annick sculpture you want like right there yeah yeah just have

302
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:09,200
 like oh we could do anything I got I was genuinely trees and I have some huge

303
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,360
 palm trees in front of my house and I have been genuinely considering hiring

304

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,360
 - Was that a Happy Days themed bar?

348
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,320
 - It was not.

349
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,600
 It was not, Paul.

350
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,880
 - Oh, I'm thinking of Potsy Potsy.

351
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,700
 - That's right.

352
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,540
 That's a different bar entirely.

353
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,680
 - Different bar, different bar.

354
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,640
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

355
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,920
 - The jukebox is cheap though,

356
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,600
 if you know how to work it. - Potsy Potsy.

357
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,640
 - Potsy Potsy, you gotta order the Ralph Mouth.

358
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,480
 - There you go.

359
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,240
 - So we hang out there.

360
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,040
 We have some cocktails.

361
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,160
 Our friends have a little bit of food.

362
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,160
 We pick off their food a little bit.

363
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,240
 The food was really good.

364
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,920
 The cocktails were delicious.

365
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,920
 Oh, I had a wagyu washed old fashioned.

366
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,720
 And just fine. - Wagyu washed?

367
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,640
 - Just fine.

368
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,040
 - Now what does that mean?

369
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,880
 - What does that mean?

370
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,800
 - Wagyu fat washed whiskey.

371
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,560
 So they just, they wipe a steak in the--

372
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,400
 - That's it.

373
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,520
 They just dip a steak down in there and just,

374
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,600
 they put a steak in the, those drink shakers,

375
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,520
 they just put a chunk of steak in there, just whip it up.

376
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,480
 - This is, I am also wagyu washed.

377
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,400
 I replaced my soap with wagyu beef now when I shower.

378
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,840
 - Wagyu washing.

379
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,000
 - Just take wagyu beef across all my extremities.

380
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,200
 - Anne loves an old fashioned.

381
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,440
 - Between the beef and the butter with you, Matt,

382
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,720
 you're really gleaming.

383
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,560
 - Yeah, yeah.

384
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,240
 I just, the only person who doesn't like this new look

385
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,720
 is my cardiologist.

386
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,640
 But other than that.

387
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,480
 (Matt laughs)

388
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,320
 - And he'll never tell.

389
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,880
 - Everyone seems to think I'm shining and glowing.

390
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,320
 - Your cardiologist.

391
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,960
 (Matt laughs)

392
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,120
 - The only man who knows my secret is my cardiologist.

393
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,320
 And he'll never tell.

394
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,720
 - He'll never tell.

395
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,280
 He's like, "I'm drinking butter.

396
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,680
 "I'm washing myself with beef.

397
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,480
 "What do you want from me, doc?"

398
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,680
 (Matt laughs)

399
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,720
 - To not do that.

400
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,880
 I don't want you to do either of those things.

401
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,760
 - Name one thing I can do differently.

402
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,240
 - Not wash yourself in butter.

403
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:30,320
 - All right, fine. - Next, next, next.

404
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,440
 Pass. - You're right.

405
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,640
 - Pass, next.

406
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,960
 - New solution.

407
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,800
 - You got me.

408
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,280
 - That's not gonna work for me, doc.

409
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,120
 - So you were at the Fremont enjoying this meal.

410
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,800
 - So we went to the Fremont, enjoyed this meal.

411
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,240
 And then we go over to this new establishment

412
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,200
 called Pachi Pachi.

413
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,960
 - Where is it in reference to Fremont?

414
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,680
 - It is a walk from Fremont, but just a walk.

415
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,600
 It's just a few minutes off of Fremont

416
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,560
 kind of on the edge of the arts district

417
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,440
 between kind of the Fremont street experience

418
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,800
 and the Las Vegas arts district.

419
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,760
 - Is it like where the Griffin is and all those spots?

420
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,280
 - It's on that end, but just a little bit past that

421
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,120
 and one block over.

422
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,840
 - There's always fancy little spots popping up over there.

423
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,680
 - Exactly.

424
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,640
 Over by like Carson Kitchen area, all that stuff.

425
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,080
 - That's the spot where it's offensive

426
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,520
 to charge for parking.

427
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,360
 - That's why we walked.

428
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,160
 - For us to, it's clearly built for locals.

429
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,440
 Just pull on there, have a good time and get out of there.

430
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,860
 - Yeah, that's true.

431
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:26,200
 So we were in there, we're hanging out with our friends.

432
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,560
 There are four of us in there.

433
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,600
 And we are at the end of the evening,

434
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,160
 we are the only people left in there

435
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,300
 with the exception of one group of three guys

436
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,000
 that's over by the bar.

437
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,280
 And so we finish up and we're gonna head out.

438
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,560
 We're gonna go, you'll probably find something else

439
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,680
 and maybe a nightcap before we call it a night.

440
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,160
 And so we stand up, we're gathering up our things.

441
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,320
 And one of the guys from the group across the room

442
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,600
 breaks off and comes over to us

443
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,280
 and says, "You guys enjoy your night.

444
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,920
 Thank you so much for coming by."

445
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,760
 And our friend goes,

446
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,480
 "Are you associated with this establishment?"

447
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,400
 He goes, "Oh yeah, I'm one of the owners.

448
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,760
 I just wanted to come over and thank you for coming in."

449
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,760
 Lovely guy, we had a nice chat.

450
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,040
 And he says, "Hey, I know you guys

451
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,720
 are getting ready to leave before you head out for the night.

452
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,160
 Would you be interested in having one more cocktail?"

453
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,120
 And we all do the thing where the four of us

454
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,960
 just do the look at each other and check in.

455
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,800
 And we go, "Yes, let's have another cocktail.

456
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,080
 This'll be nice."

457
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,200
 And we all start to kind of shift towards the bar

458
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,840
 in the place, okay?

459
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:36,440
 And he goes, "Great, hold on just a second."

460
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,520
 And he calls over to the bartender.

461
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,560
 He says, "Hey, I'm gonna take these folks over

462
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,360
 so I'll be back in a little while."

463
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,360
 What?

464
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,200
 Whoa.

465
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,400
 Oh, hold on.

466
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,680
 We're going somewhere else.

467
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,600
 Never go to a second location, Jacob.

468
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,840
 Never go to a second location.

469
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,680
 Kind of interests you guys.

470
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,880
 This is murderino101.

471
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,960
 Never go to a second location.

472
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,080
 We're gonna go to my apartment.

473
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,960
 We're going to take these guys to my apartment.

474
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,040
 In any situation, never go to a second location.

475
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,000
 This is awful.

476
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,240
 So we go, "Oh, we're going somewhere else."

477
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,320
 He goes, "Yeah, it's just a little walk.

478
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,760
 It's a couple doors down."

479
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,440
 Go, "All right, great, we're in."

480
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,080
 And so we head down.

481
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,160
 We walk down the block.

482
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,400
 - It's clothing optional, so you can leave your clothes here

483
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,720
 or check out when you get into the place.

484
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,680
 Whatever you wanna do.

485
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,240
 - They have lockers, I think it's fine.

486
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,080
 Don't worry about it.

487
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,640
 - There's no charge for lockers here.

488
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,000
 So if you wanna leave your clothes here, that's cheaper.

489
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,840
 - Oh my God.

490
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,680
 - It's two dollars over there.

491
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,920
 - I'm scared for you.

492
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,640
 I'm really scared now.

493
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,120
 - Oh, no, no, no, it's not that kind of story.

494
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,160
 So we go over, it turns out the bar that we go to

495
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,160
 is a new bar in an old location.

496
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,680
 The old location of this bar is a bar

497
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,200
 that SJ and I used to go into all the time

498
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,560
 when we first moved here.

499
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,720
 So that was kind of exciting.

500
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,980
 So we head into this new bar.

501
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:03,760
 The owner from the Pachi Pachi, he comes in and he says,

502
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,160
 "Yeah, these are my new friends.

503
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,400
 Just met them down at my spot."

504
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,240
 And we go, "Oh great."

505
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,080
 And so we all meet, we all shake hands.

506
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,760
 - Scoop or Nova Girl, Chad's asking,

507
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,600
 did he ever prove that he was the owner?

508
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,720
 (laughing)

509
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,160
 - That is a fine question, Scoop or Nova Girl.

510
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,500
 (laughing)

511
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,800
 Because what happened at that point,

512
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,680
 after he introduced us to everyone,

513
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,800
 what do you think he did?

514
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,600
 After we walked in, he said,

515
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,800
 "Oh, let's go have a nightcap, a couple doors down."

516
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,520
 We walked down to the other bar.

517
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,120
 We walk in, he introduces us to the staff

518
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,520
 and everybody who's there.

519
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:47,800
 What do you think he does at that point?

520
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,960
 We haven't ordered anything.

521
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,360
 We just walked in, we've met everyone.

522
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,600
 - It's a finger wag in the air.

523
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,120
 Drinks for everyone, drinks for everyone, finger wag.

524
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,880
 That's what I think happens next.

525
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,440
 - Paul's on it.

526
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,320
 He just goes, "Well, I gotta get back over to my bar.

527
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,680
 Thanks for coming in, guys."

528
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,840
 - What in the living hell?

529
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,200
 - So is this the game that they're playing?

530
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,400
 Is this the game that they're playing?

531
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,200
 They're just shifting customers to each other's spot?

532
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,440
 - I don't think so.

533
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,000
 I was like, he left and we all looked at each other.

534
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,580
 We were like, "Where are we hanging out?"

535
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:26,200
 I thought we were gonna, you invited us here.

536
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,960
 - Yeah, these are my new friends

537
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,800
 who I don't wanna talk to. - You were on your way out

538
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,660
 for the first time, right?

539
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:34,040
 - We were leaving his establishment when this happened.

540
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,960
 - So wasn't like he was trying to be slick

541
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,880
 and kick you out of his place so we could close.

542
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,780
 - No, I was like, maybe he wanted to close,

543
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:45,240
 but that doesn't make sense because we were leaving.

544
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,100
 We were like, we were up and putting our coats on leaving.

545
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,580
 - That's bizarre.

546
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,400
 - It didn't make a single bit of sense.

547
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,760
 - It's really bizarre. - This is like a cab driver

548
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,020
 taking you to a specific strip club, right?

549
00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:00,400
 - I guess, but I don't think anybody got anything out of it.

550
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,640
 I mean, the bar that we went to

551
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,200
 got us to buy another drink there.

552
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,200
 I mean, it was great, we had a good time there.

553
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,440
 We did have, I mean, he left

554
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,660
 and we did just order a couple of rounds of drinks there

555
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,200
 and had a nice time there.

556
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,120
 So the recommendation was awesome.

557
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,240
 - This is bizarre.

558
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,720
 This is bizarre also because--

559
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,760
 - I don't have a single bad part of this story.

560
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,280
 It was just the weirdest fucking thing

561
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,440
 I've ever seen in my life.

562
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,180
 - But the weirdness matters, right?

563
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:30,880
 Because how quickly are you gonna go to Hotsie Totsie again?

564
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,520
 - I mean, I don't think it's affected

565
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,400
 our opinion of that place at all.

566
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,160
 - Here's the thing.

567
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:43,160
 You went down for your bargain steak,

568
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:47,520
 steak bisque plate and lobster tail.

569
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,520
 - That's right.

570
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:52,440
 - And decided to dial it up by going to Hotsie Totsie.

571
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,920
 And what probably would have ended

572
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,320
 as just like really fun night out downtown.

573
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,980
 And now next time you have like friends in town or whatever

574
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:07,000
 and they're still doing the surf and turf special or whatever,

575
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,320
 you're not gonna do it again, right?

576
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,160
 You're not gonna just go like,

577
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,480
 "Oh, we should go do this and go bing bang boom.

578
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,600
 This is a really fun night downtown," right?

579
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,920
 - Well, the surf and turf special

580
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,040
 and the Hotsie Totsie aren't connected.

581
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,320
 They were just a walk from each other.

582
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,720
 So the surf and turf was just earlier and then Hotsie Totsie.

583
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,400
 Like I know what you mean though.

584
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:30,400
 It is a weird nightcap on the end of your experience

585
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,040
 at Hotsie Totsie.

586
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,080
 - In other words, like if you, like a friend came down,

587
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,200
 I was like, "Is there any old Vegas left on this town?"

588
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,920
 And you would be like, "Oh, buckle up.

589
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,660
 I'm taking you down to the Fremont.

590
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:44,820
 We're gonna have a, don't get your potato loaded

591
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,980
 and follow my lead," right?

592
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,820
 Then down there, you might be like,

593
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:49,920
 "Hey, there's also like a little bar.

594
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,760
 If you guys want to get off the strip,

595
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,600
 we can go around the town."

596
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,420
 Like, you know what I mean?

597
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,320
 Like you're very lucky to like replay that scenario.

598
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,840
 But you're very much less likely to be like now,

599
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,160
 to be like, "Hey, you want to go to this bar

600
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,720
 where the guy weirded me out?"

601
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,000
 Like, you're just not gonna do it.

602
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,160
 You're just not gonna--

603
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,080
 - You might be right.

604
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,920
 You might be right.

605
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,880
 - You know, like you're just simply not gonna be inclined

606
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,640
 to treat someone else to that experience again,

607
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,060
 because you're like, "This owner's weird."

608
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,560
 - There's just a weird story.

609
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,560
 And it is, like I say, not a single bad thing.

610
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,400
 Not a single bad thing at any part of the story,

611
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,400
 including the recommendation.

612
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,960
 The recommendation was great.

613
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,220
 - No, we only have to explore how flawed

614
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,520
 this person's logic is.

615
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,280
 Like we can't find all of the spaces

616
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,920
 on the board game of decision-making

617
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,640
 on this person's end.

618
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,360
 - And I didn't even tell you

619
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,200
 about the full length conversation

620
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,120
 that we had at his bar before leaving there.

621
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,280
 We stood there and all chatted and laughed

622
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,660
 and had a good time for easily for 10 minutes.

623
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:50,240
 Before he suggested that we go to the other bar,

624
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,540
 we all stood around and laughed and had a good time

625
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,080
 for about 10 minutes with him.

626
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,560
 - He specifically said, "You guys wanna stay for one more."

627
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,400
 He saw you leaving and said, "Let's do one more."

628
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,960
 - He came over when we were leaving.

629
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,000
 We stood up, we're putting our coats on.

630
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,560
 He came over and engaged us in conversation at that point.

631
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,560
 We had a nice, long conversation.

632
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,360
 We all had a nice time.

633
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,640
 And as that conversation seemed to be naturally

634
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,680
 getting to a point where we could either sit down

635
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,920
 and continue it or move on with our evenings,

636
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,560
 he said, "I know you guys are leaving.

637
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,560
 Would you like to have one more cocktail?"

638
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,760
 - Right, and that implies one,

639
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,640
 the cocktail happens in that location.

640
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,040
 - Or at least that he's gonna have it with us.

641
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,800
 - And two, that he's paying or that's a free round.

642
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,880
 - Sure, the paying part, I was less,

643
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,680
 I was less weirded out by the paying part.

644
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,440
 - It is weird to escort someone to a bar

645
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,080
 and not buy the first round.

646
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,720
 That's just weird.

647
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,560
 - Agreed.

648
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,040
 - No matter who you are, owner or not.

649
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,600
 And if I rally a group to move one location

650
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,360
 and go to B location,

651
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,600
 especially if I'm gonna ditch them, which he did.

652
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,920
 - That's really odd.

653
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:05,080
 - At least if he says, get them whatever they want on me.

654
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,360
 Listen, I gotta get back to my bar,

655
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,160
 but I wanted you guys to check out this place.

656
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,520
 This round's on me.

657
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,520
 Now you're doing some hospitality work

658
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,400
 and now you're doing whatever.

659
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,200
 But he literally just shoved you into somewhere else

660
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,600
 and be like, "Buy things over here.

661
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,880
 You're welcome."

662
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,280
 - It is not, it's a weird move.

663
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,120
 - It is.

664
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,600
 - And you know what I really wanted to do?

665
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,560
 You know, an hour later when we were leaving the second bar,

666
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,720
 what I really wanted to do was go back to the first bar

667
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,280
 and see if it was still open.

668
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,000
 - If it had just vanished,

669
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 see if it was still even still there.

670
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,080
 - There's not even a building here.

671
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,240
 - Yeah, right, exactly.

672
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,800
 - Oh, there used to be a building here years ago.

673
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,640
 - Yeah, exactly.

674
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,240
 - Are you familiar with the Hotsie Totsie building?

675
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,160
 - And there's a painting of the guy and it's like 1958.

676
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,800
 - Fuck, that's the guy.

677
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,080
 - That's the guy.

678
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,200
 Total ghost.

679
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,960
 - How long was the walk between the bars?

680
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,160
 - Oh. - Good question, Rob.

681
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,080
 - 90 seconds, 90 seconds.

682
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,360
 - It was right there.

683
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,680
 - Yeah, right now, not out of the way at all.

684
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,960
 Really a couple of doors down.

685
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,440
 And in the same area, in an area we were familiar with,

686
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,400
 there was not a single moment in this story

687
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,480
 where any of us were uncomfortable at all.

688
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,840
 - Because not to put too fine of a point on it,

689
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,560
 but by making you go to another bar

690
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,640
 and get another drink, which you didn't pay for,

691
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,480
 you also had to pay for another hour of parking

692
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,440
 that you were about to save

693
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,480
 by leaving the bar in the first place.

694
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,280
 - Back to the parking.

695
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,120
 - That would have been true.

696
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,520
 That would be true for other people.

697
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,080
 We had parked with our friends at the valet

698
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,680
 down at the Golden Gate Casino.

699
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,400
 - And you have friends there?

700
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,240
 - And we have friends there.

701
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,080
 They take care of us.

702
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:44,920
 But they're also-

703
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,740
 - Connected.

704
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:48,160
 - But it's also, it's also old school Vegas.

705
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,640
 So it's free valet for anyone, if you can get in.

706
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,720
 The hard part there is get again, because it's small.

707
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,160
 - It fills up.

708
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,000
 - That's it.

709
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,840
 That's where I have friends.

710
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,000
 - If we're up to Jeff Loomis, he charged $50 a car

711
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,080
 than anyone who really wanted to pay could do it.

712
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,160
 - Yeah, I mean, look at capitalist Jeff Loomis over here.

713
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:10,320
 Capitalism will solve all our problems, right, Jeff?

714
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,320
 - Yeah.

715
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,560
 - I'll tell you who else thinks capitalism will solve

716
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,720
 their problems.

717
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,480
 And that's the following sponsor.

718
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,720
 - Old money guns, Jeff Loomis.

719
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:24,800
 Today's show is brought to you by Creepy Best Buy Guys,

720
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,520
 part-time job as a professional wrestling trainer.

721
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,520
 That's from Bear Scoop in 2025.

722
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,880
 It's Creepy Best Buy Guy, part-time job

723
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,280
 as a professional wrestling trainer.

724
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,480
 - Hey, let's get in the ring.

725
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,480
 Let's just go a couple and see what we can do here.

726
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,400
 Okay, yeah.

727
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,640
 All right, now first thing you want to do

728
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,760
 is you want to put your arms together

729
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:55,760
 with the other person's arms and hold on to them.

730
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,280
 - So is it a specific type of hold?

731
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,840
 Like what do you mean by which hold?

732
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,920
 - Just get in there and start touching.

733
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,920
 See what you touch.

734
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,560
 - But like, is there a technique to the hold

735
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,960
 that I should be using?

736
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,120
 - No, no, no, no.

737
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:13,440
 You've been punching rice, like I've asked you.

738
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,120
 - Punching rice?

739
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,840
 - Yeah, I asked you to punch rice.

740
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,480
 That was part of the training.

741
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,320
 - Yeah, yeah.

742
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,920
 - You get a big old bucket of rice.

743
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,360
 You just start punching that rice.

744
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,200
 - Yeah.

745
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,960
 - And it gets your grip strength growing, right?

746
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:26,800
 Yeah, okay.

747
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,400
 - Yeah, I used cooked rice though, so it was much easier.

748
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,800
 It was very nice.

749
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,200
 - Okay, I'm going to call you Panda Express.

750
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,560
 (laughing)

751
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,400
 - Okay.

752
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,560
 - And her hay scoops are checked.

753
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,800
 (laughing)

754
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,480
 - I think that would very much defeat the purpose.

755
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,960
 (laughing)

756
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,840
 - Well, unless you cooked it and then refrigerated

757
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,920
 and let it reset in there, then maybe, I don't know,

758
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,080
 maybe it'd be sticky enough.

759
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,840
 - That's why I remember I worked with this guy.

760
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,360
 He was the nicest guy in the Virgin Islands

761
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,680
 and he was a former army ranger.

762
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,680
 And he said that they would jab their hands

763
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,920
 into buckets of sand to build up their callus and strength.

764
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,360
 And then you added rocks after your calluses built up,

765
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,200
 after a while.

766
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,320
 And then you added broken glass when the rocks

767
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,480
 didn't do anything to your hands.

768
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,560
 And you just kept jabbing them over and over again

769
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,080
 into the sands or whatever.

770
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,120
 And he's like, "That way, if you can only get two fingers

771
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,240
 on someone, you can still..."

772
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,000
 And he literally put two fingers on my neck

773
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 and I was like, "Jesus, those are callous and strong fingers."

774
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,520
 (laughing)

775
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,480
 He's basically saying that you just,

776
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,040
 that way you still only needed two fingers for you

777
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,120
 to kill someone who was trying to kill you.

778
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:43,000
 And I was like, "Thank you for your service."

779
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:43,840
 - Yeah, right?

780
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,120
 - And then I went and I changed my pants.

781
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:50,760
 - What was his army ranger?

782
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,200
 - He was an army ranger, yeah.

783
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:56,240
 - Yeah, I had friends like that,

784
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,760
 a couple of ranger friends back in the day.

785
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,960
 And yeah, they, I didn't fuck with them a whole lot.

786
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,120
 Hardly ever, in fact, hardly ever.

787
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,880
 We have an update on a previous story.

788
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,000
 - I don't know if you heard it, a few weeks ago,

789
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,360
 fella went to the old, what was the establishment

790
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,280
 he went to, the haunted thing at...

791
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,800
 - The John Wick.

792
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,400
 - The John Wick. - The John Wick experience.

793
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,320
 - The John Wick experience over at Area 15.

794
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,320
 Fella showed up there with a real sex doll companion

795
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:33,200
 and wanted to take himself and his real sex doll companion

796
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,800
 through the experience.

797
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,240
 And at one point, shenanigans occurred.

798
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,080
 But Professor Big Scoop in the chat with us here,

799
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,240
 in the room with us here,

800
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,360
 in the Zoom where it happened, if you will, was there.

801
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:51,360
 So, Professor, tell us your tale.

802
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,000
 - If you have seen the video,

803
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
 I am the tall guy standing to the screen right

804
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,600
 of the guy playing the manager.

805
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:05,320
 - That's it, we had friends send to our Instagram

806
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:10,120
 the actual security footage of the events that took place.

807
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,880
 - Yeah. - Oh, yeah.

808
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,720
 - So you're working there currently, yes, Biggs?

809
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,560
 - Oh, yeah. - Yeah.

810
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,520
 - Yeah, yeah, along with, I mean, you know,

811
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,960
 friends of Ice Cream Social, you know.

812
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,160
 - Sure.

813
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,040
 - Nicole Unger and Brenna Folger.

814
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,280
 - Oh, lovely.

815
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,320
 Brenna Folger is no friend of Ice Cream Social.

816
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,160
 (laughing)

817
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,800
 - Those names have nothing to do with

818
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,480
 who may have sent us those videos.

819
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,320
 - No.

820
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,760
 (laughing)

821
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,400
 So give us the skinny, Biggs.

822
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,840
 What happens from your POV?

823
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,920
 - All right, so we got the word

824
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:48,360
 that this is gonna be happening like two days before.

825
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,160
 - Oh, really, so he contacted the establishment?

826
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,120
 - Did they call for permission at that part in advance?

827
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:53,960
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

828
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:54,800
 - Okay.

829
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,680
 - Well, that's polite.

830
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,800
 - Or is it polite, or has he done this before

831
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,680
 with lots of places and finally realized,

832
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,800
 oh, I gotta give you this? - Yes!

833
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,680
 The answer to both of those questions is yes.

834
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,520
 - Well, it's weird. - It could very well be yes.

835
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,800
 It could very well be.

836
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,640
 - He asked permission for the doll to be armed,

837
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,280
 and we said, "This is an open carry state.

838
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,600
 Go ahead.

839
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,920
 You can strap heat under the torso of the real doll."

840
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,120
 - My doll is coming straight from her job

841
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,600
 as a parking meter enforcer.

842
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,200
 (laughing)

843
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,400
 - That's right, that's right.

844
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,600
 So we knew way ahead of time,

845
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,080
 and of course, all of the records.

846
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:34,520
 Chris Brown normally plays the manager and the others,

847
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,400
 but I was like, "Oh, come on."

848
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,120
 I was getting ready to bump him in,

849
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,120
 'cause I was also playing the manager that day.

850
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,040
 And I was like, "All right, I need to go in there

851
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,480
 and just kind of be his muscle, right?

852
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,240
 Be the guy standing behind him."

853
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,280
 - Yeah.

854
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,840
 - And he was fine with it.

855
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,120
 And the guy came in, very nice guy,

856
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,840
 apparently been spending, you know,

857
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:01,440
 about an hour or two beforehand out in the bar,

858
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,120
 having conversations with-

859
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,600
 - Yikes.

860
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,840
 Oh, great.

861
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,360
 - Yeah, with her and patrons that would,

862
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,440
 or patrons that would come up and say,

863
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,400
 "Oh yeah, so-and-so really likes the decor here,

864
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,560
 blah, blah, blah."

865
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,120
 And the whole time he said,

866
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:20,680
 he said, "Now, here's the thing.

867
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,960
 I'm not as weird as you guys may think.

868
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:27,960
 I know she's fake, but I've had some really bad relationships

869
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:34,560
 and this one with her is just, makes me comfortable,

870
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:38,640
 makes me not crazy."

871
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,040
 - Hard to argue with that logic.

872
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,040
 - Who can argue?

873
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:46,040
 - Yeah, and again, middle-aged guy would say it,

874
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:49,480
 I would say probably 50 plus, you know?

875
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,320
 - Okay.

876
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:55,320
 Well, he's got that top of the line vag doll model money.

877
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,680
 - Oh my lordy.

878
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,520
 - That shit ain't cheap.

879
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,360
 - And he-

880
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,680
 - He didn't even want just the torso,

881
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:01,760
 he wanted the whole thing.

882
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,600
 - Exactly.

883
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:07,600
 - He went with the huge tracks of land model as well.

884
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,680
 It was, yeah.

885
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,240
 - And if you lose it over the side of a boat,

886
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,720
 you want it to be able to float.

887
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,960
 (laughing)

888
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:16,800
 - Right.

889
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,000
 - Not as crazy as you think, guys.

890
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,480
 - I'm just so psychologically damaged

891
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,840
 from all of my relationships with humans

892
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,720
 that I decided to forge my own.

893
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,880
 - Holy shit.

894
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,840
 - Now, I didn't see them, but everyone,

895
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,040
 but some other people said,

896
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,960
 it made me took them off once they got out of the bar.

897
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,280
 Apparently she had elf ears as well.

898
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,760
 - Okay.

899
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:42,600
 - Okay.

900
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,560
 - Yeah.

901
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,400
 - That explains why she was rolling for Thacko

902
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,800
 before going to each room.

903
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,200
 (laughing)

904
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:55,200
 - Nice, Auburn haired young lady in a blue dress.

905
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,040
 - Real horse hair, yeah.

906
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,360
 - So he comes in.

907
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,120
 So this thing is apparently heavy.

908
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,640
 - They prefer sex workers.

909
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,840
 - Yeah, it's heavy, right?

910
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:05,680
 It's like-

911
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,520
 - Oh, horse.

912
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:11,520
 - Yeah, I would estimate it is closing in on 100 pounds.

913
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,360
 - My God.

914
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:16,800
 - It's somewhere between 50 and 100.

915
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,800
 - How is he currently transporting it?

916
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,720
 - That's Jacob's breaking point with real women.

917
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,560
 He can't do it.

918
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,600
 (laughing)

919
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,120
 - How's he currently transporting the thing?

920
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:28,920
 - So he has a truck that has a lift on the back.

921
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:29,760
 - Great.

922
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,000
 - Then she rides in the lift.

923
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,840
 - Stop it.

924
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,680
 - Lovers her to the ground.

925
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,520
 - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

926
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,900
 - From the back of the truck.

927
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,160
 - But then he just carries her?

928
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,000
 - Yeah.

929
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:39,820
 - I'm not-

930
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:40,660
 - And that-

931
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:41,500
 - You saw the video, Paul.

932
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,120
 He was just carrying her around.

933
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:43,960
 - I'm not as-

934
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:44,800
 - That's what we, I mean-

935
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,640
 - I'm not as crazy as you think, guys.

936
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,080
 I just hired this vehicle

937
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:50,560
 that normally transports aquatic animals from zoo to zoo.

938
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,240
 (laughing)

939
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,400
 - I transport her via this sling.

940
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,680
 (laughing)

941
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,960
 - Yeah.

942
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,720
 - If you think you recognize this swing,

943
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,920
 this is the one that SeaWorld used to use.

944
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,840
 You've probably seen this sling before.

945
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,680
 - Got a deal.

946
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:06,880
 Got a real deal.

947
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,880
 - It was actually like some sort of a chair once.

948
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,720
 - Okay.

949
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,540
 All right.

950
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,440
 - Yeah.

951
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,280
 - So we're in there and we get to work.

952
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,920
 All right, he's coming through.

953
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,320
 Blah, blah, blah.

954
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,640
 So he comes in and because this thing is so heavy,

955
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,440
 he's got it tucked under the armpits

956
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:30,880
 and he's kind of waddling in with it, you know?

957
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,200
 - Oh, scuba nova girl is saying roller skates

958
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,360
 and somebody needs to get through to this guy

959
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,760
 and get him a pair of roller skates.

960
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,520
 - No, but roller skates, she just whoop, boom.

961
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,500
 She'd be on her ass every five seconds.

962
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:42,340
 - He'd be doing like those-

963
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,560
 - That'd be a real problem.

964
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,520
 - He'd be doing like those weird like Scott dances

965
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,360
 with her, you know?

966
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,440
 Just like two in the legs and up and around and-

967
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,400
 - You get a tripod, maybe we can talk roller skates.

968
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,560
 - What'd you call me?

969
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:54,600
 - Yeah, you heard it.

970
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,960
 - So he comes in, he puts her behind a chair.

971
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,640
 He tries to, apparently she's got wires

972
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,080
 or some kind of armature in the fingers.

973
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:05,920
 - Okay.

974
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:06,760
 - So he tries to-

975
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,600
 - She's got bendy hands?

976
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,440
 - Bendy hands.

977
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,000
 - He's gotta come from grip.

978
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,880
 And he tries to get her to grip the back of the chair.

979
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,640
 - Is this a ride?

980
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,940
 - And then he stands to the side.

981
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:18,780
 - Is this a ride?

982
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:19,960
 (laughing)

983
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,960
 - The grip was apparently not good enough.

984
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,080
 And you guys have seen the security footage.

985
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:25,920
 - Yeah, Paul, it's a ride.

986
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,240
 - She falls backwards.

987
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,360
 (laughing)

988
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,680
 And both eyes, boop, boop.

989
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,320
 - Just both eyes just pop right out of the head.

990
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,600
 - Like champagne corks.

991
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,040
 - It was just like, boop, it's like a cartoon.

992
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,980
 - Oh, they just fly.

993
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:41,640
 - And then it kinda went another way.

994
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,480
 - Like Christopher Cullum.

995
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,880
 - What are the other guys in the room?

996
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,720
 - Now this is indeed where he is not as crazy

997
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,320
 as I think he is.

998
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,200
 Because if he was as crazy as I think he was,

999
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,600
 he would start weeping.

1000
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,760
 (laughing)

1001
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,360
 - Oh, right, right, right.

1002
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,440
 - And he actually did just kind of start laughing.

1003
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,480
 And he was like, "It's like, okay."

1004
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,080
 And this one guy went to kind of help him

1005
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,400
 and he was like, "No, no."

1006
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,240
 So he went and picked up,

1007
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,200
 "Let me be the one that touches this."

1008
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,040
 - Oh God.

1009
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:06,860
 - Yeah, let me.

1010
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:07,700
 - You don't want this on your hands.

1011
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:08,540
 - And apparently-

1012
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:09,360
 - Yeah, you don't touch it.

1013
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,160
 - And apparently, don't do that, sir.

1014
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,560
 Don't help.

1015
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,360
 - Somethings can't be undone, sir.

1016
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,200
 Back away.

1017
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,400
 (laughing)

1018
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,240
 - Sir, she's dead.

1019
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:22,120
 - They're supposed to be the sockets or the sockets.

1020
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,760
 God, this is just, it's worse.

1021
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,600
 The sockets are kind of packed with cotton or something.

1022
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:27,440
 - Yeah.

1023
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,000
 - 'Cause one of the little cotton balls also popped out.

1024
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,480
 And so he gets her back up,

1025
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,640
 but then she's there staring at the manager.

1026
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,600
 And she's got no arms.

1027
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,440
 - Oh, oh.

1028
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,520
 - And of course, I'm sitting there.

1029
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,960
 It's not my show, it's Chris's show.

1030
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:51,560
 And I'm just like, all of my years of improv just failed me.

1031
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,720
 I had no idea what to do in this situation.

1032
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,560
 - What do you do?

1033
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,920
 This is beyond surreal.

1034
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,880
 - I believe I would have literally fallen to the ground.

1035
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,880
 I believe I would be on the ground,

1036
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,140
 just right next to her.

1037
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:07,000
 My eyeballs might pop out as well.

1038
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,480
 I don't know.

1039
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,320
 - Yeah.

1040
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,800
 - This for you, by the way,

1041
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,640
 has to be a huge curve ball

1042
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,360
 because you've already volunteered to do something

1043
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,160
 maybe above and beyond at work.

1044
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,240
 And you've decided to, basically,

1045
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,420
 you decided to hop on the soldier grenade, so to speak.

1046
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,840
 You will be the front and back,

1047
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,260
 depending on how you're operating the room muscle

1048
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:28,960
 to basically keep awkward, bad conversations

1049
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,040
 from happening, right?

1050
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:33,120
 That's kind of like your MO.

1051
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,200
 - Yeah, yeah.

1052
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,040
 I'm just gonna--

1053
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,660
 - So that drop must have thrown you for a loop.

1054
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:39,500
 (laughing)

1055
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,920
 - Oh my God.

1056
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,560
 Yeah, because again, it's not my show.

1057
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,040
 I just wanted to be in the room.

1058
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:45,880
 (laughing)

1059
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:49,060
 And so I'm just kind of standing back in the corner,

1060
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:52,520
 looking stern, you know, all right, how are you people?

1061
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,360
 Are you gonna, you know, give my boss here, you know,

1062
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,200
 any trouble?

1063
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,020
 (laughing)

1064
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:57,860
 And then that happens, and I'm like--

1065
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:00,540
 - He's gonna give my boss any trouble, you eyeless freak.

1066
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:02,120
 (laughing)

1067
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:07,120
 - Well, 'cause he was in with another old group of people.

1068
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,080
 He didn't go through a lot.

1069
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:09,920
 - Oh no.

1070
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:10,760
 - It was even weirder, was it?

1071
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,800
 - He was in like a general admission group.

1072
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,120
 - Everyone else in the room said that looks like fun,

1073
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,720
 and they started throwing themselves on their backs,

1074
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,200
 hoping their eyes would pop out of their heads.

1075
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,360
 (laughing)

1076
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,520
 - And we're just like--

1077
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,320
 - Seven people died that day.

1078
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,480
 (laughing)

1079
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,600
 It's a real tragedy.

1080
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,880
 - It's like the '80s movie moment of I'll make sure

1081
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,960
 this person fits in, you know, like, hey guys,

1082
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,120
 I also felt my back and my eyeballs fell out.

1083
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,000
 (laughing)

1084
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,920
 - Throwing your eyes out of your head is the coolest.

1085
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,520
 (laughing)

1086
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,360
 - It's a customer service.

1087
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,200
 We're gonna make sure--

1088
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,040
 - It's not cool if you fall down,

1089
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,360
 your eyes pop out your head.

1090
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:46,000
 (laughing)

1091
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:46,840
 - That's right.

1092
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,760
 - Oh my God.

1093
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:49,760
 - So--

1094
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,840
 - So this is the show, quote unquote,

1095
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,160
 has not even begun yet.

1096
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,360
 - Oh, the show has begun.

1097
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:59,520
 - No, I think Chris got a line of dialogue out

1098
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,160
 before the thing fell back in time.

1099
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,920
 (laughing)

1100
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:07,920
 - And then he was just like,

1101
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,720
 'cause Chris, do you guys know Chris Brown?

1102
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,440
 Local Las Vegas actors worked with--

1103
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,400
 - Oh, I don't know if we know Chris, I don't know.

1104
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,240
 - I'm not sure.

1105
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,080
 - I think he--

1106
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:17,920
 - It works with--

1107
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,960
 - He put some work on Rihanna, is that right?

1108
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,920
 - No, different Chris Brown, Paul, different Chris Brown.

1109
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,760
 - Okay, okay, okay.

1110
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,920
 - I know, he did the Hamlet with Matt Morgan.

1111
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,800
 - Oh, I do know Chris, I know Chris.

1112
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:29,640
 - I know Chris.

1113
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,480
 - Yeah, yeah.

1114
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:36,440
 - So he was just, I know, you know,

1115
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:40,000
 waiting for things to get back to some semblance of normal,

1116
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,760
 and then he did probably the quickest version of that show.

1117
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,600
 - Right, it's the same, you have to,

1118
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:49,160
 this show resets like every 20 minutes, right?

1119
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,840
 Like you can just run people through it.

1120
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,680
 - It's an experience, yeah.

1121
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:53,520
 - Yeah, yeah.

1122
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,880
 - Every 10 minutes, there you go.

1123
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,720
 - So the show just resets and you do the same show

1124
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,920
 like many, many, many times during the day.

1125
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:04,040
 It's gotta be weird to do the show right after that show.

1126
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,640
 Like you have to, like, there must be like a weird thing

1127
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,320
 where you're just watching yourself perform

1128
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:12,680
 'cause you're like, I shouldn't be just doing another show.

1129
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:15,520
 I should be talking to a counselor or--

1130
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:19,760
 - There should be some on-hand counseling.

1131
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,520
 (laughing)

1132
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,680
 - You have suffered a traumatic event.

1133
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:28,360
 I will contact the eyes exploding out of the robots

1134
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,760
 and counselor for you.

1135
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:35,000
 - Oh my God, and so we sent the group to the next group.

1136
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,080
 - I'm around real girl accidents all the time.

1137
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,080
 Here's my card.

1138
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,600
 (laughing)

1139
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,080
 - She didn't land on you, did she?

1140
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,000
 - The door's shut, and again,

1141
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,200
 it's the end of Chris's ship,

1142
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,880
 so I was in there to bump him out.

1143
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:47,720
 - Oh, it's the end of his ship, all right.

1144
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,760
 - And he was just like, he was just like,

1145
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,000
 oh my God, the eyes, they pop.

1146
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,240
 And we just, we were both just like,

1147
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,800
 what were we supposed to do in that situation?

1148
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:59,080
 - Did he find the eyes?

1149
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,960
 - Oh yeah, yeah, they were, you know,

1150
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,680
 they're white and on a dark carpet, they were, yeah.

1151
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:07,000
 I mean, you can actually see them in that security video.

1152
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,240
 - And he just picked them up and pocketed them?

1153
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,080
 - Yeah.

1154
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:11,920
 - He didn't worry about putting them back

1155
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,160
 in her head at that point.

1156
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,320
 What do you think? - No, no, no, no.

1157
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:18,920
 - Is this a video that we can reasonably post

1158
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,520
 on our Patreon, do you think?

1159
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,360
 Do you think we can put it on our Patreon, I don't know.

1160
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,200
 I want people to see this video,

1161
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:29,520
 but I don't think we can like reasonably share it.

1162
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,560
 - I don't think we can put it out in the public,

1163
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:32,520
 that's for sure.

1164
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,160
 - Yeah, I don't think we put it out in the public.

1165
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,800
 I better go to the Patreon, yeah.

1166
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:36,640
 - Probably not.

1167
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,960
 - We've had the same conversation over, probably.

1168
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,560
 - I'm sure, yeah.

1169
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,400
 - It's like, what are we doing?

1170
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,240
 - Yeah, you guys have to sign favorite nations

1171
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,560
 to make sure you split whatever money you make

1172
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,120
 off of selling that video.

1173
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:46,960
 So, yeah.

1174
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,960
 So, yeah, it was, it was just wacky, and yeah.

1175
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,320
 Yeah, Kristen.

1176
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,760
 - I'll just tell you now, Scoops, you know,

1177
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,160
 we owe you high fives when we see you in person.

1178
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,560
 I have access to the video, okay?

1179
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,240
 So we can high five. - Oh, that's true.

1180
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:06,640
 That's true, when you see us in person,

1181
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:07,760
 ask us to see the video.

1182
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,600
 - Matt, he'll show you.

1183
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,800
 High five, and then we'll figure it out from there.

1184
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:16,200
 - Yeah, that's exactly it, here.

1185
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:19,200
 - I just sold five more tickets to Jokers of Magic

1186
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,880
 for people, just 'cause they're like, all right.

1187
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:21,720
 - Yeah, yeah.

1188
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:26,720
 - I was gonna go to Wabash, Indiana, but now, let's go.

1189
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,600
 - Let's hit it, we gotta see this video.

1190
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:32,600
 - Yeah, that's hilarious.

1191
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,600
 - There you have it, another wacky day at the old opera house.

1192
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,240
 - January 23rd, another wacky day at the old opera house.

1193
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,080
 I'll be there.

1194
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,280
 - Holy smokes.

1195
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,840
 Well, thank you so much for sharing

1196
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,120
 your inside scoop with us, for sure.

1197
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:48,120
 Did you have a company debriefing about this event?

1198
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:51,880
 - Everyone kept their underwear on at all times, Matt.

1199
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:55,720
 - No, but I mean, it might've been as a company

1200
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:59,480
 worth checking in, that's the only thing I'm like.

1201
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:04,320
 - Well, like I say, are you saying post?

1202
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,520
 - Yeah, three, he's saying, oh, post.

1203
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:07,360
 - No, no.

1204
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:12,240
 - We just, I mean, there wasn't a whole lot to do,

1205
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,040
 I mean, the guy apparently had a great time.

1206
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,520
 You know, he went to.

1207
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:19,040
 - Was there any word about the other people

1208
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:21,320
 who went in the experience with him?

1209
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:27,080
 - They, I don't know if they were friends or not,

1210
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:30,080
 but they thought it was interesting.

1211
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,080
 - Featured on a bug for the ticket value?

1212
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:39,600
 - I will say those people probably got a much different show

1213
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,040
 than most people did.

1214
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:45,640
 I know that the guy at the end playing the unseen,

1215
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:47,440
 he goes, all right, everybody, let's move.

1216
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,640
 You pick up that sex doll and let's go.

1217
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:52,520
 (all laughing)

1218
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,920
 - Did any of the characters have to talk to the doll

1219
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,200
 like it was a person?

1220
01:03:56,200 --> 01:04:01,280
 - He, yeah, and he would do things like,

1221
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,440
 like, yeah, this is the blah, blah, blah.

1222
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,280
 Oh, she says, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1223
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:09,320
 - Oh, no.

1224
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:10,160
 - Oh, does she?

1225
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,600
 - She is what I would yell as the character.

1226
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,440
 (all laughing)

1227
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,280
 - Oh, does she?

1228
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,640
 - Oh, does she now?

1229
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,280
 (all laughing)

1230
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:20,880
 - I'm about tired of you speaking for that woman.

1231
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,040
 I want to hear from her, sir.

1232
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,240
 - Let her talk for herself.

1233
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,400
 - I'm concerned for her safety.

1234
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,240
 - Oh, my God.

1235
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,680
 (all laughing)

1236
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:31,200
 - I mean, she's already had her eye popped out.

1237
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,000
 - You've already popped her eyeballs out, sir.

1238
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,640
 - You, sir, have disqualified yourself

1239
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,920
 as a proper custodian for this maiden.

1240
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:41,520
 (all laughing)

1241
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:45,280
 - I will be taking over custodianship.

1242
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,440
 - Unhand her this instant.

1243
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,560
 - Oh, my God.

1244
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:49,400
 - That's it.

1245
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,240
 (all laughing)

1246
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,600
 - I demand satisfaction.

1247
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:57,040
 - Preposterous, preposterous.

1248
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:59,760
 - Whatever Britney Spears' dad's thing was with her,

1249
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,480
 that's what I've got with that doll now.

1250
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,680
 I'm going to take care of her.

1251
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,120
 I can give her a better life.

1252
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:08,640
 - What's a shame now is simply that you've peaked, right?

1253
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:09,600
 Like, this is it.

1254
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,960
 There's no other story coming down the pipe

1255
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:15,120
 that's going to be like, and then this other time,

1256
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:18,120
 like you're done now with stories from work.

1257
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:22,040
 - Yeah, yeah, that's, that's, that is, that's true.

1258
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:23,600
 All the celebrity appearances.

1259
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,200
 - Yeah, you have to go to all the other ones first

1260
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,680
 and just keep hanging that one back

1261
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:27,920
 until someone really pushes.

1262
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,840
 - I just can't get over him fucking carrying the damn thing.

1263
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,760
 Like, put it in a wheelchair.

1264
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:36,160
 - That, that, I mean, the eyes popping out was just,

1265
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,040
 oh, my God, what do we do?

1266
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,840
 Him hoisting her up and then waddling back

1267
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,560
 and forth between the rooms.

1268
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:46,480
 That, that almost broke me right there.

1269
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,640
 I was like, close those doors, close those doors.

1270
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:54,440
 - No, I find the writing to be the Herculean effort here.

1271
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:57,160
 I don't, I sure, you waddle around a hundred pound weight.

1272
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:02,000
 It is the constant fabricating of dialogue in your head

1273
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,400
 that you are translating to everyone else in the room.

1274
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,680
 That to me feels exhausting.

1275
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,760
 - Doing some work, man, doing some work.

1276
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:13,560
 - Yeah, and like I said, the gentleman was not a young man.

1277
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:16,080
 So I guess he's getting his cardio in.

1278
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,400
 - Young man can't afford those things.

1279
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,960
 - That's true too.

1280
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,560
 That's true too.

1281
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,880
 Young man can only afford the torso.

1282
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,480
 - Yes.

1283
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:30,560
 - Did you get a whiff of any thing?

1284
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:31,400
 - What?

1285
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,320
 - Whiff?

1286
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:34,520
 Whatever do you mean, Paul?

1287
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,840
 Did it smell like anything?

1288
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,840
 - The smell had just been fucked a bunch of times?

1289
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:39,680
 Is that what you're asking?

1290
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,080
 - I didn't say that.

1291
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,960
 - Then what else could you be asking?

1292
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,840
 Did he like shove soup down his throat?

1293
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:46,400
 Like, what are you talking about?

1294
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,120
 - Oh, I don't know.

1295
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,640
 - It smelled like soup.

1296
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,680
 - Give her a little shot of Chanel or something.

1297
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:52,520
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1298
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:53,600
 He probably had a smell.

1299
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:54,440
 It smelled like soup.

1300
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:55,280
 - Meat bath?

1301
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,600
 - If it smells like soup, I'm calling the authorities.

1302
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,200
 (laughing)

1303
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,760
 I'm not saying that, that doll is clearly--

1304
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,160
 - What is that, Campbell's?

1305
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,760
 - That doll is clearly leaking cream of mushroom.

1306
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,680
 Get the cops in here right now.

1307
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:08,880
 This is disgusting.

1308
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,800
 (laughing)

1309
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,440
 Oh my God, would it be too much

1310
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,720
 if she's leaking cream of mushroom down her leg

1311
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:18,800
 and he's like, "Oh, menses, what are you gonna do?"

1312
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,040
 (laughing)

1313
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:25,760
 - Oh, I don't like having Professor Biggs on here anymore.

1314
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,240
 (laughing)

1315
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:29,520
 - It's her time of the month,

1316
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,200
 but my time of the mouth as he slurps it up.

1317
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:35,400
 (laughing)

1318
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:39,800
 - It's sure, he's basically a walking lunchable.

1319
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:40,640
 He keeps--

1320
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,960
 - Sir, that clearly has not been cooked.

1321
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,920
 - He keeps his snacks in there.

1322
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,920
 - That is clearly raw cream of mushroom soup, sir.

1323
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,560
 - Look, it's-- - Please don't eat that.

1324
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:49,880
 - It's human grade.

1325
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,840
 (laughing)

1326
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:52,680
 It's fine.

1327
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:59,080
 - Professor Biggs, where can people hear more stories

1328
01:07:59,080 --> 01:07:59,920
 from you?

1329
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:04,120
 - They can hear them on the Fabulous Geek Shock podcast

1330
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:07,440
 at geekshockpodcast.com, or just Geek Shock.

1331
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:11,400
 We actually were able to finally get the geekshock.com.

1332
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,400
 - Just took a decade, a little more than a decade.

1333
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,840
 Finally got it all cleaned up.

1334
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:18,680
 - Yeah, it's fantastic. - Oh my God.

1335
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:22,400
 - Anything worth doing is worth taking 10 years to do it.

1336
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,600
 - Yeah, well, somebody was sitting on it,

1337
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:28,000
 is what the deal was, and we were talking about it,

1338
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,880
 and we just, on a spur of the moment,

1339
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,480
 I wonder if that guy's still sitting on,

1340
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,640
 hey, guys, it's free, click.

1341
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,680
 - Nice, nice.

1342
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,360
 - I have a friend sitting, a guy sitting on

1343
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:41,560
 great eyeballs of fire, is just sitting there,

1344
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:44,440
 and I can't wait for them to just

1345
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:47,040
 sell it to me at a decent price.

1346
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,560
 - I got someone sitting on cream of mushroom cooch,

1347
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,920
 and I don't know what I'm gonna do until I get it.

1348
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,320
 - And it is leaking out.

1349
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,560
 (laughing)

1350
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,800
 - Oh, I really wish she would stand up.

1351
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,560
 - No, it's not the episode title.

1352
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,720
 - Cream of mushroom cooch is not the episode title.

1353
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:02,560
 (laughing)

1354
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:03,880
 - Oh, I begged to differ.

1355
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:08,360
 - Oh, and Paul, you'll be happy to know that

1356
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:11,640
 I have been carrying on the legacy of

1357
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:14,400
 our own versions of situational awareness.

1358
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,520
 - Oh, great, fantastic.

1359
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:17,360
 - We're good heroes.

1360
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:19,440
 - We've had a couple of initiatives.

1361
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:20,640
 - The Lord's work.

1362
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,400
 - I think we all caught something at the experience

1363
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:26,400
 that just occasionally gets us, that's all there is to it.

1364
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:27,240
 - Yeah.

1365
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,320
 - Space herpes, space herpes.

1366
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:31,880
 - Yes, that's right.

1367
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,200
 - Shit.

1368
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,520
 - Well, thanks, Professor.

1369
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:35,920
 - Biggs, great to see you, man.

1370
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:36,760
 Thanks for coming on, man.

1371
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:38,000
 - Yeah, you guys.

1372
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,400
 - Thank you, pal. - Have fun.

1373
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,240
 - Yeah, yeah.

1374
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:41,080
 - Thanks, buddy.

1375
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,360
 - Good Lord.

1376
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:43,200
 - All right.

1377
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,200
 - Let's do a little jock versus nerd.

1378
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:48,360
 (audience cheering)

1379
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:51,360
 - Ladies and gentlemen, it is time.

1380
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:58,600
 (upbeat rock music)

1381
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,600
 Time for jock versus nerd.

1382
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:13,120
 - Explosion of cream of mushroom soup.

1383
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,800
 (laughing)

1384
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,760
 - I'm pretty sure it's wrong.

1385
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,280
 - Call the cops.

1386
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:19,120
 - Call the cops.

1387
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,520
 (laughing)

1388
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:22,800
 I'm just upset now.

1389
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,440
 (laughing)

1390
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:25,880
 - We got a scooper to come and do this today

1391
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:27,240
 from Swedish Scoop.

1392
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:30,960
 The categories are retro dances, phone numbers,

1393
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,680
 penile slang, and Beatles.

1394
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:34,840
 Paul, you're up first.

1395
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:35,680
 What you want?

1396
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:38,720
 - Give me that 2,000 penile slang, please.

1397
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:41,640
 - I'll give you that 2,000 penile slang for sure.

1398
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:44,880
 A British term for a stupid or contemptible person.

1399
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,440
 This is really just the tip.

1400
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:50,040
 - A knob end.

1401
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,520
 - A knob end?

1402
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:52,520
 A bell end.

1403
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:53,360
 - Bell end.

1404
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,040
 - Oh, come on.

1405
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:55,880
 - Oh.

1406
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:56,720
 - Come on.

1407
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:57,760
 - Aren't you a bell end.

1408
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,080
 - Oh my God.

1409
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,800
 Oh, I got smacked.

1410
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,520
 - It's me, I'll do retro dances for 400.

1411
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:07,520
 Chubby Checker taught us to do this dance

1412
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,040
 before doing it again the very next year.

1413
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:10,880
 - Yeah.

1414
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,040
 (laughing)

1415
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,240
 - I believe that was the twist.

1416
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,080
 - That was the twist.

1417
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:14,920
 Let's do it again.

1418
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:16,800
 - You did it again like you did last summer.

1419
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,320
 - That's twist again.

1420
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,240
 I need another hit song.

1421
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:26,240
 - I will do a penile slang for 400.

1422
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:32,720
 - Oh, I'd love to be an Oscar Meyer this.

1423
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:33,560
 - Mascot.

1424
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:36,840
 Weiner.

1425
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:37,680
 - Truck driver.

1426
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,360
 - Weiner.

1427
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,440
 - Paul.

1428
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:44,520
 - Penile slang for 1,200.

1429
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:46,480
 - Sure, why not?

1430
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:51,360
 - Gallus dominescus is one of the most common and most,

1431
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,440
 domesticus is one of the most common

1432
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,520
 and most tasty birds in the world.

1433
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,680
 The male is often called this.

1434
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:01,080
 - A cock.

1435
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,920
 - It's a cock.

1436
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,480
 - Cock is right.

1437
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:07,320
 - Rock out.

1438
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,160
 - Cock of the block.

1439
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:09,480
 - Cock of the block.

1440
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:12,440
 - I'll do penile slang for 800.

1441
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:15,680
 I swear it isn't schlort.

1442
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:18,360
 It is slightly above schlaverage.

1443
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,360
 You could even say it is this.

1444
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:22,040
 - That's a good one.

1445
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,440
 - Oh, well I have schlong.

1446
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,280
 - That's a good one.

1447
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:25,120
 - Schlong.

1448
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:25,960
 - I do like that one.

1449
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,880
 - Schlong, schlong.

1450
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:30,360
 Nicely done with the word play on that one.

1451
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,120
 - Matt, you're up.

1452
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,960
 - Penile slang, please.

1453
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:36,960
 - You dick.

1454
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,240
 - Well, make something up.

1455
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:42,800
 I'll do retro dances, 800.

1456
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,880
 Domo arigato as you do this stilted dance,

1457
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,960
 a sub-genre of popping.

1458
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,480
 - The robot.

1459
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:53,680
 - The robot.

1460
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:56,360
 - A classic.

1461
01:12:56,360 --> 01:13:01,120
 - Beatles for 400.

1462
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:05,600
 - This Beatles supposedly died in 1966

1463
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,520
 and was replaced with a lookalike

1464
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,640
 with the band dropping clues in later releases.

1465
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,600
 - Oh, it's pole, don't you know?

1466
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:13,440
 - Pole.

1467
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:15,600
 - Nope.

1468
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,000
 - This is the old dead man.

1469
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,640
 - It's me, phone numbers, 400.

1470
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,480
 Daily double.

1471
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,960
 Now for 1200.

1472
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:30,360
 Tommy Two-Tone told us to call Jenny at this number.

1473
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:35,480
 - Come on.

1474
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:39,760
 - 8675309.

1475
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:40,600
 - That's right.

1476
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:42,520
 - Yeah.

1477
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,560
 - The fact is a lot of people,

1478
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:47,520
 maybe of our generation and older,

1479
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,960
 will use that as their supermarket codes,

1480
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:51,800
 things like that,

1481
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,040
 'cause they don't want to go with their real phone number.

1482
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:53,880
 - Oh really?

1483
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:54,720
 - And so oftentimes, if you're traveling--

1484
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:55,560
 - Oh!

1485
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:56,400
 - If you're traveling and--

1486
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,240
 - You're just gonna discount, just use that?

1487
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,080
 - They want to discount the supermarket,

1488
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,360
 you can use that number.

1489
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:03,160
 - Just put in the local area code and that phone number.

1490
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,000
 - Yeah, local area code and that number, yeah.

1491
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,040
 - There you go.

1492
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,480
 - All right, Matt, you're up.

1493
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,440
 - What a valuable tip.

1494
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,440
 - Penile slang, please.

1495
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:11,280
 - Penile slang.

1496
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,120
 - You cock.

1497
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,400
 (laughing)

1498
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,200
 - I'll do--

1499
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,040
 - Mushroom soup tip.

1500
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:21,320
 - I'll do beetles for 800, please.

1501
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:27,280
 - Ringo Starr replaced this original drummer in 1962.

1502
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:28,920
 - Tommy Smothers.

1503
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:29,760
 - That's us.

1504
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,600
 - Smothers.

1505
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:33,360
 - What was his name?

1506
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,880
 I've got, that is the question, I know, I know.

1507
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,800
 - Literally, the question.

1508
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,920
 - Oh man, fuck both my eyeballs.

1509
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:42,080
 What is the name?

1510
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:48,360
 - Todd Glass, Pete Best.

1511
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:52,600
 - Pete Best?

1512
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,080
 - Yeah.

1513
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,960
 - That's it, Pete Best.

1514
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:56,800
 - Pete Best.

1515
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:00,560
 - Shout out to Ravi for the clues in the chat.

1516
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,200
 - Oh nice, Paul, you're up.

1517
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:09,200
 - I will go, phone numbers for 2000, I'm shooting the moon.

1518
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,320
 - Oh no.

1519
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:14,080
 - Sir Mix-A-Lot told us if the butt is round

1520
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,480
 and you want a triple X throw down,

1521
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:19,440
 dial this and kick them nasty thoughts.

1522
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:22,560
 - Not 1-900-Mix-A-Lot, kick them nasty thoughts.

1523
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:25,400
 - 1-900-Mix-A-Lot, I can't believe

1524
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:26,960
 that was the $2,000 question, though.

1525
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:27,800
 - Oh my god.

1526
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:28,640
 - Believe it.

1527
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:31,240
 - Someone call the cops, the moon just got shot.

1528
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:33,480
 (laughing)

1529
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:36,120
 - Fuck the moon.

1530
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:39,440
 - I'll drop phone numbers for 1200.

1531
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:43,080
 - Call Whitehall 1212 if you need

1532
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,920
 the London Metropolitan Police, better known by this name,

1533
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,760
 it's also the location of its headquarters.

1534
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:49,600
 - Mmm.

1535
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:56,200
 - The, what are they called?

1536
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,080
 - Scotland Yard. - Ghostbusters.

1537
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:01,280
 Or Paul can just give you the answer, that helps.

1538
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:02,120
 - Right.

1539
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:04,360
 (laughing)

1540
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:10,600
 - Thank you for the hint, Paul.

1541
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:11,440
 - Scotland Yard.

1542
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,680
 (laughing)

1543
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:19,400
 - I was trying to get the Bobbies

1544
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,680
 and then figure out Scotland Yard from there.

1545
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,960
 I was still two steps away from Scotland Yard.

1546
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:26,680
 - Whatever, if Paul's playing Lifeline, I'm in, let's go.

1547
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:27,520
 - Yeah, right?

1548
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,760
 (laughing)

1549
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:33,520
 - I will do retro dances for 1200.

1550
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:36,240
 - Daily Double.

1551
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:37,840
 - Badoo, badoo, badoo, badoo, do, do, do.

1552
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,920
 - Now it's for 2,000.

1553
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,800
 - This hip hop dance shares a name

1554
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:45,000
 with a hugely popular '80s doll.

1555
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:45,960
 - Paul, what is it?

1556
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:50,240
 - Well, it grows in a garden.

1557
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:51,080
 - Okay.

1558
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:55,160
 The carrot dance. - Grows in the sun.

1559
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:59,480
 - You get real stiff and orange.

1560
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:00,920
 - This would be the Cabbage Patch.

1561
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:01,760
 - There it is.

1562
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,280
 - The Cabbage Patch, absolutely.

1563
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:05,600
 - Yeah.

1564
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:06,440
 - Paul.

1565
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:11,160
 - I'm gonna do the Beatles for 2,000, shoot the moon.

1566
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:12,440
 - We're gonna do the Beatles for 2,000.

1567
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,000
 Nobody help Paul.

1568
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,680
 Paul can't get any clues at all.

1569
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,200
 - That's fine.

1570
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,320
 - On the cover of Abbey Road,

1571
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:23,280
 this Beatle is the first in line and wearing a white suit.

1572
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,680
 - Pete Best.

1573
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:25,960
 - It's gotta be John.

1574
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:30,280
 - John is correct.

1575
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,960
 - You know, I'm going across the road first.

1576
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:34,040
 I didn't want to get hit by a car.

1577
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:36,120
 (laughing)

1578
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:38,120
 - He was always safety conscious that John was.

1579
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:38,960
 - We didn't close the road.

1580
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,720
 We just took the picture, you know.

1581
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:43,040
 - Oh, let's see.

1582
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,840
 Score check with three questions left.

1583
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:46,680
 Matt is winning with 4,000.

1584
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:49,400
 Paul and I are both on his heels with 3,600.

1585
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,760
 - It's anyone's game.

1586
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:51,920
 - It is anyone's game.

1587
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:55,040
 We got phone numbers, retro dances, and Beatles.

1588
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,000
 I guess I'm gonna go retro dances

1589
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,520
 and get the $2,000 question.

1590
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:59,360
 - Shoot the moon.

1591
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:00,200
 - Nervous about it.

1592
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:01,520
 I'm shooting the moon.

1593
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,080
 This '60s dance, popularized by James Brown,

1594
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:07,440
 is more than a gravy-soaked Thanksgiving side.

1595
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:10,280
 Dressing.

1596
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:12,120
 - Do the dressing.

1597
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,280
 - It is, of course, the dressing.

1598
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:16,240
 - And you might put it in clothes

1599
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:18,880
 and turn into the side and look at yourself in the mirror.

1600
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:22,080
 - He did the sweet potato.

1601
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,160
 He did the sweet potato stuffing.

1602
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:27,240
 - The corned hash.

1603
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:30,320
 The green bean casserole, as everyone knows.

1604
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,880
 - I can casserole.

1605
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,120
 - Papa's got a great new casserole.

1606
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:38,800
 - I'm gonna do the pumpkin pie.

1607
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:39,640
 Here we go.

1608
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,800
 - If you soak your pumpkin pie in gravy,

1609
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,360
 we gonna have words.

1610
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:44,200
 - Oh, it's so good.

1611
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,560
 - We gonna have good words.

1612
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,400
 - It's so good.

1613
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,080
 - Nasty, nasty, nasty.

1614
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:50,880
 - Gravy makes everything better.

1615
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,440
 - I got permission to take a gravy-covered pumpkin pie

1616
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:55,160
 to the John Wick experience.

1617
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:58,780
 - Don't drop it.

1618
01:18:58,780 --> 01:18:59,620
 The gravy's gonna go flying out.

1619
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:01,480
 - You don't wanna know what's gonna pop out of that thing.

1620
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:02,560
 - Oh, Jesus.

1621
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:05,520
 - It's the mashed potato.

1622
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:06,960
 - Do the mashed potato.

1623
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,680
 - I don't know what is the actual move though.

1624
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:10,080
 What's the actual, I don't know the actual move

1625
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:10,920
 of the mashed potato.

1626
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,320
 - I think it's where you got two fists

1627
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,400
 and you pump them up and down.

1628
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,240
 - I only know that because of the scene

1629
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:19,120
 in the Blues Brothers at the,

1630
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:23,880
 oh, Ray Charles' song at the music store.

1631
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:26,120
 They do the mashed potato and that.

1632
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:27,560
 Yeah.

1633
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,800
 Matt, you got phone numbers or Beatles?

1634
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:32,120
 - I need both questions to catch you.

1635
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:34,600
 So I will take both questions, please.

1636
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:35,480
 - Oh, boy.

1637
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:36,320
 Good call.

1638
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:37,160
 - Beatles' phone numbers.

1639
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,000
 - Smart strategy.

1640
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,440
 - What is Paul McCartney's phone number?

1641
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:41,520
 - Damn it.

1642
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,360
 Pass.

1643
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:44,200
 - I will do,

1644
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,400
 - Eight, six, seven, five, three, oh, nine.

1645
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:46,240
 - Beatles 1200.

1646
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:47,680
 - It's two, two, two, two.

1647
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:51,080
 - This TV presenter introduced the band

1648
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:54,280
 in their really big shoe at Shea Stadium

1649
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:57,160
 after they appeared on his long running TV show

1650
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:58,920
 a year earlier.

1651
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,800
 - That would be Chubby Checker.

1652
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,720
 - No, Chubby Checker.

1653
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:05,920
 - Dick Clark's Rocking Stadium Concert.

1654
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:09,160
 - Dick Clark's Rockin' Stadium Eve.

1655
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:11,480
 - That would be Ed Sullivan.

1656
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,600
 - Ed Sullivan, of course.

1657
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,000
 - Charges really big shoe.

1658
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,480
 - And Paul closing out the category

1659
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,560
 and the game phone numbers for 800.

1660
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:24,960
 Call 588-2300 to reach this company

1661
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,920
 if you wanna lay down some carpet.

1662
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:28,480
 - Empire.

1663
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,800
 - Empire Carpet is correct.

1664
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,480
 And that is the game.

1665
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:37,800
 Oh shit, I win with 5600 points.

1666
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,240
 Matt is in second with 5200.

1667
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:42,440
 I definitely wasn't looking at that the whole time.

1668
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:44,160
 Matt's in second with 5200.

1669
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:46,080
 Paul's in third with 4400.

1670
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,440
 That's from the Swedish Scoop.

1671
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:48,280
 Thank you, Swedish Scoop.

1672
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:49,120
 That was a fun one.

1673
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:49,960
 - Thank you, Swedish Scoop.

1674
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,160
 That was a very fine scooperty.

1675
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,720
 - We haven't done that well collectively

1676
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:54,000
 on a scooperty in a while.

1677
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,880
 - No, that was really nice.

1678
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:58,080
 I even lost a 2000 point question

1679
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,200
 and still came up in the pluses.

1680
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:01,040
 - Yeah, right?

1681
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,080
 - That's crazy.

1682
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,520
 - If you wanna send us a scooperty

1683
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,280
 or a Price is Right jock versus nerd

1684
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,000
 or an obelisk jock versus nerd,

01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,720

 Check it out.

1691
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,480
 - I wanna thank Annie for all of her years

1692
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,320
 of helping us out on this podcast.

1693
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:23,720
 - Thank you, Annie.

1694
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:24,560
 We love you.

1695
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:27,400
 You've helped us out so much over the years.

1696
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:30,600
 I truly don't think we would,

1697
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,040
 we definitely wouldn't be what we are,

1698
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:37,040
 and we would not be anything close to what we do

1699
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:40,880
 on the Patreon side without having had Annie

1700
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,640
 in our lives for all these years.

1701
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:43,800
 So thank you so much.

1702
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,840
 - I wanna thank Penn for creating this podcast.

1703
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,640
 Penn, you've done far less than Annie

1704
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:49,520
 in terms of doing anything for this pod.

1705
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,240
 I mean, really, just not pulling your weight.

1706
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:55,080
 - I think we might've done less for this pod than Annie

1707
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:57,200
 now that I'm thinking about it.

1708
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:59,720
 I wanna thank all the people who support us

1709
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:01,400
 on our Patreon page.

1710
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,760
 It is indeed a new month.

1711
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:04,600
 Or did you send us?

1712
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,400
 It is a new month, and we're trying to figure out

1713
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,480
 who's gonna do Annie's job.

1714
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:08,840
 So we don't have the list, guys.

1715
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,160
 We just don't have it.

1716
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,000
 - We just don't have it.

1717
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,440
 - I do have a text here from FedEx.

1718
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:14,520
 My cat food is coming.

1719
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,720
 But that's not gonna help this podcast at all.

1720
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:19,200
 I wanna thank all the people who do support us

1721
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,000
 on our Patreon page at all the different tiers.

1722
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,520
 We really appreciate it.

1723
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:23,840
 This is normally the part where we thank people

1724
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:28,080
 at a certain tier and higher by name or by scoop name.

1725
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,640

 - That's fartsinabag.biz.

1738

 That along with preachingfun.com,

1739
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,560
 it does take you over to our Patreon page

1740
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:13,320
 where for as little as $3 a month,

1741
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:14,880
 you can help keep this show on the air.

1742
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,360
 We are dependent on our Patreon supporters.

1743
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:20,080
 So please, if you think this show is worth more than $0,

1744
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:22,840
 fartsinabag.biz, preachingfun.com,

1745
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:24,280
 that's where you can go to show it.

1746
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:25,520
 You can do monthly subscriptions,

1747
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:26,780
 you can do yearly subscriptions

1748
01:23:26,780 --> 01:23:27,840
 and save a little bit of money,

1749
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,280
 and you can gift subscriptions to other people.

1750
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:33,320
 I still really like the idea of obfuscating people

1751
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:36,320
 via gifting them a Patreon subscription to this show.

1752
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,800
 - Yeah, they don't even have to ever know

1753
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:39,720
 that they're a Patreon if they don't want to.

1754
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:40,920
 (laughing)

1755
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:42,640
 You could just sign up your email.

1756
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:43,480
 - That just seems wasteful.

1757
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:44,800
 - That's fine, who cares?

1758
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:48,520
 But it really does make a huge difference for us

1759
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:51,760
 in our bottom line, and look how close we are

1760
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,540
 to bonus episode territory.

1761
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:54,880
 We could get that in February

1762
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,360
 if we just have a few more people joining us

1763
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,120
 to the Obelisk Scheme.

1764
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:02,000
 Remember, if you don't have the current funds

1765
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,080
 or availability to jump on our Patreon right now,

1766
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:08,060
 you can participate in the Obelisk Scheme.

1767
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:10,680
 It's as easy as one, two, three, look around the room,

1768
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:13,780
 find someone who you think shares your sensibilities

1769
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:15,480
 or might find this podcast

1770
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:19,000
 in the least bit entertaining and educational or funny,

1771
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,640
 and point them to our URLs.

1772
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:24,960
 Get them listening to Ice Cream Social.

1773
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,520
 Just one person though, just one.

1774
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,680
 It's not a pyramid scheme, it is an Obelisk Scheme.

1775
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:33,680
 So just find one person, and again, I've said it before,

1776
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:35,240
 I will say it once more.

1777
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:39,280
 If everyone within the sound of my voice right now

1778
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:44,000
 would simply get one more person to listen to this podcast,

1779
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,440
 we could almost double our audience.

1780
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:48,280
 - That's just.

1781
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:51,040
 (dramatic music)

1782
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,600
 - Math.

1783
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:54,760
 - Math. - All right.

1784
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:57,760
 - My dreaded and sworn enemy.

1785
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,920
 (laughing)

1786
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:01,920
 - Thanks for listening everybody.
