1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,060
 - Oh, hello there, I am so glad you're here

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,380
 because I would like to thank the ice cream truck drivers.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,460
 Thank you so much ice cream truck drivers.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,940
 Right now I'd like to thank Fifi, Frankie's Tiki Scoop,

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,700
 Galactic President Scooperstar McScoops-A-Lot,

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,180
 Ice Blue Scoop, I Wanna Scoop Baby,

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,900
 and Jacob Dinkalager.

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,740
 If you wanna be an ice cream truck driver

10
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,860
 just like these fine folks, and I hope you do,

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,140
 PreachingFun.com is where you can go, PreachingFun.com,

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,060
 right over there.

13
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,380
 You can sign up to be an ice cream truck driver,

14
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:38,380
 and who knows, the life you save may be your own.

15
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:43,220
 And now, a program.

16
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,900
 - Hey Johnny, do you wanna go to an ice cream social?

17
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,300
 - Yeah, I'd love to.

18
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,940
 - Great, let's go.

19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,260
 (upbeat music)

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,540
 - We had a party at the house last night.

21
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,380
 I stayed up too late.

22
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,220
 - Oh no.

23
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,820
 - Too late, I say.

24
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,860
 - Were you drinking?

25
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,660
 - Sure.

26
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,740
 - You were drinking, that's what's really funny.

27
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,340
 - Of course I was.

28
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,740
 - It's time for Matt and Mattingly's ice cream social.

29
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,820
 Sitting in Las Vegas, it's Matt Donnelly.

30
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,260
 Sitting in Pittsburgh, PA, that's Paul Mattingly.

31
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,700
 Also sitting in Las Vegas, it's me, Jacob the Audio Guy.

32
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,100
 We're PreachingFun.

33
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,820
 - We sure are, yee-haw.

34
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,020
 Well I did it, guys.

35
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,860
 I taught my first improv class in a long time.

36
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,700
 - Woo!

37
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,140
 - Well I've been teaching other improv classes,

38
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,940
 but this was my first structured improv class in a long time

39
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,180
 where I'm having the same students over and over again.

40
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,020
 I got 12.

41
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,060
 - The second woo was for the structure,

42
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,220
 not for the improv class.

43
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,340
 - 12 wonderful students.

44
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,300
 - You got a good structure.

45
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,220
 - And I gotta say, I'm a little apprehensive

46
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,660
 'cause of course at the end of class,

47
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,860
 what do you think I did?

48
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,060
 I obelisked all of 'em.

49
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,700
 I gave everybody a chip.

50
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,540
 So you know.

51
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,580
 - Give everybody a chip.

52
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,900
 - I'm either gonna have some people coming back being like,

53
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,900
 oh wow, Paul, okay.

54
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,620
 Or people are like, who am I learning from?

55
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,460
 Good God.

56
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,300
 (laughing)

57
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,500
 So anyway, yeah.

58
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,260
 I took the gamble. - Hello, students.

59
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,100
 You fools.

60
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,940
 (laughing)

61
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,660
 Hello, Paul students.

62
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,500
 - Exactly.

63
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,860
 I took the gamble and we'll see.

64
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,180
 But big thanks again to Justin

65
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,220
 for getting things cooking again with Skit

66
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,340
 and for giving me the opportunity to teach.

67
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,100
 I'm really, really excited. - Love of the game.

68
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,300
 - Yeah, and no, it's gonna be really good.

69
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,500
 - More good stuff happening.

70
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,820
 - If you haven't figured it out,

71
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,780
 Justin Zell's not in it for the money.

72
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,700
 I don't know if you have to figure that out yet.

73
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,820
 - Or if he is, he's bad at it.

74
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,700
 - Well, no, and you know what?

75
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,180
 Well, the other thing is too, neither am I.

76
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,140
 I mean, you're not teaching improv to make,

77
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:47,140
 but it is helping me do less target work, which is great.

78
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,460
 - That's exactly it.

79
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,980
 That's exactly it.

80
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,820
 - Yeah.

81
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,540
 - One less day of working at a target.

82
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,620
 - That is precisely it.

83
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,340
 I have cut back to basically three days a week now

84
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,480
 and it's gonna save my ass 'cause, oh man.

85
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,940
 Oh, cash grab Mattingly.

86
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,500
 That's right, Rich, too. - That's good.

87
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,220
 I don't want you walking around Target too much

88
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,740
 because I don't want that sweet, sweet derriere to fade away.

89
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,900
 - I mean, it's true.

90
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,940
 The words of-- - You gotta keep them cakes, baby.

91
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,660
 - The words of Sir Mix-A-Lot ring in my ears every day,

92
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,940
 especially days like today

93
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,740
 when I'm slurping on a little chocolate milkshake.

94
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,980
 I don't want none. - You can do side bans

95
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,420
 or sit-ups, but please don't lose that butt.

96
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,700
 - Oh, trust, trust.

97
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,780
 This shelf is firmly intact.

98
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,820
 This shelf is here, baby.

99
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,260
 Yeah.

100
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,580
 - Matt Donnelly, you're back on dry land.

101
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,340
 - Yeah, man, yes.

102
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,700
 Yeah, I'm sorry that I cannot attend your party,

103
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,620
 but literally I haven't been home in a month,

104
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,460
 so it was like--

105
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,540
 - Oh, SJ was like, I sent Matt and Sara a text

106
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,380
 about the party.

107
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,460
 I didn't hear back from them.

108
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,580
 I didn't say anything to her,

109
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,700
 but I was like, they are not coming.

110
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,540
 (laughing)

111
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,260
 - I think Matt is back on land.

112
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,220
 They're not coming to our house.

113
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,780
 - No, no, no, we're very happy.

114
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,100
 Two nights in a row, got to have all four of us home

115
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,460
 with our children, and then of course, yeah,

116
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,900
 I was on full soccer dad duties last night,

117
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,060
 which took me around town or whatever, but yeah.

118
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,540
 - How are the boys?

119
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,740
 Did you notice any changes since you were gone?

120
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,100
 - Uh, yes, yeah, yeah.

121
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,540
 - Have they gotten employment?

122
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,380
 - Yeah.

123
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,420
 - Lots of six, seven?

124
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,860
 - Oh, so yeah, so I was in the car with my oldest

125
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,180
 and somebody that goes to school with, driving them home.

126
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,860
 And I told them, I was like, you know, my son now,

127
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,700
 my oldest son now goes to performing arts middle school.

128
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,500
 So that means I'm probably gonna play improv games.

129
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,700
 - That's awesome.

130
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,540
 - Totally.

131
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,180
 And so we were comparing, 'cause I just went home for,

132
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,420
 the last thing I did was I did my improv jam room,

133
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,300
 which I want to talk a lot about on the show.

134
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,620
 - Yeah.

135
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,940
 - But we were going over improv games,

136
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,340
 and I said, yeah, these are games I started playing

137
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,460
 when I was like 16, 17 years old.

138
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,780
 And they started laughing.

139
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,900
 (laughing)

140
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,100
 And I said, wait, 16, 17 counts as six, seven?

141
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,940
 - Ah.

142
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,460
 - Oh, did they get called out?

143
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,420
 Didn't they were like, oh.

144
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,340
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, they were laughing, yeah, yeah, yeah.

145
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,180
 - Good, good, good.

146
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,300
 - No, no, they're not subtle about it.

147
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,020
 Like we were driving the car and my kid is like,

148
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,860
 perfect time.

149
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,380
 And I look and it says six, oh, seven on the dash.

150
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,460
 (laughing)

151
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,780
 Like it's not subtle.

152
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,860
 - No, it's everywhere.

153
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,860
 It's everywhere.

154
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,700
 - Yeah, yeah.

155
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,540
 - Craziness.

156
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,420
 - The new South Park is all of it.

157
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,260
 - All six, seven.

158
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,460
 - People know that it means nothing.

159
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,300
 - Yeah.

160
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,140
 - Right.

161
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:20,980
 - Right, yeah, it's just gibberish.

162
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,820
 It's just gibberish, yeah.

163
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,540
 - They know that like it just happened to be in a song

164
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,020
 and then some guy did it on a TikTok

165
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,660
 and it's all out there.

166
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,500
 - Yeah, it's just in there.

167
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,860
 - And it vaguely annoyed some of their parents.

168
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,700
 - Yeah.

169
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,180
 - Yeah, yeah.

170
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,700
 - So yeah, but I went--

171
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,540
 - Theotic clumsy.

172
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,540
 They were just laughing at the idea of you being young.

173
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,020
 - Yes, that part is definitely true.

174
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,340
 (laughing)

175
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,180
 Well, that's the whole thing.

176
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,460
 Even we were putting together the improv lineup.

177
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,980
 We're like, you know, I know it's been 27 years

178
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,420
 for me to do this, it's been 27 years for me to do that.

179
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,500
 And I go, can we, we should stop saying 27 years.

180
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,380
 It's definitely been 31 years.

181
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,740
 - Oh my God, that's what's blew in my mind

182
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,580
 when I'm teaching again.

183
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,860
 - It's been 27 years and then a few more.

184
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,420
 - Yeah, one of my students asked me straight up,

185
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,260
 it's like, how long have you been teaching?

186
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,100
 How long have you been teaching?

187
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:03,940
 I'm like 20 years.

188
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,340
 And I'm like, wait, I've been teaching like 22 years.

189
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,020
 And if I've been teaching 22 years,

190
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,300
 I've been improvising 35 years.

191
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,060
 - Oh my God.

192
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,940
 Let's not go down this rabbit hole.

193
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,540
 - This is a depressing rabbit hole for any of us to go down.

194
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,060
 - But this is like what I was talking about.

195
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,460
 Like as my buddy, Pat, my buddy, Pat,

196
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,260
 he's gonna be doing the tyranny thing with us this Thursday.

197
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,740
 I found out that I've been spelling his name wrong

198
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,380
 for our entire friendship, which was embarrassing.

199
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,740
 He was like, I'm pretty sure we talked about this

200
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,580
 multiple times.

201
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,460
 I was like, I have a false memory of you telling me

202
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,180
 how to spell your name properly.

203
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,980
 Where I, it's Pat Shepard.

204
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,260
 I've been spelling it with the second,

205
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,220
 I've been spelling it Shepard.

206
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,780
 And I thought for a fact,

207
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,780
 that's actually what he instructed me to do one time.

208
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,460
 He was like, it's like Shep and Hart.

209
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,740
 And I was like, great.

210
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,060
 And I literally had a conversation with him

211
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,220
 like just like three days ago.

212
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,300
 Or he was like, nope, never said that.

213
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,500
 Never tried to do that.

214
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,060
 Definitely been all ease on my last name

215
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,700
 the entire time you've known me.

216
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,660
 And I was like, how do I make up

217
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,860
 for the fact that I've been spelling you?

218
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,820
 Like I can't, that's like, there's no mea culpa.

219
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,220
 Like we're lifelong friends.

220
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,380
 Like we are our friends for entire improv lives.

221
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,700
 And I think the only thing that you can do here

222
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,180
 is tell him how to spell your last name incorrectly.

223
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,740
 And let him spell it incorrectly the rest of your life.

224
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,660
 - My brain was really racking like possible

225
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,860
 like big time solutions.

226
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,780
 'Cause it's so embarrassing.

227
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,380
 How do you undo 30 years of mistakes?

228
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,180
 Like it's also like, it's the number one bitch

229
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,020
 behind my back, right?

230
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,820
 If you're like, guy doesn't even spell my name right.

231
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,900
 We're supposed to be brothers.

232
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,900
 You know, like I have no defense for being like,

233
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,700
 if there's any sense of like, I am a fucking ogre, selfish ogre.

234
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,100
 It's like, I never learned how to spell.

235
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,020
 - It's better than what I thought you meant though.

236
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,020
 I thought you meant you were misspelling Pat.

237
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,860
 - No.

238
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,940
 P-I-T, Pat.

239
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,780
 - Shit.

240
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:56,860
 - And it's not like we're casual friends.

241
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,700
 No, like possible side effects.

242
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,620
 Many press releases, many articles,

243
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,100
 many listings of who's playing in the shows.

244
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,220
 I've put out his name numerous times

245
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,220
 and shouted it to the rafters with incorrect spelling.

246
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,300
 Just 30 years.

247
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:15,300
 - I don't think, I don't think that you can change it.

248
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,620
 I think the only way forward is to continue on.

249
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,460
 - He was like, no, we've definitely had conversations about it.

250
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,700
 I was like, well, clearly I don't remember.

251
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,820
 I go, I just want to say clearly.

252
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,140
 One, I'm sorry.

253
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,020
 And two, this wasn't some elaborate trolling

254
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,020
 that I've been doing a bitch for 30 years.

255
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,100
 Like I don't, I know I'm capable of these bits.

256
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,860
 This wasn't it though.

257
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,300
 - Oh man, side note on the word bit.

258
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,500
 Fucking, so jealous.

259
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,540
 Amy Poehler, great podcast.

260
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,140
 And she's interviewed two people about two elaborate bits.

261
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,740
 One is the guy, Cole Escala, who wrote "Oh Mary."

262
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,100
 - "Oh Mary."

263
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,060
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

264
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,500
 - They are so fucking funny.

265
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,340
 They are amazing.

266
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,180
 - He has a bit where he calls someone

267
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,100
 and on their voicemail, he leaves a message

268
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,940
 as if he's talking to someone else's voicemail

269
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,060
 about the person.

270
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,700
 So he's talking about having to kill the person

271
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,900
 he's leaving a message for to another person.

272
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,580
 So like if I called Paul, I'd be like, what's up, Jacob?

273
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,740
 Look, it's gotta go down.

274
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,860
 Paul's out of hand.

275
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,100
 (laughing)

276
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,780
 - Like he's accidentally called the wrong number?

277
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,300
 - Yes, yeah.

278
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,660
 - We have to murder Paul.

279
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,340
 - So that's a bit he does with all of his friends.

280
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,980
 Like he has to murder, he's colluding with their other

281
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,740
 friends to murder that person.

282
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,580
 - Great, that's pretty great.

283
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,780
 - Which I'm so jealous of that bit.

284
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,180
 And then fucking Aziz Ansari.

285
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,620
 His bit on Amy Poehler's was fantastic.

286
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,140
 - So he found out Amy Poehler's kids,

287
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,780
 the names of their best friends.

288
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,740
 And so when the kids would visit set,

289
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,540
 Aziz Ansari would walk by on the phone,

290
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,620
 pretending to talk to their best friends and ignoring them.

291
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,540
 - Amy Poehler's children's best friends.

292
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,260
 So he wouldn't speak to her children.

293
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,060
 He would pretend to speak to their friends.

294
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:06,060
 And it's like Dalton or something like that.

295
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,420
 But it was like, oh yeah, hey Dalton.

296
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,620
 No, I haven't seen Amy Poehler's kids around lately.

297
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,540
 Yeah, I don't know where they are.

298
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,460
 I'm sure they're fine, but I don't know where they are.

299
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,300
 - But let's get together.

300
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,420
 Let's play this, let's do that.

301
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,820
 Like he's just like making plans and like,

302
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,620
 and I'm like, oh, that's a really good bit.

303
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,580
 That is a really, really good fit.

304
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:30,300
 But yeah, so we got together hilariously

305
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,500
 at Kevin Smith's Smod Castle.

306
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,020
 We did the reunion, right?

307
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,460
 - Yes.

308
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,460
 - And so I just walked in and I am just surrounded

309
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,500
 by Kevin Smith, everything, right?

310
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,980
 They've decorated everything.

311
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,940
 Just a ton of memorabilia.

312
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:48,940
 - I just saw, he just got the mall rats poster,

313
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,180
 original art, very, very recently framed up.

314
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,540
 That's the Drew Struzan piece who just passed away.

315
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,380
 - He just passed away, yeah, yeah, yeah.

316
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,060
 - Legendary artist, Drew Struzan.

317
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,020
 Yeah, so.

318
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,100
 He did, I mean, really, it's worth looking up that guy.

319
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,860
 He did every movie poster he wrote.

320
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,700
 - Oh, everything that we grew up with, for sure.

321
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,340
 Drew Struzan, yeah, he did.

322
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:10,100
 - Oh, yeah, that's something that I've been wanting

323
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,340
 to get into kind of quietly for a long time

324
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,740
 is old movie posters and start collecting those.

325
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,220
 But that is, the bar to entry,

326
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,180
 getting into that kind of collection is intense.

327
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,340
 - Well, if you're getting like,

328
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,180
 'cause I mean, what he bought

329
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,380
 was the original painted work.

330
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,940
 - Right, right, which is even crazier.

331
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,540
 - Yes, it's like 30, 30 grand.

332
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,860
 - I'm not even looking at that kind of stuff.

333
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,700
 But yeah, even just the original prints, though.

334
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,900
 - Oh, sure, the ones that used to be in movie houses.

335
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,980
 Because a lot of those are double printed, right?

336
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,420
 So they can be illuminated from the back

337
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,260
 and that kind of thing.

338
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,620
 - A lot of them are double printed

339
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,820
 or a lot of them have like multiple things

340
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,500
 with the silver, it's all, yeah, yeah, yeah.

341
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,860
 - All right, sorry to completely derail,

342
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,300
 but yes, you're in this podcast

343
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,060
 and you're full of all this memorabilia.

344
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,140
 Even one part, there's the poster with like,

345
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,820
 it's one of those stereoscopic vision posters where you--

346
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,940
 - Oh yeah, with the sailboat, the schooner.

347
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,060
 - Yeah, yeah, and so it had Jay and Silent Bob underneath

348
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,060
 and then Jay talking.

349
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,540
 I have a button that was misprinted

350
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,020
 and has Silent Bob talking with the comic book bubble.

351
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,020
 - Oh, funny.

352
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,900
 - It's one of my like little pieces of memorabilia

353
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,100
 I'm keeping for if it should be valuable one day.

354
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,940
 It's a misprint.

355
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,780
 So it turns out Kevin Smith decided to do

356
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:27,420
 a mall rats full cast reunion video,

357
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,980
 I mean the movie watching and Q&A with the entire cast

358
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,780
 on the same exact night as my informant.

359
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,040
 (laughing)

360
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,340
 - Yes, did you get him a chip?

361
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,780
 That's all I wanna know, that's all I wanna know.

362
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,740
 (laughing)

363
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,700
 - I know, I know if Matt got him a chip or not.

364
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,940
 (laughing)

365
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,140
 - No, this is--

366
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,500
 - I've already shared on this pod,

367
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,740
 I believe some of my friend wrote me like hey,

368
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,300
 maybe we can get a picture of Kevin Smith

369
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,700
 and I said maybe you can.

370
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,980
 (laughing)

371
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,940
 I'm all for you know, forgiveness and sleeping dogs,

372
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,780
 lie and stuff like that,

373
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,820
 but I'm not like about to initiate like hey, it's me.

374
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,740
 - Not on that night, not on that night, right.

375
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,420
 - Hey, while you're back together

376
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,580
 with the entire cast of Mall Rats,

377
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,340
 do you remember kicking me out of a film when I was 17?

378
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,340
 (laughing)

379
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,860
 I just want you to know that I passed it.

380
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,340
 Wanna grab a photo?

381
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,260
 (laughing)

382
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,260
 By the way, I don't know if you've heard this thing

383
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,020
 called a podcast, but I have one.

384
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:20,860
 Here, please.

385
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,700
 - Here's a chip.

386
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,540
 - Here's a chip, check it out.

387
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,380
 - I don't know if you've heard of this thing

388
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,180
 called a podcast, Mr. Eighteen Podcasts.

389
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,020
 (laughing)

390
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,860
 - Hilarious.

391
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,540
 - So yeah, there was no in on me and Kevin.

392
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,380
 I only thought it was funny that I ran--

393
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,900
 - Hey, I don't know if you remember kicking me

394
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,180
 off of a movie 20-something years ago.

395
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,340
 - The only thing that was funny

396
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,260
 is that I basically ran right into him.

397
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,540
 I was crossing the street and he was rounding the corner

398
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,060
 and then there he was and I literally just stopped dead

399
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,140
 in the sidewalk, in the crosswalk, walked backwards

400
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,940
 and just let, I just like, I don't even wanna be here

401
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,620
 but then, I'm not, I'm not doing it.

402
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,020
 (laughing)

403
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,860
 I just laugh.

404
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,380
 - If he happens to see me, it happens to recognize me,

405
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,860
 I don't want this to happen right here.

406
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,020
 - Yeah, I was like, no, I thought I was gonna be okay

407
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,180
 if we just happened to run into each other.

408
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,020
 It literally happened.

409
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,660
 I was like, nope, I'd rather just let it happen.

410
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,900
 (laughing)

411
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,540
 My heart was like, just you do your thing tonight,

412
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,420
 I'll do mine and we'll just be happy, okay?

413
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,620
 - Hilarious.

414
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,980
 (laughing)

415
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,820
 - Let's just get through the rest of our lives, man.

416
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,260
 We don't need to worry about this.

417
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,020
 - No, no, we're both just--

418
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,580
 - We got plenty in our lives, we can just move on.

419
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,700
 - Nothing is plenty of dirt on top of that hatchet, right?

420
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,700
 Nothing buries that hatchet plenty.

421
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,540
 So, I'm not saying it's--

422
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,180
 - Well, nothing buries it to the point

423
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,340
 where it's not embarrassing the next time

424
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,620
 you have to have a conversation.

425
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,500
 - Yeah, because the truth is there's a 90% chance

426
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,620
 he doesn't remember at all, do you know what I mean?

427
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,420
 Like, there's just a chance he does not remember

428
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,780
 whatsoever, you know?

429
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,140
 And I also have to remember that that film

430
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,660
 did not become like "American Pie."

431
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,540
 It did not go on to do like, I can't point--

432
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,380
 - It wasn't "Mallrats."

433
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,500
 - I bring up the movie and people go, "What?"

434
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,140
 And you're like, "Yeah."

435
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,580
 So, it's like it's not, I even, you know,

436
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,860
 the more important is that I buried the hatchet

437
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,020
 with Brian who wrote it and had to suffer, you know,

438
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,940
 that whole political situation and still get his movie made.

439
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,780
 - Right.

440
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,180
 - But even I hopped on one of his Instagram lives

441
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,780
 and it was like, he was going over how it just came out

442
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,740
 on DVD, now you can just buy it.

443
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,580
 - Yeah.

444
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,380
 - And then I popped on his Instagram live

445
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,580
 and he's just going over how amazing the cast was

446
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,540
 and everything was amazing.

447
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,260
 And I was like, "Well, maybe I'm not totally over it.

448
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,100
 "Okay, bye."

449
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,020
 And I just kind of clicked off the live to be like,

450
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,100
 "That's enough."

451
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,340
 (laughing)

452
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,340
 You know, so I've still, you know,

453
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,220
 I've still spoken with everyone in it.

454
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,820
 We've all done everything else with our lives.

455
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,380
 It's all fine, but I just was like,

456
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,500
 "Oh God, what a funny curve ball to just have."

457
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,740
 You know, there's a lot around the block,

458
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:49,180
 not for improv jam, you know, the whole bit, right?

459
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,060
 But we got in there.

460
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,260
 They set up a little stage for us in a movie theater

461
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,900
 and we sold out.

462
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,220
 We sold out the show and it was a tax house.

463
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:05,220
 And I met holding a grudge, I'm shocked and surprised.

464
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,700
 I'm doing my best to not be a Jersey stereotype, all right?

465
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,580
 I'm trying to be an evolved person.

466
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,060
 - You're doing great, buddy.

467
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,900
 You're doing great.

468
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,980
 (laughing)

469
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,020
 - I tell you who doesn't hold a grudge,

470
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,220
 the guy who wrote "Improv Jam,"

471
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,660
 because I left that in a very fiery,

472
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,220
 political way at the time, you know?

473
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,340
 (laughing)

474
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,860
 - 20 some odd years ago.

475
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,940
 - Yeah, it was 20 something years ago

476
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,780
 when I wanted to show Kevin Smith what what.

477
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,980
 I took my college money and funded a TV pilot

478
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,780
 with my improv group, not our improv group, mine.

479
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,900
 I left my hometown improv group, started my own college,

480
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,500
 and took the most inexperienced group

481
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,340
 and decided they were the ones I wanted to work with

482
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,740
 and we did a TV pilot with them.

483
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,020
 Again, if that became a real TV show,

484
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,780
 maybe I wouldn't be invited back to the reunion.

485
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:55,180
 But again, it went on to no success like the movie.

486
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,700
 Just a bunch of people holding grudges,

487
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,740
 throwing money around and no one's better for it.

488
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,980
 (laughing)

489
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:06,780
 And in fact, there was the original core group of the show

490
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,380
 and then there was the class that came right after us.

491
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,740
 We're all reunited, right?

492
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,420
 Because my buddy Pete never left the group

493
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,460
 and so he stayed on and bonded with another,

494
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,140
 the crew that came right after us.

495
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,780
 So it really was like two classes of the show reuniting.

496
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,700
 30 years and some years later.

497
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,980
 And I was laughing 'cause someone's like,

498
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,220
 "Where did these new guys come from?"

499
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,780
 And I was like, well, they came from the fact

500
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,860
 that Tom, Pat, and I quit and started our own group

501
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,260
 and went up north to Jersey and left it.

502
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,180
 So it created a vacuum of availability for the cast.

503
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,020
 So.

504
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,260
 (laughing)

505
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,860
 - You're like, "Oh, I can answer that question."

506
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,700
 - Yeah.

507
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,540
 - Hoisted by your own petard.

508
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,380
 - Exactly.

509
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,340
 So it was a 14-person cast.

510
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,580
 All of us playing games we haven't played in years.

511
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,420
 I'm the most recent player.

512
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,540
 - Holy shit, that's a lot. - Of all of the games.

513
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,460
 And Jacob, you're gonna laugh at this, right?

514
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,580
 So they put together a game and Pete did a good job

515
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,820
 distributing all the games to all the different people.

516
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,940
 And he gave to Jeopardy and he went to Jeopardy

517
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,780
 and he was like, blah, blah, blah.

518
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,220
 And he goes, "And Lance, you'll host."

519
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,300
 And Lance made a face.

520
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,380
 And I literally froze.

521
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,300
 I go, "Freeze, Lance."

522
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,020
 I go, "Yeah, was hosting Jeopardy your thing

523
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,980
 "when you did the show?

524
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,260
 "'Cause I was not part of your cast."

525
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,700
 He was like, "Not really."

526
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,620
 And I go, "Do you know how to host Jeopardy?"

527
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,460
 And he goes, "No."

528
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,940
 I go, "Okay, switch games with me.

529
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,780
 "I will host Jeopardy.

530
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,420
 "You do this other game."

531
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,260
 - Yeah.

532
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,100
 (laughing)

533
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,940
 - And I was like, and I said, "I'm really sorry."

534
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,700
 I was like, "I don't wanna step on anyone's toes."

535
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,660
 I go, "But hosting Jeopardy is super hard.

536
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,660
 "And I just made this mistake.

537
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,700
 "I just made this mistake.

538
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,100
 "I made our audio guy with no improv background host Jeopardy

539
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,180
 "and I forgot that the Jeopardy host

540
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,420
 "is the hardest job in that game."

541
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,420
 - Right.

542
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,300
 - It is to sell everyone's jokes.

543
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,660
 You have to repeat and sell everybody's jokes.

544
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,660
 And you have to move the show along

545
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,820
 based on the funniest answer.

546
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,180
 And you have to get a sense of whether someone else

547
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,580
 might have a funnier answer.

548
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:04,620
 It is not, you just throw somebody in to do it or whatever.

549
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,140
 And so I--

550
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,700
 - It's a showrunner more than--

551
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,540
 - Yes.

552
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,220
 - It's a showrunner more than an imp--

553
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,980
 Like now, I know exactly what to do with it.

554
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,820
 - Right, right, right.

555
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,220
 - Like now I can just do it.

556
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,060
 (laughing)

557
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:20,300
 But like that day, I was like, "Oh, y'all want what now?"

558
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,540
 - Yes.

559
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,820
 - We got on stage, it was like, "Oh, it's this.

560
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,220
 "It's this, I see now."

561
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,580
 - Yeah, even when, it's the most like joke,

562
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,260
 like pimping you into making dumb jokes game.

563
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:35,140
 It's even harder than 185 or those games.

564
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,220
 - Oh yeah.

565
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:40,100
 - And so I hopped on that grenade, Jacob,

566
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,460
 and I was like, "Oh, I'm hosting, I'm hosting Jeopardy."

567
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,020
 - How'd it go?

568
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,980
 - Oh, it went really well, it went really well.

569
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,340
 I mean, the most thing was that honestly,

570
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,580
 like the thing was that Michael Keefe

571
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,780
 was the guy who ran Improv Jam when I was a kid.

572
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,300
 He was the funniest person I'd ever seen

573
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,940
 when I went and saw that show, like he was so funny.

574
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,500
 And I would steal his bits and do his bits in high school

575
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,780
 and get attention for it.

576
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,820
 And then I finally got in the show

577
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,380
 and got to perform next to him.

578
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:07,380
 And when we all got together, he was older than us.

579
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:11,460
 And so I could, but I could see him,

580
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,860
 like he had 14 people, he's bouncing 14 people.

581
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,940
 And I could see that he was like not,

582
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,060
 like he was kind of chanting a bit, a little bit to be funny.

583
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,580
 And he was kind of, you know.

584
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,420
 - Oh, right, right.

585
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,340
 - He was kind of making sure everyone's getting fed

586
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,180
 or whatever.

587
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,540
 And so when "Dating Game" came around,

588
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,220
 I just was like, he was explaining like there are three contestants.

589
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,740
 I go, "Nope, there's four contestants in this one, Mike,

590
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,220
 and you are contestant number four."

591
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,020
 And so I threw him in a dating game.

592
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,300
 And then all of a sudden I was up for Jeopardy

593
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,660
 and I turned to Pete and I go, "I'm gonna do it again."

594
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,140
 And he's like, "There'll be three people up here."

595
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,620
 I go, "Nope, there'll be four people playing

596
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,460
 in Jeopardy at night, Mike, four.

597
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,020
 And you're playing in that one as well."

598
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,980
 I was like, "We're doing this."

599
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,220
 - That's great.

600
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,660
 - Yeah, I, the only thing I was really happy for myself

601
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:58,020
 was that like I, because I had departed

602
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,380
 and even reconciled and departed multiple times

603
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,380
 on shaky ground, I actually just straight up

604
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,740
 after his last game just said, "By the way, everybody,

605
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,020
 like all of us are here and all of us went on

606
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,260
 different things with our lives over the conference

607
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,740
 that came from doing this show.

608
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,140
 Please let's give Mike a proper round of applause

609
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,380
 for what he's done for everybody here."

610
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,020
 And we got standing ovation in the theater.

611
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,620
 - Oh, that's nice.

612
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:27,140
 - I was happy because I really, like I said,

613
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:32,140
 I was very driven and certainly at times very egotistical

614
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,580
 and I was definitely went off doing my own thing

615
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,140
 and I had my own political battles with that.

616
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,260
 Of course, when you look back, you're like,

617
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,260
 boy, am I just a dumb 18 year old kid

618
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,660
 in those arguments, right?

619
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,780
 - Yes.

620
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,740
 - And that show just meant so much to me.

621
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:50,340
 And I did not realize the nostalgia factor.

622
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,340
 I was too busy trying to make sure

623
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,620
 that we were getting 14 people into a show.

624
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,340
 I knew I was pretty experienced compared

625
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,580
 to some of the other people coming back.

626
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,820
 I was really trying to make sure.

627
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,900
 - You were the most practiced,

628
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,220
 you were the most recently practiced.

629
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,780
 - Yeah, and so I was trying to really just kind of make sure,

630
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,380
 you know, 'cause our shows with Brad and Jonathan,

631
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,460
 I mean, that's like keeping up

632
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:12,900
 with the fucking two amazing Titans, you know.

633
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,460
 I certainly felt like very in shape for this reunion, right?

634
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,300
 - Yeah.

635
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,980
 - I did not give myself like the, I did not for a second,

636
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,340
 I was like, oh wait, you're going back

637
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,020
 to the epicenter of your entire creative life.

638
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,860
 Do you know what I mean?

639
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,620
 Like, you're going back to where you were 16, 17,

640
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,460
 and you started doing this show.

641
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,420
 - Ah, 16, 17!

642
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,660
 (laughing)

643
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,500
 - 16, 17.

644
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:40,500
 - I'm so young and hip.

645
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,140
 - No, like, so like, my buddy Tom,

646
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,060
 who had a stroke nine months ago,

647
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,260
 and we were literally just told, like,

648
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,860
 check in with his wife day out.

649
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,260
 Like, whether he would make it or not,

650
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,540
 whether he'd want to play or not, or whatever.

651
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:56,540
 And so, Tom walked in, and my buddy Nick,

652
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,780
 those were the guys that were in the show before I got in.

653
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,620
 Those were the guys that I looked at,

654
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,100
 to be like, I want to play on stage with those guys, right?

655
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,660
 He just walked in, the first person he saw was Nick,

656
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,940
 and I just saw Tom and Nick hug,

657
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,220
 and just seeing those two together,

658
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,140
 I literally just started to lose it, like, right there.

659
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,620
 It was like five o'clock, the show was at eight.

660
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,620
 - Oh, you were done?

661
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,140
 - Yeah, I was like, good Lord!

662
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,380
 You know, and I just wasn't really,

663
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,860
 all this was like, how the hell do we make

664
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,780
 this 14 person improv show with a bunch of people

665
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,980
 who haven't practiced go well?

666
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,820
 That's all that was on my mind the entire time

667
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,460
 going into this, like, this has to be good, you know?

668
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,620
 And I was not prepared emotionally to be like,

669
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,260
 no, buddy, you're going back to, like, day one.

670
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,020
 You're going back to, like, the starter space

671
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,220
 on the game board.

672
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,140
 And it was really crazy to just feel those,

673
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,580
 all the people playing games and going like,

674
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,260
 I was feeling 17, but I was like, oh, I love this game!

675
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,300
 I want to play this game, too!

676
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,140
 You know, like, I was like, I want to do all the games!

677
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,660
 And I just was like, right back to being a 17 year old,

678
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,980
 just like, loving the show.

679
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,500
 Also, like, this weird thing, like,

680
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,860
 Mike came from a sack theater in Orlando.

681
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,660
 They start, they coach the crowds and they say,

682
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,180
 for every scene, scene in, and the whole crowd goes,

683
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:10,220
 five, four, three, two, one, and the thing starts.

684
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,260
 - Oh, that's fun.

685
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,580
 - It is fun.

686
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:17,260
 And none of us took it off on our separate improv endeavors.

687
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,820
 Like, all of us went off to do other improv endeavors,

688
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,260
 and we never did that.

689
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,420
 So, we were all just waiting to be introduced,

690
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,780
 and he coached the crowd and doing it,

691
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,180
 and hearing a full theater do the countdown again.

692
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:31,380
 We all, all 14 of us back, or 13 of us, Mike's on stage,

693
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,140
 all 13 of us went, oh, like, we like, just got,

694
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,060
 we all just got hit in the stomach with a bowling ball,

695
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,220
 like, right off the bat.

696
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,660
 Like, before we even hit the stage,

697
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,820
 it was like, this crazy nostalgia of it.

698
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,620
 And it was awesome.

699
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,660
 Everybody really impressed me.

700
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,140
 Everybody really held their own and did all the right things

701
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,340
 to start all the games, and the crowd was into it.

702
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,060
 There was a lot of people who was their first improv show,

703
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,900
 which I was--

704
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,260
 - Going to see their first improv show?

705
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,660
 - Yes, because it was listed on the Smodcastle newsletter.

706
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,940
 - Oh.

707
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,940
 - So, like, half the crowd was nostalgic people.

708
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,780
 - Half of them were just like,

709
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,600
 oh, I wanna go see some improv.

710
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,380
 - Yeah, and it being fucking 30 years,

711
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,740
 a lot of people brought their kids

712
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,820
 who were the same age as we were,

713
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,540
 like, when we were watching the show.

714
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,380
 - Yeah.

715
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,740
 - So a lot of people were showing their kids

716
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,580
 what they watched when they were their age.

717
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,420
 - Oh, yeah.

718
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,500
 - And that was a really big trip.

719
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,520
 - That's a head of a half, yes, sir.

720
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,940
 (laughing)

721
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,940
 - Yeah, I can see how that would be a thing, sure.

722
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,660
 (laughing)

723
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,820
 - And, yeah, it was just, it was just a blast.

724
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,420
 It was just a crazy night out,

725
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,620
 and, yeah, we did all the old games,

726
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:48,620
 and it was a crazy, nutty thing to do.

727
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,540
 I was really glad we did it.

728
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,020
 I can't imagine doing it again anytime soon.

729
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,140
 (laughing)

730
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,340
 And then with that in mind, we're only getting older, right?

731
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:04,340
 So, like, to wait 30 years to do it is crazy,

732
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,900
 and then you're like, well, 10 more years,

733
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,940
 then it gets really weird,

734
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,060
 because there was no way we can do all that shit, you know?

735
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,020
 Even when Mike went up,

736
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,980
 we made him do "Emotional Roller Coaster,"

737
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,340
 and that was always like,

738
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,180
 this is the strangest thing about this show,

739
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,780
 is that that was our closer before we did a music,

740
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,180
 we would close with a song at the very end,

741
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,820
 but the last game we'd play was "Emotional Roller Coaster,"

742
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,740
 which basically was a tip of the cap

743
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,820
 to whoever we thought was hot shit, right?

744
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,860
 That person got to do all the emotion changing.

745
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,620
 So, like, our way of ending our show was like,

746
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,260
 now one person gets to show off for you.

747
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,140
 Like, it's really weird.

748
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,660
 It's like really weird to look back.

749
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,700
 So I was like, oh, Mike is gonna change.

750
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,260
 Mike, we'll make Mike change.

751
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,580
 He'll do the last game, and he'll change.

752
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,820
 And to incorporate everyone else,

753
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,620
 I had everyone else call the different emotions.

754
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,420
 I just went down the line to every performer,

755
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,980
 and they all changed their emotions or whatever.

756
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,940
 But I was like, we made such a weird show

757
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:04,300
 that was oddly popular, and it was not like,

758
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:08,700
 it was not a wholesome improv, everyone gets along,

759
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,020
 we're all looking out for each other kind of thing.

760
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,660
 It was a very, looking back on it,

761
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,380
 we were all like young, hungry comedians.

762
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,060
 It was very competitive.

763
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,700
 It was very much like,

764
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,660
 I've earned my right to do a motion roller coaster.

765
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,540
 Like those things came back into my head, you know?

766
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,380
 - And not like a, and not a formula

767
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,340
 that you can just go and recreate

768
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,540
 with a different group either, it sounds like.

769
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,340
 - No, I mean, this is, like I said,

770
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:36,220
 I've had a very blessed improv life, right?

771
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,300
 So I've gone off to many other places

772
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,980
 and seen short form and long form shows everywhere.

773
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,060
 And when I say things like,

774
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,900
 oh, we would close with a motion roller coaster,

775
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,780
 people go like, what?

776
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,020
 Like that's a starter game.

777
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,100
 That's like a, that's a first three gamer

778
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,940
 in most people's repertoire.

779
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,060
 It's just a silly throwaway game.

780
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,820
 But like, and I said, and I've said this

781
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,020
 when I came back to them, I go, you know,

782
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,700
 every short form show basically becomes a review.

783
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,740
 Like it basically becomes a kind of a rehearsed deal

784
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,060
 where you do things with a certain energy,

785
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,300
 you perform it a certain way,

786
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,740
 and you basically also kind of maybe steal

787
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,020
 other people's bits and jokes

788
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,140
 to create like a greatest hits version of this game,

789
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,460
 which just is inevitable.

790
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,300
 It's inevitable.

791
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,140
 It happens every theater, it happens everywhere.

792
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,540
 And no one wants to admit it, but basically,

793
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,260
 but that's why those shows basically when you come in,

794
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,700
 you go, oh, 'cause I love trying to sit in with every group

795
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,580
 and try to get everyone's vibe.

796
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,060
 And it was always very interesting to see like

797
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:32,980
 what elements of their shows were just like,

798
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,580
 oh, this is just a piece.

799
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,300
 Like even though this is an improv game,

800
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,860
 this is a set piece that I can't help.

801
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,940
 I can't walk onto this.

802
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,420
 I can't help this out.

803
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,340
 I have to hands off this piece for this particular group.

804
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,100
 - They have a thing that they do on this one.

805
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,700
 - And it's part of what made me hate short form

806
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,820
 for a long time.

807
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,460
 It's part of what made me resent it as not improv

808
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:54,380
 and made me like a long form zealot for a good, you know,

809
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,060
 15 years after the fact, you know, like it was like,

810
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:00,060
 I'm doing actual improv and you're doing a review, you know.

811
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:03,300
 But as I got older and we learned Paul

812
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,780
 with our various endeavors in Las Vegas,

813
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,060
 sometimes putting together a review is really fucking hard.

814
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:10,500
 - It is, it absolutely is.

815
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,620
 - Sometimes it can be really not funny at all.

816
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,460
 - Yeah, it's very easy to fuck up games.

817
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,020
 - Yes.

818
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:22,740
 - I mean, they're, you know, generated to help you succeed.

819
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,260
 But if you don't know the tricks

820
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,260
 and if you don't know how to intro the fucking thing.

821
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,100
 - Right.

822
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,940
 - Look out.

823
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,540
 - That's the thing, Mike comes from Sack Theater.

824
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,860
 Sack Theater is where Jonathan, Wayne Brady, Nathan Fillion,

825
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,260
 all those guys came from.

826
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:40,060
 A lot of friends that Paul and I have came out of there.

827
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,380
 And yes, they'll be quick to remind you like,

828
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,260
 oh, when you intro this game, don't forget this bit.

829
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,340
 You know, like, so we did Jeopardy,

830
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,380
 I forgot that we used human buzzers, right?

831
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,780
 So we bring humans up and then Mike literally goes,

832
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,580
 oh, and don't forget, we have to say,

833
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,420
 before we start the game, you put your buzzers down.

834
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,900
 And then I go, oh, I forgot.

835
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,500
 I totally forgot about that bit.

836
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,060
 And then I said, oh, all right, before we start the game,

837
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,780
 go ahead, just put your buzzers down.

838
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,540
 And they all start insulting the people

839
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,940
 who came up to help them.

840
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,780
 - Hilarious.

841
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,180
 (laughing)

842
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,260
 - And it gets a huge laugh.

843
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,100
 And I was like, fucking bits, man.

844
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,140
 The fucking little shows.

845
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,860
 - Little zings that just keep things flowing,

846
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,420
 keep the energy high.

847
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,700
 And it's another one of those things, you know, again,

848
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,020
 I love teaching level one

849
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,580
 because it always keeps me on my toes,

850
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:30,820
 keeps me remembering that it's basics, basics, basics, always.

851
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,180
 And that's just it.

852
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,340
 Like, just reminding people that it's a show,

853
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,580
 reminding people that they can relax

854
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,900
 and we know what we're doing, even though we don't.

855
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,340
 - It's that we know what we're doing.

856
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,420
 Like, Jonathan-- - You're in good hands.

857
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,540
 - Jonathan Magam does a bit.

858
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,780
 If you put Jonathan in charge of writing something down,

859
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,300
 you have to remember that he does this bit

860
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,220
 and I've only done, you know, how everybody shows it.

861
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,420
 But you start saying things for Jonathan to write down

862
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,620
 and then you wait, and like the third one,

863
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,420
 you go, you getting all this, Jonathan?

864
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:02,020
 And he will go, oh no, I'm just drawing a cat.

865
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,820
 And he'll turn over the pad and show that he's just drawing

866
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,500
 a cat and written nothing down.

867
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,300
 - Yeah. - And that bit,

868
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,940
 if you nail it, kills. - Kills, yeah.

869
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,660
 - Like, if you do it wrong too soon,

870
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,820
 if you forget he was doing the bit,

871
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,860
 he'll finish it himself and it goes, okay.

872
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,340
 But you have to remember that Jonathan does the bit

873
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,020
 where if he picks up the pad, he's gonna draw a cat.

874
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:19,860
 (laughing)

875
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,260
 And those are the things that make it a review

876
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,140
 and not a pure improv show,

877
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,980
 but it's the kind of thing that makes an artist go like,

878
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,420
 oh, these guys, these guys have it in their back, pop.

879
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,500
 - They got the shit together.

880
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,460
 - Yeah. - Simple little stuff.

881
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:35,460
 When we did our show on Saturday, the teacher show,

882
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,140
 I just grabbed a few pieces like,

883
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,180
 we were doing puppets and just the old,

884
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,340
 make sure no one touches the bikini zone.

885
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,100
 That's just one little thing like that,

886
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,940
 it's a little throwaway line,

887
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,380
 but it just gets a laugh and gets everybody going.

888
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:51,460
 And at the top of, we were doing,

889
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,580
 we did a little 20 minute or so long form,

890
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,780
 after an interview, the interview was pretty heavy.

891
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,620
 And so at the end of the interview, I was like, okay.

892
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,900
 So what we're about to do now

893
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,340
 is a little bit of a long form piece.

894
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,500
 It's gonna be a little more theatrical, more scenic.

895
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,580
 Things might come in, might go away, might come back.

896
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,940
 You might see characters return

897
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,100
 in different times and whatever,

898
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,020
 but that's what's gonna be a little more theatrical,

899
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,860
 a little more long form.

900
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,300
 And it's all intended to be comedic,

901
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,340
 which I've grabbed from you,

902
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,780
 which is all intended to be comedic.

903
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,380
 And it just ends it with them like,

904
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,340
 and then the audience laughs 'cause they're like,

905
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,100
 but it's good to remind them that yeah,

906
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,260
 we're trying to be funny here,

907
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,740
 even though we just talked about some really deep shit.

908
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,700
 We're gonna be fun, right?

909
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,580
 - Is I've added to that bit, Paul.

910
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:35,940
 I go, I'll pause and go like the whole time.

911
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,860
 - Oh, good, yeah, yeah.

912
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,340
 - Yeah, intended to be comedic, like the whole time.

913
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,820
 (all laughing)

914
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,700
 And I only added that bit because Kamie's gotten dicier.

915
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,740
 - As it ever.

916
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,180
 - As we've gotten older, you know?

917
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,700
 - That's it. - It's gotten different.

918
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,220
 - Well, we were interviewing this gal

919
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,220
 and just stuff just kept coming up, you know?

920
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,860
 And she's like, you know, just some heavy stuff.

921
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:00,860
 And she's in this meeting and stuff is getting very

922
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,260
 politically charged and partisan for no good reason.

923
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,180
 And it's the only reason. - Oh, cool boy.

924
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,980
 - And so I'm like, and I'm like,

925
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,300
 no, I really appreciate you telling us

926
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,540
 that human rights are partisan now 'cause I wasn't 100%.

927
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,380
 But now I get it, okay, this is good.

928
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,060
 'Cause yeah, 'cause that's what she was dealing with

929
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,660
 was just these insane things that are happening.

930
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,420
 'Cause it is, it's insane times, it's insane times.

931
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,180
 - It is insane times. - What?

932
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:29,300
 And it was good to do our show 'cause like Nick, right?

933
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,780
 Like his specialty was to bring in political stuff

934
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,820
 or do a little satire or do whatever.

935
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,020
 And he was saying after the show that he felt weird

936
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,980
 that he couldn't play the way he normally played

937
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,460
 because it's too heavy. - No, satire's dead, baby.

938
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,660
 Satire's dead.

939
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,420
 - It's just too much to throw in an audience.

940
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,580
 - How can you make fun of this shit?

941
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,340
 It makes fun of itself.

942
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,900
 - I know, yeah, it's beyond parody.

943
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,340
 Yeah, yeah.

944
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:55,340
 So, yeah, yeah, I mean, yeah, just a fucking crazy thing.

945
00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:00,380
 Oh, so one of the games we play is a game called Space Jump.

946
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,220
 And the way Space Jump is-- - Okay.

947
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,740
 - It's kind of like a freeze tag-ish game

948
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,180
 except that when a person starts off dancing,

949
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,820
 you call freeze, you come and you make a scene

950
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:09,420
 based on the way that person's frozen, two-person scene.

951
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,540
 They keep doing something physical, freeze,

952
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,980
 someone changes it, third person comes in,

953
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,180
 and you go, like typically in our show,

954
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:18,020
 we have five or six people in the cast.

955
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,820
 Six person would come in first and leave first.

956
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,740
 So you do a six-person scene,

957
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,260
 and they find a reason to leave.

958
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,860
 And then you go right back to that five-person scene,

959
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,860
 go right back to that four-person scene,

960
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,700
 go right back to that three-person scene.

961
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,060
 - Oh, you keep adding, you would keep adding as they come in.

962
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,100
 Nobody tagged out.

963
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,580
 You just-- - Nobody tagged out.

964
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,420
 It just gets more and more and more.

965
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,740
 - You just grew it from the freeze.

966
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,580
 Okay, cool.

967
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,020
 - So P.K. Pell is like,

968
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,700
 we're gonna do a 14-person space jump.

969
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,700
 And I laughed really hard, and he had a moment of doubt.

970
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,540
 He goes, right?

971
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,540
 And I go, oh, I'm sorry.

972
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,780
 Yes, we're definitely doing it.

973
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,900
 - Absolutely, fucking yeah.

974
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,580
 I'm already laughing at it.

975
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,420
 It's great.

976
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,900
 - Yeah, and in my head, I'm like,

977
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,220
 this might take a half hour.

978
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,940
 Like, this might take up the majority of our things

979
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,060
 or whatever.

980
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:01,660
 And-- - And it is intended to be comedic.

981
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:05,540
 - And instead, everyone nailed their opening lines.

982
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,380
 All of them.

983
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,260
 And so it was either call or call and response, freeze.

984
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,660
 Big laugh.

985
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,220
 Big laugh on the freeze.

986
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,060
 And so it was like lightning fast all the way up to 14,

987
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,980
 and then it became this hilarious game

988
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,300
 of trying to remember all of them on the way out.

989
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,140
 - Oh, right.

990
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:21,980
 - And that was the whole game.

991
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,820
 - What were we doing?

992
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,660
 What were we doing?

993
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,540
 - Everyone was looking at each other to be like,

994
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,740
 who's seen, is it, who's supposed to leave or whatever.

995
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:31,340
 And it was just, and it just paid off huge.

996
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:35,460
 - Yeah, it's easy for like 14 and 13, maybe even 12.

997
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,300
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

998
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,860
 - You get down to like 11, 10,

999
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,620
 and then you get to like eight and nine.

1000
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,180
 - Yeah, one of them was that they were frozen.

1001
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,020
 They were frozen.

1002
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,220
 They were hands up holding a casket.

1003
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,460
 And obviously the physicality changed.

1004
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,340
 So they literally was like six people

1005
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,100
 staring at each other.

1006
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:50,940
 And then one guy finally remembers and goes,

1007
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,420
 "Oh, we dropped the casket."

1008
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,480
 And everyone just laughed.

1009
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,140
 (both laughing)

1010
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:01,340
 So yeah, just so many moments.

1011
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,140
 My dad came out, check it out.

1012
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:03,980
 - Oh, wonderful.

1013
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,800
 - Nice.

1014
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,060
 - And I said, "Man, it's been a while.

1015
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,580
 I've worked hard to get in this show."

1016
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,940
 He goes, "Oh yeah, you were terrible when you started."

1017
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,600
 (both laughing)

1018
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,540
 And I was like, "Not wrong, not wrong."

1019
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,660
 He literally like portrayed,

1020
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,180
 like it was a vivid memory in his mind

1021
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:23,420
 of me having stage fright the first time I was in the show.

1022
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,260
 - Oh, really?

1023
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,080
 - Yeah.

1024
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,920
 And he literally was like, "You were like..."

1025
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,460
 And he posed as me, like frozen on the sidelines.

1026
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,780
 And I was like, "That's exactly what happened

1027
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,600
 in my first show.

1028
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,120
 I was absolutely, totally stage-fritten.

1029
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,580
 I don't know how to say it past tense, but yeah.

1030
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:44,580
 Yeah, I was just, yeah, it was a really crazy,

1031
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,880
 crazy emotional experience to go through.

1032
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,720
 - Wow.

1033
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,540
 - You know who else doesn't know

1034
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,580
 how to say the word frightened?

1035
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,220
 That's the following sponsor.

1036
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,380
 (laughing)

1037
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,980
 - I like stage-fritten.

1038
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:00,980
 - Today's show is brought to you by Spanx for Skanks.

1039
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,740
 Yeah, that's right.

1040
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,060
 That's our magic show.

1041
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,180
 Magic Shell Scoop in 2024.

1042
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,140
 That's Spanx for Skanks.

1043
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:13,540
 - Hey, I'm Crack Whore Jessica,

1044
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:17,140
 and I love me some crack.

1045
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:22,140
 I also love to look fit and tight in my Louboutins

1046
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,660
 and my hot couture.

1047
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,460
 So after I smoke some crack, I throw on some Spanx,

1048
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,180
 but not just any Spanx.

1049
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,300
 Spanx for Skanks.

1050
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,980
 Their number one customer is me, Crack Whore Jessica,

1051
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,020
 and my crack pipe.

1052
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:41,900
 These Skank Spanx are built for Skanks like me.

1053
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,620
 They got a crack pipe holder.

1054
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,920
 They got a place where you can put your weed.

1055
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,000
 They got a place where you can pee right in 'em

1056
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,820
 when you're wearing 'em and won't nobody see.

1057
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,780
 That's right.

1058
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,900
 These things are made for Skanks.

1059
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,900
 You can skank these Spanx up like nobody's business

1060
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,500
 and nobody will even know.

1061
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,300
 Meanwhile, I'm walking the red carpet high as fuck

1062
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:06,820
 and don't nobody blink because I'm wearing Skank Spanx.

1063
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,060
 Everybody thinks I got it all together.

1064
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:09,980
 I don't.

1065
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,780
 The only thing that's holding me together

1066
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,380
 are these tight-ass undergarments.

1067
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:18,860
 But I'm pissing in 'em and don't nobody know.

1068
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,420
 So I say that's a win.

1069
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,300
 So go.

1070
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,100
 You take that Skank home and you just open it

1071
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,980
 like a mattress that was just delivered.

1072
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,060
 You slowly get those Spanx off and then.

1073
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,620
 Oh, it's expanding!

1074
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,860
 I'm sorry. It's expanding!

1075
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,720
 I can't help it now.

1076
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,760
 They only last for 12 hours.

1077
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,020
 That's the Spank-Skank guarantee.

1078
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:42,260
 12 hours, but after that, it's like the fucking.

1079
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,540
 There's Cinderella Spanx.

1080
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:47,300
 Yep, it totally, it'll pumpkin your ass real hard.

1081
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,260
 So watch it.

1082
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,260
 Watch it, watch your time, girls.

1083
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,820
 Set your watches and shit

1084
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,900
 'cause that stuff will explode on you.

1085
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,780
 Enter Hayscoops to check out.

1086
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:59,820
 The worst part about that is

1087
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,140
 her parents named her Crack Whore Jessica.

1088
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:02,980
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1089
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,220
 Nominative determinism.

1090
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,700
 Nominative determinism.

1091
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,980
 That's right.

1092
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,240
 (laughing)

1093
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,900
 That's the first thing that popped into my head.

1094
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,740
 Yeah.

1095
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:15,220
 Oh, man.

1096
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,020
 Yeah, so I just got back from the doctor,

1097
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,740
 got my neck ultrasound, good times.

1098
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,960
 Oh, boy.

1099
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1100
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,060
 When do you find out the result of this neck ultrasound?

1101
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,380
 The lady said things are running back.

1102
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,980
 Oh, it'll be like a week or two.

1103
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,840
 And I said, "Well, I'm heading out of town now."

1104
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,780
 She's like, "Well, that's great."

1105
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,700
 So yeah, it'll be like probably two weeks.

1106
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,860
 There's nothing with my neck that means I can't fly

1107
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,100
 because I'm gonna go fly somewhere.

1108
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,740
 Exactly, that's the one thing I kind of thought.

1109
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,140
 I was like, well, if I do have any kind of artery problems,

1110
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,620
 I guess the flight's gonna just do a number of,

1111
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,460
 whatever, who cares?

1112
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,940
 You know what, you're gonna figure it out.

1113
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:51,140
 I can promise you at 50, feeling the way I do,

1114
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,880
 my blood is not flowing as perfectly as it should be.

1115
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,700
 I can say that definitively.

1116
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,420
 I think it's, I don't think there's any major blockages

1117
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:02,260
 or anything, but it could stand to be better, I'm sure.

1118
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,680
 One of our friends came to the house last night

1119
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,260
 and he had, what he said at first was

1120
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,980
 that he nicked his lip shaving

1121
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,500
 and that it was bleeding profusely.

1122
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,820
 Well, I thought that was odd.

1123
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,800
 It turned out it was like the beard clippers.

1124
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,820
 Oh, okay.

1125
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,460
 The clippers took a- He really got in there.

1126
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,540
 Yeah, like took a little hunk out of his lip.

1127
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,460
 So it was like a deep, deep, deep dig there.

1128
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:29,420
 Yeah, but it was bleeding for a couple of hours.

1129
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,940
 It was bleeding. Oh my gosh.

1130
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:34,360
 Like profusely for, 'cause it was right on his lip.

1131
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,620
 It was right on like the, not above where your mustache is,

1132
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,340
 but like down on the lip.

1133
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,460
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1134
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:43,780
 So anytime he would smile, move his lip,

1135
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,140
 and move his mouth at all,

1136
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,820
 you know, it would just open right back up.

1137
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,140
 Oof.

1138
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:51,540
 Yeah, this is how we live now.

1139
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,260
 This is just how we all live.

1140
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,460
 You can remind him that, of course,

1141
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,140
 the area of the mouth and eyes are the first to heal.

1142
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,940
 So there you go.

1143
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:04,580
 I'll remind him next time that happens.

1144
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:09,140
 I'm laying down and she, she gooed,

1145
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,740
 she put a towel under my neck and everything.

1146
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,300
 And then she gooed me up with the jelly.

1147
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,940
 And then she, and then she ultrasound to me.

1148
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,140
 And I got to hear my heartbeat

1149
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,340
 for the first time on the monitor.

1150
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,620
 I really felt like I was my own baby.

1151
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,060
 It was really interesting.

1152
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,420
 I'm a boy.

1153
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,940
 I was like, oh, oh, it was like, oh, we can hear a heartbeat.

1154
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,780
 We've got a heartbeat.

1155
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,780
 I could hear whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.

1156
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,660
 You know that, that sound that comes through

1157
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,500
 with the heartbeats.

1158
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,500
 I was like, oh, and she had to do that eight different times

1159
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,260
 and find it just right out and whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.

1160
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,500
 And I was like, oh, I can hear him.

1161
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,620
 He's in there.

1162
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:51,660
 It was just really interesting to hear my own blood.

1163
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,220
 - He's fighting to get out.

1164
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,540
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1165
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,140
 I'm like, oh, that's sweet baby boy.

1166
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,460
 He's bleeding inside.

1167
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:00,260
 He's just a gushing and a swishing.

1168
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,900
 But from my untrained ear sounded pretty much the same

1169
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,140
 on both sides.

1170
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,220
 So I don't think there was anything.

1171
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:10,380
 - Did they tell you like what they're looking to diagnose?

1172
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,340
 - Yes, they're looking because again,

1173
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:15,780
 because it was isolated to my left eye.

1174
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,620
 - Right.

1175
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,780
 - 'Cause this is all from a few weeks ago

1176
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:22,780
 when you went to an eye exam and they had a moment of,

1177
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,740
 they saw something they didn't like in your eye

1178
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,500
 and it was bleeding.

1179
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,340
 - There was retinal hemorrhaging, yes.

1180
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,180
 - Yeah.

1181
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,820
 - So they went and they, I went to the eye doc,

1182
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,180
 the expert and they checked it out.

1183
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,820
 I don't have anything going on with the right

1184
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,860
 or I didn't at least.

1185
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:41,380
 And so, but I still have had no vision impairment,

1186
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:44,140
 no vision changes, still ongoing.

1187
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,580
 - And you still look great.

1188
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,220
 - I mean, thank you, thank you.

1189
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:50,260
 But the concern was there are the arteries

1190
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,260
 that go back and forth there.

1191
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,420
 The concern was because it was isolated to one eye

1192
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,020
 that it could be some kind of blockage

1193
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,820
 or some kind of impediment as to the going

1194
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:02,180
 or coming of the blood in that area.

1195
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,660
 So that's what they're flushing out.

1196
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:08,420
 And then she's like, I'm gonna check both sides.

1197
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,700
 You got any questions or anything like that?

1198
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,180
 And I was like, well, I mean, I just,

1199
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,820
 I know that the focus is on the left

1200
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,300
 because it is only isolated to the left

1201
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,540
 and that was kind of the weird thing.

1202
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,780
 And she's like, well, they check both sides

1203
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:22,540
 in order to kind of get a baseline of what is normal.

1204
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,380
 And then I went.

1205
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,220
 - All right.

1206
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,040
 - Oh yeah, of course.

1207
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:30,040
 This is the every day medical exam of the Joe Layman, right?

1208
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,940
 You get up, you're like, oh shit,

1209
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,540
 that really hurts over here.

1210
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,380
 What the hell?

1211
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,200
 And then you feel it.

1212
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,660
 And then you feel the other side and you're like,

1213
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,340
 oh, that's pretty much the same.

1214
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,780
 I'll be okay, right?

1215
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,020
 That's the whole thing you do.

1216
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,100
 The symmetrical nature of our bodies.

1217
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:46,940
 That's what we do.

1218
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,420
 We go, ooh, my knee, what's a, oh, okay.

1219
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,260
 How's this one?

1220
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,340
 No, no, that's pretty much the same.

1221
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,640
 - We can always do like A to B comparative shopping.

1222
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,480
 That's what we can do.

1223
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,320
 - Exactly, that's right.

1224
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,140
 Exactly.

1225
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,640
 - And that's why as far as I know, my liver is fine.

1226
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,740
 - That's the one, that's one of the tricky ones.

1227
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,780
 It's the internal stuff that gets really tricky.

1228
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,300
 External stuff is a little bit easier

1229
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,520
 to diagnose from the self, quote unquote.

1230
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,720
 But yeah, that was what.

1231
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,560
 But I thought that was funny.

1232
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,660
 - He checks his left penis, then his right penis.

1233
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,500
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

1234
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,780
 - Yeah, well, as a Klingon, I do have to.

1235
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,180
 - As a echidna?

1236
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:22,860
 - Yeah, yes, it is the echidna.

1237
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:26,960
 - Well, no, that's exactly with checking everything.

1238
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,100
 In fact, I think it is Santa Claus,

1239
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,340
 who was the very first to practice

1240
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:34,080
 this symmetrical diagnoses.

1241
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,920
 - Is that right?

1242
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,000
 - Yeah, he makes a list, he checks it twice.

1243
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,220
 (laughing)

1244
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,380
 - Gonna find out who's left and who's right.

1245
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,180
 - Yeah, gonna find out if it's an ass,

1246
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,920
 if it's an abscess or not.

1247
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,720
 Yeah, Santa Claus is rectal exam.

1248
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,460
 Yeah, that's it.

1249
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:53,620
 - I wanna give a shout out to Sparta Avenue Stage,

1250
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:56,140
 who hosted me for two shows Friday night

1251
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:59,060
 before my improv reunion up in Sparta, New Jersey.

1252
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:03,300
 I sold out the first show,

1253
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,460
 and then no one likes to stay out late in Sparta.

1254
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,900
 No, not after that.

1255
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,620
 - Sidewalks roll up at eight, huh?

1256
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:09,460
 - Yeah, yeah.

1257
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:12,900
 But no, I know all about that out here.

1258
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:17,900
 First crowd, they gave me a standing ovation, all right?

1259
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,960
 - Wow, fantastic.

1260
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,660
 - And they weren't just leaving.

1261
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:23,480
 - No, no, no.

1262
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,320
 - They weren't just standing up to leave.

1263
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,460
 It was a legitimate standing ovation.

1264
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,500
 - I didn't say, "Wait, guys, turn around.

1265
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,380
 "Just do it this way."

1266
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,420
 - You didn't say, "Hey, everybody,

1267
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,740
 "let's give it up for children with cancer."

1268
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,860
 - Yeah, I blew garbage at them.

1269
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,300
 - Cancer babies, huh?

1270
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,740
 Stand up, stand up for cancer babies.

1271
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:40,500
 Thank you, good night.

1272
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:44,780
 - Oh, side note, I was on a cruise ship

1273
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:49,780
 with this couple, they're big time magicians,

1274
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:54,100
 but they're now more social media people than magicians,

1275
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,940
 but they're Kyle and Misty Knight.

1276
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,820
 And they also-- - Oh, sure.

1277
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:01,260
 - They work backstage with Blaine

1278
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:04,580
 when Blaine comes to town, that they're on Blaine's crew.

1279
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:07,460
 So I told them that I have--

1280
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,780
 - Michael Blaine.

1281
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,880
 - So you were in the theater, Chris Angel was there,

1282
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,100
 and then we started talking about the story,

1283
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,280
 and I was surprised the next day,

1284
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,500
 I gave him Chris Angel as a question stickers.

1285
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,340
 - Oh, awesome. - That I give out at my fest.

1286
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:18,700
 'Cause I give those out at my shows

1287
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,220
 to any Penn Sunday school listener.

1288
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,180
 - Did they love it?

1289
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,700
 - They asked for an extra one for David, so I gave him.

1290
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,380
 - Oh, that's great. - Good, good.

1291
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,940
 - Did you give 'em a chip?

1292
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:29,100
 - They are all chipped up.

1293
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,220
 I don't think that-- - If we can obelisk

1294
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,500
 David Blaine, our life is complete.

1295
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,540
 (laughing)

1296
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,020
 - How funny would it be to have David Blaine

1297
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:40,580
 come do some crazy, death-defying shit at Scoop Fest some year?

1298
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:43,940
 - At my show, do you listen to podcasts or whatever?

1299
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,940
 And I'm jokingly, I'm referring to my own,

1300
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:47,780
 and then people will be like,

1301
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,620
 I like this American life.

1302
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,180
 And then-- (laughing)

1303
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,380
 - Nobody says that.

1304
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:55,120
 - But I have my chips and stickers ready for that,

1305
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,260
 when I'm going to my show. - Kick ass, that's awesome, man.

1306
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,180
 - I do properly chip people at my shows.

1307
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,420
 - Oh yeah, baby, always obelisking, baby.

1308
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,740
 No, no, no, but you know what,

1309
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,020
 and that's the best way to do it.

1310
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,060
 - Well, that's good, because that way, if they get lost

1311
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,500
 and somebody else takes them to the vet,

1312
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,780
 they'll be able to know that they're yours.

1313
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:10,700
 - Well, no, but you're also--

1314
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,300
 - Oh, this is Matt Donnelly's audience.

1315
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,140
 - You're on the road.

1316
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,540
 You've only got so much capacity.

1317
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:20,660
 You can't have all your chips at your disposal, so.

1318
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:21,900
 - No, I can't.

1319
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,980
 Literally, I'm down to three, I have three pounds of leeway.

1320
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:25,820
 (laughing)

1321
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:29,060
 - Exactly, right, yeah, you gotta go light for it.

1322
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:33,020
 - And they are often exactly like 49 and like 47 pounds.

1323
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,580
 So yeah, between the two of them,

1324
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:37,020
 some of it goes up to 50 on me and I get mad.

1325
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:41,220
 But yeah, I've definitely multiple times been that guy

1326
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:42,940
 at the airport who's opening both cases

1327
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,500
 and shoving one jacket from one case into the other.

1328
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,900
 - Yep, yeah. - All that stuff.

1329
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:50,220
 So yeah, no, those chips are heavy, those chips are heavy.

1330
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:52,460
 - Do you feel a sense of betrayal

1331
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:53,540
 or maybe this hasn't happened to you

1332
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,220
 at the airport very often?

1333
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:57,260
 It's happened to me once or twice

1334
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:00,980
 where the scale at the airport is obviously calibrated

1335
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,860
 differently than the scale at my house.

1336
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:04,180
 - Yes.

1337
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:06,140
 - I'm not saying one of them's wrong and one of them's right

1338
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,340
 'cause I don't know, but they are different

1339
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,380
 and that is the most maddening thing

1340
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,980
 that can happen on those travel days.

1341
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,100
 - No, it is.

1342
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,100
 And like, it's not that it happens,

1343
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,100
 like I don't have a scale at home.

1344
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,660
 I really do just lift it up with my arms and go like,

1345
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:19,140
 this feels about the time where it feels right.

1346
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:21,740
 And I'm actually pretty good, right.

1347
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:23,900
 I don't wanna brag, but I will lift any of you up

1348
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,180
 and tell you how much you weigh.

1349
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:27,620
 - Tell you if you're over or under 50 pounds.

1350
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,580
 - Carnival Parker blood.

1351
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,180
 - That's it, just over or under 50, that's it.

1352
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,340
 That's the only task.

1353
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:33,820
 - I don't know, you're good.

1354
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,540
 You can get down there, you'll be fine.

1355
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:37,380
 - Oh, you're at least 53.

1356
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,940
 - So when I pack the same exact stuff

1357
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,940
 and it also is like 51 pounds at the airport

1358
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:43,140
 when I'm going out, I'm like, no,

1359
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:46,140
 I packed this exact same case on the way in

1360
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,900
 and it was 49, you jerk.

1361
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:48,860
 - Yeah.

1362
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,900
 - Yeah. - Liars.

1363
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,580
 - And do they let you go?

1364
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,580
 Are they like, okay, that's close enough.

1365
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:58,660
 - Or are they jerks about it?

1366
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:02,820
 - Do my original foolish trick, but for real.

1367
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:05,940
 Just to get a calculator, start guessing people's weights

1368
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:09,140
 and then when they say this thing is 53 pounds,

1369
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,780
 I rip open my shirt and I have 53 pounds

1370
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,740
 on a piece of duct tape on my chest

1371
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,900
 and then I rip it off and hand it to them.

1372
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:19,580
 Yeah, so wait, what's your question, Jacob?

1373
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:22,100
 - I don't remember.

1374
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,020
 - Great, moving on.

1375
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:25,380
 Jacob, I had a curiosity for you actually.

1376
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,740
 - Okay, hit me.

1377
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:29,260
 - A guy came out, I was unloading groceries,

1378
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:31,620
 I left my trunk open and then I got caught in the backyard

1379
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:35,420
 talking to my family and then a guy knocked on the door

1380
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:37,020
 and then I came up, I was like,

1381
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,860
 I bet my trunk is open still and I opened it and he goes,

1382
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,500
 hey, someone let you know your trunk is open.

1383
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,820
 I said, oh, thanks.

1384
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:43,860
 He goes, do you help with your groceries?

1385
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:46,300
 No, stranger, I do not.

1386
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,460
 And then he goes, hey, we're walking around the neighborhood

1387
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,820
 and we noticed your windows and your beautiful home

1388
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:55,380
 and we wanted to sell you discount windows

1389
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,180
 if you're willing to put our sign in your front yard

1390
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,020
 that you're willing to do this.

1391
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:02,620
 And I go, wait, I've turned this down all the time.

1392
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:04,340
 It's probably the fourth time I've turned a guy down

1393
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:06,700
 with this offer that my house is a model house.

1394
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,860
 But you did this deal, right, Jacob?

1395
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:10,380
 - We did, yeah.

1396
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,900
 - Did it work out?

1397
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:13,720
 Was everything good?

1398
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,560
 - Yes.

1399
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,380
 - Okay.

1400
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:18,060
 - Oh, oh yes, everything was great.

1401
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:19,260
 We saved a lot of money

1402
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,060
 and they took some pictures of the house.

1403
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:24,300
 - It feels scammy, right?

1404
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,940
 And I was trying to figure it out because I was like, wait,

1405
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:28,780
 I think Jacob did this and we never got like a bad report

1406
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:29,620
 after the fact.

1407
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:30,460
 'Cause I think I would have remembered

1408
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,300
 if it went south or something, right?

1409
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,500
 - No, everything went great.

1410
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:37,100
 The bad thing that happened after it was right at,

1411
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,900
 'cause it still cost us a pretty penny to do all of it,

1412
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,540
 but it saved us, it ended up saving us like three grand,

1413
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:47,060
 maybe 3,500 bucks, something like that.

1414
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:50,300
 So not nothing, significant savings for sure.

1415
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,620
 - Windows are very expensive.

1416
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:55,380
 - Yes, the downturn that happened at the end of that story

1417
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,380
 was right after we did that,

1418
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,340
 like a few weeks after we did that,

1419
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,180
 COVID shut everything down

1420
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:04,100
 and most of our income stopped coming in immediately

1421
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,800
 after spending a lot of money on windows.

1422
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,140
 (laughs)

1423
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,180
 We would have been fine.

1424
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:10,420
 We would have been fine not swapping them out.

1425
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:11,580
 - That was us with fake grass.

1426
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:12,420
 We like called to be like,

1427
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:13,660
 can you not install the fake grass?

1428
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:14,900
 And like you already cut it.

1429
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:17,380
 So you save just the installation fee.

1430
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:18,540
 - It is done.

1431
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:19,380
 - And I was like,

1432
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:20,780
 and you just have like a mountain of sand

1433
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:23,520
 on your side of your house, you know?

1434
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,140
 And I was like, oh man.

1435
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:28,140
 I guess go ahead. (laughs)

1436
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,940
 - But so I'm trying to think of what the,

1437
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:33,420
 I think it might simply be the con of it

1438
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:37,180
 is simply that Anderson windows are the standard.

1439
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,820
 Anderson windows are expensive.

1440
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:42,340
 And if you offer cheap windows that aren't Anderson,

1441
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,020
 then people think they're gonna get shitty windows.

1442
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:47,060
 And so the discount element just,

1443
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:50,460
 and by complimenting your house, you feel flattered.

1444
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,460
 And then the idea that you have to hold an advertising thing

1445
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,980
 to save money is like, it's like the same as like,

1446
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,500
 as Paul would say, taking the bottle of water

1447
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:57,340
 for the meeting, right?

1448
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:59,540
 You don't take the water when they offer you water.

1449
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:03,620
 You know, it's like you're creating a currency exchange.

1450
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,460
 - Yes.

1451
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,180
 - So like, I guess like it's simply about like,

1452
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:10,220
 you want to compete with Anderson and you can buy price.

1453
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:13,460
 Competing by price doesn't work unless you do this bit.

1454
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,300
 Is the best that could come up with.

1455
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,420
 - I don't, yeah, 'cause ours were,

1456
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:20,300
 ours weren't Anderson, but they were another big brand.

1457
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,220
 I forget what it was.

1458
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:26,140
 But they're like two or three big brands in town.

1459
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:28,220
 - Isn't Pella one of the big ones?

1460
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:29,340
 - Acme?

1461
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:30,180
 Acme?

1462
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,620
 - Acme, that's it, that's it.

1463
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:33,780
 They sell windows and anvils.

1464
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:34,620
 - Nevar break?

1465
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:36,500
 - That's it.

1466
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,580
 But yeah, so it was like another big brand.

1467
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:40,660
 And so we felt okay with it.

1468
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:43,380
 - He offered me six to 7% off and then we just laughed at him

1469
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:44,220
 until he left our yard.

1470
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,040
 He didn't know why.

1471
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,180
 (laughing)

1472
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:48,660
 - New windows, new windows.

1473
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,900
 (laughing)

1474
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:54,340
 - I'll tell you what, I'll just go get some new windows

1475
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:55,940
 and they're gonna pay full price.

1476
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:57,700
 That's the following sponsor.

1477
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,060
 - Today's show is brought to you by...

1478
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:04,140
 Greek yogurt.

1479
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:07,740
 Yep, that's it, Greek yogurt from Scoop of Henley in 2022.

1480
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:10,300
 This show is also brought to you by Greek yogurt.

1481
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:14,180
 (grunting)

1482
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:23,740
 - There's a bowl.

1483
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:28,820
 - Enter Hey Scoops to check out.

1484
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:30,800
 - Did you just shit yogurt?

1485
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,040
 (laughing)

1486
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,580
 - I didn't just shit it.

1487
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:42,620
 I put it in a bowl.

1488
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:46,140
 - He makes a lot of good points, Donnelly.

1489
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,460
 He makes a lot of good points.

1490
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:48,380
 - Good point, good point.

1491
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:53,940
 - Scoop Jesus in the chat is pointing out

1492
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:58,500
 that it's interesting that they did take some money

1493
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,980
 off of our windows to pay for advertising

1494
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,500
 and now I can't tell you the brand name of the windows.

1495
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,740
 (laughing)

1496
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:12,020
 - Also why we thought it was a con is that your yard

1497
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:15,900
 gets no visible, there's no foot traffic,

1498
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,340
 there's no traffic traffic that goes by your house.

1499
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:21,380
 You live very, you live very remotely.

1500
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:25,060
 - The sign thing wasn't the big deal for ours.

1501
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:26,700
 The big deal for ours was the pictures.

1502
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,100
 - Yeah, pictures on the website.

1503
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,420
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, that makes more sense.

1504
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:31,180
 - 'Cause we have a weird looking house.

1505
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:34,120
 That was, I think that was also why they liked our house

1506
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,340
 was because it's different looking for a Vegas house.

1507
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,980
 - Yeah, it looks like a little cocaine compound.

1508
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,580
 - That's it. - Some cartel.

1509
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:43,900
 - Right, that's precisely what it looks like.

1510
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:47,240
 - That's what everyone, everyone who comes to the barbecue

1511
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,860
 thinks that someone might just break out a machine gun

1512
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:50,300
 and mow everybody down.

1513
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,420
 - Yeah, it's a fair concern.

1514
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,100
 It's a fair concern.

1515
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:57,340
 - You've almost got like a conversation den,

1516
00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:00,340
 conversation pit designed for the living room.

1517
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,860
 - Oh yeah. - Yeah.

1518
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:02,820
 - Dropped floor.

1519
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:09,740
 - So I am doing the second show at the Sparta Avenue stage

1520
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:10,660
 up at Sparta, New Jersey.

1521
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:12,580
 Wonderful theater, great community,

1522
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:13,700
 run by awesome people.

1523
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:17,140
 - Awesome people who go to bed early.

1524
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:19,020
 - This is the late night one sparsely attended?

1525
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,500
 - Yes, the sparsely attended one and it is,

1526
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,300
 they boosted us by reaching out to their friends.

1527
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,940
 Of course, it's a local magic community surrounding that.

1528
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:29,940
 So my magician to regular human ratio

1529
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,980
 in my second show is a little off.

1530
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:32,900
 - Sure.

1531
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,980
 - And this is the thing, it's like magicians just don't,

1532
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,980
 as much as they want, even the most respectful magician

1533
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:39,100
 is just hard to be a regular audience member

1534
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,140
 when you're doing magic, right?

1535
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:43,460
 So a couple of people who just don't want to do certain,

1536
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:44,740
 they give me a look like you don't want to use me

1537
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:46,620
 for this kind of thing when I'm trying to get people

1538
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:47,460
 from the audience.

1539
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,300
 There's a lot of volunteers on my show.

1540
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,460
 - Yeah.

1541
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:51,460
 - This one guy was kind of like,

1542
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:52,620
 I busted his balls a little bit

1543
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,260
 and he was a very chatty person.

1544
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:59,420
 And then, so for, when I have a small amount of crowds,

1545
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:02,660
 I don't get new people, you know, for straight as Jack.

1546
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,580
 - You use the same folks over and over.

1547
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:05,500
 - I just go to the two guys

1548
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,060
 that have stood out the most, right?

1549
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:07,900
 - Okay, yeah.

1550
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:08,820
 - 'Cause basically like I can't,

1551
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,820
 I can't constantly get two other guys kind of thing.

1552
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,500
 And so I just call them by name.

1553
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,380
 They get up quickly, they get on the show faster.

1554
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,540
 And so I bring a guy up

1555
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,060
 who I've been messing with a little bit throughout the show

1556
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:23,340
 and he'd be messing with me back a little bit.

1557
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:25,580
 But I go to raise the curtain and he covers my face.

1558
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,900
 And this is a bit that comes up oftentimes

1559
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,660
 with drunk dudes on cruise ships.

1560
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:30,500
 - Right.

1561
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,900
 - Where I'm trying to do my finale

1562
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,740
 and I do the joke where they raise the curtain too high

1563
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:35,980
 and get them to lower it, I talk over it.

1564
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:37,660
 And then some people think it's funny

1565
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,220
 just to keep covering my face.

1566
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:40,620
 And I let that laugh happen

1567
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:41,740
 and then I try to move on with the trick

1568
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:43,180
 and then they keep doing it.

1569
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,500
 And then I point out to them,

1570
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,500
 hey, this bit's getting diminishing returns.

1571
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,740
 Did you have people laughed at it and now they're not?

1572
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,540
 Just letting you know.

1573
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,260
 You can stop doing the bit and let me go.

1574
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:54,100
 - It was a fine bit.

1575
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,980
 It was a fine bit a second ago.

1576
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,380
 - And this guy won't stop doing the bit,

1577
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:59,100
 won't stop trying to say funny things,

1578
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:01,300
 won't stop trying to upstage me through the entire thing.

1579
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:04,340
 It basically kicks all of my jokes right in the dick.

1580
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,700
 And I can't, I can't.

1581
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:07,540
 - Can't get it going.

1582
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:08,700
 - And so it ends fine.

1583
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:09,580
 The show ends fine.

1584
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:12,140
 I still get out, it's still surprising.

1585
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:14,820
 I produce beers, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1586
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,100
 And the show's over.

1587
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:21,220
 And then he comes right up to me after the show,

1588
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:22,340
 some signing posters right there

1589
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,020
 and hitting up chips possibly.

1590
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,260
 And--

1591
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:27,020
 - Not to this motherfucker.

1592
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:27,860
 - Right.

1593
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:29,620
 And he goes, hey, just wanted to say,

1594
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:31,100
 I've really enjoyed your show.

1595
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,220
 I've been a professional magician for the last 34 years.

1596
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:34,380
 - The fuck you have.

1597
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:35,220
 - No.

1598
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:36,660
 - The fuck you have.

1599
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,860
 You've been a professional cocksucker.

1600
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:40,940
 You've been a professional piece of shit.

1601
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:42,060
 - That's exactly it.

1602
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:44,420
 My head just goes, that just can't be true.

1603
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:45,260
 - No.

1604
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:47,500
 - That just can't, that just can't be the information.

1605
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,940
 - Did you ask him when his last paid gig was?

1606
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:54,340
 When was the last time people paid you to perform magic?

1607
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,180
 - Even backstage.

1608
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,020
 - Yeah, what'd you pay job?

1609
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:59,340
 - The other magicians who helped me pack up were like,

1610
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:00,620
 that was really weird.

1611
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:03,260
 He was, that was weird of him to do what he did to you.

1612
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:04,620
 And I was like, I agree.

1613
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:08,300
 - Especially if he's claiming to be a magician.

1614
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:10,220
 What a fucking asshole.

1615
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,220
 - And then on top of that,

1616
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:15,580
 because the way the guy introduced me,

1617
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,660
 it felt weird to just go right into like, whatever.

1618
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,540
 And so I started talking about

1619
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:20,300
 how I became a magician to the second crowd.

1620
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:22,660
 I was just trying to, they also, no one would sit up front.

1621
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:24,380
 So I was trying to like endear them and to be like,

1622
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:25,780
 hey, we're hanging out.

1623
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:28,060
 So I just told my story of learning how to pen,

1624
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:30,020
 dare me to learn magic and all that other stuff.

1625
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:32,260
 And then I went into my show.

1626
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:34,940
 I'll do that if I feel like an audience is like super cagey.

1627
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:36,740
 I'll just tell my actual story of becoming a magician

1628
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:38,860
 to be like, we're cool.

1629
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:41,180
 - Try and change the temperature in the room a little bit.

1630
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:42,140
 - Yeah, yeah.

1631
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:43,260
 So I guess that compelled him to like,

1632
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:46,900
 then he wanted to tell me his entire life story as well.

1633
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:48,420
 - Oh, for fuck's sake.

1634
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:50,340
 Oh, this is great.

1635
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:52,340
 - And then I'm trying to get chips and stickers

1636
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:53,540
 to two people I recognize

1637
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:56,420
 from coming to my show multiple times.

1638
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:57,260
 - Oh yeah.

1639
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:58,900
 - And he almost seems like annoyed

1640
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,100
 where like he gets through part of his thing.

1641
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:00,940
 I was like, oh cool.

1642
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,420
 And I went like, let me just get this thing real quick.

1643
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:05,460
 And he seemed like annoyed that I wasn't like hearing him

1644
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:08,020
 tell his story. - No, you can't.

1645
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:11,340
 I'm fine with coming up to you and telling you a story.

1646
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:14,220
 I'm fine with saying I'm a magician as well.

1647
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:15,260
 I'm fine with all this.

1648
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:18,500
 You don't get to be annoyed when the group of people

1649
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:19,980
 that you're doing the thing with

1650
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:22,180
 is still a group of people.

1651
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:23,660
 - Exactly, exactly.

1652
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,380
 - Nothing has changed here.

1653
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:26,220
 - Oh.

1654
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:27,500
 - Jeff Loomis in chat says

1655
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,820
 that he has to be your apprentice.

1656
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:31,820
 Jeff, in a way he was asking me to become his apprentice.

1657
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:32,660
 - Right.

1658
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:33,500
 - In a way.

1659
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,340
 He basically was saying like-

1660
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:35,340
 - And what did you say?

1661
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:36,700
 - I heard your story and just let you know

1662
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,980
 I'm way more experienced than you.

1663
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:40,260
 - Oh my fucking God.

1664
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:42,940
 - Oh.

1665
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:45,740
 - You probably noticed how well I handled you on stage.

1666
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:47,500
 That's just a little taste of what I can do.

1667
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,340
 - Yeah.

1668
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:51,340
 I don't know if you saw me fucking destroying on there

1669
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:52,420
 during your bit.

1670
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:53,260
 Taking your bit to the next level.

1671
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:54,140
 - Oh, destroying my show?

1672
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:54,980
 Yes, I saw that.

1673
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:57,260
 - I didn't see you destroy my show as a matter of fact.

1674
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,100
 - Yeah.

1675
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,220
 - Yeah.

1676
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:01,060
 - Wow. - Yeah, yeah.

1677
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:03,180
 It was, I, it was, that was the,

1678
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:05,580
 that was the strangest part of it for sure.

1679
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:06,420
 - Yeah.

1680
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,420
 - Did you see "Chaotic Clumsies" line?

1681
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:10,900
 That's, you should use that in the future.

1682
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:13,540
 - You tell me it's bigger tits to be that irritating.

1683
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:15,780
 (laughing)

1684
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:20,420
 - I am gonna steal that.

1685
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:21,260
 - Yes.

1686
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:22,740
 - Yeah. - That's pretty fucking good.

1687
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:23,580
 Pretty fucking good.

1688
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:24,420
 - His were pretty big though.

1689
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:25,260
 His were pretty big.

1690
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:26,420
 (laughing)

1691
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:27,420
 - Okay.

1692
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:28,820
 So you say he was justified.

1693
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:29,660
 - Yeah.

1694
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:33,140
 - Yeah.

1695
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:35,420
 That was, that was really, really, really strange.

1696
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:37,220
 - Sorry, you had to go through that shit.

1697
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:38,060
 - No, no, no.

1698
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:40,660
 I mean, I overall had a fantastic night.

1699
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:41,820
 It was so fun. - Right, yeah.

1700
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:43,980
 - And it was, you know, even, even,

1701
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:46,100
 even though the audience was a little different,

1702
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,300
 you know, for the second show,

1703
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,140
 obviously if you do a show that's sold out

1704
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:50,260
 and you get a setting ovation,

1705
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:52,500
 the second show's not gonna check all the same boxes.

1706
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,340
 - Exactly.

1707
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:54,180
 - Yeah, yeah.

1708
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:55,860
 - But you've got that one in your pocket

1709
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,340
 rather than coming off a bad show

1710
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:59,340
 trying to get the energy back up again.

1711
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:00,180
 - And it basically, like I said,

1712
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:01,180
 I'm recording both shows.

1713
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:04,180
 So it's usually, it's, I'm finding that the moments

1714
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:06,180
 that I find most awkward from my shows

1715
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:08,220
 are making the best reels on my social media.

1716
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:09,060
 (laughing)

1717
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:10,140
 - Of course.

1718
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:13,180
 - Well, I was like, well, at least this is taped

1719
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:14,020
 and I'm sure there's more bits

1720
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:15,020
 that come out of it this way.

1721
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:15,860
 - There you go.

1722
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:17,860
 - I bet, I bet the clip of him upstaging me

1723
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:20,100
 with the bit is gonna make a fine clip

1724
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,780
 for the social media. - Oh yeah, mm-hmm.

1725
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:26,060
 - But it was, yeah, so I just went to the second show,

1726
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:28,740
 just like, great, another show, let's just do it.

1727
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:30,900
 But it was super fun, super fun.

1728
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:31,740
 - Nice.

1729
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:32,580
 - Yeah, that was just the only thing.

1730
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:35,820
 - And so would you say that your, I don't know,

1731
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:38,180
 roughly eight months away from your family

1732
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:39,620
 have been worth it?

1733
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:42,180
 - It feels like it, it feels like eight months.

1734
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:44,140
 Anything more than two is just, yeah,

1735
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:46,060
 everything feels a little weird at home.

1736
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:48,260
 - When SJ said last night, she was like,

1737
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:50,700
 oh yeah, I texted Matt and Sarah about coming over,

1738
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:51,980
 I hadn't heard from them yet.

1739
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:54,940
 And I was like, oh, Matt has,

1740
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:55,940
 I don't know if you know this,

1741
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:58,580
 Matt has been gone since ScoopFest.

1742
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:00,300
 - Yeah, and also, - She was like what?

1743
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,380
 - ScoopFest doesn't count as me really being at home either.

1744
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:03,420
 - Right. - Right.

1745
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:07,260
 - You know, like, I don't really see anybody in the fam,

1746
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:10,580
 so it was really, ended up being a really weird thing, so yeah.

1747
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:12,020
 - Extra weakest shit, yeah.

1748
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:12,860
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1749
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:14,020
 - Kids are all grown up.

1750
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:19,020
 - Well, there was like, there was like a crisis.

1751
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:22,180
 Like, my kids' soccer team while I was gone,

1752
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:23,740
 that I wasn't there for, that was annoying.

1753
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,660
 - Oh no. - Basically.

1754
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:29,660
 Like, my youngest kids' soccer team,

1755
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:31,740
 they don't, like, they always keep

1756
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:32,740
 a certain core group of players

1757
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:34,740
 that always get new players every year.

1758
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:36,460
 - Okay. - And my kids'

1759
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:39,020
 soccer coach is not like, you know,

1760
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:41,700
 basically, as teams get, you know,

1761
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:43,620
 move on and stay together or whatever,

1762
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:45,700
 some coaches basically recruit.

1763
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:46,540
 You know, basically, - Oh, sure.

1764
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:48,660
 - Help other kids hop over to the other team.

1765
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:51,860
 And my kids' coach does not do that.

1766
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:55,500
 He just takes the random allotment.

1767
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:59,460
 Like, I believe that's actually fair to the league, right?

1768
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:02,820
 - And probably the healthier way to go about it as well.

1769
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:05,060
 - Right, so, but what ends up happening

1770
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:07,780
 is that we end up getting kids who aren't quite

1771
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:09,580
 in demand for any other team.

1772
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:10,780
 - Right.

1773
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:12,900
 - And they're not in demand, not because they're maybe bad,

1774
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,300
 but sometimes they're not in demand

1775
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:15,940
 because they don't like Trilla.

1776
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:17,260
 They just don't, they don't.

1777
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:18,780
 - Sure, they're not reliable.

1778
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:20,300
 - They're not reliable.

1779
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:25,140
 And so, basically, my whole season,

1780
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:27,300
 my youngest has been playing with, like,

1781
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:30,020
 either one man down or just enough to play the whole game

1782
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:33,380
 with no subs for the entire season.

1783
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:35,620
 - That's hard, how can you even win

1784
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:37,140
 when you don't have any fun?

1785
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:40,820
 - They almost had a forfeit of game while I was gone.

1786
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:44,780
 And so, it's been a bummer to not be there for him.

1787
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,420
 - If you had been there for that one,

1788
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:49,140
 would they have let you suit up and head out on the field

1789
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:50,780
 to be the last player that they needed?

1790
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:52,540
 - I mean, I have my cleats, you know?

1791
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:54,180
 I have my shin guards.

1792
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:55,380
 - Good, good.

1793
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:56,860
 - And I have a forged birth certificate

1794
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:58,460
 saying that I am 10 years old.

1795
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:01,020
 - Well, you got everything you need, though.

1796
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:03,780
 - I'm willing to just march it on out.

1797
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:06,700
 - Is that kid, I don't know if that kid's 10 years,

1798
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:08,180
 we need to see a birth certificate.

1799
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:10,060
 - You know what, no, seriously.

1800
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:11,660
 - Let him play, don't worry.

1801
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:12,860
 Do not worry about him.

1802
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:17,260
 - If you think your kid can't outrun that guy, you are wrong.

1803
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:18,900
 - You'll be surprised to know, Matt,

1804
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:21,220
 that currently, what you just talked about,

1805
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:24,180
 cleats, shin guards, and a forged birth certificate

1806
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:26,500
 stating you're 10 years old are also required

1807
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,460
 to work in a bodega now in America.

1808
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:32,700
 - Interesting.

1809
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,820
 - I'll tell you what's not gonna work for you,

1810
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:37,220
 this jock versus nerd, you're gonna get whooped.

1811
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:39,260
 - Bullshit, I'm getting crack on.

1812
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:41,260
 - You're doing a jock versus nerd action?

1813
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:42,100
 - Oh, am I?

1814
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:43,500
 - Fuck yeah.

1815
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,860
 - I'm on the hunt for balls.

1816
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:48,440
 (upbeat music)

1817
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:54,220
 - I'm on the hunt for balls.

1818
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:55,060
 - No!

1819
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:58,500
 Oh, we got an obelisk coming to us today

1820
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:01,180
 from the upside down under scoop.

1821
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:03,340
 This is the one where you have the pyramid

1822
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:04,620
 of all the different prices.

1823
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:06,660
 The questions start at $200,

1824
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:08,940
 they go all the way up to $5,000.

1825
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:10,780
 We have double downs.

1826
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:12,920
 We have steals, we have super steals,

1827
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:14,820
 where we also steal the other person's money,

1828
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:16,300
 and it's a 50/50 thing.

1829
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:19,560
 If you miss a question, you lose control of the board,

1830
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:21,660
 and that's how the game works.

1831
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:23,380
 The $200 question's coming to me first,

1832
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:27,700
 and the question is about Famous Dick, Famous Dick.

1833
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:28,820
 I'm not gonna double down,

1834
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:30,280
 I'm betting nobody's gonna steal,

1835
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:33,340
 so let's see what the question is.

1836
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:37,580
 Ron Jeremy was also known as A, The Hippo,

1837
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:42,580
 B, The Hedgehog, C, The Horse, or D, The Whale.

1838
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:47,020
 D, The Whale is a great porn name.

1839
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:48,620
 My name is D, The Whale.

1840
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:51,380
 - D, The Whale, Dick, The Whale.

1841
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:55,700
 - I would say The Hedgehog, he was The Hedgehog.

1842
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:56,940
 - Absolutely.

1843
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:58,320
 - Yeah, there he is.

1844
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:01,100
 - He's been just, he's just bad, bad, bad.

1845
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,580
 Is he in jail now, did he die?

1846
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:04,980
 - I believe he's in jail. - I don't think he's dead.

1847
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:06,580
 - I don't think he's dead.

1848
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:07,820
 - Okay. - Oh.

1849
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:11,100
 - Yeah, he's been bad, he got bad.

1850
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,340
 - I agree. - He got worse.

1851
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:13,460
 He was bad from the jump,

1852
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:14,580
 but he got worse as time went on.

1853
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:19,140
 - Sure, and man, his version of Miley Cyrus's Wrecking Ball

1854
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:20,340
 is still fantastic, though.

1855
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:21,700
 - Oh, I don't know if anyone heard it.

1856
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:23,700
 - Separating art from artists there, no problem.

1857
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:24,900
 - That's right, that's right. - No problem,

1858
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:26,260
 because Wrecking Ball is just beautiful.

1859
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:28,100
 - We can do that. - Yeah.

1860
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:31,780
 I'd say Famous Tits, Famous Tits, anybody wanna steal?

1861
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:33,660
 - Oh, I mean, it's a category I feel great about,

1862
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:35,620
 but it's too early in the game to steal.

1863
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:37,020
 - This is one that you know a lot about.

1864
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:38,820
 I'm glad it's a low dollar question.

1865
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:42,620
 This set of Famous Tits are held in place, allegedly,

1866
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:47,620
 by a 40 double D bra, Dolly Parton, Anna Nicole Smith,

1867
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:50,300
 Pamela Anderson, and Kat Dennings.

1868
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:51,700
 - Ooh. - I'm pretty sure

1869
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:54,220
 this is a Dolly Parton story,

1870
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:56,340
 so I'm gonna say A, Dolly Parton.

1871
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:59,660
 It is Dolly Parton. - Hooray.

1872
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:02,020
 - Anna Nicole Smith was the only one

1873
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:03,260
 that gave me pause there. - Oh, she does have

1874
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:04,940
 Famous Tits.

1875
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:08,020
 - Ah. (laughs)

1876
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:08,860
 - Well, that's Dolly Parton. - It's not something

1877
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:10,820
 I ever think about with Dolly Parton.

1878
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:17,700
 Famous Farms, Famous Farms, anybody Famous Farms?

1879
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:21,020
 No, here's the question. - Told McDonald's.

1880
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:25,900
 - Tyler Sheridan owns this Famous Texas Ranch.

1881
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:28,900
 Two sixes, five sixes, four sixes, or six sixes?

1882
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:31,740
 - Oh my goodness. - Well, I don't know.

1883
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:36,940
 I'm not using a 50/50 on this one.

1884
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:40,100
 - I'm at a loss for Taylor Sheridan.

1885
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:40,940
 Who is that?

1886
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:42,660
 Is that a ball player?

1887
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:46,220
 - Also known for his tits and from the south.

1888
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:47,860
 - Oh, okay. - Huge tits.

1889
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:53,900
 I think it's, let's say five sixes, B, five sixes.

1890
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:55,340
 No, it's four sixes.

1891
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:57,060
 I was one six off. - Oh, one six off.

1892
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:58,260
 - So close.

1893
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:01,900
 - Matt, that goes to you, Famous Farmer.

1894
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:03,740
 Anybody wanna double down or steal?

1895
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:07,380
 - I'm prepared to answer. - Here we go.

1896
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:08,220
 (laughs)

1897
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:11,100
 This Canadian farmer supplements his farming income

1898
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:13,740
 to the tune of around $1 million a year

1899
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:17,900
 with YouTube videos jabbering on about farming shit.

1900
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:21,140
 Is it the New Age Farmer, the Millennial Farmer,

1901
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:24,380
 the Geriatric Farmer, or the Gen X Farmer?

1902
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:28,820
 - I doubt it's the Geriatric Farmer.

1903
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:34,500
 - Gen X Farmer, the Millennial Farmer, New Age Farmer.

1904
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:38,340
 - B and D feel right to me, but I don't know.

1905
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:39,180
 - Yeah, exactly.

1906
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:43,740
 It's like, yeah, the social media's conditioned younger

1907
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:46,340
 people to just constantly talk about their generation.

1908
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,500
 (clicks tongue)

1909
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:54,020
 - Let's see, I'm gonna go B, the Millennial Farmer.

1910
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:55,060
 - Let's try it.

1911
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:55,900
 It is B, the Millennial Farmer.

1912
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:57,340
 - Hooray. - The Millennial Farmer.

1913
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:58,180
 - Well done.

1914
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:00,180
 - Oh, all the math was done, it just worked out.

1915
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:02,820
 And in one question, Matt is now ahead.

1916
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:04,100
 (Matt laughs)

1917
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:08,460
 The $1,000 question, Famous Dick, Famous Dick.

1918
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:10,740
 - All right. - Anybody wanna do anything?

1919
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:12,500
 Here we go.

1920
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:14,460
 This porn actor from the '60s

1921
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:19,460
 reportedly had an 18-inch denus, a denus, dingus, a denus.

1922
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:22,580
 - A denus, a denus. - A denus.

1923
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:24,340
 Funky cold, a denus.

1924
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:30,540
 Is that Long Shlong Silver, Long John Delver,

1925
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:35,220
 Long Dong Silver, or Long Dong Delver?

1926
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:36,340
 Good Lord.

1927
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:39,340
 Come on, Matt, you were just talking about this guy.

1928
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:44,420
 - Long Dong Silver.

1929
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:45,260
 D.

1930
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:46,180
 - C.

1931
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:47,020
 You said C or D?

1932
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:48,100
 - C.

1933
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:51,140
 - C, Long Dong Silver is correct.

1934
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:52,340
 - Hooray.

1935
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:53,180
 - There we go.

1936
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:55,180
 - I mean, it had to be Long Dong Silver.

1937
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:56,420
 - Long Dong Silver.

1938
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:57,260
 - That was me pretending

1939
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:58,780
 like I didn't have all of his catalog.

1940
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:00,740
 - Number one super guy.

1941
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:03,380
 Do you remember that Chris Rock portrayed Long Dong Silver

1942
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:04,980
 in his SNL sketch?

1943
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:08,140
 - No. - Yes.

1944
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:09,700
 - There you go.

1945
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:10,540
 Yarn in six, what are you eating?

1946
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:11,500
 - A $1,200 question.

1947
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,140
 - You don't have to get online, you can just type it.

1948
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:14,700
 What are you eating?

1949
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:15,780
 - I'm very curious.

1950
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:20,420
 - $1,200 question, we're back to Famous Tits.

1951
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:23,060
 Famous Tits, anybody wanna do anything?

1952
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:24,180
 - I'll steal.

1953
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:25,020
 - What?

1954
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:25,860
 - Paul's gonna steal.

1955
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:26,860
 - Regular steal.

1956
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:28,020
 - He loves them tits.

1957
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:30,180
 This modern day Romanian porn star

1958
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:33,500
 has a bra size of 34 M.

1959
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:34,540
 - Jesus Christ.

1960
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:39,540
 - Is it Busty Emma, Busty Juggs, Busty Boobs,

1961
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:40,940
 or Busty Elma?

1962
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:44,180
 - I'm gonna go Busty Elma, 'cause she's Romanian, D.

1963
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:47,020
 - Dad, let's see.

1964
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:49,740
 Oh, you're so close, it's Busty Emma.

1965
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:50,580
 Busty Emma.

1966
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:54,180
 - Chocolate Moose Tracks ice cream,

1967
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:55,740
 well, that sounds delicious.

1968
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:58,260
 - Well, at least I don't lose any points.

1969
01:10:58,260 --> 01:10:59,100
 - That's true.

1970
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:00,140
 - I still have a super steal.

1971
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:01,380
 - Credit to Yarn in Six for making this

1972
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:02,860
 an actual ice cream social.

1973
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:06,340
 - Yeah.

1974
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:07,180
 - Well done.

1975
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:11,660
 - Matt, it's back to you, it's a $1,400 question

1976
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:14,420
 about farming, about farming.

1977
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:16,100
 Anybody wanna do anything?

1978
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:17,940
 - It's back to me, I'm excited.

1979
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,660
 - Yeah, it comes back to you, Paul stole it

1980
01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:21,460
 and got it wrong, so it just comes right on back.

1981
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:22,300
 - Oh, I see, okay.

1982
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:23,460
 - That's cool.

1983
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:26,300
 With harvest not far away for us down under,

1984
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:29,020
 how many hours a day on average do I sit

1985
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:31,500
 in the tractor doing my thing?

1986
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:36,180
 24, 12, 10, or 15, doing my thing is definitely masturbating.

1987
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:39,300
 - Right, and then these numbers must be minutes or seconds.

1988
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:42,460
 - Or a refractory period afterwards.

1989
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:48,340
 - Let's see here, I have no idea.

1990
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:51,140
 So let's go 50/50 on this one.

1991
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:54,980
 - All right, that got rid of 12 and 10,

1992
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:57,900
 so you got A, 24, or D, 15.

1993
01:11:57,900 --> 01:12:02,620
 - Well, he's not 24 hours.

1994
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:03,460
 - There you go.

1995
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:07,940
 - He's not on the tractor on average 24 hours a day.

1996
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:10,900
 - It's harvest time to start meth-ing for a few months.

1997
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:15,260
 - Ah, good Lord, I lose more teeth every harvest.

1998
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:16,860
 - Just so much meth.

1999
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:20,340
 - So I'll go with 15.

2000
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:24,820
 - Let's try 15, D, 15, and the 50/50 answer

2001
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:26,740
 has never worked better in this game.

2002
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:29,660
 - Out here gathering my molars at harvest time.

2003
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:36,500
 - Ah, holy shit, it was a $1,600 question.

2004
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:39,780
 Matt has 3,200, I have 600, and Paul has zero.

2005
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:41,900
 - Oh, but you still have a super steal.

2006
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:42,900
 - I do still have a super steal.

2007
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,340
 - You can take all my points.

2008
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:46,660
 - You still have a, we all still have double downs.

2009
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:47,500
 - Yeah.

2010
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,140
 - And definitely not a cult.

2011
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:51,540
 I'll try a steal, I'll try a regular old steal.

2012
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:54,300
 - All right, that protects my points.

2013
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:55,300
 - It does.

2014
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:58,180
 This chart doesn't officially have cult status,

2015
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:01,460
 but it is the starting point for a few cult leaders

2016
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:04,820
 like David Koresh and George Spate.

2017
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:08,300
 Scientology, Catholic Church, Seventh-day Adventist Church,

2018
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,460
 or Church of Latter-day Saints.

2019
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:16,660
 I mean, I feel like we could just say

2020
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:18,860
 the Catholic Church is the root of all of it.

2021
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:23,140
 But I believe this is Seventh-day Adventist.

2022
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:26,260
 - I mean, the Catholic Church doesn't have cool compounds.

2023
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:27,460
 - That's true, that's true.

2024
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:28,300
 - They have one.

2025
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:29,700
 - C is, I mean, the Vatican.

2026
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:31,220
 - They have one cool compound.

2027
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:34,420
 - But it's not really cool unless you're into fucking kids.

2028
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:37,020
 - Yeah.

2029
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:37,860
 - Allegedly.

2030
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:39,420
 (laughing)

2031
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:40,940
 - We all just stopped and thought about

2032
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:42,060
 the different jokes we could make,

2033
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:43,700
 and we all decided to just move on.

2034
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:45,420
 - That's all very true. - 25 words is all the question.

2035
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:47,220
 - I was like, nope, nope, nope, nope.

2036
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:49,060
 - That's it, I thought of at least four,

2037
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:50,780
 and I passed on all of them.

2038
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:52,340
 - But here's the offer, once again,

2039
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:54,340
 there are many, many people in the Catholic Church,

2040
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:56,340
 fucks a lot of kids, and I don't know why,

2041
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:59,980
 that's not a bigger deal for us taking on this earth.

2042
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:01,700
 - It is one of those things that I will,

2043
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:03,500
 I will put my stake in the ground on that,

2044
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:06,020
 and I will speak about it because it is infuriating to me,

2045
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:07,660
 and it has affected my life directly

2046
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:10,540
 in a lot of negative ways, fuck the Catholic Church forever.

2047
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:11,380
 - Yeah.

2048
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:12,660
 (laughing)

2049
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:15,740
 - Famous farms, famous farms, anybody wanna do anything?

2050
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:20,740
 Stealing, I don't wanna double down on farms, here we go.

2051
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:25,820
 This Australian station, just a big farm,

2052
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:30,780
 it shares a surname name with a famous Aussie movie star.

2053
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:32,820
 Is it Crowe station, Jackman station,

2054
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:35,060
 Robbie station, or Kidman station?

2055
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:37,740
 - On that tractor, I'm doing Jackman station.

2056
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:39,340
 - Yeah.

2057
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:40,540
 - For 24 minutes.

2058
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:43,380
 - Um, boy.

2059
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:48,340
 I'm just gonna guess at this one, I'm gonna say,

2060
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:49,860
 this feels like a Hugh Jackman,

2061
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:52,220
 I'm going with the Jackman here, let's go.

2062
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:53,660
 B, Jackman station.

2063
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:57,300
 Oh, it's Kidman station.

2064
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:58,260
 - Damn it.

2065
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:00,980
 - Nicole Kidman and her big ass farm.

2066
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:02,820
 (laughing)

2067
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:06,100
 Shit, it goes back to Madigan, dick locations.

2068
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:08,100
 - I've got a super steel.

2069
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:10,340
 - Oh no. - Paul with the super steel.

2070
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:11,900
 - You son of a bitch.

2071
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:14,020
 - I mean, I'll probably lose.

2072
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:16,220
 - This dick themed Aussie beach

2073
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,500
 located in Queensland is called,

2074
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:21,140
 A, Dickie Beach, B, Peter Beach,

2075
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:24,740
 C, Todger Beach, or D, Dick Beach.

2076
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:27,020
 - I'll go C, Todger Beach.

2077
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:30,020
 - Todger Beach, Dick Beach, private hide.

2078
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:31,940
 No, I'm sorry, it's Dickie Beach.

2079
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:33,860
 - Dickie Beach.

2080
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:34,820
 - Dickie Beach.

2081
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:36,380
 - I would have done the same exact answer,

2082
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:37,500
 I would have thought Australia's gotta have

2083
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,300
 weird words for dicks and love names

2084
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:40,900
 after those weird words.

2085
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:42,340
 (laughing)

2086
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:44,300
 - Todger. - Holy shit.

2087
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:45,780
 It goes back to Matt.

2088
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:48,140
 - Talley Whacker Island next to Dick Beach.

2089
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:49,540
 - Dick locations.

2090
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:51,700
 Matt, are you doubling down?

2091
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:52,540
 - Yes. - 'Cause if not,

2092
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:53,620
 I'm stealing.

2093
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:55,580
 - I'm doubling down to ward off the steal.

2094
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:56,860
 - Matt is doubling down.

2095
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:57,700
 - Smart.

2096
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:02,060
 This tit themed Aussie town in Victoria is called,

2097
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:05,180
 A, Tits Creek, B, Titty Song,

2098
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:09,020
 C, Titty Bong, or D, Boobs Head.

2099
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:11,060
 - All right, this is where it gets tough, right?

2100
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:13,660
 I already used my 50/50.

2101
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:16,060
 - I should have used my 50/50, I'm a dummy.

2102
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:17,460
 - Yeah, you're dumb, but.

2103
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:20,220
 (laughing)

2104
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:24,260
 So from Paul's mistake, logic dictates Tits Creek.

2105
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:26,140
 But boy, does Titty Bong sound Australian

2106
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:26,980
 as anything I've ever heard in my life.

2107
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:28,380
 - That really does, man.

2108
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:30,060
 That's what I was going for, is Titty Bong.

2109
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:30,900
 - And Boobs Head.

2110
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:33,500
 - And Boobs Head also feels Australian to me.

2111
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:34,740
 - Yeah, but Titty Bong.

2112
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:38,500
 Like, isn't Billabong a Aussie thing?

2113
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:39,580
 - Yes.

2114
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:40,780
 - So, Titty Bong.

2115
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:45,220
 Also that could be mistaken for the universal greeting

2116
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:47,060
 of the junkieons.

2117
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:49,700
 Bah-weep-grah-nah-weep-nitty-bong.

2118
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:51,100
 - I was gonna say that, yeah.

2119
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:51,940
 - Yeah, yeah.

2120
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:53,860
 - That's the universal greeting.

2121
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:55,620
 - Yeah, of the things, yeah.

2122
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:57,140
 - I'm just stalling for someone to type

2123
01:16:57,140 --> 01:16:58,340
 the right answer in the chat.

2124
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:00,180
 - Ha, you sneak.

2125
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:02,940
 (laughing)

2126
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:04,940
 - I'll go, I know it's gonna be wrong,

2127
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:05,780
 but I can't help it.

2128
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:09,460
 I have to put all of my might behind Titty Bong.

2129
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:10,420
 I just want it to be that.

2130
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:13,420
 - All of the eggs going into the Titty Bong basket.

2131
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,260
 - Yeah! - It's correct!

2132
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:15,900
 - I would've got that right.

2133
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:18,380
 (laughing)

2134
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:20,260
 - Titty Bong is always correct.

2135
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:22,140
 (laughing)

2136
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:23,740
 $5,000 question.

2137
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:26,180
 I have to super steal it here at the end

2138
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:28,100
 for a random question.

2139
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:29,380
 This is the game.

2140
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:36,340
 My favorite ICS episode is, hint, it's polarizing.

2141
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:37,180
 - Oh.

2142
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:38,460
 - A, Don Poseidon.

2143
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:40,340
 B, Taco Bell Hospital.

2144
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:42,420
 C, Bonnie's Ball Hospice.

2145
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:43,780
 That's the Milk Leg episode.

2146
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:47,340
 Or D, Rod Stewart's Bread Surrogate.

2147
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:49,860
 - Oh, those are all polarizing episodes.

2148
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:51,820
 - My guess would be A or C.

2149
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:57,540
 - Let's see, either Don Poseidon or Bonnie's Ball Hospice.

2150
01:17:57,540 --> 01:18:00,100
 But I mean, Taco Bell Hospital is,

2151
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:02,420
 that's the gnarly one that has all of the,

2152
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:04,460
 it's gotta get a lot of gross stuff in that one.

2153
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:05,980
 - I guess so.

2154
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:07,500
 - And Rod Stewart's Bread Surrogate,

2155
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:11,380
 that was, wasn't that a Great Night episode?

2156
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:12,860
 Wasn't that another Great Night episode?

2157
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:13,860
 - Bread Surrogate was not.

2158
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:16,900
 - No, no, that was, we did that way back in your house,

2159
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:17,980
 way back. - Okay.

2160
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:21,220
 Oh wait, I have a 50/50.

2161
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:22,980
 I'm gonna not be like Paul and use my 50/50.

2162
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:24,740
 - Yeah, smart, use your 50/50.

2163
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:26,420
 - That got rid of A and D.

2164
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:30,340
 Don Poseidon and Rod Stewart's Bread Surrogate are out.

2165
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:31,180
 - Yeah.

2166
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:33,100
 See, I thought it was A or C, so.

2167
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:35,180
 - You know, I've wanted Taco Bell Hospital

2168
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:36,020
 from the beginning.

2169
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:37,060
 I'm going with Taco Bell Hospital B.

2170
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:37,900
 - Oh, really?

2171
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:40,060
 - Final answer.

2172
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:41,620
 - C? - It's Bonnie's Ball Hospice.

2173
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:43,100
 - It was C.

2174
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:45,660
 - It's Bonnie's Ball Hospice.

2175
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:48,980
 I got that wrong, losing all of my points.

2176
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:50,900
 Matt eked out the win today.

2177
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:55,900
 11,200 points versus zeros for both Paul and I.

2178
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:59,740
 That is from the Upside Down Underscoop.

2179
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:01,580
 Thank you so much, Upside Down Underscoop.

2180
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:02,420
 - Yes, thank you.

2181
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:04,020
 - If you wanna send us a scooperty

2182
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:05,900
 or a Price is Skryte Jock versus Nerd

2183
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:07,780
 or an Obelisk Jock versus Nerd,

2184
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:10,980
 head over to Preaching, not that one, HeyScoops.com.

2185
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:13,460
 Head over to HeyScoops.com, right there on the homepage.

2186
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:15,140
 You can do all of those things.

2187
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:16,740
 You can send us some email.

2188
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:19,820
 You can do all kinds of things over there at HeyScoops.com.

2189
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:22,420
 Oh, you can buy the Scoop Fest merchandise.

2190
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:23,260
 - Yeah. - That's right.

2191
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:26,100
 - So go over there, buy yourself some Scoop Fest merch.

2192
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:26,940
 Oh, I think y'all, thank you.

2193
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:28,100
 - I guess we've said it explicitly,

2194
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:30,540
 but the mystery item this year was a Fez,

2195
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:32,300
 was a Scoops Fez. - Yes.

2196
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:35,940
 - And so a lot of those have been selling off our website

2197
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:37,180
 as well.

2198
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:38,020
 - For sure.

2199
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:40,980
 - It's been a fun item to get your hands on.

2200
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:44,700
 I don't think we'll be restocking the Fez, so definitely.

2201
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:45,540
 - No, no, no.

2202
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:46,820
 - It's a one-time thing.

2203
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:47,940
 So these are gonna be-- - Yeah, yeah.

2204
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:49,620
 - These are gonna be very-- - The Fez is gonna--

2205
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:50,740
 - Very collectible, very-- - It's gonna be good

2206
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:52,020
 while it lasts. - Yep.

2207
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:56,700
 - Yeah, and if you're hearing this right now,

2208
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:57,540
 Paul and I show it tomorrow night.

2209
01:19:57,540 --> 01:19:59,820
 If you're hearing it the morning it comes out, Thursday,

2210
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:01,620
 Paul and I have a show tonight at Tierney's Tavern

2211
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:02,540
 in New Jersey.

2212
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:04,180
 - Get there, be there. - 20 bucks at the door.

2213
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:06,220
 Go, come on up, come on up and check out the show.

2214
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:09,500
 - Hottest comedy spot on the East Coast that night,

2215
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:10,340
 right there.

2216
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:11,540
 - It's gonna be a really fun collection of people.

2217
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:12,380
 - It is.

2218
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:14,060
 - It's gonna also be less than 14 people,

2219
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:16,220
 meaning it's also gonna make it more fun to play.

2220
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:20,340
 But it's gonna be me, Paul, my buddies Pat Shepard

2221
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:22,300
 and Dijory Douche from my old improv group,

2222
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:23,860
 Possible Side Effects.

2223
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:27,340
 My buddy Dion Flynn, many people know from playing Obama

2224
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:28,980
 and other characters on the Jimmy Fallon Show,

2225
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:31,300
 and of course, famous stand-up Kurt Braunler

2226
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:33,740
 will be doing stand-up and improv with us there.

2227
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:36,420
 That's tonight at Tierney's in Montclair, New Jersey.

2228
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:37,980
 Get there if you can, or if you know someone

2229
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:40,980
 who might dig that show, just come out

2230
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:43,020
 and check out that show.

2231
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:46,180
 - It is almost guaranteed to be one of the funniest things

2232
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:48,580
 you can do in Montclair, New Jersey that night.

2233
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:50,380
 - That's true, that's true.

2234
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:51,380
 - Yeah.

2235
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:56,020
 - And so, but sorry Andy, I will not film it.

2236
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:57,660
 That's just the rule of asking old friends

2237
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:59,020
 to do an improv and an improv in a while.

2238
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,120
 We do not film it.

2239
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:02,340
 (laughing)

2240
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:03,820
 - Oh yeah, it's too dangerous to film it.

2241
01:21:03,820 --> 01:21:05,100
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2242
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:08,700
 But so, yeah, come check it out.

2243
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:11,460
 I wanna thank all the people who check us out every week

2244
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:12,420
 and put us in your ear holes.

2245
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:13,420
 Andy, thank you so much.

2246
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:15,860
