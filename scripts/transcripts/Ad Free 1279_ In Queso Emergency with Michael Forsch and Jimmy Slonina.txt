 We're not privy to the Twitch chat when we switch that off of our stack
 This is my favorite part of the show this is the part of the show where we thank you the ice cream truck drivers
 Thank you so much ice cream truck drivers up. It's crazy. We have a new list
 I can't figure out how to look at all of it who can say what's gonna happen in the future
 But hopefully you don't even hear this and you just hear me thanking people in case you don't I decided to put this hilarious
 Anecdote in right here if you want to become an ice cream truck driver
 And I hope you do preaching fun calm preaching fun commas
 We're gonna sign up to be an ice cream truck driver and who knows the life you save
 May be your own
 And now a program hey Johnny
 Do you want to go to an ice cream social? Yeah? I'd love to great. Let's go
 We have some guests here in the turn today
 Mike for sure should be so needed from a list casting the web series
 It's true
 Ice cream social sitting in Las Vegas that's Matt Donnelly sitting in Pittsburgh PA. That's Paul
 Also in Vegas. It's me Jacob the audio guy. We're preaching fun. Oh
 Yeah, but before we get started fuck land man right in the neck fuck it fuck that show
 fuck that
 Piece of shit
 So happy that we didn't dive into this season from what I'm hearing about this season
 This season's been terrible many people been writing about it, but they did a scene
 Okay, this is second the last scene that the series is about to end and they spend again
 This is a show about a whole series. Does the end end? No, it should be but no, it won't it will go on
 We're heading to the end of season two, this is a show that is about an oil company
 aha trapped in doing business with a drug cartel and
 the episode 9 of a 10 episode season I
 spends
 90% of it with like really deep
 Conversations about relationships and about like their daughter going to college and all this other stuff
 Okay. Now, that's just a big waste of the premise, but
 In this episode this is things I watch the show because it is mediocre
 I watch the show because it's easy to watch some of it and go to bed. That's why I watch it, right?
 so I'm watching it and the daughter goes to college and
 She it's like this really sweet moment and she even makes like a little like, you know
 prayer gesture and then opens up her door and walked inside her first dorm room and
 they have written a character to be a
 like Charlie Kirk
 Every liberal valued
 Person becoming a nightmare possible. It is a trans roommate who says that they are vegan
 They can't hear certain words because it's triggering. They said they have to meditate they have a pet muskrat. They miss take every possible thing
 They have to take every possible thing that you could
 that
 Every like shitty liberal stereotype. Yes
 Like here's all and like not even stereo stereotypes the wrong word because it's not even stereotype
 Because like trans isn't a stereotype, but they just look at that and go like well, well trans is a problem
 So we're gonna make this into a list of problems
 See, they took everything that any kind of liberal value and made it an antagonist. Yes
 I'm trying to make it an assault on the daughter and they literally have the mother come in to save the day where she rents
 A hotel says invite all of your cheerleader friends because the daughter is gonna be on the cheerleading squad
 They literally sit there sipping margaritas. Okay, everyone's underage except for the mother. They're also
 Margaritas saying this is what college should be like and then talking about the roommate and saying like she's just unhappy with herself
 So they purposely misgender the roommate and then lecture each other at the pool
 Saying, you know basically saying that if you have liberal values, you have no fun. You have no friends
 but if you you know, just just
 Hate all those things and just value totally being selfish and fun life works out for you
 And I'm supposed to go to bed and I'm stead. I'm fucking livid and angry
 That this fucking for no reason just multiple shots anti-trans
 Multiple shots across the bow just hitting transfer. No reason not for no reason
 Fair fair
 There there's a reason there are several psyops going on right now, baby
 But this is it like I get it like we watch entertainment to give ourselves
 brief respite from this hellscape of issues that we were constantly assaulted with from the time we wake up to the time we go
 To bed, right and on the one hand we shouldn't be so concerned with the news
 On the other hand real terrible shit is happening and it is affecting people. So where do we find a balance?
 I don't know but one place to try to find balance is like for an hour before I go to bed
 Right, like can I make a recommendation as to my bedroom viewing routine?
 Just just your own penis where you put googly eyes on it and you just well that step one is
 because
 Bobo, that's his name Bobo is always watching along
 Well, he can't watch without it. You can't watch without his eyes put on the uniform
 You got to put the googly eyes on or Bobo is blind and a blind Bobo. Nobody wants to see that
 anyway, I strapped Bobo's eyes on and I throw on tubi and
 tubi has the giant selection of
 Mystery science theater and rift tracks and that's all I do
 I start a mystery science theater or rift tracks and let it play in the background forever. It's a mediocre film
 If it has anything problematic in it, it is being lampooned by voices of reason who happened to be based out of Minnesota, by the way
 Mystery science theater mystery science theater was from Minnesota. That's where that that all jumped off
 that brilliant stuff so
 That's how I soothed myself to sleep every night by watching old episodes of mystery science theater and rift tracks that I have seen
 Hundreds of times and it's wonderful. Yeah
 I will anything's better than what I'm doing. So I can't I can't say whether I do or don't like your idea Paul
 I'm not a good judge of character as to how to spend an evening
 So the best part about it Matt is that it especially with the rift tracks
 Yeah, you've got the voices of the guys who are very left-leaning
 For the most part Mike's not but still he wrote
 you know, like I I used to just watch mediocre dramas because
 Comedy makes me can get me in my analytical brain, which makes it not shut off
 And so I end up like in a in a like joke construction
 Kind of whatever and I can just I can just stay up for for hours and hours and hours and hours gotcha
 So that's usually why I try to watch thing about rift tracks is because what you're watching is not funny, but they make it silly
 Yeah, and so I take what I can watch I can watch
 Man hands down. I haven't even watched season two. It's already better. This is who's definitely better than the season two of land man
 I've ever even watched definitely
 Is it out yet? Are you just about to roll out episodes? Where are we at from from the sake of a viewer boys?
 We have five episodes out. So we have only three more so you have some catching up to do. Mr
 Donnelly deal deal clearly my schedule is now open. So there you go. No problem
 Your viewing schedule has opened up. So remind our audience about what your show is and where people watch it
 Absolutely, we are a list casting
 Jimmy are my esteemed actor here who keeps randomly changing his wallpaper and
 Currently has a massage table
 That's exciting who's never mind, I'm not even gonna ask who I've been in that spot that's happy beginnings. I know that place
 Casting season two is located
 Happy beginnings at the beginning. I mean not that I'm overly familiar with the industry
 but I'm guessing that would work actually better right like I
 Think it's way more comfortable than a casting couch. Let's just go with that
 Let's get that crazy part out of the way and then now I can really relax into a mess
 Okay, but I'm just gonna say you're missing the market
 It's actually about a show about two casting directors and their assistant who have been blackballed by Hollywood and
 now they are stuck in Las Vegas because when
 Hollywood spits you out
 Vegas sucks you in
 That's true, I mean you guys are writing season three
 Jimmy plays Roger and Roger is the owner of happy beginnings and no Roger Roger
 Jimmy started out in
 as sad actor and in the pilot episode and
 we loved him so so much in the pilot episode that we gave him a name and
 He's been a series and he's you got Urkel buddy. You got Urkel look at you go
 Yes, it's it's a it's a very proud day, you know, I'm a classically trained actor I studied Shakespeare Chekhov
 Decorated with awards and now here I am dressing up as a clown
 and
 Playing these sad actor
 Before I actually get actually get my name. So finally got my name and it's Roger. Oh
 Is there any Rogers do we do we do you know any like actual Rogers in the wild these I know a Roger
 I mean, there's the American dad alien
 And and that's the other one that I could think of yeah
 And the American dad alien guy Jimmy I am stunned by this question
 I have to actually look at my contacts with Roger Moore Roger in my okay. No Roger Whitaker Roger Whitaker
 American treasure actually, I think he's English English treasure Roger Whitaker. Do I know Roger?
 Yeah, the only one that popped up in my phone is the one that I mentioned
 He is the only Roger that I that I have in my content
 I do squirrely as Jimmy just asked the same question over and over again while you guys continue to stretch the parameters of the question
 Roger Stone, I do not have in my Rolodex
 Do you get a Roger ring at the massage parlor Roger Dodger
 Happy Roger. I dodger on my Todd. Don't have anyone with a first name Roger in my contacts. Yeah
 Let me shout out Roger. That's it. I'm gonna make another kid. I'm gonna name him Roger the market's wide open. I
 Do want to say that his name almost was Kroger because when we were writing it I mistyped
 Roger and
 my creative partner Zack
 Loved that it was Kroger and he was like, I love it. His name is gonna be Kroger
 I can make Kroger work. Well Kroger is not only the grocery chain, but you've also got
 the Nickelback fame Kroger, right like that's
 Jack Kroger is Nickelback, right?
 Hence why I had to cut it back to run. I guess have three Kroger nowadays. He's known as
 Mrs. Avril Lavigne, right? Yeah
 Okay, I wish I was for that weird marriage
 Yeah Avril Lavigne Mary nickelback, did you guys not know that
 Yeah, I thought Avril Lavigne died didn't she die well like one of her guys
 One of the Levine's died, but there's lots of clones of her
 Okay. No, she didn't die. She got Lyme disease, right? Isn't isn't she the one that got that guy? No, that's that's somebody else
 That's what's her name from bikini kill who's married to a Beastie Boy?
 I'm with Jimmy on this one. I think
 She might have put
 Kathleen Hanna also got Lyme's disease
 Good Kathleen Hanna though. So what I'm the initial riot girl
 Yeah, what I'm taking from this is if you marry a musician you get some kind of disease
 Avril Lavigne contracted Lyme disease from a tick bite in 2014
 Oh, no
 Yeah, Jimmy knows everything about Lyme disease. Gotta stop this camera. Everything about Avril Lavigne except for her nickelback husband
 Kroger who's apparently named Iraq air who else got Lyme disease?
 Anybody who goes outdoors, which is why I never do it the outdoors. Yes, like
 That was really like something that was like kind of like brought to me as like a selling point of just like yeah
 We go out for a walk. We go through the trees. We petted a deer and then we go home and check each other for ticks
 I'm like, I don't want type 2 entertainment. I don't want it
 This entertainment pitch this is a terrible salesperson
 Yes, you're right terrible
 Now Jimmy once your character went from sad actor to Roger
 Did you start doing a lot of like hmm? I don't know if my character would say it this way or my character do that
 Roger doesn't kind of person who would like did you really take ownership now of your scenes, right? Right?
 Yeah, no, I I had plenty of notes. Well, I didn't have them. I didn't give the notes my agent gave
 Directly, I mean I don't got time for that shit
 Thank you again for being here by the way, oh sure it's my pleasure I'm the envelope is slip slipping through the door
 It's on its way we're paying him Michaels to be paying
 Pay them in sandwiches
 As long as the money in the sun is green. Oh
 This is gonna be this is gonna be so awkward. I have them slipping a sandwich under your door right now
 It is a capriotti sandwich like it's a it's a big it's not gonna fit under the door it's gonna be a mess
 So Michael I know
 Now I'm hungry
 You guys have a studio where you're filming a lot of this but are we looking as you keep growing here to do more on
 site possible shoots and things like that to make Vegas even more of a character as
 The series progresses as I know LA is quite the character in a lot of Los Angeles productions
 So are we hoping to make that more of a reality?
 I know there were talks at one time of Las Vegas investing in some tax breaks for filming and stuff like that
 That may have just been pissed in the wind
 Yeah, I don't think that's really come to fruition
 But what's the what's the ability to how how film friendly is Vegas right now for what you're doing?
 Um, actually I found filming in Vegas like really
 Embracing like it's actually a lot easier to get permits
 It's a lot easier to okay find locations for people to film that the problem is
 a cost a lot of money to transport an entire crew and to rehearse in a space and all that so
 Yeah, as soon as a list casting gets funding from a bigger network
 we'll definitely be able to okay take advantage of all these things, but
 currently we tend to pick one location outside of our casting office to go to and and this time
 It was a local dance studio where we filmed that but in the previous season
 We went to Millennium Fandom Bar, which I'm sure you guys are familiar with. Yes one bar got to film there and
 yeah, so I
 Think that if we could afford it, I would absolutely do but you know
 This is definitely an independent project where we pay Jimmy and massages and sandwiches
 Yeah, so if any locations wanting want to let us film there for sandwiches and massages then
 Example that's a great example of local business chipping in and wanting to be represented on the on the screen
 So an example of businesses that love massages and sandwiches
 Jacob what was that bar that you went to that turned into two bars last the other night? Maybe those guys need some
 Film broadcast. They look like they need some promotion, right? Tony two bars. Don't need to buy Tony to bar
 Was that it wasn't right? No, the guy dragged you over to a second bar for a drink and then left you high and dry
 Yeah. Yeah. Well, the owner of this bar like took us out of his bar to a different bar and
 Seemed like he was gonna buy us a drink and hang out with us in this other bar that he was taking us to and then just
 left
 He was like he was in the other bar for a grand total of two minutes
 Well, you don't want to mention either of these bars, it was the weirdest thing I've forgotten both of the names
 That's one thing. Well, then they definitely need some promotion. So the second one used to be the downtown lounge
 That was that it was it was the same word twice. It was a nice place, too
 Was it boing-boing or something like that? No, it wasn't boing-boing. We're calling it. Hatsy-tatsy. So it rhymes with that
 Yeah, all right, hoochie smooth. It was like it was like Potsy Potsy
 Potsy pot. It was Potsy Pots with the other one was Potsy Potsy. Good. We figured out guys. Go ahead and film there
 Yeah
 As far as we're concerned, well at least I'm glad to hear that at least on the locals level Vegas is still
 Helping each other out in that respect
 statistically I
 Also, I feel like he is I also volunteer at Jacob's house. Oh
 Yeah, yeah, how's your house is it good for does have a casting couch and sandwiches and so many
 So many cast the couches so many sandwiches
 You'd be you'd be doing me a favor if you got rid of some of these sandwiches actually
 He actually has like a dog accessible casting couch, which is pretty amazing
 He's got a little puffy stair staircase that goes up to his couch for his puppies, so that's it's a good it's good for
 For dogs almost sleep their way into roles
 Right. Oh, I see. Mm-hmm. I wasn't sure that was for me to get on to the
 Very high couch
 Person but no seriously that you know
 It's it's I think it is a love letter to Las Vegas not so much in terms of the landmarks or the the the
 places but like the characters that you'll find yeah in Las Vegas which I mean
 I challenge you to find something that has that sort of thing where it like kind of explores the strange
 Weird people who are in the entertainment field on the fringes that are not circa or Spiegel or whatever and
 and how they
 Make their lives work in this town because you know like LA actors left and right but you know, what are these?
 lowly
 Sad lawyer turned actors and you know all these all these other kind of characters
 So I think that's it's that's one of the benefits of it
 I mean, no no city on earth has better people watching than Las Vegas
 and so to have a show that is kind of dedicated to a
 Bit of that spirit is is a fascinating idea and something that people should check out
 I mean that that's a that is a weirdly niche thing that I think people are gonna really love
 and
 More importantly Jimmy in episode 3 is dressed up as a birthday party clown trying to steal craft
 crafty, which is the catering at
 services and and
 Him and I get in a shouting match with each other. So whoa
 Is that because Jimmy?
 Is that because Jimmy came to the shooting from his side gig as a birthday clown? No, no, no, no
 he is for so the backstory of the movie that we're filming is that he's the clown in a world of mimes and
 He feels lonely and left out and so he has to it's very dramatic has to jump off the roof to end everything
 I can't wait to watch this. This is all backstory. This is all backstory that you will not know. Of course, you're hearing it first
 Jimmy knew this
 I
 Was wondering why there were all these minds and me there that that was kind of confusing but now that makes no makes total sense
 Now you finish season 1
 Just does suddenly like did you always you're gonna make the season 2 season 2 simply just like I we can't something of funny casting
 Adventures to go on or did you think of somewhere new to go with the show?
 How did it all come together creatively for season 2?
 Well, our writer Nick Adams he had already started writing
 Season 2 unbeknownst to us. So we're like we did season 1 and our executive producer Chuck Prater was like, you know
 I I think that we need to get a season 2 going away
 I'm gonna get some funding for you guys and stuff and then Nick was like funny enough. I have
 eight episodes ready for you guys to go and I was like
 That's great. I was like
 okay, and I was like this is great now we need to make them twice as long and
 with much more characters and much to my chagrin doing
 27 pages a day I was in three days
 We talked about this last time I was on but yeah, we tend to shoot three episodes per day it and that was
 It turned out wonderful. But also I was like, I'm never doing this again, which I say after every season
 I was gonna ask you when he when the when the writers said, oh, I've got eight more episodes in the in the bag
 Ready to go. Were you more excited or more terrified? Which which direction did the needle lean?
 Because I know at least I know both both were on the scale for sure
 We were very excited actually because
 You know, we love doing this. This is you know at Jimmy having this whole family together having everybody on the set
 It's it's definitely been an experience. We've been doing it for five years
 So bringing the crew together and and doing everything it feels like at the end of 16 hours
 Like everybody's just like oh my gosh
 But then you get to see what you did and what you achieved and that's that in itself is always always gratifying and
 Actually, Matt and I had a conversation about magicians
 You said you never do you said you never out me on this you said you're gonna give us anonymous
 You're supposed to say a magician friend I
 Know well
 We I told it to the writer and so now it's too late. So if there is a season three
 There's gonna be a magician episode. So hopefully we can get some
 magician
 Adjacent type people maybe Matt Donnelly will make an appearance. I can't tell whether you're saying I should do this or stay away from it
 I'll do it. I would love to do it. Yeah. Oh my god, if you can see on the background, there's
 There's Jimmy's clown spoilers, but that's me. Oh, yeah Wow
 Pretty dope for the video for people who aren't on on twitch or zoom. Yeah, there's a little little bonus something
 I'll let you know. I'll just speak as my agent for a moment. You should make Matt part of the last episode because he tends to
 Cause schedules to go off the rails with
 You definitely want you don't want me holding up another episode. I'll just tell you that much right now
 You oh, you'll be the grand finale, baby. There you go. There you go
 I'll get you we give you your least amount of patience and I'm doing the most amount of improv. You're gonna love it
 Why the show ended
 Oh
 Yeah, I had a friend working on a project that I was like
 Oh, I would have been fun to work on that one and then they described the working process is like
 Oh, I would have been a nightmare. Thank God. I didn't try to be a part of that project. I just pissed everyone off
 They would have hated me but it's good
 Somebody just put Jimmy with the dude wipes dressed as a clown
 Dude wipes, I'll have you know, that's Blumpkin spice. That is not Photoshopped. That is legit. That is
 I didn't have that picture
 Yeah, Jimmy Wow, Jimmy
 That's good lighting. Look at that
 That's download that shit. Yeah, that's a good picture
 Jimmy how many that's going how many months now with no podcast? Do you miss it at all?
 Do you hate not being part of the audio world?
 No, see now like this is the perfect opportunity for season 3 the all a list casting goes all podcast
 Just goes to totally man Michael only Michael I'm gonna tell you right now you're gonna love the format change
 You know what if it's not 16 hour days and we're doing three back-to-back podcasts, I'm here for it's way shorter days
 We only do two on on our hardest days. We do two in a row. We've we've tried three in the past and it doesn't work
 If I ever they don't even go on location anymore. No, they just do it all from home
 Ship or wherever the hell they are
 That's like take bruises, what can I say we've evolved
 No, I'm good. I'm I'm good
 saving my
 conversations for my therapist good and not for not for
 Some two dudes that I that I work with that I love
 Yeah, you guys are getting together for the occasional meal. He's still keeping up with the guys. It's just not as regular or
 Yeah, yeah, sure. You know, it's you know, and you know, we got the dressing room has to say you see each other all the time
 Wouldn't it be great here? If it was like actually we have built walls between our stations and the dressing rooms
 Literally not spoken since that last episode like you know when like restaurants were desperate to open during kovat
 So they put up all those little micro walls and stuff
 Yeah, so the dresser was like now atmosphere and the best part is all you need for Jimmy to stay private is a micro wall
 Get the part buddy you want to massage you want to get on the massage table you gotta
 Ah
 Now I so the last time I was on this episode all we could talk about was docking
 so I was like I'm gonna bring Jimmy on so at least like he'll keep these guys in line and
 Good job, Jimmy. Good job, Jimmy
 Actually, I'm glad you brought up docking because I have some things I want to discuss with that
 So, thank you
 Jimmy maybe maybe this is unfair to put a button on it, but we should say
 You since you last were on air
 Your case got thrown out you weren't you were not being it did you were not exonerated?
 You're not being good. I go into jail for going to your own place of business from a bar
 Yes, it has been dropped but it still could be I guess I just found this out the other day
 It could be it takes a year for them to like actually close it
 So like at any point if I act up or you know
 Oh Jesus still like yeah, so you're
 List is that what we're hearing still kind of tell me that Las Vegas has like a delete folder for 365
 So like if you move into delete, but it actually stays in this folder for a year
 Exactly so I still get to mind my P's and Q's no happy endings at the massage
 Got to the beginnings are on the table beginnings. Oh, we have to be happy. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely
 but yes for all intents and purposes that
 that that case is now now done and
 The future is still is unclear and my lawyer says I shouldn't talk too much about it. There we go. That's fine
 We'll leave it. We'll leave it
 Let's leave it there. Yeah. Yeah, I was want to celebrate
 I mean, I've not put it like a little no my calendar like wait a year to celebrate. Yeah
 Good to know 11th the fateful day June 11th
 Well, I have I have faith in the fair and 611 you turned around it's 9/11. Oh my 9/11 Wow
 Illuminati never forget guys Machiavelli
 You know when we started this episode today, I thought to myself, you know
 I really hope I could find out one day what Jimmy Sloaneen is 9/11
 Jimmy's personal 11. It's just actually now gonna be an icebreaker for all of our guests. Hey, yeah, what's your 9/11?
 My 9/11 is finding out my character's named Roger
 When it could be Kroger the whole time
 He looks so much like a Kroger
 My 9/11 is watching episode 9 of of land man over and over again
 There's a character in a list
 God help us her name
 The actress name is Katie and we we turned her. Yeah, she's hilarious
 you'll see her in episode 5 and she says so in episode 3, but she's featured in episode 5 and
 Unfortunately, we made it a bit that her name is tall actress
 So that's what she's called in the show and she doesn't get a name. No one can remember her name
 It's just sort of nice
 So she hasn't been given a name and she is very careful to remind us every time we do any kind of promotion
 That she doesn't have a name yet. And I'm like, don't worry. It's gonna be a big reveal in season 3 Kroger or 5
 So her real name is tall actress
 Her name is also Roger. Yeah
 It's also Roger
 Everybody is Roger. This is all on YouTube. Yes
 Yep, you can find it all on YouTube. I
 Think you just look up a list casting and you will see me you will see Jimmy
 you'll see a lot of Las Vegas actors and
 Jonas Wilberton. Oh, wow. There's so many people you guys know who's who of scoop guests. Yes
 Tons of them. Yes, Karina Harney Jones. Yes
 Nicole Unger, I heard there's a lot of pressure to up the sex appeal for season 2 to boost the ratings. Is that true?
 That's very true
 Jimmy
 shows his nipples on every podcast and
 Whether he's asked to or not
 yeah, and
 much much like
 Brett Alters he gets naked at the top chance. You know, you don't have to ask Brett once
 I've got one more testicle in that guy
 Somewhere Brett Alters is just getting like things in the universe
 He's got a little baby
 One is enough the ringmaster of Big Apple Circus. Now he's touring with Piff again. Fuck that guy
 Yeah, but fuck you Brett Alters. You'll never be on a list cast and your nudity
 But we'd love to have you back on on the podcast. Oh, yeah, come on by Brett any time. Yeah
 I don't think we ever had bread on which is a mistake. No, did we have it once?
 Maybe a long time ago. Oh, yeah, we've done this podcast. I don't know. He'd have to tell us
 He'd have to tell us
 Now we knew this podcast and Piff stuff. Yeah, I have no idea you guys talk about how if you you know
 You had a budget you go maybe shoot some more locations and that kind of stuff
 Modern entertainment is a fucking crazy
 Making entertainment was always hard. It's harder than ever to take the independent project like this to a major
 Streamer but but small entertainment like this like these smaller episodes and being able to watch from your phones that kind of stuff
 Like that's all on the rise, right?
 Yeah has have you thought about possibly simply trying to do like a Kickstarter or a crowd funder to try to maybe see if you
 Could just get a budget you'd want for to maybe make this a little a little more dynamic and spicy for you guys
 Yeah, I mean that's definitely on the portfolio, you know, we're looking at where things go
 With this current season and then we're gonna get together and talk about okay
 Do we crowdfunds like what's our goals? Like what are we gonna do with season 3?
 What can we do to make a season 3 happen, you know that sort of thing or
 You know with the help of all the scoops in the chat and everything
 They're the subscriber base and the viewers watch and everything goes up so high that we can
 You know take that to more of a network type style
 So there's two different ways to go we kind of have to step back and examine exactly where we're at
 I would love like, you know, this this show is is
 Definitely a love letter to Las Vegas and and to the entertainment here
 So I would love to continue making it and everybody enjoys
 The process of doing it. So there's many there's many opportunities where we're gonna be looking at
 But hopefully one of them would be to crowdfund and to kind of get it enough of a budget to make a season 3
 The other option, you know
 take it to some more networks again now that we have more of a fan base and stuff and
 Show them the analytics and that kind of thing and see if it gets picked up. So all right
 Well, do you crowdfund Paul Jacob and I are in for five dollars?
 Yes
 Between the two of you
 Switches your background to Jimmy and Jimmy's background, which is pretty good
 It's a Russian nesting doll
 This is what I put the link I put the link to the a list casting channel on the chat
 There and hit that smash that subscribe y'all. Yeah
 And if you're not on the chat a list casting just do a list casting search it on Google search it
 YouTube it pops right up. Yeah, subscribe to it. It's gonna be fantastic
 You're gonna love it
 All right. Well gentlemen, we're gonna do a little ad we want to thank you for plugging the the episode
 You're welcome to stick around and fuck around with us, but we're gonna move on to other other topics
 So if you want to go I get it. No problem. I do have to run. Okay. All right. I love you all
 Love you. Love you. Love you. Good to see you

 Today's show is brought to you by Captain cut berry cereal. That's right

 Hi
 Jacob do you have a time I have a topic if you don't have a topic a topic you go. I have a top
 Pick who feels strongest about their top. I got too quick. I got two quickies
 First of all, I'm gonna let y'all know I got to experience a little slice of heaven the other night
 Let me tell you what a slice of heaven is
 So I went to this massage part a slice of heaven. Happy beginnings
 Happy beginnings is a Pennsylvania CoC Costco
 On a on a Steelers playoff Monday night. Oh man
 Ghost town
 Was wonderful and and I had the run of the place there couldn't have been 50 people there workers included
 It was wonderful
 Were the workers all furious that they were there? No, nobody in their right mind wanted to watch that game. Give me a break
 Are you kidding me?
 Anyway, I watched a few minutes of it and then just dozed off
 Up at some point right around it was almost halftime. I mean it was right after halftime and
 Looked at the game. It went. Nope. It turned it off and got up. I just did other things. Yeah. Yeah
 Yeah, as someone who loves watching Aaron Rodgers lose and be a dick about it. It was a fucking chef's kiss
 More perfect than an interception turned touchdown as you're fine
 Everyone else out on the sideline and they just showed up shouting at everyone. Yeah, I was like, ah
 Well, he's the reason I didn't watch a single lick of it this whole season and I'm a better person for it
 And now I'm completely off
 That and you don't care about sports. I don't I really don't
 Forgot that you don't care about sports. I reminded myself real quick Rogers
 Just reminded you if anything you owe Aaron Rodgers. Well part of it too was for two years. I was basically
 Immobile from my damn leg. So I that's true
 I didn't have a whole lot of options but to connect with the outside world through live sports entertainment
 It was either like sports or become a card magician. That was kind of it. And so I think I chose wisely again
 Alright, so that was a great that our scoops right now are all catching each other up on football and they also don't care
 I know that much about it. So right now the chat is just a litany of like wait bears wait
 Somebody just mentioned the Brooklyn Dodgers
 Yeah
 So anyway, that was great fun Monday night going shopping with Ann. That's really funny to hit
 Truly the perfect time it was the perfect time it was insane like I mean ghost town so there was that and then
 and for holiday through her work got a
 gift card from one of her associates for
 Applebee's so we decided to burn that Applebee's gift card yesterday. I
 Don't know if you guys have been to Applebee's Applebee's. We had to use it at Applebee's. Well, you shouldn't have burned it
 Well, we that was you know, we probably it might have been a better move. I don't know but we went to Applebee's
 Applebee's currently has on the menu on the menu currently. They have an item called the
 om-cheeseburger
 Om-oh, this is the one just yes. I just saw the ads for this, too
 This was on every playoff game this weekend. So they cut a cheeseburger in half and let it rest on them
 melted dish of cheese
 Not just a melted dish of cheese. The wording is served in a molten pool of cheese
 Sir in a molten pool of cheese
 This is what Matt and Matty Lee's ice cream socials served in a molten pool of cheese. I was like, yeah
 I'm gonna have to move. I'm gonna have to move throsian to second place as to what to do with my dead body
 Put me in a ball pool of cheese
 Why wait till you're dead though serve me
 Fondue
 Do you put like a long fork oh
 You have to get a fork in there to get the cheese that's left and I'll tell you this
 Oh Applebee's missing out on giving people a long fork for their hamburger to dip it in the cheese
 I didn't eat super fast like on the time. I went for the second the second half
 You're too late bozo you missed your train
 Half my burgers on the plate and I saw I saw on the menu I was like limited time only I'm like
 Yeah, you have a limited time to eat it before it glues itself to the dinner where there it is
 And then put the two flat halves down in just a plate of cheese, that's it
 Video up there this feels like something that like some mother does for like one of her kids
 And like right you serve it to me with the cheese on the plate. Can you can I have melty cheeseburger tonight? Yeah
 Melty pool burger and then that kid goes to sleep over the first time and he asked me to cut his cheeseburger in half
 Is this you put more cheese on the plate you guys do melty pool burgers?
 They go. What the hell are you talking about kid and then he shows it and they never eat a cheeseburger the same way again
 And then those children went on to open an Applebee
 Well, like I say, I'll say it wasn't bad. It's just that that second time experience
 It should come. Yeah, it should come like fondue should have a little little fire. Let's have a little heater
 Yeah, it it comes on a skillet. So it comes out bubbling like a fajita plate
 so it is truly like
 Like it is molten cheese like you cannot
 I dare you to consume me is the cheese just is the is the cheese in the in the little pan just like cheese
 Just like cheddar cheese or something. It's a it's like a
 Mexican cheese blend I would say like a matcha jack style
 This is a fucking this is a fucking miss on their part not to do it in a pan of queso. Yeah whiz
 Yeah, I mean, yeah, if you're if you're going for it, you should go for it
 Like they do serve like kill it just do some skillet. Okay, so there you're done
 I think they serve skillet queso at Applebee's. Come on Applebee's. I'm giving you gems here
 you know, I went to Sonic the other night and I
 You know, they have a pretzel twist like a cheese dip, but they're at a pretzel twist. So I still order the the the the
 dip
 Yeah, I ordered the dip and put my tater tots in it tater tots. Oh
 Smart each Applebee's each shit Applebee's well, I think I think they're on to something
 But I think you guys are exactly right if you're gonna go for it fucking go for it
 but then I think it becomes just a you're spending too much on your cheese and
 So I think it just becomes an arms race at that point
 I think then all the restaurants are racing to see who can put what in queso
 Yeah, and I mean it would probably just end the world
 I I mean if if you so if you put on your menu menu in queso emergency
 burger I
 Am I am buying that sandwich? I will be at your restaurant every day every day in queso emergency eat cheeseburger
 Fuck yeah, and go ahead like make that just an option in case of emergency as an option

 When that was it was big for me because back to the future 2 came out at I was whatever whatever age

 Well, let's know the time we thank all the people support us on patreon
 Obviously, we're in a transition of going from any to no one
 Other people a lot of people have offered to hop in there. Yes, we're still getting our
 We did and we may still take them up on me
 We are going to experiment see if we can do it ourselves, which is a little weird
 But we should be thanking everyone the way they should be doing it
 But the way we simplified our patreon it seems like we will a be able to just be able to get lists ourselves and be
 We don't have a lot of
 Crazy deliverables anymore. So we can't have people write us and yell at us, which is also why we had any
 We think we're safe sure I think with the way
 Safer the digital rules are mostly doing kind of hang stuff and that kind of thing. So yes
 Which is coming up soon beyond the lookout. We'll have that sometime next week. I'm planning great

 So we need three billion dollars. Mm-hmm before taxes three billion dollars gross. I don't think we're completely clear on the financials here
 It can be crypto. It can be that fine with paying it paying back some of that
 Yeah, yeah
 No
 If we have to tax on it and whatever is income or however, we have to do that
 We'll figure that out on our end. Yeah, you don't worry about that. You just come up with the three billion even
 We might even bring any back to help us figure that one out. Yeah, we might we might
 Maybe a contractor fee. Yeah
 But yeah
 You give us the three billion dollars and we will see if we are better at being billionaires than the current billionaires out there
 You know, I'll go ahead and say it will even bring back the hands-less eating reward
 We learned the first time around we have to do it all in one we can't do like multiple sessions
 We have one hands-less eating session, you know, yeah, you know what the next has to be available at the where do we go?
 Eat that famous last night, you know the pepper mill menu the big step lucky for you
