1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,740
 When I play pickleball, I don't want anybody to know that I'm playing pickleball. It's more like knuckleball

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:16,960

 We're not but we're about to be because I forgot to here we go. Hey Johnny

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,200
 Do you want to go to an ice cream social? Yeah, I'd love to great. Let's go

14
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:26,740
 Ice cream social sitting over in Pittsburgh. It's Paul Mattingly sitting in Las Vegas. It's Matt Donnelly

15
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:34,100
 The audio guy we're preaching fun preaching fun. That's what they say everybody. That's what they claim

16
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,640
 That is what they claim fun preaching

17
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,340
 the fun all the time

18
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:47,940
 You guys read the story about they're going nuts that a wolf figured out how to pull in a crab trap. Have we seen this?

19
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,540
 Yes. Yes

20
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,500
 This is great. So tell us a wolf has

21
00:01:52,500 --> 00:02:01,700
 Basically saw a wolf saw humans set a crab trap into a lake and then and then when the hunters went away or the

22
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,760
 Hunt the hunters. They use the great crab hunters

23
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:12,480
 Their cage of little meat there's a there's a bar right on East Sahara called the great great crab hunter

24
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,900
 The bar in front of the flamingo was called the crab hunter if you ever

25
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:28,620
 The crab pot would be a great name for a bar at the flamingo back in

26
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,340
 Basically when the when the crab trap setters walked away

27
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:39,000
 the wolf went over and then started pulling in the rope and brought the trap up and then

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,300
 That was set inside the crab trap. Oh

29
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,080
 Some scientists are going nuts being like this is a wolf using tools

30
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,480
 Right, and I was skeptical about this being significant news

31
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,740
 until

32
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,180
 My cat Shmi ki

33
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:06,180
 Figured out how to open the cat door that we close at night the dog. Oh

34
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:12,340
 Yeah, so like we put a little slide down the thing to seal off the

35
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,260
 Cat door. It's really a doggie door, but we've repurposed it for cats by not having dogs and having cats

36
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,060
 calling it a cat door by having in a cat store and

37
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:28,320
 We were hearing this noise or whatever we thought was just playing for something downstairs getting fixated on something, you know

38
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,020
 Like the like cats do

39
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:36,420
 No, Shmi ki had figured out how to push up the the seal on the cat door enough to speak out

40
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,780
 middle of the night

41
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:44,780
 To kill birds probably to kill birds and it was not yeah in the chat. They're asking that you sure wasn't Shmookie

42
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,540
 That's that's the hard part. If my money would have been on Shmookie

43
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:55,020
 She's the more devious ninja of the cats. She's certainly the most lethal of the cats

44
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,420
 but no is a

45
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,420
 Shmi ki want to go outside and so

46
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:06,980
 Now it's all right Shmi ki. Yeah, and so now I'm thinking between that wolf story and my cat story

47
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:14,460
 Maybe our time as as as apex predators on this planet is is is you know, there's one time we weren't right, you know

48
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,840
 Right historically our species would hang out and wait for the bigger predators be done

49
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:25,580
 Then we'd go in and pick the bones and drink the bone marrow of leftover victims and then and then we figured out tools

50
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:31,340
 And now oh wait, is that what we're supposed to be doing waiting on to suck the bone marrow?

51
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,620
 I think about that all the time. You know fancy steak house all these homeless dicks for no reason

52
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,420
 You totally misinterpreted

53
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,340
 Completely

54
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:47,780
 Boy, is there egg on my face? That's I think about that whenever you're at a fancy steakhouse they offer that marrow

55
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,940
 Like a marrow and bread appetizer. Yeah

56
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:57,020
 I'm like man, what would like hundreds hundreds or maybe I guess it's thousands of years ago

57
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:02,080
 What thousand years ago just think about like here we are like almost like laughing at the fact that this is all we used to do

58
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,840
 Yeah, now it's just an appetizer. We dip our bread in

59
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,580
 over fancy clothes

60
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,620
 Bone marrow

61
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:21,460
 Anyways, I think these cats I think I think animals are just gonna start figuring it out. Yeah, we've had a good run

62
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:29,060
 We can be done with this I'm for when I'm ready push eject. Yeah, let's uh, let's run for the hills

63
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:36,620
 What would be the best new apex predator or raccoons best apex animal on the planet raccoons raccoons?

64
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,620
 I was good love

65
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:44,460
 Would love it. I love it raccoons cuz they're almost there. Their hands are almost there. Yeah, very close

66
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,780
 They're getting domesticated as we speak. I can easily see

67
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,780
 Raccoons like you know, just a raccoon city

68
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,860
 That you don't want because that leads to Resident Evil

69
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,940
 Manatees that's where that's where it all goes down in raccoon city. Oh, yeah

70
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,820
 Don't you know your Resident Evil lore

71
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,580
 Sadly, I'm lacking. Oh man

72
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,140
 Resident Evil was it that was it? God damn when that game came out

73
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,860
 Oh, and then you had to get the second version to do with the dual stick. Oh my god. Oh, oh, oh

74
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:26,760
 Every time I see the videos the video of somebody like handing a raccoon cotton candy

75
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:31,300
 And they wash it stream and they wash it it goes away. So say breaks my heart every time

76
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,060
 It's the saddest thing ever and but you gave that raccoon some some food that can be washed

77
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:41,620
 Yep, shame upon all those people that do that. We had to lose a tree yesterday. Oh

78
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:49,020
 Yes, I see it. Well, I thought it was in the yard and then all of a sudden and like it just no

79
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,700
 We had lawn service come out because it was starting a suckle took our tree

80
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,620
 It was starting to crack and get real rotty

81
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,780
 It was already rotty and we knew it was gonna go at some point but also it was already dead

82
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,620
 But yes, but at the last last couple of months it started to straight-up crack up top

83
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,940
 Yeah splint and if that thing would come down on a pooch. I'd never let myself

84
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,660
 forgive myself, so

85
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,500
 We got the pros in to come in and do it and we left a four foot tall stump

86
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:25,540
 Or so four foot tall stump so we can fart around and put birdseed on top of that or maybe a little oh you

87
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,520
 You left that on purpose on purpose. Yes, we left a four foot and we left all the wood

88
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,180
 so we've got logs and logs and logs and sticks and twigs and

89
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:39,260
 Ted is having a field day and he's out there getting a new chew toy every every all the wood precariously on a shelf

90
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,860
 That's rickety that could collapse and kill one of his dogs. Yep

91
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,540
 All the logs are safely on the ground they're farting around with them though

92
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,540
 but now we're gonna use that to

93
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,140
 Re-border the garden in this springtime and

94
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:58,700
 we're gonna chop up the twigs even more for mulch and for birdies to use and

95
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,380
 Then the little sticks we're gonna figure out other uses for it

96
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,540
 But it's great and the fact that and so into the gardening stuff

97
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:10,620
 We could just have them leave all the wood and not just chuck it in their truck and chip it

98
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,820
 Yeah, just leave it. We're fine. So do you have a fireplace or a fire pit or anything like that?

99
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
 we don't but our

100
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:22,340
 Relatives do so if we wanted to if you set that wood on fire, you could you could have one done

101
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,700
 We could just set it on fire and burn a patch in the yard and done and done

102
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,020
 We could do that. I don't trust my dogs not to

103
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,540
 Burn themselves. They're dumb jump into the fire

104
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,460
 I wouldn't jump into the fire, but they would fart around with it and they get in trouble

105
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,300
 One of our dogs is fascinated by fire

106
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,940
 Look our little lily dog is fat

107
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:47,100
 Like I will have a fire going and she will just sit and watch it. She will get close to it

108
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,420
 She won't she won't like get get dangerously close to anything

109
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,860
 But she will just sit and watch it with this fascinated look on her face

110
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:57,700
 That is some that is some ancient breeding in there, right? Like like how many out of me? Well, I mean, that's it

111
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,700
 How many generations?

112
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,220
 Lily's been going the dispensary when Jacobs not home

113
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:09,700
 Getting that sticky like look inside the flames

114
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,100
 Speaks to you

115
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:20,140
 Wolf cuz I'm a dog Lily is that girl with the balloon at the concert

116
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:25,660
 He's gonna be holding the balloon in her mouth

117
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:37,020
 You know what I'd be in I'd be in so yeah, there was a fancy

118
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,220
 Starbucks barista cup that came out. I

119
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,420
 saw this I have already lodged a

120
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:50,380
 Formal complaint and since cease and desists to all Starbucks good. Yeah, cuz our IP

121
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,100
 Not our IP our our IP should stand for something

122
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:01,860
 All right, our IP basically. Wait, what is that? What is it called? It was a barista. It's a glass

123
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,020
 Cup that's a it's like it looks like a honey jar

124
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,420
 Mm-hmm, but then it's got a little beanie hat on top and a straw

125
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,980
 This thing sold out immediately. I think it was 30 bucks

126
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:22,900
 Okay, of course going for like multiple hundreds online already collector people are insane. Yeah, as they were very

127
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,740
 Shortly stocked right, of course

128
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:31,220
 engineered scarcity is the new normal in the dying days of capitalism here and

129
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,420
 so

130
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,340
 As you can imagine

131
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,980
 That's it. I

132
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,980
 Don't think it was the one with the sombrero

133
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,500
 But it was one of the beanie hat

134
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,060
 but as you can imagine

135
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,660
 people being people don't understand that

136
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:56,220
 Workers at the Starbucks don't really have any control over how many or where or who has bought the bear already. Ah sure

137
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:05,260
 So people and I will keep this I will keep this as vague book as possible. Okay, but I will say that within

138
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,380
 The tri-state area an incident occurred

139
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,060
 Where a woman?

140
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,580
 Physically attacked a store manager for not having the bay. Oh

141
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,460
 my god

142
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:27,940
 Pushed her against some fucking shelves and shit like out-of-hand bullshit behavior from this customer

143
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:35,260
 Yeah, we got sorry just carry more tasers on us I think just making that more common

144
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,140
 Something man. It's just getting stupid. Well, I mean

145
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,980
 Forget your hands to yourself

146
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,460
 It's just yeah, and then the manager

147
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,100
 Bear cuffs and keep your hands to yourself. No Leon

148
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:53,680
 They did not retaliate as is the way and we can't really it's just awful. Yeah

149
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,840
 Anytime I hear those stories. I try to picture that person

150
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:03,820
 Telling like they went home that night right or they went and met a friend later, you know

151
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,980
 And maybe like like you think they have friends. I don't think they have friends

152
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:14,580
 What I'm trying to get it. It's like what the hell is that person's version of that story where they're like, what's right Starbucks?

153
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,620
 And then they have the nerve to not have a grizzly barista mug

154
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,300
 And so I attacked her so I attacked it's like good for you, man

155
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,820
 Stand up for yourself

156
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:33,380
 like the only thing that I see that's similar is the magic and Pokemon card stuff working retail now and

157
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,900
 That's just the craziest. I

158
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,340
 Was lucky

159
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:43,260
 They would we got a restock and I was able to grab a couple of booster packs to like a normal human being and that's

160
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,460
 The limit you're supposed to be able to get and you know

161
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:50,740
 The new Pokemon cards came out and I grabbed a couple booster packs and then you know the next day everything's gone

162
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:57,320
 you know hundreds and hundreds of cars everything but it's it's all scalpers they just come in and grab it all up and

163
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,380
 Hock it on the internet for crazy money. It's just nuts

164
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:06,380
 Briarhorse fans. They don't just fight they joust they actually will take up a long

165
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:12,340
 Spear from the ends of the room and they will gallop towards one another and fight. That's right fight for Briarhorse

166
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:17,340
 Now the Briarhorses are the little miniatures, right? Yeah, the miniature the collectible miniature horses

167
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:22,140
 Yeah, they don't have they don't have horse beans. They have little horse English peas

168
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:30,420
 Mushy peas, that's right. That's right. Look at the horse beans in this one's cock. I'll pay $50, please

169
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:35,220
 Yeah, so I'm not knock scoop is saying I saw a pic of someone weighing Pokemon packs

170
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,460
 I guess depending on the weight some are more viable than others

171
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:44,340
 yes, that is what it's come to the scalpers go into the stores and they weigh the individual packs to see which ones are heavier because

172
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:49,540
 That indicates a you know a coating of some kind with a metallic shine or something like that

173
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,780
 And that's how they get the greater value cards for what they're buying man

174
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:59,180
 When I was a bartender people asked for like all drums or all wings for their buffalo wings. I would get pissed at that

175
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,180
 I can't imagine

176
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:08,520
 Forget it forget it and that's just it like retail don't pay enough for people to be babysitting these 40 year old motherfuckers

177
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:15,520
 A guy got in the habit of coming in asking for all drums and like we didn't know what to do

178
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,300
 So we kept accommodating him and Billy Tierney was in one night. He goes. Wait, are you the guy ordering all drums?

179
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,580
 He goes he goes no stop. We can't do it you get whatever we get

180
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:27,220
 It's done. Hell. Yeah, and I was like also he's my hero

181
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:33,060
 There are arguments to be made that flats are superior to drums. Yeah, well, I do like a flat

182
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,340
 Well, we knew the person was a you know, a knuckle-dragging ogre. We knew that already

183
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,660
 No taste

184
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,300
 Right, right, right, but

185
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:49,300
 Yeah, I did get a nice card out of one of my packs which was cool. I got a

186
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:54,820
 The managers of that store. So this guy has a scale has to be like get out

187
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,820
 Yeah, no

188
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:02,300
 No, they should be is what he said but but no but who cares

189
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:08,780
 Ultimately, who cares if they're buying this shit? I mean, it's it's frustrating. It's awful, but it's the end of the world man

190
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,900
 All bets are off

191
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,020
 Nobody's got it. No, who's got a dog in this fight?

192
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:16,380
 You're gonna stop this guy from earning an extra $20. Fuck it, man

193
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,900
 If that's what he's chosen to do if he's really chosen to go, you know what you know what I'm gonna do

194
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,940
 I'm gonna fuck over every kid and collector that I know

195
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,380
 and I'm gonna get $5 or

196
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:34,900
 $20 for all this headache and bullshit. I'm gonna go to how do they do it?

197
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,380
 If you said that there's a limit on how many they can buy

198
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:42,060
 How do they how do they go in and buy a bunch of transactions Jacob multiple transactions?

199
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:48,100
 What yep different cards different shit they just

200
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:56,740
 Shed on my point and being like no, you can't do that. And then you just went off about how these people are dickheads anyway, which one is there?

201
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,740
 Are they this should we should?

202
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:04,580
 I'm saying they're dickheads. Anyway, it is not in your favor to try and stop their dickish behavior. I don't think yes

203
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:09,340
 It is in my store. It is I don't want to say dickheads. I want to store. Okay. Okay, man

204
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,820
 You're saying you're saying in your store. What is this your store you're talking about?

205
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,940
 Collaborate your store. Tell me thank you for asking and I'm glad you guys could all be here

206
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:26,660
 I know that Pokemon cards are a six billion dollar your industry and sharks you can get it on the ground level

207
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:35,180
 With I what I call house of shards house of shards is my card store. All right house of shards

208
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:42,300
 Yeah, and and basically in there everyone has to get be I have a good attitude in the store

209
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:48,460
 Or I punch them in the intestines until they shart in a game of death in the doorway, so it's fair

210
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,980
 So it's a gentleman's game

211
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:56,260
 We're all in for a gentleman's game in the store. Great. Okay in your store

212
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:00,420
 Yes, you have the ability to say fuck you get out of here behave yourself

213
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:07,100
 Don't be but also I promise you all of your product is behind glass and weigh the fuck away from their fingers in

214
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,260
 Always that what's gonna have to happen

215
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:14,580
 Are these fucking cards gonna have to get put in the glass cases and many are already open them up many are

216
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:21,300
 Of course they are and most of them are spiderwebbed up with those, you know magnetic steely deelys

217
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:27,340
 Oh, so they can't pocket them. Yeah. Yeah, and what well in the end all kind of stuff and they got you know security stuff

218
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:34,580
 but the stuff is going for crazy money out the gate now anyway, like even just basic basic prices for bundles or get are

219
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,180
 getting very close to $100 for a box and

220
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,900
 certainly a over a hundred for a box of

221
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:47,500
 Packs, but even just a basic box with like nine packs in it is like eighty five ninety dollars. It's nuts

222
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,260
 so what you're saying is that this is happening at like Target or

223
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:57,020
 Walmart Walmart. Yeah, that's where it's really happening. Walmart's really cracked down

224
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:03,540
 My Walmart has everything behind a register like there's one register at the end of the wall and it's like tobacco products

225
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:08,700
 You mind register porn magazines trading cards. That's it. It's all the very

226
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,880
 Porn magazines behind those registers

227
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:20,440
 The day baby, we have eight dollar long sleeve fake Budweiser t-shirts go steal those get out of here

228
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,100
 Over there

229
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,580
 so much

230
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:32,700
 So much better stuff to be stealing. It's just terrible. It's just terrible. It's also so the experiences I walk into a Walmart

231
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,940
 They've now put these cards behind glass. I have to like push a button for one of the Walmart workers to come over with a key

232
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:43,980
 Oftentimes, yes, it is oftentimes and even then that person with a key they go hold on. I'm actually gonna weigh them before I

233
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:48,000
 Sometimes these motherfuckers are trying way. I'm yeah. Yeah, and then

234
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:55,540
 If you're the guy with the key you have to just say like no here you're here you're too. That's if that's what you want

235
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,380
 That's what you gotta get. That's what they try and they try and do that somewhat

236
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:04,960
 But also I went to my Walmart with a bathroom scale and I asked the person opening the glass to step on the scale

237
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,900
 And he said you you misread the article that you read sir

238
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,360
 You're you're not supposed to weigh me. You're supposed to weigh the packs of cards

239
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,100
 So that's what you see you have him stand on the scale and hold his hands out

240
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:27,940
 Just hold so I gotta get a good read here, you know, they bring the little the little you know iron chef

241
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,780
 I should have brought a digital bathroom. That's what they have this analog bathroom scale is not working

242
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:38,480
 Well, they have the tiny little iron chef. I thought I brought a seesaw and some dumbbells. This is really not the way

243
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:48,140
 Justice scale I'm gonna stand here blindfolded holding this thing out. You tell me what the two sides are

244
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:53,300
 Yeah, you're gonna just do two packs at a time and see which one's heavier and and then keep going on and on and on

245
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,980
 Ridiculous, yes chaotic points out chat that I used to do a trick with weight

246
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,900
 And I was clearly just trying to find the holographic audience members versus the regular audience members

247
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:09,380
 Need those hollow foils, baby, you know eat them we need them

248
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:15,380
 Yeah, but I pulled a $25 card just grab me a couple packs. I wasn't you know, looking for anything. You're rich

249
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:21,740
 You're always exactly you're always looking for stuff, but you know, just grab a couple but whatevs it's crazy

250
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:29,180
 The whole thing's crazy, but I have a box of a figure like a rich person of Pokemon and magic cards

251
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:33,300
 Is there someone who like who like who like you follow on Instagram because they take their jet

252
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:38,620
 Is is there a Warren Buffett of Pokemon cards? Yeah, kind of Logan Paul

253
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:44,780
 Okay, have you seen his entrance? I was okay with the question. I'm disappointed with the

254
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:49,060
 When he was doing his boxing, I guess his brother has continued with it more

255
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:54,720
 But when he started off with his boxing and stuff and his entrance stuff, he had a oh, that's right

256
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,620
 He had a first edition Charizard on a gold chain around his neck

257
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:05,300
 His big fucking flex the other person I get such on the magic side Paul brothers

258
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:12,180
 Feelings you say they're so funny. I think they're so evil, but

259
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:22,060
 That's really funny to come out with Charizard. It is funny and then they're good at being the bad guy wrestlers in real life

260
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:27,500
 I guess when I say I'm conflicted by the Paul brothers. I mean starting now starting this okay, right?

261
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:33,220
 There's the first thing that I was like, oh, that's actually kind of funny. Well, you know post Malone

262
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:41,100
 Does something funny he's a giant magic head. Did you know that I did know that yeah

263
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:46,260
 He bought the one ring from the first Lord of the Rings

264
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:51,820
 Special set that came out. Oh, man. He spent like two million dollars to buy that fucking card

265
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:57,060
 Then that's a card. Yeah, I thought you meant like he bought a movie proper. No, no, no, no

266
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:01,380
 they made one card of the one ring some guy found it in a pack and

267
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:08,540
 Oh, they only made they only made one because it was the one ring and they only made one card of that whole set and

268
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:15,320
 Post Malone was like I'll take that please and he bought it. So he owns that he is crazy, but posty at least

269
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,660
 Plays there's a lot of there's a couple channels

270
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:24,540
 easier time explaining to SJ that you spent two million dollars on the card or

271
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:31,340
 You beat up a manager at Starbucks because they didn't have the mug you're trying to buy which would be the manager the manager

272
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:35,140
 Nope, the manager would be a much easier explanation to SJ

273
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,960
 Should be like you're an idiot and you're and you're gonna go to jail for like 30 days now

274
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,420
 I'll see you when you get out and you're still dumb if I did the card thing

275
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:51,080
 I think she would be so confused while she was divorcing me

276
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,180
 Like

277
00:22:55,180 --> 00:23:00,020
 Does that person feel like they were like this the manager secretly had it was hiding it from them

278
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:07,220
 Like like like they know you've got more of these cups like taking a person like oh you won't sell me the barista

279
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:12,460
 You're waiting for the the nice. Yeah that or they think that the employees get first dibs or some shit

280
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,980
 it's fucking crazy, which they do but

281
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:21,220
 But they're not gonna know but they're not gonna spend

282
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:26,620
 Two hours worth of pay for a fucking bear cup most of the time, right?

283
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,940
 I remember a certain collector shit came into the Starbucks. I worked at we actually couldn't get it

284
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,760
 We actually weren't allowed to buy stuff or we went on to buy it with a customer discount. We had to buy it right price

285
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:41,740
 Yeah. Oh, I see. Yeah, there's all kinds of rigmarole around it. It doesn't it's not enticing for

286
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:46,500
 Employees to nab the super juicy exclusive. That's why I had a house of shards

287
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:52,060
 You'll see a specific section of Starbucks collectibles fantastic behind the glass obviously

288
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:57,380
 Always and I won't let anyone who is more than 200 pounds go into that area

289
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:04,580
 Justice is happening

290
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:11,920
 I'll tell you who else loves a good house of shards and that is the following sponsor today's show is brought to you by

291
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:21,080
 Guy who really guy who's really into women's beach volleyball trying to convince you it's because of the sport not anything else

292
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,380
 That's from the gorilla dentist in the Bjork video in 2025

293
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:30,780
 It's guy who's really into women's beach volleyball trying to convince you it's because of the sport and not anything else

294
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:36,920
 Hey, man, come over this weekend watch a little watch a little game. Yeah. Yeah

295
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,380
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, though. It's it's a Saratoga versus the Renegades

296
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:50,300
 Uh-huh. Yeah, it's gonna be watching you're watching college beach volleyball bash on the beach, baby. This is the big one

297
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:56,300
 This is the big one. Uh-huh. Yeah, this is the one where those those college students are in tiny little bikinis, right?

298
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,820
 That's why you watch that. Hey

299
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:03,220
 This girl's very aerodynamic when they're up there getting ready for the spike. That's what I'm saying

300
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,860
 It's kind of like swimmers. They got to wear the right kind of stuff

301
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:09,620
 They got to shave their pubes and stuff, you know, so there's no less drag, you know

302
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,860
 You don't want pubed rag. I

303
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:20,740
 Wasn't aware of the pubed rag factor and oh man, it's it can cut fractions of seconds off your time

304
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,380
 Yeah. Yeah, how many?

305
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,460

00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,600
 There you go

355
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,580
 American Thanksgiving American Thanksgiving Canadian Thanksgiving. That's a good November 27

356
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,460
 You have to sign up by November 26th

357
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,980
 Hey

358
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,860
 That's how they work. That's how them dates work. What what?

359
00:29:50,860 --> 00:30:00,260
 15,000 is the number of reports that went into the Nevada DMV

360
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:04,020
 Snitches line. Oh in the first month

361
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:12,700
 Of the website being active. So people who don't know Nevada DMV has a snitch page on their thing

362
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:18,300
 If you see a car without a registration or without current registration, you can report them

363
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,800
 You can report your friends and neighbors

364
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:28,020
 I know this is not this doesn't tie into any history at all. Just report snitch on your friends and neighbors our friends

365
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:32,340
 Multiple news outlets are reporting of this so they're getting the stats out

366
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:39,460
 But they are not saying what's driving it like I they need to find some snitches and interview them

367
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,680
 I need to know what is driving the snitchery?

368
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:47,900
 Because here's the other thing that people don't know about Las Vegas. We're famously we don't have

369
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:52,360
 High taxes, you know, no income tax that kind of stuff

370
00:30:52,360 --> 00:31:00,980
 So the only way the state makes money is off the DMV. So our our our registrations are super expensive

371
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,660
 crazy high and so

372
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:08,760
 But our personalized license plates are cheap. Yes, that's true. That is true

373
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,500
 I tried to get one out here and I was like sticker shock. No, thank you

374
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:18,320
 So this is basically like a citizen driven tax hall for the state

375
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,320
 Yeah, this is the weirdest thing. Oh

376
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,020
 Ten scoop in the chat says to be fair

377
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:27,920
 14,987 of them were just him fucking with me

378
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:37,100
 That explains all of the certified letters for example all of the

379
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,460
 downtown Las Vegas parking is

380
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:47,500
 Already up on this like if you go into a parking garage and your cars are registered you would

381
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,120
 Someone from the city will come into that parking garage and ticket you

382
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,180
 Within within a half hour. It's some bullshit and like

383
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:01,940
 That's basically how I get my $75 reminder that I haven't forgot to renew my car

384
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:06,940
 Registration once every so often and it always happens by going downtown to do something or see something

385
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,620
 Yeah

386
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:13,980
 It's always going to the bucket showed at the majestic realm. I do a bucket show and cost Matt 75 bucks

387
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:21,060
 Yeah, that's all we don't do them every week anymore we can't do we cannot do a bucket show every week

388
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:24,820
 I can't it's a loss leader and that's yeah, I can't do it

389
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:28,180
 I

390
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,740
 Ran it to our friends Scott and Hazel the other night

391
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:38,460
 No, no scooper Nova girl. It's not $75 for the registration the ticket that they give you is $75 and then you have to go pay

392
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,180
 For your registration. Yeah, the ticket saying hey, you're not registered. I'm like a new car

393
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:45,740
 If you get like a new car, it's based on like how old your car is and how valuable it is

394
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:49,900
 Yeah, but a new car in Las Vegas will be like five or six hundred dollars for a registry

395
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:54,820
 Oh, no, it's more than that. That's going up. Yeah. Yeah when we got because we got two new cars

396
00:32:54,820 --> 00:33:00,400
 This year. Yeah, it was about two thousand dollars to register both of them

397
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,980
 Each of them

398
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:06,220
 All right, no for both of them. Okay, it was about it was about a grand a piece

399
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:14,860
 Yeah, it was it was like six hundred something for the van when we got the van but yeah for the for just the year

400
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,300
 Just a year. Yeah, just regular registration

401
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,860
 That's oh, no, it's crazy. That's why it's such a drive

402
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:24,860
 That's I'm saying like that's what that's what in terms of people listening to the story when we talk about it

403
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:28,680
 Like what is driving? This is that this is how Nevada makes money

404
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:33,940
 This is not that a this is how Nevada makes up for its taxes. This is a Nevada tax

405
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,780
 Yes is what the DMV registration is. Yeah

406
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:44,100
 So, uh, I went to the party in Las Vegas, oh good

407
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,980
 So

408
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:56,100
 Speaker world's newest show is over at the Casa Politan and it's just in what used to just be the walk-in bar area of

409
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,500
 opium

410
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,540
 little

411
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:07,100
 the little side restaurant area in between the old showroom and the superfico restaurant mm-hmm and

412
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:11,740
 They have put together this really cool dinner and

413
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:18,860
 It's a three course for course tentatively for course you can't bread and olives, of course, and that's you know, that's my favorite course

414
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,860
 Why wouldn't I count it?

415
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:26,020
 No, no bone marrow with their bread and olives. No boat. No, it's an upgrade. It's an upgrade. You got to get the upgrade

416
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:31,740
 But if you're at House of Sharks, the charcuterie board just comes with bone marrow. It's included boy your store

417
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,740
 Your store is on his top-notch

418
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:37,680
 It's a nice store. Yeah, I really want to go to this store

419
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:42,260
 And everyone is just so nice

420
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:49,060
 You know, it's like we set the bar things cheaper I think and

421
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:53,780
 It's about it's still like, you know, it's 150 bucks, but

422
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,940
 You pay that for tickets on this town most things anyway without food

423
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:03,260
 Yeah, yeah, and honestly, it's the other part where you pay that for food in this town without it, right?

424
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:09,060
 Yes, so you're getting one of those things at a deep discount. Yeah, and so it's this really intimate space

425
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:13,460
 I think the place holds maybe like 60 people and it's all yes

426
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:13,980
 I like that

427
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:19,700
 I think it's like dinner is and it's all like little little tables and booths and I was sitting at the bars one little bar

428
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,980
 area and

429
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:27,460
 The stages is like right there. I love this stage. Actually, it's like it's like heightened and right on the top there. Yeah, and

430
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,340
 and

431
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,020
 you see like

432
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,020
 eight variety acts and

433
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,820
 You get a three course meal and it's like super casual

434
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:40,380
 Like it's actually like that you you actually get break

435
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:45,220
 You're getting breaks with both right you stop watch entertainment then you give food and you have friends there like we had other friends

436
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,020
 We're just oh, that's cool

437
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:51,660
 We were just you know each course so you could talk in between and then shut up while the show's happening back and forth. Yes

438
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:56,860
 That's great. That's great. That's smart, especially nowadays, right? Give them a minute. Talk about it. Yeah

439
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:01,340
 yeah, like it was very much like it but it was funny was so we went and saw it and

440
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,260
 You know it's speaker world

441
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,900
 so does access some of these amazing acts and so the first two acts was the

442
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,180
 This great bubble act that's famously been in their shows for forever

443
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:16,900
 Where they have a person blow all kinds of different kind of crazy bubbles and make different shapes with smoke and stuff

444
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,900
 And it's beautiful. It's beautiful

445
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:24,060
 Heart-touching act and then our friend Lindsay Benner. Oh, I think it's Howard Noddy. I think it's Howard Noddy's

446
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:28,260
 Or one of it one of his students kind of brought to Spiegel world

447
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:33,580
 Tin scoop reminds us that $150 is the price of a tuna sub at this subway in Orleans

448
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:38,500
 These are that is a party sub though, that is a party sub

449
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,220
 So you get to wear a hat while you eat it

450
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,840
 It's your version of a party sub

451
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:52,620
 It's a regular foot log, but it comes with a hat and a hat says I spent $150 on a tuna sub

452
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,020
 so

453
00:36:55,020 --> 00:37:02,700
 Next up was Lindsay Benner who headlined our VIP night at course doing a shorter version of that same act a book of love

454
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:09,140
 It's remarkable at it, right and especially she juggles the balls in the dark to that beautiful piano music the whole bit or whatever

455
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:13,940
 So these are both nice acts very nice partner in it as well still no

456
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:18,800
 No, it's just it's just in the short version. It's just Lindsay. Okay. No, Gary. No, Gary

457
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,380
 And

458
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:27,540
 So then the next course came out was a little break and the mater dee I guess sensing that we was

459
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,940
 Entertainment people were something

460
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,060
 Or he says this to everybody

461
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:37,740
 But he's like, oh, don't worry. It gets weirder. It gets crazier

462
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,540
 Which so that was like such a bizarre warning

463
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:48,260
 Was like wait what but he wasn't kidding

464
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:58,740
 He was correct, okay have a drag act of a person dressed as a sexy cow

465
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:02,860
 Yeah, and then the cow does a full on

466
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:08,320
 Like dance throughout the entire room and then does an elaborate

467
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,140
 striptease of

468
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,500
 slowly

469
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,500
 Revealing its utters

470
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:24,500
 What are they sick what are they sequestered under like like like like like lace like lingerie and then like first like a like like

471
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,260
 It was just looks like a regular like it looks like it's one piece like it's one

472
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:31,660
 It's like utters that are are in like spandex or something like that

473
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:36,140
 But the spandex comes off and they're like a lacy utter on the cow

474
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,540
 And then boom it's revealed the

475
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:46,220
 Four otters and people just you know know how to cheer for burlesque so the people place goes wild when the otters are revealed

476
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,620
 Yeah. Oh, yeah, and then he shoots

477
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,020
 milk

478
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:54,360
 You all over the like just start shooting milk all

479
00:38:54,360 --> 00:39:01,420
 And at one point singles on a guy just like blasted into his mouth for like 50 seconds. Oh my god

480
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,420
 It's milk leg all over again

481
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:15,020
 I was dying laughing. I thought this is there. That's great. This month is hosted by Eddie's

482
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:19,920
 She's filling in for the main host and

483
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,740
 One point she just

484
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:29,740
 Walks around with an accordion asking people for her vices and just does crowd work and just basically

485
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:34,380
 Just narrates all the sexual tension in the room with everybody and their tables

486
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:40,620
 Singing a song to an accordion and I just was like I love this act. She could do this anywhere

487
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,620
 She could do this everywhere. I

488
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:47,060
 Just was like get get get scoop fest tomorrow. Let's go with yeah

489
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:52,860
 Accordion just walking on the strolling accordion fucking with people and it was like my favorite thing

490
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,260
 I'm one of my favorite things of the night very Judy Tanuta

491
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,980
 Yes, our IP. Yeah. Yeah

492
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:03,940
 Well, that is the thing like there are people that we know there's there's several different acts that we could point at that

493
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:10,720
 We that we know of over the years where the act is just the excuse for this talented person to be on stage

494
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,380
 Yes

495
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:17,860
 We just we just need this talented person to be out there with a microphone on so that they can be out there and do things

496
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:22,020
 We need a reason for it. Here's an accordion. All right now go

497
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:28,060
 And in this tiny room, they were very inventive with like finding a way to put like an aerial act in it

498
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:31,700
 But they use like a side of the floor instead of the stage for it

499
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,980
 But it's still like well lit and compelling

500
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:40,260
 Cool our friend penny is in it and she does this penny wren penny wren

501
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:46,620
 There's the fabulous penny wren who I always knew was a comedic burlesque artist. She does a very not comedic a very intense

502
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:52,980
 Dance burlesque number in it that I was like, wow, this is a different side of penny. It was really compelling really cool

503
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:57,300
 Penny is an excellent burlesque performer. Yeah in all in all

504
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:03,500
 Types of it and like I think I don't want to speak for her. I think that she enjoys the comedic side of it

505
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:08,580
 Maybe more than the kind of the classic side of it, but I mean she's got those classic chops for sure. Yeah

506
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:15,940
 It is also just like I was like this is one I laughed because being around speaker world in the in the

507
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,820
 2000s and the 2010s

508
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:27,540
 Boy, did the CEO really love the idea of dinner being served with acts like just kept finding every different anniversary

509
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,940
 Some kind of celebration need be like, why don't we bring in chefs?

510
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:39,200
 Yes, like get me food with entertainment, please and so I cannot this entertainment is great, but my fingers aren't greasy. You know, I

511
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,540
 Can't feel like this is just a dream come true for him

512
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:46,380
 But I actually love it like I think it's so smart for Vegas to have something like this

513
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:50,820
 It is is everything everything that looks like it needs to be there's a couple things happening

514
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:55,940
 I was like, oh these are things to note for like surviving the modern Vegas landscape and this is one of them

515
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:01,140
 Combining the dinner entertainment experience in a place. That's the price that you would have paid for one of those experiences

516
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:07,180
 And and then what happens is I guess the main host who at least is filling in for

517
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:15,520
 Actually meets everyone before the show like hosts everyone in the little room pants out champagne and actually memorizes everyone's name

518
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,500
 So throughout the show that's a gimmick

519
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:23,540
 She just turns and will while she's doing an act like actually say the person's name like in you Tom

520
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,540
 You know like and just talk to people

521
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:30,180
 And I was like, oh wow, and then also our friend gypsy

522
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:36,860
 walks around with these like cards that make people ask personal questions to each other as couples during the dinner parts of the

523
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:40,780
 Show great and I was like again, just that's it. That's a small thing

524
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:48,460
 but it's a huge thing and that like we don't get to focus on ourselves during a show and this is you are making that happen and

525
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:51,140
 Those are two things with this happening. I was like those two small touches

526
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:56,580
 I think need a lot for how to differentiate itself from well from Las Vegas and that is

527
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:03,500
 Part and parcel to the modern media landscape and the attention span scape and all that kind of thing

528
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:08,620
 You know, we're all we're all dipping into our phones every five minutes. I'm as guilty of it as the next person and

529
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:14,300
 This lets you do it. Well, I'm not being rude to everybody phone dip

530
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:20,540
 My phone's not even turning on what the hell

531
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,180
 Oh, there it goes. Yeah

532
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,820
 I've got a couple of new emails

533
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:28,260
 None of them look important. Okay, I'm back

534
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:32,500
 Alright, I got a message from Brogan that I'll have to get back to them

535
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:37,300
 Leaving it on read

536
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:45,700
 Another thing I'm very curious about because it's way outside of my taste

537
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,540
 but I get it is

538
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,500
 The Vanderpump casino

539
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:57,500
 What a focus. Yes. Yes. See the Cromwell is turning into the Vanderpump

540
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,740
 Really? Yeah, holy shit

541
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:05,700
 and I'm curious if it will work because for instance, one of the things like

542
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:13,220
 Vegas has been notoriously dead. It had a big spike this past weekend because of Bravo Con. Oh

543
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:22,260
 Yes, so all those shows that are on Bravo they had a gigantic convention in town and a lot of people came to town for Bravo Con

544
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,460
 It was really was like one of those

545
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:30,420
 Newer conventions that took over the town. Oh cool. And so like I'm curious if

546
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,500
 like niche

547
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,900
 Fandom like niche community fandom

548
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:42,400
 Can fill hotels on a regular basis instead of a convention like right?

549
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:45,540
 Right is the Vanderpump reach

550
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:50,580
 Such that those people will like to because basically treat themselves to the experience in the hotel

551
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:57,500
 And of course the Vanderpump will be at the hotel, you know, like will that be enough of a niche thing to?

552
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:01,540
 Fuel because it's the only innovation I'm seeing in the casino space

553
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:08,020
 I mean that one specifically might be because they're they're already I think three or four

554
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:13,860
 Large Vanderpump bars in casinos. There's one in Caesars. There's one in the flamingo

555
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:16,860
 That one in Caesars has been there forever and it is always busy

556
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,940
 Yeah

557
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:22,700
 It used to be a different thing and now it's been Vanderpump for quite a few years now

558
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:27,100
 And yeah, I mean even just this like yesterday when I walked past it

559
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:31,580
 There was just a giant line out the door of people waiting to get into it. Yeah, it is not slowed down

560
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,580
 There's one in Paris as well

561
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:36,380
 So I mean there are a couple of those and I know they're always busy

562
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:43,420
 So it really might be and and the brand is just kind of like nice decor and good food

563
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:51,140
 Good drinks and luxury. Well, what a brand what niche products do you think could bolster a full casino, Matt?

564
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:55,540
 What niche fandoms do you think could hold up a whole casino like that?

565
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:56,780
 I mean, I'm telling you right now

566
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:01,380
 If magic the gathering is popular as it is and post Malone is as popular as he is

567
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:06,940
 If post Malone were to somehow do one of these like David Blaine like residencies

568
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:09,780
 and

569
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:17,000
 Tie that in with magic the gathering events and you had to just simply come up with events outside of post Malone's weekends

570
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,500
 I bet that would do well enough for a small casino. I should point out that the Cromwell is a small casino

571
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:27,060
 The Cromwell is on the great location and it certainly could use

572
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:33,100
 Something the Cromwell was not itself an overachieving casino. It basically was just drays

573
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:38,260
 There's drays. It just was a nightclub. It was that it was the casino that was underneath drays

574
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:44,740
 Yeah, yeah, no, San Diego Comic-Con super scuba nova girls mentioning SDCC was thinking of moving to Vegas

575
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,900
 Well, I know Evo thrives in Vegas

576
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:55,340
 Evolution the evolution fighting championship, you know, that's it. I think I think some kind of if you could properly umbrella nerd dem

577
00:46:55,700 --> 00:47:02,860
 Right because that's actually what you're also trying to innovate is not just going out to Vegas but staying in that space, right?

578
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:06,980
 But are you looking for a year-round kind of attraction? That's what I'm curious about

579
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:09,340
 Yeah, stuff makes sense to me as a convention standpoint

580
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:13,980
 But this Vanderpump thing makes sense for it because the Vanderpumps are always there, right?

581
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:18,100
 Well, there was that talk of the Atari hotel that fell through right? Yeah

582
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:21,860
 So something along those lines, I think a video game based

583
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:24,780
 property could work

584
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:29,940
 Yeah, I video game fandom like you could be it could be like one floor would be all fighting games

585
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:34,460
 One floor could be shooters one floor could be competitive COD

586
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:40,020
 What I'm really kind of poking is like what what that is a great way to buy floors of fortnightly

587
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:43,140
 Go against the grain of what's currently

588
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:47,300
 One of the factors is currently hurting Las Vegas, which is people are feeling

589
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:53,420
 Totally nickels and dimes right price. Yeah, absolutely priced out. They don't feel like the value is there and

590
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:58,300
 Also, like because we are so feast and famine with these crazy events

591
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:04,160
 So like if you wanted to say come to Vegas just to check out, you know a couple of you know

592
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:09,860
 Area 15 a couple of museums or you know meet some friends for a bachelor party or whatever

593
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:16,820
 And if it's the same weekend as a Raiders game, you're fucked if it's the same weekend as a Taylor Swift concert

594
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:22,900
 You're fucked because every hotel raises their rates for these marquee events f1, right?

595
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:28,900
 Like yeah, you you and so now like and people people aren't planning their personal events around those kinds of things

596
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:34,820
 No one's gonna be like I went to my bachelor party in April. Oh, wait, there's a there's an event. I should move it

597
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:40,780
 They're gonna go somewhere else. They're gonna say not Vegas, you know, by the way having Monday night football

598
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:45,980
 Then a week of f1 then a Sunday football game at the Raiders Stadium

599
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:51,820
 Along with everything else that's already going on is too much stuff

600
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,220
 It's too much stuff. I agree

601
00:48:54,220 --> 00:49:02,500
 We found it. It is way too fucking much. Hey, I'm working for F, you know, I'm working for Spiegelworld for f1 this year

602
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,500
 I'm hosting

603
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:09,180
 Their ski lodge with Casey Wilson. Oh great into the show. So Casey and I have been hired to be

604
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,940
 hosts

605
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,540
 for the ski lodge

606
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:17,060
 Which is a an additional attraction within the Mercedes tent for people by the Mercedes experience

607
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:21,180
 And so we've been working on that all day and I've been I went to the track yesterday

608
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:25,940
 And I'm going to the track again today and we're commuting from the office to carpool and it's just a nightmare

609
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:34,900
 And I try to race home and there's a Raiders game and I was like, oh, I'm like really good at finding back roads

610
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:39,580
 But the back roads were slammed because of the Raiders game and I was like, oh my god this town

611
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:44,320
 And of course, it's a monsoon this week here as well

612
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:51,640
 So we were we had to go yesterday for a really? Oh, yeah, it's been hard hard rain for four days

613
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,700
 and

614
00:49:53,700 --> 00:50:01,060
 The the lodge itself is a the attraction is not a roofed thing. It's an open air thing

615
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:05,060
 So we we we then Casey never confused like no

616
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:07,980
 They still want us to come in to the track and I was like, okay

617
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:08,620
 Okay

618
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:14,660
 And then we so let me have a huddle up in this one area that was still kind of building the whole they're still building the

619
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:18,700
 Whole thing at one point Emily Wendler who's who's one of the one of the writers on it?

620
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:24,160
 Was like it feels like the race on Thursday more should be done than what's I'm seeing

621
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,780
 Still very much putting together

622
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:31,020
 Isn't one of those things where they all come in at the last minute you go

623
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:34,660
 It's just then they're done

624
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:39,220
 I think you're confusing it with the pit crew. No, the pit crew is the ones who build the whole thing, right?

625
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:45,620
 Roadies they set everything up and then find the pit crew comes in and just like oh, yeah, sure

626
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:55,100
 So we're in this one area and we're working and the power goes out because of the rain is just

627
00:50:55,100 --> 00:51:02,540
 Everywhere and then as we're doing boom like a leak like a big stream of water leak just burst through one of the

628
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:08,580
 This town

629
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:16,740
 Time there is a major rainstorm. It is just hilarity. Yeah, and it's not even I would love to say that it's people's fault

630
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:20,300
 I really don't think it is because it's so dry and so hot here all the time

631
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:23,660
 So all of the seals like they they dry out and rot and everything

632
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:27,260
 Yes

633
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:33,280
 Seal can you hold any water back at all or you to dry it out?

634
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,700
 What happened to his face

635
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:47,900
 Yeah, no, it's been it's been a lot it's been a whole lot this week, yeah

636
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:54,100
 But I can't wait. I have more story about wait till after the weekends over to tabulate all my stories for

637
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:57,100
 It's been a really funny event

638
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:03,460
 Had some friends outside they've been you know setting up speakers for for the whole event there

639
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:06,020
 they run the sound systems for for the whole event and

640
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:08,820
 And yeah, they were I was texting with them yesterday

641
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:16,100
 They were trying to they had found a roll of clear plastic and they were trying to get their

642
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,620
 Queen okay

643
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:25,620
 They had found this role of this Queen and they were trying to waterproof their golf cart so they could get from site to site

644
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:29,340
 Absolutely soaking wet

645
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:34,540
 So they're like trying to clip up this Queen on the front of the golf cart to be turning it into a winch

646
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:40,700
 I have doors that yeah, we're leaving the track and then like one of the carts came pulling up one of the guys working

647
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,780
 F1 was like pull up any slowed down and go so don't worry

648
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:48,060
 I'm not gonna get you wet and then keeps driving and I was like, well you can give us a ride

649
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:52,300

676
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:14,460
 Yeah, you see you see the kiddo and that's really fun. And and you know, she's she's growing up. She's five now

677
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:18,820
 She's she's you know, just a person. She remembers things she could talk to you about things. It's great

678
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:23,860
 On the other hand these fucking kids and their germs

679
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:29,820

00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:48,180
 It's going around when you hear that. Yeah, it's going around. You don't picture that but that's exactly what everyone's saying

683
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,900
 yes

684
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,920
 it's in their ability to cover their coughs and

685
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:56,340
 Just they just don't do it. No

686
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:06,400
 I'm hoping to stay well during this holiday season, but I've been busy as a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest

687
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:12,960
 It's awesome though. My classes have picked up. I just started my second level one this Monday

688
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:18,380
 then I went hot taught my free class over at the duty last night, which was great fun and

689
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:21,800
 And I got my level two class

690
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:27,540
 Locked in starting next week next Tuesday. So I'll be teaching two classes a week moving forward

691
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:36,540
 Which is awesome. I I'm just astounded. It's it's great. I'm super excited for this community to keep growing and

692
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:43,000
 Yeah, there we go. Just make the drive Jason. Just do it. Just come on out. Come on out to Pittsburgh

693
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:50,740
 Do you have like hand sanitizer like what are you doing to promise to keep this not like a germ germ thing?

694
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:54,780
 You know what I mean? Well now that it is truly getting into the cold times

695
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:59,380
 Yeah, I think I'm gonna have to just hand sanitize a little more here and there and you know, I bring water

696
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:04,480
 I bring my vitamin C drops like always keep myself poppin the vitamin C drops

697
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:09,020
 And yeah, have you thought about teaching improv over zoom? You love that. God damn it, dude

698
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:14,100
 The difference is staggering the difference is staggering

699
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:20,420
 Staggering I feel energized after class is not drained. It's crazy. It's crazy

700
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:27,660
 I won't I won't think I'll ever do it again. I don't think I can I don't think it's I think it's unethical at this point

701
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:29,660
 It's just not even right to do

702
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:32,020
 Talked into it a few times

703
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:39,180
 Yeah, and after one I was like literally like just like bleary-eyed like like just like oh god

704
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,180
 and it was like an hour and a half and

705
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:45,940
 After they're like the team says that was great. Are you right? Of course?

706
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:51,420
 Yeah, because they just fucking vampires your whole soul. Yeah, cuz you have to give like

707
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:55,460
 I mean I give a lot in my classes, but Jesus to get it through the screen is like, oh

708
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:58,260
 God damn it

709
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:05,220
 Yeah, no scooper another girl. The monthly poll zooms will not be improv classes. No, no, no, no by the by

710
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:08,340
 I'm about to set up the invites for that as soon as I can figure that out

711
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:11,700
 Exactly, which levels I need to send the invites out to and how nice that

712
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,860
 Which is right once I'm thinking day after Thanksgiving

00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:20,900
 That Friday night take a shot because people will be free. Yeah, we'll see how it goes. So

714
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:23,500
 Yeah

715
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,540
 Mm-hmm. All right while I was out of town. I really missed my bidet. Oh

00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:34,340
 Asshole really missed my bidet. I fucking bet dude Jacob being away from it for a few days

717
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:38,660
 I just might I was like, oh now I have to take a whole shower if I want my asshole to get clean

718
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:45,700
 I am still waiting for that day that glorious day when I can get a full-on Japanese toilet installed in this place

719
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:51,540
 Yeah, I really want one with all the bells and whistles. That's gonna be that's gonna be when I know I've made it that and

720
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:55,060
 A pinball machine those are the great thing about having all the bells and whistles on there

721
00:58:55,060 --> 00:59:00,420
 Is that everybody in the house knows when you're taking a shit who cares they can because they can hear all the bells and whistles

722
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:02,420
 Yeah

723
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:10,300
 Well, mine's a Japanese toilet so it doesn't sound like that it sounds different

724
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:21,820
 I'm a Japanese toilet and I don't sound like this. He's just take one. It's just one big gong when you when you drop the main load

725
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:33,420
 I would like that a lot

726
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:40,660
 Yeah, what's worse is I'm like kept bringing up while he was there like God he really misses bidet

727
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,660

 How would you make such a mess before you would get around there be everywhere you kink the hose you kink the hose there at

 Jacob in the dickhole what company just announced that it has instituted a new 10-4

924
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:06,340
 program with its workers

925
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:09,860
 That's a 10 hour workday

926
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:13,300
 For four days a week. Oh

927
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:19,380
 I see. Oh, I've done that before I did not like that a friend of mine used to do did it with his company

928
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:23,060
 And it's doing very well. I don't think this is I bet it works better for companies

929
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:26,640
 It doesn't work well for entertainment. We didn't for 12s back when we did our

930
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:32,860
 Alien stuff because it took so long to get into the makeup and oh, yeah, it helped keep

931
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:37,420
 Yeah, it was good. It worked for us. Yeah, I know there's some places in other countries. They do

932
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:41,060
 720s but

933
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:47,780
 720s yeah, exactly that is rough coming coming to us a state near you. I'm afraid

934
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:55,780
 Google

935
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:59,260
 Target oh

936
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:05,900
 It's not the 10 hours four days a week thing when a customer is within 10 feet display welcoming body language

937
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:12,900
 Was within four feet verbal greeting or offer personal assistance. Yeah, that went over like a lead balloon. I can tell you everybody

938
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:15,660
 Everybody was like eat shit

939
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:22,220
 First of all, is there any onboarding and by that I mean so like what are you gonna get like a tape measure and start?

940
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:24,220
 Like make sure when there's nothing I mean

941
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:30,620
 Yeah, I mean that just it seems like a bad idea all it's not as though

942
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:36,500
 The the current directives are like scowl at everyone entering the store

943
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:42,200
 You know, it's it's nothing. It's not it's all common-sense shit, but then also

944
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:51,780
 It's very clear that they have no idea what's going on on the ground level of their stores or they're just really trying to

945
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:59,020
 Shine some shit up for the investors cuz boy, oh boy things is a rocky road a rocky road

946
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:02,120
 Oh great. Well, that's only change the scores Matt's ahead with

947
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:04,820
 Sorry, I just didn't want spoilers. I'm a target

948
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:11,800
 Stockholders and I have a meeting coming up. So great. No spoilers Paul. I want to leave it all for the call

949
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:16,840
 Okay, I'll keep it for the call Matt does like those investment calls

950
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:23,620
 Score check Matt has 1600. I'm down to zero now after that daily double and Paul has a negative 1200

951
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:27,220
 But it's Paul's turn Paul. You have multiple choice for 800 1200 to 2000

952
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:29,560
 I gotta go 2000 to get back into the positive baby

953
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:33,540
 Which college town is famous for its pepperoni rolls?

954
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:40,220
 Manhattan, Kansas Morgan town, West Virginia Stillwater, Oklahoma or Tuscaloosa, Alabama

955
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:46,780
 Well, I know it's a big thing here. It's a big thing here and we're close to West Virginia. So I'll go with okay

956
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:48,780
 All right. Let's see it

957
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:57,260
 Morgantown, West Virginia is absolutely correct similar to a stromboli but smaller and less cheese mid-atlantic market has the best ones. I

958
01:20:57,260 --> 01:21:03,620
 Do not care for pepperoni rolls get out of my zone leave my zoom. Okay

959
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:07,020
 Up Paul has left Matt. You're up

960
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:12,380
 Let's see here if I I could seal the victory with 1200

961
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:15,060
 That is true. I'll do 1200

962
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:19,480
 All right, multiple choice for 1200 from Sesame Street's inception in

963
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:23,180
 1969 until his retirement in 2018

964
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:30,020
 Carol Spiney played what two Sesame Street characters Big Bird and Oscar Big Bird and Grover

965
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:33,300
 Count and Grover or Grover and Oscar. Oh

966
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:39,020
 Man, let's see. I believe he played Big Bird for sure

967
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:44,840
 Okay, so now is it Big Bird and Grover or Big Bird in Oscar?

968
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:47,940
 Mm-hmm

969
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:54,080
 Now if I get this wrong, I'm dumb that I put myself in second place. I'm a fool. I should've done 800. I

970
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:57,580
 Don't think this is why you're dumb. Oh good point

971
01:21:57,580 --> 01:22:03,300
 I'm going to say

972
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:14,500
 Grover Big Bird and Grover be be Big Bird and Grover is

973
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:18,060
 Incorrect

974
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:25,000
 That is why you rarely saw both of them at the same time that was my lots of a picking Grover

975
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:31,820
 Let's see here Paul has 800 Matt has 400 I have zero

976
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:36,300
 There is a multiple choice question for 800 left and it's mine for the tie

977
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:42,740
 What global news company was started in 1850 when it developed a prototype news service?

978
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:49,180
 using homing pigeons and electric telegraphy to transmit messages between Brussels and

979
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:51,340
 ancient

980
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:52,540

 Let's see news company

983
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:09,300
 They used homing pigeons. That's got to be Sky News, right? Let's go Sky News. See it's a good guess

984
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:13,100
 It's a wrong. Oh, it's Reuters and

985
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:16,540
 Penn loves this fact

986
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:19,020
 There you go according to this. Oh, there you go

987
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:28,060
 That is the game Paul wins with 800 points Matt's in second with 400 and I'm in third with negative 800 that comes from Smitty
