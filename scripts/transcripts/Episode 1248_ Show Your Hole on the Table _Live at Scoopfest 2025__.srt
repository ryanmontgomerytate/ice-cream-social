1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Hey Johnny! Do you want to go to an ice cream social?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Yeah, I'd love to!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Great! Let's go!

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Oh man, it is Scoop Fest here in Las Vegas!

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Let me hear your scoops!

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Of course we have a great night here with us.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 It's time for Matt Madley's Ice Cream Social!

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Sitting to my left is Paul Mattingly!

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Across from me, that's Mr. Matt Donnelly!

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 From the knobs and tiles is Jacob the Audio Guy!

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Oh, I love that guy!

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 We're preaching fun!

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 How we doing, Scoop Fest?

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 We've had a long Scoop Fest.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Yeah, it's been a good one.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 It's been a real good one.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 You guys having a good Scoop Fest so far?

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Oh, thank God! I'm glad it's not just me.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Yeah, it's been a blast. It's been such a cool deal.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Of course, we just always got to cap it off as our last kind of live event

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 before we do the big jock versus nerd ball.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 That's right!

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 So, gotta bring back our boys. Our brothers.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Our brothers from another podcast.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 The O.O. Boys!

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 The O.O. Boys, if you will.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 The O.O. Old school boys.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Gentlemen, thanks for being here.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Oh man, I mean it's the best.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 It does not get better than hanging out at the Orleans at Scoop Fest.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Is it just us that like, I mean just Las Vegas is the Orleans to me?

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Everyone else is trying too hard, the Orleans?

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Oh, like in terms of like if you really try to boil down Las Vegas.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 I feel like every other building in this town is trying to be something they're not

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 except for the one that we're sitting in right now.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 It's the most honest building in Las Vegas.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Yeah, right down to the three alligators playing jazz.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 The iconography of authenticity, anthropomorphized alligators.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 And also like just the sheer size.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 When you walk in the Orleans, they're like 20 foot alligators.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Yeah.

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Like who turned in the drawings?

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Like that's how much space it should take up when you walk into this place.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Yeah.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Can I?

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Alright, so a long running joke that Brian and I have had whenever we've been at the Orleans

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 is that nobody knows when the Bailey Wick is open.

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Yes.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Always true.

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 And they've posted hours.

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 I've never seen, like as far as I knew,

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 like it opened when somebody like phased into existence inside of it.

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Like there is no rhyme or reason.

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 You have properly summoned Bailey Wick.

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Want a beer?

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 But like they actually posted hours and they're even more fucked up.

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 It's like it's only open from like 3 p.m. to 10.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 In Las Vegas at 10.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Yes.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 No, your premium bar.

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Fuck you, get out.

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Yeah.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 It's like, oh, the place for live music and food and booze?

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Nope.

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 After 10 o'clock, you are not allowed in here.

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Done.

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Yeah.

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Just psychotic, just sociopathic behavior by the Bailey Wick.

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Yeah.

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Somebody do a Netflix series on the Bailey Wick.

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Let's go.

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Find out what skeletons are in that attic.

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Bailey Wick doc series.

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 TM.

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 That is ours.

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 So Brian, you have kept up your bit of asshole blackjack?

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Oh, Jesus.

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Now I know why he's homeless.

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 All right.

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Yeah.

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Now I am homeless.

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Okay.

83
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 First of all, I was gambling with somebody who didn't like the idea of asshole blackjack

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 because he's somebody who feels like, hey, man, gambling is supposed to be fun.

85
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And you're like actively, does anybody not know?

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 I don't know why I'm phrasing it this way.

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 We don't know it.

88
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 What's asshole blackjack?

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 How do you explain asshole blackjack?

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Refresh.

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 So blackjack, game where cards come out.

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 People at tables get very mad if you are not playing correctly.

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Quote, unquote, by the book.

94
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 By the book.

95
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Because they believe that the cards that you got by playing incorrectly or didn't get by

96
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 playing incorrectly is affecting them.

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 And no matter who's sitting at the table, they want the table to play as a team as a

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 whole.

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Yes.

100
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Against the dealer, not against each other.

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Just how it's supposed to go, right?

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Right.

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 So what Brian does is the opposite.

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Yes.

105
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Well, every so often I'll play something a little bit off book or do something silly just

106
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 because it's delightful when doing something wrong yields amazing results.

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 And then I hear to my left, that was my ace or whatever.

108
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 And it's like, okay, well, then now we're no longer playing blackjack.

110
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 We're playing asshole blackjack, which usually lasts about five minutes, and then the game

111
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 is over and all my money is gone.

112
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 But every so often an epic run ends up happening.

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 And Justin and I laugh and shout and make a lot of noise, chase everyone off.

114
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 And then as we leave the table, they say, excuse me, you dropped your Percocet.

115
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Yes.

116
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 A true thing that happened, one of the first times we played asshole blackjack is we just

117
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 infuriated a family from Alabama that were just like spitting fucking mad.

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 And we could not stop laughing.

119
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 And then at the end, my Percocets fell out of my pocket.

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Now, just collapsing this fucking caricature of a human into startling relief.

121
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Oh, this just got real.

122
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Now, as I was trying to explain, the beauty of asshole blackjack is a piece of performance

123
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 art.

124
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 And I like to think of myself as a patron of the arts by spending all my money on asshole

125
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 blackjack.

126
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Jesse, our friend, had the mistaken impression that the point was to piss people off.

127
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 No, that is a side effect.

128
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Ah, yes.

129
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 That is righteous and good.

130
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 But it is not the point.

131
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 That's right.

132
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 The point is to bend reality just a little bit and maybe just maybe you'll get lucky

133
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 and doing the wrong thing will yield something magical.

134
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 So Jesse and I were playing blackjack and eventually got down to just the two of us.

135
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Jesse did not believe in asshole blackjack.

136
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 He didn't believe it would work and he didn't much care for the idea of it.

137
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 And then I got dealt a five and the dealer had a three face up.

138
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 And then I got dealt another five and then a face down card, right?

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 So we all know what you're supposed to do in this situation, right?

140
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Split.

141
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Well, okay.

142
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 So I take my chip and I push it forward and they say double.

143
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 I said, "Uh-uh."

144
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 The rules say you're supposed to double there.

145
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 That's right.

146
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Yeah.

147
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 So I split my fingers and I said, "No, split."

148
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 And they're like, "Are you sure?"

149
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Do I look like a man who is sure?

150
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Pit boss kind of glances over.

151
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Yeah, yeah.

152
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 First card, an ace.

153
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 And then push that second chip forward.

154
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 To double down.

155
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 To double down on a soft 16.

156
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 All right.

157
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Next one, five.

158
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Three goes down.

159
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 It's an eight.

160
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Yeah.

161
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Chip goes forward.

162
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Let's go.

163
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Keep it going.

164
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Finally, there's -- oh, wait.

165
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 I'm sorry.

166
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 I left out the most important part.

167
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 When I split them fives, the first card that was dealt was a five, at which point that got split.

168
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 So there are three fives.

169
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 I forgot that part of the story.

170
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 And it was upon the third five that another five was dealt.

171
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Chip goes forward.

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Four fives.

173
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Four fives on the table.

174
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Oh, man.

175
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Another card.

176
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 It's like some bullshit in the teens.

177
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 And then finally, last one.

178
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 I think it was another -- I think it was another eight.

179
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 And I doubled down on it again, at which point 13 -- it ended up -- they threw down a bunch of cards.

180
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 And then they said the word's 21.

181
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 And I was like, "Well, dang it.

182
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 That would have been a neat story."

183
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 But then there was like a weird vibe.

184
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 And then she smiled and was like, "Eh?"

185
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 I'm like, "I don't get it.

186
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 You took all the money."

187
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 And they were like, "No, it's 21.

188
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 It's 22.

189
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 We busted.

190
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 You won."

191
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 And then they gave me a $500 chip.

192
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Hey!

193
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Believe in magic, people.

194
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Yeah.

195
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Assholes win.

196
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Exactly.

197
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Show your hole on the tables at the Orleans, the home of asshole blackjack.

198
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Yes.

199
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

200
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Just spread 'em.

201
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Justin.

202
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Yeah.

203
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 You're running the Politics, Politics, Politics podcast.

204
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Yes.

205
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Yes.

206
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Quiet, quiet, couple weeks.

207
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Nothing to see.

208
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Just real tumbleweeds, you know, bunch of action.

209
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Does that mean, like, as a podcast, you consider it, like, a great time to be a political podcaster?

210
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Like, how does it feel when things are so divulgent?

211
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 It feels great that I don't have to think about what I'm going to talk about.

212
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Because you have to do, at a certain point, beyond all of the, you know, the subject matter,

213
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 is obviously as emotionally charged as you can make it.

214
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 But I have to kind of make the donuts every day.

215
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 Right.

216
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 It's a lot easier when it's like, "Okay, well, here's what we're talking about.

217
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Now we're going to have somebody on, and we're going to talk about the very obvious thing

218
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 that everybody wants to hear about."

219
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 But, yeah, no, it's fucking insane.

220
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 It's crazy.

221
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Do you ever wake up and be like, "I just want to do a football podcast."

222
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 I often fantasize about doing another podcast.

223
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 And then I realize that that's what's gotten me into this mess.

224
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Doing too many fucking podcasts.

225
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 But usually, yeah, it's usually like that.

226
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 It's like, "Oh, my God, I would love to just have shitty hot takes on sports."

227
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 But then I'm like, "Eh, but then I would have to actually, like, think about them,

228
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 and I wouldn't want them to be embarrassing."

229
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Right.

230
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 I don't know.

231
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Yeah.

232
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 But also, yeah, I don't know.

233
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Most sports podcasts are like that.

234
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 That's the sound of you ask too real a question.

235
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Yeah.

236
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 You pumped them right in the id.

237
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Sorry.

238
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Sorry, apologize.

239
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Give me a sports hot take right now.

240
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 No, no, no, no.

241
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 I will be up at 6.30 in the morning.

242
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Hopefully, I'll go to McMillan's across the way.

243
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Yeah, what is this thing?

244
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 What is happening?

245
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 Well, the Steelers are playing the Minnesota Vikings in Ireland.

246
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Right.

247
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 In Ireland.

248
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 In Ireland.

249
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Yeah.

250
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 So I'll be over there.

251
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Several of you just asked why.

252
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Who knows?

253
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 No one knows.

254
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 If you want to improve relationships with Ireland, you send Aaron Rodgers.

255
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Yes.

256
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 That's right.

257
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 You send...

258
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Our best and brightest, Carson Wentz and Aaron Rodgers.

259
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 We send our cave-dwelling ayahuasca-drinking weirdo conspiracy theorist to Ireland.

260
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Look, if the red zone offense stays in the 80%, then I will also take ivermectin.

261
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Seems like a needless wager on your part, but okay.

262
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Yeah.

263
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 That's fine.

264
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 I don't know how it happens, but we're scoring a lot inside the 20.

265
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Mattingly.

266
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 Yes.

267
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 You woke up early.

268
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 You took scoops on an outing.

269
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Some scoops on an outing.

270
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 I did.

271
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 We had a little nerd out.

272
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Went out to Alternate Reality Comics out here in Las Vegas.

273
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Yes.

274
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Big shout out to Alternate Reality.

275
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 It's my boy Ralph.

276
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Ralph has been holding it down for damn near 30 years out here.

277
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 It's the best little comic shop in Vegas.

278
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 I just love it.

279
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Love it.

280
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Yeah.

281
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Some scoops were kind enough to join me in the morning.

282
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Vegas early.

283
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 But we went out there and had a great time.

284
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Terri.

285
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 I really, it was awesome because I've just gotten really back into comics in the last

286
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 year and a half or so.

287
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 So, I was able to give heartfelt, earnest recommendations on what is on the shelves right now, so that

288
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 was kind of fun.

289
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 And people bought books I recommended, which was great.

290
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 That was really cool.

291
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 And then we went-

292
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 A lot of tits.

293
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 A lot of boobies.

294
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 A lot of circles and squirrels.

295
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 More circles and circles.

296
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 They're just circles and squirrels.

297
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 You don't know what I'm saying.

298
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 You mean like in the comic shop or in the comics?

299
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 In the comics.

300
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 So, this is the thing.

301
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,720
 Paul handed my son a comic with tits in it.

302
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,720
 Nice.

303
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,920
 But your son is 28 years old, right?

304
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,920
 Yeah.

305
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

306
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,920
 It was a bargain bin.

307
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,760
 He said tits only to Paul.

308
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,000
 Give me that book with them tits.

309
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,120
 An old 50 Cent issue of Powers, and it's one of my favorite series ever.

310
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,120
 And I was like, "Here you go."

311
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,320
 And Michael Avon Owing's artwork is very stylistic.

312
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,320
 Sure.

313
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,000
 And it's really just circles and circles when you're looking at the boob, but whatever.

314
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Paul's staying at my house this time around though.

315
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,680
 He actually says that in real life to his wife as well.

316
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,100
 It's just circles and circles, baby.

317
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,100
 Yeah.

318
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,100
 They're just circles and circles up there, baby.

319
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,100
 Thank you.

320
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,100
 My boobs don't look like that.

321
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,100
 Circles and circles is my favorite.

322
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,100
 Oh, oh boys album.

323
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,100
 Yeah.

324
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,100
 Boobs is a flat circle.

325
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,360
 No, that was awesome.

326
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,640
 And then right next door to the comic shop is a new card shop, which is under new management.

327
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,640
 I had never been.

328
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,640
 Card?

329
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
 Card.

330
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,920
 Collectible cards, Pokemon, Magic, all that kind of shit.

331
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,000
 It was incredible, well, really well kept, nice, run well.

332
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,200
 I spent way too much money in these types of shops too?

333
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
 No, sir.

334
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
 No, no.

335
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
 So this is all just like magic cards?

336
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
 All Magic the Gathering and Pokemon.

337
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,280
 And maybe a little dash of Lorcan.

338
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,280
 Don't know what that is.

339
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,760
 It's the Disney trading card thing.

340
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,760
 Good.

341
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,760
 Yeah.

342
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,760
 So yeah.

343
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,760
 And they really were holding it down.

344
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,240
 They run tournaments there.

345
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,360
 So clearly they had their stuff on.

346
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,360
 It was just clean.

347
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,360
 Shop was clean.

348
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,360
 Prices were right.

349
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,360
 Oh nice.

350
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,360
 Which is a huge thing.

351
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,360
 I don't know.

352
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,360
 Do you guys keep up?

353
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,360
 I mean some dirty Magic the Gathering shops, right?

354
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,360
 Oh god.

355
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
 Filth Fests.

356
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,360
 No.

357
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,360
 Seriously.

358
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,360
 No.

359
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,360
 Do we have any Magic fans out here?

360
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,360
 Any Magic players?

361
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,360
 You know what?

362
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,360
 That was a no.

363
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,360
 I gave up Magic the Gathering in 1993.

364
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,360
 Okay.

365
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,880
 And I gave away my Black Lotus.

366
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
 Damn.

367
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,720
 Before you did that, Mr. Brine Brushwood.

368
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
 Oh shit.

369
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,720
 That's valuable.

370
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,720
 What does that mean?

371
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,720
 That is an extremely valuable card.

372
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
 Okay.

373
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
 Before you did that, Mr. Brine Brushwood.

374
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,720
 Oh.

375
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:52,480
 Would you say that the average conglomerate of Magic the Gathering players have the highest

376
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,060
 standards of hygiene about them?

377
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:03,720
 There are signs on many Magic the Gathering convention doors that say, "Wash your ass

378
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,240
 before you come in here."

379
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,560
 Like seriously, there are rules in tournaments that are like, "Stinkies go home."

380
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,720
 It's a problem.

381
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,080
 I'm almost certain that for a while there was a Twitter account that was nothing but

382
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,640
 ass cracks at Magic the Gathering.

383
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,640
 Oh yeah.

384
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,640
 There was a Twitter account.

385
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:25,800
 There was a dude who would always take pictures with his hands in prayer emoji form by just

386
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,000
 heinous ass cracks at Magic the Gathering.

387
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 If you can look it up.

388
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Yeah.

389
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 That's right.

390
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 I forgot.

391
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 That's right.

392
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 He did his little meme of praying.

393
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Yeah.

394
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 His ass cracks.

395
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,560
 And many were strewn with stuff.

396
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,560
 Just bad.

397
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,560
 It was a fucking ...

398
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,560
 Look it up.

399
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,560
 Strewn with stuff?

400
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,560
 I'm telling you.

401
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,560
 I will not look it up.

402
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,280
 By the way, and here's how fucked that community is.

403
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,680
 They yelled at the guy.

404
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:56,480
 They banned the guy from coming to Magic Tournament when it's like he is a Pulitzer Prize winning

405
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,360
 journalist who has just broken loose a horrifying scandal.

406
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,600
 You should be thanking him.

407
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,200
 He should be the commissioner.

408
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,880
 You leave our dirty butts be.

409
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,880
 Exactly.

410
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,880
 But no.

411
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,560
 Big ass told him to fucking pass out his hand.

412
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,760
 So all that to say, when you find a really clean Magic the Gathering shop, you're like,

413
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,760
 "Holy shit.

414
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,480
 I might be able to breathe in here."

415
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,480
 Yeah.

416
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,480
 Yeah.

417
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,600
 So it was really well kept and really nice.

418
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,240
 And then, of course, just down the way from there ...

419
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,960
 Much easier to tap two mana than to wipe twice.

420
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,960
 Good Lord.

421
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,800
 It's a fucking fact, man.

422
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,720
 Their asses are their graveyards.

423
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
 It's just ...

424
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,720
 What is with ...

425
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
 What is that expression?

426
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
 Bones are your money.

427
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,720
 Yeah.

428
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
 This is the thing with pro wrestling too.

429
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,000
 Especially for big shows, you'll have these things on the reddits that are like, "Guys,

430
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 shower."

431
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 For the love of God.

432
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Yeah.

433
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,560
 Why are you going to show up and just stink out everybody?

434
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,080
 Now, like WrestleMania here in Vegas, the cheapest seat that you can get is $800.

435
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:00,280
 And imagine that you're standing next to somebody who's a fucking biohazard and just stinks to

436
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,280
 high heaven the entire time.

437
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,280
 That's going to be bad.

438
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,040
 Paul was just telling me about this the other day, about the WrestleMania thing here, just

439
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,560
 being so fucking expensive.

440
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,560
 Oh, yeah.

441
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,560
 Yeah.

442
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,120
 Luckily, I have just purchased a black Lotus card.

443
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,120
 Oh, really?

444
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,120
 Yeah.

445
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,120
 I'm going to sell that one.

446
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,120
 What deal did you get?

447
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
 There you go.

448
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,120
 No, I got it for $400,000.

449
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,120
 There you go.

450
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,120
 Yeah.

451
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,120
 I'm just going to use that.

452
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,120
 Is it really worth $400,000?

453
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,120
 According to this, it is.

454
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,120
 Yeah.

455
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,120
 Look, when you need three mana ...

456
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,120
 It depends on the addition.

457
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,120
 It depends on the condition.

458
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
 Yeah.

459
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,640
 In the early days, they didn't have the play balancing quite right.

460
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,080
 So in tournaments where you're playing for keepsies, then all of a sudden it became profitable

461
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,080
 and made sense.

462
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,040
 The value went up, and then the legend grew long and all that stuff.

463
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:48,000
 But I quit because I was finally making friends in college, and that was ruining my friendship,

464
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 so away it went.

465
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Yeah.

466
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,880
 That was exactly a conversation that was had at the Magic Place, because he was talking

467
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,600
 about he plays commander, and he's got a couple of different decks, and he has to decide

468
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,960
 on the day, "Do I want to keep my friends, or do I want to play a fun game of Magic?"

469
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,960
 Yeah.

470
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,320
 Well, because if you're playing mathematically, then some pretty unfun, brutal strategies

471
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,320
 start to make sense.

472
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,320
 Exactly, yeah.

473
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,760
 There are mechanics that you can lose forever friends from, yeah.

474
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,920
 Just by taking all this shit, taking all the cards.

475
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,480
 You could play a high-risk thing, and so it's not fun for the other player.

476
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:28,080
 There was a land killer deck that I played where it's just like, you need land for energy,

477
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:33,000
 so imagine if you never got to take a single step forward in the contest, and then meanwhile,

478
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,820
 the moment you put down one land, like, "Fuck you, fire, dead," you're not doing anything.

479
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,820
 Go on, go on, go on.

480
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,820
 Yeah.

481
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,640
 So why are the black lotus card?

482
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,760
 So this is so early, nobody had even heard of the game.

483
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:52,800
 There were what they called black-bordered alphas, and so we would just, we would congregate.

484
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,840
 I heard they make the rockin' world go round.

485
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,840
 They did, yeah.

486
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,120
 Yeah, like we would wait for them to show up with the Tuesday mail, and then we would

487
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,320
 just like, you know, like vultures, just crrrr, and stuff, everything.

488
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,320
 Okay.

489
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
 So it's like an unboxing on a package.

490
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,320
 Yeah, yeah.

491
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
 You just found one in a pack.

492
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
 Yeah.

493
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,320
 Yeah.

494
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,920
 And that's that black rim.

495
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,920
 Oh, there it goes.

496
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,920
 Did you ever play it?

497
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,920
 Oh, sure.

498
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,760
 It was just a card to me, and then I gave them all away.

499
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:21,160
 I think my brother gave me 70 bucks for all my cards, and he later, I think, sold it for

500
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
 500.

501
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,160
 Yeah.

502
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,160
 Did you even have them sleeved back then?

503
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,160
 No, goodness, no.

504
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,160
 No, rock on.

505
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,160
 Them sleeves, though?

506
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,160
 Them sleeves?

507
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,160
 Oh, them sleeves, though.

508
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
 They weren't no sleeves, though.

509
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,160
 Yeah.

510
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,480
 They used to, in the very early on, they wanted to, they claimed ...

511
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,040
 Them sleeves, though.

512
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,840
 They claimed that you had to ante every single game, so you would shuffle your deck, and

513
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,000
 then blind, you'd have to set out a card, and then you played, and then the other person

514
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 got it.

515
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 That didn't last.

516
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Well, that was the whole thing with Pokemon, too.

517
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 It was all six prizes.

518
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 They would go.

519
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Yeah.

520
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,840
 Now, what time period is this?

521
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,840
 Fall 1993.

522
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,840
 Two fist fulls of cookie dough.

523
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,840
 Yep.

524
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,840
 I remember those days.

525
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:04,800
 No, because I'm trying to say, what's weird now is that, as someone who, they're teens

526
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,000
 and twenties in the '90s, any niche culture was actually kind of shit on.

527
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,560
 You just kind of ... You always had to alf the alf.

528
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,620
 No matter what was going on, as soon as it became popular, it was like, "Go left."

529
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:20,840
 This is before the great flattening of the geek empires, thanks to the internet.

530
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,120
 This is at a time that I was excited about Magic the Gathering, because it was a more

531
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,200
 approachable bridge to Dungeons and Dragons at the time.

532
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
 I'm like, "Well, they're just playing a game."

533
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

534
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,080
 Because what I'm trying to say is, you chose friends over this game, right?

535
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,080
 This time.

536
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,760
 This is before the dark times, before Mikey.

537
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,760
 Yes.

538
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:45,920
 But now I feel like you don't, right?

539
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,520
 I feel like the internet makes these communities a thing, that people aren't even friends.

540
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,920
 There's just no king media.

541
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,320
 There's no king thing.

542
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,160
 There's no mainstream anymore.

543
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,840
 Everything is just its own niche.

544
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,560
 It's like, all right, is there a one weird thing that people are all obsessed about?

545
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,560
 Yeah.

546
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,560
 You want to know the problem with the internet?

547
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,960
 Nobody's lonely.

548
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,760
 When you're lonely, you have to do a little thing called compromise and meet other people

549
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,080
 at the square dance, you dipshits.

550
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,720
 Instead, everyone's all making hierarchies.

551
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,440
 This fall on Fox News, Brian Brushwood shares the real truths.

552
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,480
 Why aren't the kids at square dances?

553
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,920
 I had to tell you, Brushwood, as someone who's just been dipping my toe, by dipping my toe,

554
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,360
 I mean paying two 20-year-olds to edit clips for me.

555
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,760
 Oh, is that what you're paying them for?

556
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,760
 It's part of it.

557
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,240
 We have different hobbies.

558
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,240
 Yeah.

559
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,560
 Believe me, take the reels.

560
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,280
 It's so much simpler.

561
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,240
 Trust me, you'll be happier with the reels.

562
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:57,280
 Okay, so which means I've experimented with putting things on Instagram, Facebook.

563
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,280
 Everyone loves them, super supportive.

564
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,480
 YouTube is a hellscape.

565
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,960
 Luckily, it's not one of our jobs to fucking stare at the raw feet of God's butthole the

566
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
 whole day long.

567
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:17,960
 Actually, it was really funny, even one of the clips, I looked, I was like, "What?

568
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,960
 40 comments?

569
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,960
 What the fuck's going on here?"

570
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:26,480
 And simply, it was a thing of doing a trick I bought from you.

571
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,480
 Oh, that's right.

572
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,480
 I think my wife saw this.

573
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:34,320
 She was like, "Hey, I think you take tricks pretty good, but yeah, I'll let it stand."

574
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,880
 I'm doing your trick, and I simply say, "What's your favorite book?"

575
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:48,120
 She goes, "I don't have one," and I go, "Correct," and that's the whole hoping-to-go-viral moment.

576
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:55,160
 And then a debate breaks out about whether or not books are stupid.

577
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,160
 In the comments.

578
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,160
 Yeah.

579
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,160
 Nothing to do with me at all.

580
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,160
 Yep.

581
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,320
 Just people going at it like, "Why don't you fucking read?"

582
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,200
 And defenders go like, "No, reading's dumb," and it just goes on and on and on.

583
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:12,120
 So yeah, I had this conversation in the car back from the fucking...

584
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,280
 That reading's bad?

585
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,280
 This is why...

586
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,680
 He's from Kentucky.

587
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:22,440
 This is why we need to support comic book stores and libraries and all this kind of

588
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,440
 shit.

589
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,440
 We need to read.

590
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,440
 Fucking read.

591
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:31,040
 I love the fact that comics went from being the scourge of literacy-

592
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,040
 Wait, wait.

593
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,200
 Yes, to, "Guys, at least there's words in them."

594
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
 No.

595
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
 This is...

596
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
 Honestly, this is the-

597
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,640
 If we put words next to the titties, they might read.

598
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,640
 They might notice that.

599
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,640
 That was my hope.

600
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,800
 I'm trying to get Matt's kids literate.

601
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,480
 What's this hidden word around this areola?

602
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,480
 Constitutional democracy.

603
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,480
 What the hell?

604
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:04,080
 No, but even at just a base level, I've always, in my head, thought, "What better way to

605
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:11,000
 get people of any type to learn how to read, but by having visual representation of what's

606
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,880
 happening accompanied with dialogue and explanation?"

607
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,680
 Eventually, they'd move on to chapter books.

608
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,680
 Right.

609
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,200
 What the fuck?

610
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,200
 Some people do.

611
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,360
 Paul hadn't moved on yet.

612
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,360
 Props to Chuck Winding.

613
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,680
 Who won in the comments, from your opinion?

614
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,680
 Books or no books?

615
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,680
 Books crushed it.

616
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,680
 Books did.

617
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,680
 Good for books.

618
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,680
 You know what?

619
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:39,720
 I would say I'd be okay with those random arguments if YouTube would bake into the system

620
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,440
 the ability for you to be the judge.

621
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,880
 Man, this is your room.

622
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,880
 There's no fight.

623
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,000
 You get to call the winner.

624
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 That's it.

625
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Yeah, yeah.

626
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Yeah.

627
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 All right.

628
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 I'll write them.

629
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 Dear YouTube.

630
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 You should post that.

631
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 It was John Waters.

632
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Right?

633
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 I believe it was John Waters.

634
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 John Waters' quote.

635
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,280
 He was like, "Please, if you go to someone's house and you see that they don't have any

636
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,120
 books, don't fuck them."

637
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,120
 Right?

638
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,160
 I think I'm attributing that properly.

639
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,160
 Yes.

640
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,160
 I think it was Houdini.

641
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,160
 Oh, you're right.

642
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,160
 It was Houdini.

643
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,160
 Shit.

644
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,160
 That was not an option.

645
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,160
 You walked in.

646
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,200
 You're like, "Here's a gift of a book."

647
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,200
 No reason.

648
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,200
 I had some.

649
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,200
 Do you have a shelf?

650
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
 Put this on.

651
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:30,760
 Matt bought three girls the entire Encyclopedia Britannica before he left the Virgin Islands.

652
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,760
 I'm back with G.

653
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,760
 Yeah.

654
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,760
 That hit the spot.

655
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:51,720
 One, I was thinking it would be really funny if you just said, "Worked in a big way."

656
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,920
 I was like, "He's right."

657
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:59,440
 Then we all rushed to comic book stores and created a wave of everybody to do it.

658
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,880
 I get lost in these conversations because we're getting older, right?

659
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,880
 Yes.

660
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,880
 Speak for yourself.

661
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,880
 Slow decay.

662
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,880
 Slow.

663
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:13,120
 As someone who started a magic career late, I went on tour as a guy and now I'm touring

664
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,120
 as an old guy.

665
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:18,920
 I definitely noticed that where people talk to me to start and then they're like, "Okay,

666
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,920
 we're done talking to the old man.

667
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,160
 Now let's go back to talk to each other," and I'm like, "Oh, okay."

668
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:32,760
 On the slow road to total burdendom, you can see the light in people's eyes slowly start

669
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,920
 fading as you drone on and on about the Gulf War or some shit.

670
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,400
 I used to be guile.

671
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,760
 Now I'm dulcet.

672
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,680
 The slow road to total burdendom.

673
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,680
 Yeah.

674
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,080
 You're just like, "So Norman Schwarzkopf was popular."

675
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:54,800
 "Nope, nobody here saw Good Will Hunting."

676
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,800
 I don't know.

677
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,360
 Fucking their brains just rotted with a million TikTok trends.

678
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,360
 That's it.

679
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,520
 The internet is everything, right?

680
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,520
 Right.

681
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:10,280
 No, what I mean to say is we talked about this off air, but on the episode we did something

682
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,280
 kind of serious.

683
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,280
 Yes.

684
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:19,640
 We said it's hard because there's so many forces that profit from the destruction of

685
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,640
 hope.

686
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,640
 Yes.

687
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:29,800
 Basically, by making it feel like a hellscape all the time, it makes money and it also tells

688
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,120
 me to go for self.

689
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,120
 I don't have to worry about the future.

690
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,960
 I don't have to worry about future generations because they're never going to change.

691
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,760
 They're going to fuck it all up.

692
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,760
 They is whoever.

693
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,840
 I'm talking about any issue, they.

694
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,200
 They're going to fuck it all up and then so therefore I don't have to worry about shit

695
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,200
 anymore.

696
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,200
 I don't have to think about things anymore.

697
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,200
 You know what I feel like the solution is?

698
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:55,200
 In-person events like what's happening right now at ScootFest.

699
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,200
 Agree.

700
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,200
 I agree.

701
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,880
 Also, we talked about it years ago.

702
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,340
 We talked about you have to identify the they.

703
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,760
 You can't just be able to say they.

704
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,880
 I think it's important.

705
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,880
 It's super important.

706
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,880
 Thank you very much.

707
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,120
 People are just bringing me booze.

708
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,120
 It's great.

709
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,120
 Name them, Jacob.

710
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,120
 Who's bringing you booze?

711
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,920
 By the way, I'll sign up for that as well.

712
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,440
 Dos Equis, please.

713
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,440
 Or whiskey.

714
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,440
 Cheers.

715
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,440
 Cheers, mate.

716
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,840
 That Whiskey Break is brought to you by our sponsor.

717
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,200
 Yes, that Whiskey Break is brought to you by our following sponsor.

718
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,720
 Today's show, Matt and Mally's Ice Cream Social, still haven't moved the commercial tab to the

719
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,200
 front page of my phone.

720
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,200
 Why do that?

721
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,200
 That's too much.

722
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,000
 Time swipes to the right before I get to the square in the middle.

723
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,160
 It's fine, it's fine.

724
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,720
 Who's getting older?

725
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,720
 Not us.

726
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:55,200
 Jesus, that font.

727
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,200
 So bright.

728
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,120
 Matt, just hold your phone up so the background can read it.

729
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,200
 I think you can read that from space.

730
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,200
 What the fuck?

731
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,400
 I'll just have the bartender tell us who's sponsoring this today.

732
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,320
 Oh my God, did you hear the wave of horror?

733
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,960
 Matt just showed his phone to the room and there were legitimate "whoa"s.

734
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:20,560
 No bullshit, hold that up and if you can read it, stand up.

735
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,720
 There you go.

736
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,120
 How far back can people read that?

737
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,600
 I think it is rivaled only by the Hollywood sign.

738
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,840
 I actually can't see the Hollywood sign right now but I can see that.

739
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,040
 I legit was surprised by the reaction from the audience.

740
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:39,120
 This has been a startling mirror onto self.

741
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,240
 No only because I know that I'm actually holding out of this font size.

742
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:48,000
 I've gone up one and if I go up two I'm going to feel really old so I'm trying to hold it

743
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 down.

744
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,040
 I say bull the fucking ripples.

745
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,280
 Let it go baby.

746
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,880
 All you're doing is fooling yourself.

747
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:59,080
 I'm going to tell you right now, my font size on my phone is the standard size.

748
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,680
 I can't read it but I will not change it.

749
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,680
 I switched to video games.

750
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,320
 Jacob has not read a text message in three years.

751
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,640
 That's right.

752
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,160
 He blindly responds, "Ha!" to everything.

753
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,280
 I give a lot of thumbs up.

754
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,280
 100%!

755
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,280
 100%!

756
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,280
 100%!

757
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,280
 100%!

758
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,280
 100%!

759
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,280
 100%!

760
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,280
 Very nice.

761
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,280
 100%!

762
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,280
 100%!

763
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:32,280
 Oh great, pass my whiskey back over then.

764
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:37,640
 That's keeping tabs over here, Jacob.

765
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:44,840
 Anyways, today's show is brought to you by Beef in a Box, now with Extra Box.

766
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:50,480
 That's from Belgian Tripple Scoop in 2023.

767
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,200
 So people tell you no beef, bullshit.

768
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,340
 You want beef and you want beef in a box and you want extra box so come on and get this

769
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,520
 beef in a box with the extra box.

770
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,520
 Boom.

771
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,520
 Unh.

772
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,520
 Box.

773
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,520
 Beef.

774
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,520
 Beef in a box.

775
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,520
 Boom.

776
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,520
 Boom that beef in a box.

777
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,520
 Yeah you hear it mooing?

778
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
 That's your beef.

779
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,520
 Sorry.

780
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,520
 I'm distracted by this commercial.

781
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,600
 Someone threw up a package of Aldi hot dogs and Brian is squeezing it like a stress toy.

782
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,040
 I will warn you of this, Brian.

783
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:26,460
 Should the contents of that in any way touch your skin, you will be unable to remove that

784
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,360
 scent for at least two nights.

785
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,360
 You will not be allowed in.

786
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:38,360
 That's great because I have a Magic the Gathering tournament scheduled for tomorrow.

787
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:43,080
 And I'm not joking when I say, yeah you're right, that's kind of the vibe.

788
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:49,920
 It gives off the scent of a gathering of Aldi hot dogs sweating, sweating too close together

789
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,760
 and letting their ass cracks out.

790
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,200
 That is unfair to disgusting people.

791
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,560
 No it's not.

792
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:03,440
 Do you think that that shit happens because people can't smell or have they become immune

793
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,440
 to smelling themselves?

794
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:11,920
 When you are saving up money to buy $500 pieces of cardboard, other things slip through the

795
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,920
 cracks.

796
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,920
 Like lava.

797
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,200
 Like loose toilet paper.

798
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,200
 Yes.

799
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,200
 Yeah.

800
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,400
 I think really it is a combination of that kind but I think it is just living really

801
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,800
 stretching stuff out and not even thinking about that.

802
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,400
 That's a cry for help right?

803
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,400
 Yeah.

804
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,400
 Being that smelly.

805
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,400
 I don't know.

806
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,440
 I think it's a sign of depression.

807
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,440
 Yeah.

808
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,320
 But also there's a bunch of like creators that I see on TikTok and what not, they're

809
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,560
 like don't wash your hair.

810
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,560
 I know right?

811
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,560
 I'm like ew.

812
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,560
 They're like don't wash your hair.

813
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,560
 I'm like what?

814
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,200
 I legit had an LA friend tell me to stop washing my hair.

815
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,040
 See this is what I'm saying man.

816
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,280
 And they probably don't, I don't know.

817
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:52,120
 I don't want to get into a hygiene debate but I will.

818
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,360
 No but nobody is saying don't wash your ass.

819
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,360
 Yes.

820
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,360
 I'm spoiling for a hygiene debate.

821
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:04,320
 I'm just waiting for the right YouTube short magic trick to bring it out.

822
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,920
 I will finish the trick and be like whoa pull that one out of my ass.

823
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,040
 And they'll be like you shouldn't store stuff in your ass.

824
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,040
 Yes you should.

825
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,840
 You should use pockets.

826
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,000
 We are evolved to store things in our ass.

827
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Asses are dumb.

828
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,480
 That's why we beat the monkeys.

829
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,800
 It's nature's pocket.

830
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
 Nature's pocket.

831
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,800
 Excuse me.

832
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,800
 Today's show is brought to you by nature's pocket.

833
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,800
 Oh god.

834
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
 Interhase script's a check out.

835
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:32,960
 I just got done writing my 200 word comment about South American tariff rates on bandana

836
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,960
 banana.

837
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,960
 Oh boy.

838
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,960
 Yeah.

839
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,960
 But oh yeah Interhase script's a check out.

840
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,960
 Yes.

841
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,960
 Nailed that one.

842
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,960
 Extra long commercial.

843
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:51,680
 If folks brought stuff we're going to do like a physical school mail thing during the concert.

844
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,680
 Yes.

845
00:32:52,680 --> 00:33:00,080
 We won't do a physical school mail thing now just because narrating gifts is burdensome

846
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,080
 to the listener.

847
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,080
 Not the greatest of.

848
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:07,480
 But we do have a microphone for people who want to do any kind of in person.

849
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,320
 Narration of the gift that they brought.

850
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,320
 Scoop mail.

851
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,320
 No.

852
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:15,600
 In person scoop mail.

853
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,480
 We won't narrate it but if you want to narrate it.

854
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,960
 Or argue about whether or not reading is dumb.

855
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,960
 Yeah.

856
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,960
 You can also do that.

857
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,600
 Those are the two things that are mostly what we want.

858
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,320
 But I guess for you could also do anything else.

859
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:35,440
 So if anybody has a in person scoop mail you'd like to do come on up get lined up at the

860
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,640
 microphone up here and we will get to that in just a moment.

861
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,640
 That doesn't include an item.

862
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,400
 Is it just me or is the energy weird.

863
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,800
 The energy's weird today.

864
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
 The energy is weird.

865
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,800
 No the energy's weird.

866
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,440
 I don't think it's bad but it is weird.

867
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,600
 No I think we're at day three.

868
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,600
 Yeah that's it.

869
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,800
 Also I know I am pacing myself for tonight right.

870
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,800
 Yeah.

871
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,160
 That's what's going on.

872
00:33:55,160 --> 00:34:01,920
 These guys are just taking it to zero and then at eight o'clock it's ass cracks out.

873
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,920
 Yeah.

874
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:08,200
 I can answer your question about what happened to the mood in the room.

875
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,200
 Okay.

876
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,200
 Oh.

877
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:15,240
 You got all the international scoops arrested so that's what happened and all the good scoops

878
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,240
 left.

879
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,240
 That's true.

880
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,240
 That is true.

881
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,240
 Okay.

882
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,240
 Let's bring it up.

883
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,240
 I apologize.

884
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,240
 Okay.

885
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,240
 Good.

886
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,240
 Good.

887
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,240
 Good.

888
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,240
 That joke is from Penn Sunday School so good.

889
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,240
 This is good.

890
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,240
 It's like a comic book series.

891
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,240
 You have to listen to them all together.

892
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,240
 That's right.

893
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,240
 Yeah.

894
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,240
 That's right.

895
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,240
 It's good.

896
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,240
 It's good.

897
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,240
 It's good.

898
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,240
 Very nice.

899
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,240
 Yeah.

900
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,240
 Well a lot of these people have had two nights at McMullin's.

901
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,240
 It's a lot.

902
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,240
 Oh yeah.

903
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,240
 No we're running on empty here.

904
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,240
 Fucking redlining.

905
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,240
 Holy shit.

906
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,240
 Yeah.

907
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,240
 Oh.

908
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,240
 We have someone coming up here.

909
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,240
 Oh hey.

910
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,240
 Oh hey.

911
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,240
 Even if I'm an international scoop.

912
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,240
 Shame on you.

913
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,240
 No.

914
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,240
 It was so real.

915
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,760
 I don't know why it was so real.

916
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:03,600
 I've never had any kind of a police job or I don't know why anybody would believe you

917
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
 had an earpiece.

918
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,600
 Yeah.

919
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,160
 I don't know why it thundered forth so big.

920
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:15,800
 I do have one question because I asked Scoop if they know the answer for it and I don't

921
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,120
 remember it ever coming up.

922
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,800
 Who is Annie?

923
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,560
 So the person we are getting our emails from, from Patreon.

924
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,560
 Oh Annie.

925
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,800
 I never ever heard anything about the person behind that.

926
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,480
 Is she okay?

927
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,480
 I don't know.

928
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,480
 Why don't you ask her?

929
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
 Annie are you okay?

930
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,600
 She honestly, and this is the timely because she was recently hit by a smooth criminal.

931
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,600
 Damn.

932
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,680
 She was actually struck by a smooth criminal.

933
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,160
 She was hit by an amstruck by.

934
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,160
 By the way.

935
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,160
 Hilarious.

936
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,160
 Great question because 1200 episodes in.

937
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,160
 Yes.

938
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,160
 Annie.

939
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,160
 Was it early?

940
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,160
 Was it a listener?

941
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,160
 Yes.

942
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,160
 Was it a listener?

943
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,160
 We don't know.

944
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,160
 She definitely was a listener.

945
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,160
 Yeah.

946
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,280
 We think she still listens.

947
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:08,480
 And we first busted out the Patreon.

948
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,480
 We were overwhelmed.

949
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,480
 Yeah.

950
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,480
 As happens.

951
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:17,440
 And we offered a lot of stuff and so we basically said none of us have office skills.

952
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,720
 Does any scoop out there have office skills?

953
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,160
 And Annie stepped up.

954
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,920
 And we created an email address for her.

955
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:31,600
 And also we just thought it was a good idea to have a barrier.

956
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,200
 Not from like a don't bother Jacob, Paul and I with stuff.

957
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,240
 But we actually just thought our listeners will talk more honestly and frankly with someone

958
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,360
 whose job it was to talk to scoops.

959
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,360
 Like if there's an issue.

960
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,360
 Yeah.

961
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,360
 Yeah.

962
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,600
 Like some scoops might not want to come to us with an issue, might be easier to go to

963
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,600
 Annie with an issue.

964
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,600
 Yeah.

965
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,600
 Yeah.

966
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,360
 And so we have to interact with Annie all the time.

967
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,360
 She emails us before episodes.

968
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,360
 Yeah.

969
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,360
 That kind of stuff.

970
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,200
 And so she does all of our kind of like Patreon relationship housekeeping.

971
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,840
 And has done it now for fucking.

972
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,840
 As long as we've had Patreon.

973
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,840
 Nine years.

974
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,840
 Yeah.

975
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,840
 It's been crazy.

976
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,840
 Yeah.

977
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,840
 She's great.

978
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,840
 No Annie's amazing.

979
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,360
 I have met her, I believe the other two have not.

980
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,360
 Nope.

981
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,360
 I have not met Annie.

982
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,360
 I follow her on the socials.

983
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:19,240
 I see she and her kids do Disney World occasionally and yeah.

984
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,240
 Nice.

985
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,240
 Good.

986
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,880
 People were doubting Paul but he came over the top of that Disney World thing.

987
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,160
 The guy wants to know Annie's condition.

988
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,200
 You can't fabricate that detail.

989
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,320
 She's in the Magic Kingdom.

990
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,640
 I occasionally email Annie.

991
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,120
 By the way, I love this question.

992
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,280
 Do we have like weird small ice cream social minutiae questions?

993
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,120
 Yeah, this is great.

994
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,120
 There it is.

995
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,120
 More mystery.

996
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,120
 No, line up.

997
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,120
 Line up.

998
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,120
 Come on.

999
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,120
 But I met her and her husband.

1000
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:50,160
 They came and saw me open for the Magic Dragon in Connecticut at Foxwoods.

1001
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,160
 Annie is lovely.

1002
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,160
 She's a super sweet, awesome person.

1003
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,720
 How has she not been to a scoop fest?

1004
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,720
 Oh, we don't let her.

1005
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,720
 Oh, she doesn't like us.

1006
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,720
 No.

1007
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,720
 Give us your scoop name.

1008
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,720
 What's your scoop name?

1009
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,720
 Scooper Nova Girl.

1010
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,720
 Scooper Nova Girl.

1011
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,720
 There she is.

1012
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,720
 Yeah.

1013
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,600
 Do you guys have a lot of call and responses and greetings?

1014
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,600
 Do we have a toast?

1015
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,600
 A toast?

1016
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
 Oh.

1017
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,720
 Well, the answer is we don't.

1018
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,720
 I don't think so.

1019
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,720
 I don't think we have an official toast.

1020
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:20,920
 Well, I mean, we have my toast, which is Kapla and Good Journey, which combines my love of

1021
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,920
 Star Trek and Master Universe.

1022
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,920
 You guys can pick up on one of our favorites.

1023
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,920
 What is it?

1024
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,920
 Which is jizz.

1025
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,920
 Yeah.

1026
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,920
 You ever notice it?

1027
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,920
 Jizz.

1028
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:35,020
 All right, if you do that, that's rude, crass, ugly.

1029
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,020
 Oh.

1030
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,040
 If you add the word mate, they assume you're British.

1031
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,040
 Jizz, mate.

1032
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,040
 Jizz, mate.

1033
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,040
 Jizz, mate.

1034
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,040
 Oh, I got you.

1035
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,040
 Okay.

1036
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,040
 He's not like that.

1037
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,760
 And actually, we started doing that on a podcast where the head of the network was on it.

1038
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,760
 It was a...

1039
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:55,080
 It was just a cheap way to just say jizz on a polite society livestream.

1040
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:59,720
 But at some point, we just keep... 'cause it was a New Year's Eve thing, so booze was

1041
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,720
 fun.

1042
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,720
 Happened a lot.

1043
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,720
 And so we were cheersing a lot.

1044
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,720
 And so we're just like, "Jizz, mate, jizz."

1045
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,580
 And at one point, he just looks at me, and he's just like...

1046
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:11,580
 That was it.

1047
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,360
 How long did it take him to realize?

1048
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,440
 We got seven, eight jizzes before he even...

1049
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,800
 You got so much jizzes in.

1050
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,080
 Oh, we were firing ropes, dude.

1051
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,080
 Like, it was...

1052
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,080
 Let me...

1053
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,080
 I mean, it was Peter North all the way down.

1054
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,080
 Oh, yeah.

1055
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,080
 Yeah.

1056
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,840
 We don't have an official thing, but I think we could all do a salt pork, I need help.

1057
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,640
 Scoop or Dove Girl, do you have a suggestion?

1058
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,640
 Not off the top of your head?

1059
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,640
 No.

1060
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,640
 I'm not that good.

1061
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,640
 Fair, fair, fair.

1062
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,640
 All right.

1063
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,640
 Yeah.

1064
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,640
 Right, what you got?

1065
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,640
 Scoop's name.

1066
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,640
 Doc Scoop.

1067
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,640
 Doc Scoop.

1068
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,640
 There he is.

1069
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,640
 What up?

1070
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,800
 We fall in love with characters over time and people that come and go.

1071
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,280
 Haven't heard from Brit Mukai in a while, and any updates on how he's doing, what's going

1072
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,280
 on with him?

1073
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,120
 Well, again, he's another one that I follow on the old socials.

1074
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,680
 Takes his kids to Disney World every now and then.

1075
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,680
 Yeah.

1076
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,680
 Kids going to Disney World.

1077
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,680
 Kids now.

1078
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:03,280
 No, his VO career has continued to be successful.

1079
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,200
 Recently he's had some health and dietary struggles.

1080
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,640
 Not trying to put you on blast, Brett.

1081
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,640
 But he's sharing all that.

1082
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,640
 He's doing it publicly.

1083
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,640
 Yeah.

1084
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,640
 Yeah.

1085
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,640
 He's sharing all that.

1086
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,640
 But he's doing really well.

1087
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,320
 If you follow Brit Mukai, he's not hard to find on socials.

1088
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:23,680
 He's doing lots of convention work and signing autographs because he is the voice of many

1089
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,680
 anime characters.

1090
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,680
 Oh, fantastic.

1091
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,680
 That people know and love right now.

1092
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,680
 Yeah, he's working.

1093
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,680
 He's doing well.

1094
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,680
 Yeah.

1095
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,680
 Brett is working.

1096
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,680
 No, Brett.

1097
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,680
 That's why he's not hanging out with us.

1098
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,680
 He's in LA making that dollar.

1099
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,680
 That's right.

1100
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,680
 You think we can get him to do a phoner?

1101
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,680
 He?

1102
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,680
 Check in with us?

1103
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,680
 He bought property in California.

1104
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,680
 Whoa.

1105
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,680
 Yeah, right?

1106
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,680
 Like, yeah.

1107
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,680
 Well, damn.

1108
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,680
 But you bring up a good point.

1109
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,680
 Tell me about this home.

1110
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:50,360
 It has been a long time, and we should probably reach out to Brett for a touch base, maybe

1111
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,360
 a Zoom.

1112
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,360
 Thank you, Doc Scoop.

1113
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,360
 You should probably call him right now.

1114
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,360
 No.

1115
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,760
 I feel like I've got at least another year in me before I need to talk to Brett Mukai.

1116
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,760
 Are you going to try it?

1117
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,760
 Just give him a call.

1118
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,760
 All right.

1119
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,760
 He's going to try it.

1120
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,760
 I mean, it's Scoop Fest after all.

1121
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,760
 You're right.

1122
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,760
 You're right.

1123
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,760
 You're right.

1124
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,760
 He's going to try it.

1125
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,720
 When all miracles take place, they say that if you rub your two fingers together, that

1126
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,800
 Brett Mukai will send us the voicemail.

1127
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,320
 It is a pretty miraculous time.

1128
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,040
 Well, I mean, it's, what is it?

1129
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,040
 It's a Saturday afternoon.

1130
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,040
 It's as good as time as any.

1131
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,040
 I guess so.

1132
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,840
 He might be at a con.

1133
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,840
 That's quite possible.

1134
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,840
 At a con?

1135
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,840
 God.

1136
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,840
 Signing them things.

1137
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,840
 It's my only Star Trek joke.

1138
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,840
 Brett's doing great, man.

1139
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,840
 Brett's doing great.

1140
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,840
 What have you got?

1141
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,840
 Scoop name?

1142
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,840
 Technical Scoop board.

1143
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,840
 Checking in again.

1144
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,840
 Oh, hold on.

1145
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,840
 Wait, wait.

1146
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,840
 Sorry.

1147
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,840
 Sorry, technical Scoop board.

1148
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,840
 We've got Brett Mukai.

1149
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,840
 Brett Mukai, do you hear me?

1150
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,840
 Yeah, I can hear you.

1151
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,840
 What's up, brother?

1152
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,120
 You are live at Scoop Fest in front of hundreds of Scoops right now.

1153
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,640
 How's it going, Scoops?

1154
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,920
 Oh, my God.

1155
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,640
 Brett, literally, someone came up and just said, how is Brett?

1156
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,640
 Why haven't we heard from a while?

1157
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,640
 Where is he?

1158
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,640
 So how are you, Brett?

1159
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,640
 What's going on?

1160
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,640
 Dude, I'm fucking rad, man.

1161
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,640
 And in fact, I was going to hit, it's so crazy.

1162
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,640
 I was going to hit you guys up.

1163
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,640
 I'm actually going to be in Vegas next weekend.

1164
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,640
 Oh, fuck yeah!

1165
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,640
 I'm one weekend too late.

1166
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:12,000
 Can you come on the Friday episode?

1167
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,880
 Yeah, I mean, we're on Zoom, you can come on any episode, but yeah, come on by.

1168
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:25,640
 I'll be in Canada, but don't let that stop you from doing it.

1169
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,640
 What are you up to?

1170
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,800
 Tell the Scoops something they can dive their teeth into.

1171
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,800
 What's up, Scoops?

1172
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:41,280
 I'm at a convention in Florida, in Tampa Bay, and yeah, I'm just eating dinner with like

1173
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,480
 Pokemon voice actors and people like that.

1174
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:48,400
 And yeah, I'm just chilling, having a good time, and ate a great burger just now.

1175
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,760
 Oh, there you go.

1176
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,760
 Well, Brett, thank you so much for answering my call.

1177
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,200
 If you didn't, I was going to be so furious.

1178
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,960
 So I appreciate you doing it.

1179
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,920
 That's the only reason I answered it, Matt.

1180
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,560
 I was like, "If I don't answer this, I'm going to miss out on something awesome."

1181
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,000
 All right, give it up for Brett, everybody.

1182
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,160
 Take it easy.

1183
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,160
 We love you, Brett.

1184
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,160
 We'll talk soon.

1185
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,160
 Bye, pal.

1186
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,160
 Technical Scoop board.

1187
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,160
 You got a question?

1188
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,160
 I do.

1189
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:25,840
 It's been quite a while since I've heard the haiku from the Patreon requests.

1190
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,840
 Is that still a thing?

1191
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,440
 We are changing the Patreon right now.

1192
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,440
 Yeah.

1193
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,680
 So this has been really tricky because Patreon changeups happened right around the time Scoop

1194
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,080
 Fest preparations really kicked into high gear.

1195
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,480
 So we're hoping to have things remedied and squared by the middle of October.

1196
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,760
 You're the second person who's asked this.

1197
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,480
 So I propose, and this is just Paul, and I might just do it by myself if I have to.

1198
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:56,560
 I propose we try and make good on what suggestions we still have in the kitty and maybe a few

1199
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:02,300
 that come in now and do maybe a special hour long bonus episode of just the haikus and

1200
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,600
 the what do you call it, and the triple threats and all that.

1201
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,720
 You guys would like that, maybe?

1202
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,720
 Yeah.

1203
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:12,720
 And then they are going to go away, except for special occasions.

1204
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,720
 Yeah.

1205
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,720
 Except for when we want them to come back.

1206
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,720
 Yeah.

1207
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,720
 And then we'll do them.

1208
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,200
 And by we, I mean we, all of us.

1209
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,040
 But it's not going to be an essential part of the Patreon moving forward.

1210
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,040
 Right.

1211
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,040
 Thank you.

1212
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,800
 Can you speak a little deeper to that question?

1213
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,800
 Oh, please.

1214
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,800
 Get deep.

1215
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:36,880
 No, no, because like in truth, comedy has changed a lot since we started doing this

1216
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,880
 podcast.

1217
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,880
 Yeah.

1218
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,880
 12 years.

1219
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,200
 And sensibilities have changed a lot.

1220
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,920
 And an awareness of being like three white dudes doing a podcast has been a thing on

1221
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,440
 our minds.

1222
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,380
 And on some level, like in the room, like when we do the Bucket Show, we do other things

1223
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,380
 like that.

1224
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,380
 Like when we're in a room with people who like us, who trust us, and just like any other

1225
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:58,520
 group of people where you're in a room where people trust each other, you can toe the line.

1226
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,920
 You can push the envelope.

1227
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,920
 You can basically get laughed for saying something a little, a little insensitive.

1228
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,920
 You have some latitude.

1229
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,040
 Knowing that the person thinks you're a good guy.

1230
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,040
 Right.

1231
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,360
 And as comedy changed and as we got older, like the idea of leaving constant physical

1232
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:18,160
 evidence of us doing haikus and saying your mom, a difference between your mom and blank

1233
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,240
 and that kind of stuff just started getting a little like, uh-oh, maybe this might be

1234
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,400
 a bad idea in the long term.

1235
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,200
 And so we got a little gun shy about doing that.

1236
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,600
 You didn't want to turn on the printing press of liability receipts.

1237
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,600
 Yeah, exactly.

1238
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:37,000
 And it's a shame because like, I know that like, we've always joked from the beginning

1239
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 like we are dumb jokes for smart people.

1240
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,600
 Like it's like always like kind of like what I like to think of us.

1241
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,540
 And so like, I know we get the benefit of the doubt from the people that do it.

1242
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:51,080
 And there is something like, there's guilty pleasure about being childish in humor, sometimes

1243
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,080
 stuff like that.

1244
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,640
 But we do enjoy doing it.

1245
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,160
 Like we still do it at the bucket shows and things like that.

1246
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:01,480
 But it just became something that got a little dicey for me for doing on air.

1247
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:07,780
 I think it's also something that is going to be better received as it's rarer.

1248
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:14,200
 Like if you do a thing every once in a while, you know, that's a very involved bit.

1249
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,200
 Yeah.

1250
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:21,160
 And it's like, it's hard, it takes away some of the magic when you see it so often that

1251
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,160
 it becomes mechanical.

1252
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,160
 Of course.

1253
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,600
 I mean, our first Patreon was a fucking nightmare and it was so funny.

1254
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,600
 And that's what we loved.

1255
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,880
 Like we made a very funny Patreon.

1256
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:30,880
 Right.

1257
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,240
 You go, you guys had fucking the most convoluted reward system.

1258
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,240
 It was one time.

1259
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,800
 We would eat weird things on camera was one reward.

1260
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,720
 Oh, I forgot about that one.

1261
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,640
 Oh my, no hands, we would no hands eat things.

1262
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,640
 No hands eating.

1263
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,640
 Right.

1264
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,640
 We did that.

1265
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,640
 Yeah.

1266
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,640
 We did that at a fucking pepper mill.

1267
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,640
 We did it at a pepper mill with Ryre.

1268
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,640
 We recorded people just eating shit.

1269
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,400
 Eating things without using our hands.

1270
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,200
 I forgot about that.

1271
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,080
 We, we used to try to do individual made up credits for each person we thanked at the

1272
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,080
 end of episodes.

1273
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,080
 Yep.

1274
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,080
 Every single person.

1275
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,080
 And then it mostly was just...

1276
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,080
 And then it just got to be too many people.

1277
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,080
 Yeah.

1278
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,080
 So we'd literally be like, technical school board.

1279
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,080
 Technical school board.

1280
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,080
 He graduated from this university.

1281
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,080
 Allegedly.

1282
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,080
 He did all this.

1283
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,080
 And then allegedly he did this.

1284
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,080
 Yeah.

1285
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,080
 We would do like five minutes.

1286
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,080
 And at first it was a blast.

1287
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,720
 And then it became like really unfunny.

1288
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,240
 And then we just finished the episode like, I don't want to end episodes doing our most

1289
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,240
 unfunny shit.

1290
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,240
 Right.

1291
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:26,320
 We just run this fucking momentum into the cliff face of like mandatory fun.

1292
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,320
 Right.

1293
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,480
 So like, and you know, it's like Paul and I are improv guys.

1294
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,680
 And so like so much about like being improv, like we can always make it up on the spot.

1295
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,880
 We can always generate gold.

1296
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:34,880
 We can do this.

1297
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:40,040
 And then putting it to the test, you know, for three hours a week for 12 years, it's

1298
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:44,320
 just, you know, maybe, maybe gold is the high standard.

1299
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,320
 You know?

1300
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,320
 And so I think we tried to kind of, we also, yeah, we would kind of pump breaks on weird

1301
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,320
 shit like that.

1302
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,320
 Yeah.

1303
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,840
 But as I said, it's just not going to be part of the patron going forward in a large capacity,

1304
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,760
 but we will do a make good episode from some of the old stuff.

1305
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,840
 If you got one specifically, you really want to hear, send it to Jacob.

1306
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,840
 And we're, and we're going to do them.

1307
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:06,320
 Like we're, we're still going to, we're still going to do all of our stuff, you know, as,

1308
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,320
 as time goes by.

1309
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,360
 Uh, but yeah, maybe just not quite as often.

1310
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,360
 Yeah.

1311
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,480
 Is that fair?

1312
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,480
 Very fair.

1313
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,480
 Thank you.

1314
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,480
 Thank you.

1315
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,480
 Yeah.

1316
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,480
 Come on up.

1317
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,480
 Come on up.

1318
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,480
 Welcome to the Belgian Triple Scoop.

1319
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,480
 I love it.

1320
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:23,720
 Actually, I'm very grateful technical scoop port, cause you kind of started the question

1321
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:28,040
 that I have, which is, you know, um, I bought tickets for Scoop Fest before I, I'm now in

1322
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:33,000
 a serious relationship or about to be a year, but she doesn't share the same kind of sense

1323
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,640
 of humor that I think we, everybody in this room really loves.

1324
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,640
 Come on guys.

1325
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,640
 Yeah.

1326
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,640
 Dumb jokes for smart people.

1327
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,640
 Woo.

1328
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,640
 And you're, you're asking us if you should leave her?

1329
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,640
 No, no, no, no, no.

1330
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,640
 This is so awkward and unexpected, but yes, you should.

1331
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,640
 Stacey, that's not what I'm saying.

1332
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,640
 Stacey, you should leave.

1333
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,160
 I'm feeling bad that you said that because now four people just said, you know what?

1334
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,160
 I'm over it too.

1335
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,160
 And they just left.

1336
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,860
 Dropping like flies here.

1337
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:58,520
 But it's, it's how do you marry that idea of this is something that you love, right?

1338
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:02,840
 Like it's, you know, you, you talked about, you know, obviously your very thoughtful response

1339
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:06,600
 to how you do the different jokes and oh, this is great comedy gold.

1340
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,560
 It's comedy gold everybody, but explaining the Captain Morgan podcast and why that's

1341
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:11,560
 funny.

1342
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:12,560
 Sure.

1343
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:13,560
 It's sometimes difficult.

1344
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:18,440
 I don't think I can explain why, if the Captain Morgan podcast is funny.

1345
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,440
 Super cerebral.

1346
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,120
 But it's exactly, it's my watermark.

1347
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,120
 But that's the idea.

1348
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,120
 It's, it's, how do you...

1349
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:28,120
 Captain Morgan, did you wander into script?

1350
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:35,120
 I just wanted to let you know that the podcast is funny because my name is Captain Morgan.

1351
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,160
 What do you want me to do?

1352
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,160
 What are you doing?

1353
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,560
 Captain Morgan, you seem like, you seem like you're on the precipice.

1354
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,560
 You're, you're refusing...

1355
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,560
 On the precipice.

1356
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,560
 Well, okay.

1357
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,560
 Hold on.

1358
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,560
 Get out of my precipice.

1359
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,560
 What?

1360
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,560
 No, no.

1361
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,560
 I'm prespiring on the precipice.

1362
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,560
 Don't sweat the small stuff.

1363
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,100
 I'm just here for you, Brian.

1364
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,680
 Well, I know you seem very upset though, Captain Morgan.

1365
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,360
 Why do you have hot dogs?

1366
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:02,560
 Well, it's, I invented hot dogs, by the way.

1367
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,280
 I didn't know this about you.

1368
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,280
 I didn't.

1369
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,160
 Funny, funny, you should ask.

1370
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,160
 I didn't.

1371
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,120
 You have a hot dog that I invented.

1372
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,120
 Okay.

1373
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,120
 I invented one.

1374
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,120
 Yes?

1375
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,120
 Not the rest.

1376
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,120
 Well, tell me about it.

1377
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:20,480
 I put it together in a spindle that I carried in a bindle.

1378
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,720
 Oh, are you homeless as well?

1379
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,720
 Nope.

1380
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,720
 Oh, no, you're not.

1381
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:25,720
 No, I have a boat.

1382
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:33,840
 I take my boat around to the high seas, and if I ever see a hot dog I don't like, I kick

1383
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,840
 him off.

1384
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,080
 I say, get the fuck out of here, hot dog.

1385
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,080
 Okay.

1386
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,080
 Well, why?

1387
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,080
 It's a real problem.

1388
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,080
 Now, wait a minute.

1389
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,080
 These days.

1390
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,080
 Hot dogs everywhere.

1391
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,080
 Where?

1392
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:47,080
 Running, hither and yon, can't trust them.

1393
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:54,320
 Can't look a hot dog in the eye anymore and say, hey, we're going to make a square deal.

1394
00:50:54,320 --> 00:51:00,120
 Now these hot dogs be doing, hot dogs be trifling.

1395
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,520
 Did a hot dog disappoint you?

1396
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,520
 Fuck yeah.

1397
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,520
 Oh, tell me about it.

1398
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:14,200
 One hot dog crashed the stock market and high interest loans, and next thing you know Obama

1399
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,200
 was president.

1400
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,200
 All right.

1401
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,200
 Ladies and gentlemen, Captain Morgan.

1402
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,200
 Belgium.

1403
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,520
 But that's exactly what I mean.

1404
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:24,640
 I'm doubled over laughing, and you guys, I mean all five of you have-

1405
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,320
 75% of the audience wasn't.

1406
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,120
 But that's the point.

1407
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,320
 You guys all have partners.

1408
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,600
 You have children.

1409
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,880
 You have people in your life who may not share that.

1410
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,320
 How do you find the kind of balance in you guys making your living off of jokes that

1411
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,640
 I find amazing, but I have a hard time sharing?

1412
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,640
 How do you find that balance?

1413
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,080
 Oh, none of our spouses think we're funny.

1414
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,080
 My wife does.

1415
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,360
 None of our spouses think we're funny.

1416
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,360
 No, my wife thinks I'm funny.

1417
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,360
 No, no.

1418
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,360
 She calls me all the time and tells me.

1419
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,360
 No?

1420
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,360
 Wow.

1421
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,360
 She thinks I'm funny.

1422
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,360
 She just thinks I push it too gross sometimes.

1423
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,360
 Should there be a statute of limitations on lore?

1424
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,560
 Like at some point they expire and you have to let them go?

1425
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,560
 What?

1426
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,560
 Say it again?

1427
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:04,960
 Should there be a statute of limitations on lore, like at some point, because it's impenetrable

1428
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:05,960
 at some point?

1429
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:06,960
 It's like-

1430
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:13,280
 Dude, you haven't heard from Mothra's secret agent in a while for a reason.

1431
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,280
 So yes.

1432
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:18,400
 Because the last time I started to hear from them, Matt and I just yelled, "No!"

1433
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,400
 It doesn't happen.

1434
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,400
 Yeah.

1435
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,400
 So I mean that's-

1436
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,400
 I mean, you look at The Simpsons, right?

1437
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,720
 They didn't think they were going to go 30 years and so all of a sudden they're being

1438
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,760
 held accountable for decisions they made 20 years ago.

1439
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,240
 Like that's fucking bananas.

1440
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,240
 Yeah.

1441
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:33,720
 Because it implies, because you're looking back, it's like the powerhouse of that you

1442
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,520
 knew what you were the whole time and not that you were desperately trying to get anyone

1443
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:42,760
 to pay attention to you doing anything that came into your brain and just hoping it flew

1444
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:43,760
 in the moment.

1445
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,760
 Yeah.

1446
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,760
 I mean-

1447
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:50,280
 But no, I mean, I think anytime you try to make any kind of living being creative at

1448
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:57,520
 all, something that really comes from your heart and your mind, it's fucking ballsy.

1449
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:03,280
 And anytime you get any kind of audience of support, it means it's really something special.

1450
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,000
 Well, comedy is also very, very specific.

1451
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,700
 There's not a lot of objective elements to comedy that you can say like, "Well, clearly

1452
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:17,000
 this is funny," because it's all dependent on where people come from, their expectations.

1453
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,680
 I think I've quoted this one before, but this is my go-to right now.

1454
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:25,480
 Zach Anner, the comedian, multiple sclerosis guy, he's amazing.

1455
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:26,480
 He's fantastic.

1456
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:27,880
 I love social media, Zach Anner.

1457
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,640
 This is his whole thing.

1458
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,680
 Comedy isn't meant to be timeless.

1459
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,880
 Great comedy is in service of its time.

1460
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:38,200
 It helps start the conversations that will eventually deem it irrelevant, outdated or

1461
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,200
 offensive.

1462
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,280
 You laugh, you think, you grow, and you move on.

1463
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:45,080
 That said, farts are always hilarious.

1464
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,680
 But it's so true.

1465
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:53,440
 I went back and listened like last week, two weeks ago, I listened to a Bill Cosby comedy

1466
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,440
 album.

1467
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:59,840
 Boy, I didn't know there'd be edgy humor on this show.

1468
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:04,880
 It was the edgiest, not even edgiest, but it was hilarious.

1469
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:10,280
 It was a huge seller of its time, and I went back and listened to it, and forget about

1470
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:14,120
 all the Bill Cosby stuff, or try to, or just go to sleep and forget about it.

1471
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,120
 It's fine.

1472
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,640
 He'll make you forget.

1473
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:22,720
 All of that aside, it's just not poignant.

1474
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,840
 It's simply not relevant to this day and time anymore, and it's so hard ...

1475
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:30,480
 Jacob's like, "When you guys are done bitching about the other stuff about Bill Cosby, I'd

1476
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,800
 like to take the content of a special for that."

1477
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:33,800
 Can we get to the real issue here?

1478
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,640
 I'm going to really focus in on the minutia of Bill Cosby.

1479
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,640
 The drain-bamaged bit.

1480
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:38,640
 The drain-bamaged bit.

1481
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,640
 But it really is.

1482
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:47,200
 You go back and listen to it now, and it's just a ... It's a relic of the past now, is

1483
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,320
 all it is.

1484
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:54,520
 You're listening to that, and you're listening to it for the nostalgia.

1485
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,260
 It's pure nostalgia at this point.

1486
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:57,640
 It's not comedy anymore.

1487
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,920
 It's a history.

1488
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,760
 It's a time capsule.

1489
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,440
 I don't think you guys are time capsules.

1490
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,440
 Eggs.

1491
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,440
 Eggs are in the cake.

1492
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,440
 No.

1493
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:10,280
 The kids won't pull up their pants.

1494
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:14,680
 So to be kind of, just to wrap everything up, it's figuring out that way to share that

1495
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:19,640
 part of your personality in your comedy, but not push the envelope too far, but understand

1496
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:20,640
 that it's of time.

1497
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,640
 I don't know.

1498
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,640
 Drawing the line.

1499
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:23,640
 I'm sorry.

1500
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,640
 I didn't mean to make this more serious.

1501
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,640
 No.

1502
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:32,120
 You always want to say, "Hey, whatever I do is not for everyone," but as soon as you find

1503
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:36,320
 out it's not for everyone, it's devastating.

1504
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,320
 Really hurts your feelings.

1505
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,320
 You do.

1506
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:42,960
 You always say, "My comedy hero has never cared about mass popularity.

1507
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:48,480
 My comedy hero just made the funniest thing possible," and then it's realizing you hope

1508
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,480
 you're wrong.

1509
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:55,680
 You hope it's like, "No, I'll be as funny as my heroes that didn't get the recognition

1510
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,680
 that they deserved," and then you're like, "Oh, no, but I'm not getting the recognition

1511
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,680
 that I deserve."

1512
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,680
 No.

1513
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,640
 When I go do a show on a cruise ship where the audience is just the energy just fucking

1514
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:10,840
 zip, I absolutely go to sleep hating myself going, "I guess I'm not for everyone," and

1515
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:15,160
 then I have to walk around the ship with them the next day, and then go up and hide on deck

1516
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:22,280
 19 and look out and hope I don't get harpooned, but it's not for everybody, but the bottom

1517
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:28,840
 line is that looking at us over time or any kind of stuff, the body of work, all that

1518
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,840
 feels cool.

1519
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,140
 To create something that people want to come to feels cool.

1520
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:36,560
 In the moment, the smartest thing that we decided we were was that we are a service,

1521
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:40,800
 and that service is a weekly service, and we are there to help people in that moment.

1522
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:45,760
 We hope that that podcast helps people in that day or that drive or that walking of

1523
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,760
 their dog.

1524
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:47,760
 Yeah.

1525
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,720
 Everything else after that, sure, but that's the primary deal.

1526
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,240
 That's why we keep doing it.

1527
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,240
 I'll tell you what.

1528
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,200
 When scoops come up to me, and this has happened multiple times this weekend, it happens all

1529
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,200
 the time.

1530
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:04,280
 When scoops come up to me and say, "Hey, I listened to the whole back catalog.

1531
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,920
 My blood runs cold every single time."

1532
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,400
 Like, "Good God, what did we say a decade ago?"

1533
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,400
 Yes.

1534
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,400
 Agreed.

1535
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,520
 Oh, I'm terrified all the time.

1536
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,520
 I start laughing.

1537
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,520
 Next.

1538
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,520
 Exactly.

1539
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,520
 Thank you.

1540
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,520
 Thank you so much.

1541
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,520
 Thank you.

1542
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,520
 Thank you.

1543
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,520
 Scoop name.

1544
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,520
 Give it to us.

1545
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,520
 Gelato problems.

1546
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,520
 Love it.

1547
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:27,520
 Gelato problems.

1548
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,520
 So my question's about commitment.

1549
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,520
 What the fuck?

1550
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,520
 I don't know if it's...

1551
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,520
 You know commitment?

1552
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,520
 Go ahead.

1553
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,520
 Explain it to him.

1554
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,520
 Commitment to a bit.

1555
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,520
 Oh, I don't know.

1556
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,520
 Commitment to a bit.

1557
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,520
 Commitment to a bit.

1558
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,520
 Commitment to a bit.

1559
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,520
 Oh, commitment.

1560
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,520
 To the point of...

1561
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:41,520
 To the point of endangerment.

1562
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:46,440
 You know, it just felt like this was like a love line segment from like 2001.

1563
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:51,600
 So I don't know if my husband's Max the Ginger Scoop, and I don't know if he was always going

1564
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:56,600
 to be a commitment guy, and you just named the thing that he does, or if he's just following

1565
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:01,840
 you to be a commitment guy, but he is that guy, and he will kill something until it is

1566
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:05,160
 dead and buried, and I'm like, "Please stop," and he won't.

1567
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:10,240
 And so my question, this is a crowd that will show up at the party tonight in commitment

1568
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,240
 outfits.

1569
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,240
 Yes.

1570
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:17,280
 You guys love commitment, but is there any commitment that in your lives, maybe bad jokes,

1571
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:21,680
 like there are some bad jokes that I'm like, "Kill it, and it won't die," and bad jokes,

1572
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:25,760
 commitments, bits at home, or bits in your lives that you're like, "I'm gonna keep doing

1573
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,880
 it no matter how upset it makes everyone at work or at home."

1574
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:30,880
 Anything like that?

1575
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,880
 Paul?

1576
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:39,500
 Your moment has come, sir.

1577
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,940
 The audience said it first.

1578
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:49,740
 The people that I love the most get nicknames, and those nicknames stay forever.

1579
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:50,740
 So...

1580
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,220
 Matt and I don't have nicknames.

1581
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:54,620
 That's true.

1582
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:57,600
 So far I see no complications.

1583
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,600
 Everything's good, girl.

1584
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,600
 It seems legit.

1585
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,000
 Well, but you're the audio guy.

1586
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
 Don't.

1587
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
 Don't.

1588
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
 Move on.

1589
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
 Move on.

1590
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
 Don't.

1591
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
 It's fine.

1592
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
 It's fine.

1593
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
 It's fine.

1594
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
 It's worse if you try to make it now.

1595
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
 It's worse.

1596
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
 Yeah.

1597
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
 Yeah.

1598
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
 Just go ahead.

1599
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
 Finish your thought.

1600
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
 I will.

1601
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
 I will.

1602
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
 But I will.

1603
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
 I keep at it.

1604
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
 I started calling Ann...

1605
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
 It's so great if you just shoehorned "Madinator" in, like he had always done it.

1606
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
 I started calling Ann "Snakey."

1607
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
 The old "Madinator."

1608
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
 When we were dating early on, and she was like, "What the fuck are you talking about?"

1609
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,880
 And she didn't like it, but I kept it up, and I have called her "Snakey" for damn

1610
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:35,720
 near 20 years now, and now it's cool that she knows that I'm Snakey, and it's all good.

1611
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:45,560
 The hunk, my beloved brother, that came up, we were what, 12, 10, less, yeah.

1612
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:48,860
 Younger is the word you're looking for.

1613
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,280
 He's also from Kentucky.

1614
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,280
 Yeah.

1615
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,280
 Not with the math.

1616
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,160
 Stop fucking with the math on us.

1617
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,520
 We were lesser people.

1618
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,520
 But that's what it is.

1619
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:00,920
 It started with that, it started with those kind of things, and there will be moments

1620
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:08,560
 when I am in a real goofball mood, and some days Ann is like, "Enough, enough."

1621
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:11,960
 She will sometimes just say, "You got to stop here and make me cry."

1622
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,360
 I'll be like, "Okay."

1623
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:18,520
 I don't mean to, because I think it's ... But then sometimes it's really hard, because that's

1624
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:22,680
 when I know, "Oh God, this is really funny."

1625
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,040
 She hates this.

1626
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,880
 This is amazing.

1627
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,880
 That's when you know that the shields are down.

1628
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,440
 It's a combination thing, so I have to be very careful.

1629
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:37,640
 I understand that I wield a certain power, and I need to respect it, but for the most

1630
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,640
 part I will pull back.

1631
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:46,200
 There are few things funnier than the true flash of rage in the eyes of somebody that

1632
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,200
 you love very deeply.

1633
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,200
 Oh my God, oh my God.

1634
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:52,700
 I will say that this is one, I'm going to give out a posthumous shout out.

1635
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:56,140
 Many of you guys listen to Geek Shock.

1636
01:00:56,140 --> 01:01:02,040
 Shout out to the Geek Shock boys, and big ups to 80s Jeff who is no longer with us anymore.

1637
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:05,480
 We lost 80s Jeff last year, it broke my heart.

1638
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,480
 That's a real commitment.

1639
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:10,640
 80s Jeff was the butt of a lot of my shit.

1640
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:17,620
 If you listen to those old, even just those old episodes, one of the worst was he came

1641
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:18,620
 over.

1642
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:25,680
 He came over to the, we would gather up after Trek almost every, I don't know, every three

1643
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:30,040
 nights or so, and we'd all be playing video games, and watching anime, and just acting

1644
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,040
 a fool.

1645
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,400
 And this is after you all watched Star Trek together?

1646
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,080
 All that kind of stuff.

1647
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:41,880
 Just doing very nerdy things in somebody's house, and there's like eight or ten of us.

1648
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:42,880
 Very nerdy.

1649
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:46,600
 Eight or ten people playing looky cookie, oh my God.

1650
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:52,080
 80s Jeff had a habit whenever- That is a case of pink eye waiting to happen.

1651
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:56,800
 Whenever he walked into a room, whenever he walked into a room, it didn't matter what

1652
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:01,640
 was going on, if something was playing on the TV, he'd be like, "What the hell is this?"

1653
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:04,640
 That was his go-to thing, he'd just, "What the hell is this?"

1654
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:05,640
 Just didn't matter.

1655
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,640
 He could have been something he kind of knew, could have been something he hadn't, just,

1656
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,120
 "What the hell is this?"

1657
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:12,560
 And we all made it, he always says, "What the hell is this?"

1658
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:17,180
 And so finally, there was this, I can't remember exactly what the anime was, but it was this

1659
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:23,920
 moment of these samurai looking guys, and gals, and very traditional kimono garb, and

1660
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:28,240
 all these things, and these sakurai flower petals are falling all down the ground, and

1661
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,800
 he's like, "What the hell is this?"

1662
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,880
 And I go, "It's your wedding."

1663
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,360
 And he goes, "What?"

1664
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:37,160
 And I go, "This is footage from your wedding."

1665
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,360
 And he says, "What the hell are you talking about?"

1666
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:44,680
 And some of my friends start laughing, and I go, "Yeah, man, this is your wedding, this

1667
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:45,680
 is your upcoming nuptials."

1668
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,520
 And he says, "What do you mean?"

1669
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,480
 And then people really start laughing.

1670
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:52,120
 And I go, "Yeah, this is Jeff's wedding.

1671
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,920
 We got this on tape already."

1672
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:54,920
 He's like, "What are you talking about?

1673
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:55,920
 That's not funny.

1674
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:56,920
 What are you talking about?

1675
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:57,920
 I'm not married."

1676
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:58,920
 And then everybody's like-

1677
01:02:58,920 --> 01:02:59,920
 Because Jeff was not married.

1678
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,360
 And then everybody starts to really lose their shit, because he gets that angry.

1679
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,360
 He gets angry.

1680
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:05,360
 He's like, "What do you mean, my wedding?"

1681
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,880
 And everybody's like, "No, it's your wedding, dude.

1682
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:08,880
 This is your wedding."

1683
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:09,880
 But it's not funny.

1684
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:12,160
 And everybody is just fucking losing their minds.

1685
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,840
 There's nothing better than when somebody starts shouting, "It's not funny.

1686
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,200
 Yeah, what's funny about it?"

1687
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:20,800
 And this goes for an hour of bullshit back and forth until he's just like, "Fuck you

1688
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:21,800
 guys.

1689
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:22,800
 Fuck you guys.

1690
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:23,800
 I'm not getting married.

1691
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,800
 Fuck you guys.

1692
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,800
 Fuck you guys.

1693
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:26,800
 This is not my wedding.

1694
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:27,800
 Fuck you."

1695
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:33,400
 And then to this day, to this day, you go up to one of the geek shop crew, you want to

1696
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,800
 get them going, you say, "Hey, Jeff's wedding."

1697
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:39,500
 And we all just fucking fall out, just Jeff's wedding.

1698
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,880
 We all fucking lose our shit.

1699
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:45,000
 But there came a time when we could not say it anymore.

1700
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,360
 That's great.

1701
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,360
 Around him.

1702
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,360
 Magic the Gathering.

1703
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,760
 I lost casual friends to a bit.

1704
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,560
 Oh, oh, oh.

1705
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:54,560
 Yeah.

1706
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:57,800
 So in my comedy group, Possible Side Effects, we loved doing bits.

1707
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:58,800
 I loved doing bits.

1708
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,320
 Part of why I wanted to do a podcast with Paul in the first place was that I was like,

1709
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:05,600
 "I want to keep doing bits all the time."

1710
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,600
 And I loved...

1711
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,720
 And I hated when I did improv videos, when they'd police bits, like, "Oh, you guys are

1712
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:09,720
 doing a bunch of bits."

1713
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:10,720
 I'm like, "Shut up.

1714
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,440
 This is my love language, and let me do bits."

1715
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:18,000
 And I was walking, we were visiting friends in Boston, and I was walking on the sidewalk.

1716
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
 It was definitely a not...

1717
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,600
 It was not a jovial mood.

1718
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:21,600
 Just calmly walking.

1719
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,080
 And I go, "Oh, man.

1720
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:24,080
 This is getting hard."

1721
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:25,080
 And the guy's like, "What?"

1722
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:28,040
 I was like, "I'm Dr. Sam Beckett."

1723
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:33,880
 And I leapt into Matt's body, and I am trying left and right to figure out what wrong to

1724
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:40,520
 write, to leap out of this fucking body.

1725
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:44,480
 And my comedy group was like, "Yes!"

1726
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:49,960
 And they just would grill me about being Sam Beckett, and I would have to start answering

1727
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:50,960
 questions like, "Oh, shit."

1728
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,480
 And I started answering questions of Sam Beckett, who leapt into Matt Donnelly's body to write

1729
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,940
 wrongs in his life.

1730
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:02,560
 And so whenever my comedy friends were bored at a party, and I'd said anything, one of

1731
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,360
 them would just go like, "Whatever, you're not even Matt."

1732
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,200
 And I'd be like, "All right, let's not."

1733
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:10,760
 And I would commit to being Sam Beckett immediately.

1734
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:15,720
 And I'd answer questions of Sam Beckett, who leapt into Matt's body, for years.

1735
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:16,720
 For years.

1736
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:20,540
 If it came up, I would never not be Dr. Sam Beckett if they brought it up.

1737
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:24,760
 And it ruined people I was hitting on.

1738
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,840
 It ruined just casual friendships.

1739
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,840
 Wait, you'd be hitting on somebody and one of your friends would go over to you and ask

1740
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:30,840
 Sam Beckett a question.

1741
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,880
 And you'd be like, "We're going fucking Sam Beckett, I'm cock-blocking Matt."

1742
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,960
 And I would just be like, "Oh, I'm sorry, I don't want to get the wrong foot with you,

1743
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:37,960
 but I am.

1744
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:43,960
 I should confess that I'm Sam Beckett, and not actually Matt Donnelly."

1745
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:47,040
 And I mean, we did the bit for a decade.

1746
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:51,000
 I don't know when we stopped doing it, but I would never not do it.

1747
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:57,400
 What a checkmate move when somebody's just trying to lay some game and then just be like,

1748
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,400
 "Oh, wow.

1749
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:04,440
 I guess my only options are, do I explain quantum leap to them?"

1750
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:08,840
 I remember my buddy, Steve Buck on Neutrino, he would do a thing called Bitbot, give me

1751
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,240
 a quarter and I'll do a bit.

1752
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:13,640
 And this drove improvisers crazy.

1753
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:16,320
 And then I would just get out an invisible quarter every time.

1754
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:20,280
 I was like, "You guys are watching the best bit in the world.

1755
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,880
 He'll do a bit on anything."

1756
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:22,880
 Congratulations.

1757
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:23,880
 And I would sell Bitbot.

1758
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,160
 And I just fucking loved it.

1759
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:31,240
 I would say as I got older, I guess I'm not as super major bit crazy, but when I get in

1760
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:32,800
 the groove, I love it.

1761
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:38,000
 And my wife and I met doing improv, so we do fucking really filthy, disgusting bits

1762
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:45,280
 all the time, and really say next level offensive things to each other.

1763
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,440
 And it's so fun, 'cause it's almost like a game of chicken with each other sometimes,

1764
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,920
 and it is a love language, and I do love it.

1765
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:52,920
 Yeah.

1766
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:53,920
 Yeah.

1767
01:06:53,920 --> 01:07:01,520
 I think my wife might not like me personally, because I will just run fucking bits that

1768
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:02,520
 aren't funny.

1769
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:03,520
 I could repeat them to you.

1770
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:11,680
 They're not even clever or interesting, but they make her mad, and that makes me happy.

1771
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:14,320
 Does your wife think you are a funny person?

1772
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:23,840
 I suspect that she does, but she would be very fucking loathe to give me any hint that

1773
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:27,000
 she will suppress laughter.

1774
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
 She will turn her face away.

1775
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
 Oh, she's going to give it to you.

1776
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
 You won't give me that point.

1777
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
 Oh, no.

1778
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
 That's SJ.

1779
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
 SJ will not laugh at me at home.

1780
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
 Really?

1781
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
 Don't give me that point.

1782
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
 SJ's like, "Go fuck yourself."

1783
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,320
 No, 'cause she knows that if she laughs, then she's going to hear that fucking joke for

1784
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:44,280
 the rest of her life.

1785
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:49,280
 She knows the ones that are sticky, and she's like, "I can't tell you that's clever.

1786
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:53,520
 I can't tell you that's interesting, or else it will just be repeated right before we go

1787
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:57,760
 to sleep for the rest of her fucking natural days."

1788
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:58,760
 And she is right.

1789
01:07:58,760 --> 01:07:59,760
 Yeah.

1790
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:00,760
 Oh, no, no, no.

1791
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:01,760
 Yeah, she's absolutely correct.

1792
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:02,760
 She is dead right.

1793
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:03,760
 100%.

1794
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:13,280
 I mean, Brian, I know Bonnie likes you 'cause you're thin, but does she like you ...

1795
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:18,640
 Oh, Matt, good news.

1796
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:22,160
 Bonnie just texted me, and she said, "I don't know why, but I like Matt a little more right

1797
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,160
 now."

1798
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:24,160
 Yeah.

1799
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,160
 Yeah.

1800
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,160
 Trim it up a little bit.

1801
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,160
 All right.

1802
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,560
 No, I actually have good news from the future, 'cause your kids are how old?

1803
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,560
 10 and 12.

1804
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:31,560
 Yeah, yeah.

1805
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:35,880
 So it's like there are families that do music, and they'll just naturally, the kids grow

1806
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,520
 up, and they just learn to harmonize instantly.

1807
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:43,200
 It is a fucking blast when you have teenagers who have grown up where just naturally bits

1808
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:48,000
 are ongoing, and you understand the importance of setting up a runner and all that stuff.

1809
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:54,960
 To be honest, I was really hoping that Josie didn't want to go to college and instead would

1810
01:08:54,960 --> 01:09:00,720
 sneak out to be the surprise guest at ScoopFest, but it's like she is objectively the coolest

1811
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:04,600
 of all her friends, and I am certain it's because of all the ongoing bits and her natural

1812
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:05,600
 understanding.

1813
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:06,600
 Yes.

1814
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:07,600
 So I highly recommend ...

1815
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,520
 Oh, you tell Josie any time she wants to come to ScoopFest, call me, and she can just come

1816
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:12,520
 to ScoopFest.

1817
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,520
 Tell dad to stay home.

1818
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:14,520
 Yeah.

1819
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,520
 Yeah.

1820
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:19,240
 Doing bits with my kids is awesome.

1821
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,240
 Yeah.

1822
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,240
 Thank you very much.

1823
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:24,360
 If you hear Max ... This is the one that I want people to boo him.

1824
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:29,720
 If you hear Max say that he kicks children for a living because he's a martial arts instructor,

1825
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:34,760
 it's a stupid joke, and I've heard it for eight years, "Boo him, boo him."

1826
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:38,920
 Max, you keep kicking those kids for a living.

1827
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:46,360
 No, we have a lot of bit people in our audience, and I love it.

1828
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:48,120
 I love seeing the bit game over our audience.

1829
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:49,120
 I love Max.

1830
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,680
 Max actually hopped in one of my shows in New York, and I literally was like, "Hey, I need

1831
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,520
 a punchline for this magic trick.

1832
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:58,720
 Just do this at this point of the show," and it was so awkward and it was so random, and

1833
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,880
 he just did it, and then he crushed, and it was awesome.

1834
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:04,840
 Thank you, Max, for hopping in my show.

1835
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:05,840
 We got two more here.

1836
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:06,840
 We've got to wrap it up.

1837
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,960
 We've got the bobo, the flound.

1838
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:09,960
 Talk about commitment.

1839
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:10,960
 Yeah.

1840
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,240
 I don't know what you're talking about.

1841
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:13,240
 All right.

1842
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:14,240
 Oh, wait.

1843
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:16,360
 Do you guys not see this person dressed up in front of the microphone?

1844
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:17,760
 What is objective reality?

1845
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:18,760
 No.

1846
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:19,760
 No.

1847
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:20,760
 Back to that one.

1848
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:21,760
 Is it just a microphone?

1849
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:22,760
 Just a microphone.

1850
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:23,760
 Oh, Jesus Christ.

1851
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:24,760
 I don't know why no one would take a microphone.

1852
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:25,760
 There's a microphone right there.

1853
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:29,120
 I actually have Gilbert Godfrey doing the voice for me in the background right now.

1854
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,520
 I'm actually just doing it silently.

1855
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,360
 All right.

1856
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:38,400
 My question on to you is, where do you draw the line in the sand for a comedian to clown?

1857
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:43,000
 Because you'll have like prop comic, you'll have physical comics, but they're not necessarily

1858
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
 a clown.

1859
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,920
 So where do you draw that line in the sand?

1860
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:46,920
 Oh, interesting.

1861
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:51,200
 Because I definitely have a line in my mind, but I don't know where it is.

1862
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:57,760
 So as I, and maybe I have a weird perspective on this, but if you have a physical skill,

1863
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,080
 I put clowning above comedian.

1864
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,080
 Oh, I do too.

1865
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,640
 It's ancient.

1866
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:07,320
 You know, clowning is just ancient.

1867
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:10,560
 You are.

1868
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:11,760
 The questioner is ancient.

1869
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,400
 Oh, I mean, the truth is off the bat, I don't have an answer.

1870
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,640
 Like I don't, this is not something I've contemplated before.

1871
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:20,160
 I definitely do, as you bring it up, I go, oh, I do see a difference in it.

1872
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:25,480
 It is a blend of intellectualism and physical comedy, but yeah, I don't know where that

1873
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,040
 line is.

1874
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:31,680
 And there is, it's weird because I definitely have a real line in my head between people

1875
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:36,720
 in my life that are comedians and people who are clowns, and I don't know exactly what

1876
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,400
 that line is.

1877
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,720
 It might be self-identifying.

1878
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:40,720
 I'm really not sure.

1879
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:45,600
 I will say, I don't know artistically, but just in the difference between clowns and

1880
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:53,160
 comedians that I have met in my life, they are very different people in general.

1881
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:59,080
 Like a comedian, once you've been around people who've done comedy, there's an archetype,

1882
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:06,440
 you know, kind of brooding, like there's little like buttons and love languages that you can

1883
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:07,440
 understand.

1884
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:11,920
 Clowns are far more like carnies and renaissance fair people where there's like, there's a

1885
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:15,440
 fucking tough as nails element to clowns.

1886
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,840
 There is a like, you can't phase them.

1887
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:23,520
 Yeah, but also it's like, you know, maybe there's a dark secret.

1888
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:24,520
 I don't know.

1889
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:28,160
 Like there's an element, usually comedians' dark secret is that they didn't get along

1890
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,160
 with their mom.

1891
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:30,160
 Right.

1892
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:31,160
 You know, actually.

1893
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:37,360
 I'm shooting off a hip here, but I think like comedians, you tend to like their perspectives

1894
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,360
 on things.

1895
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:42,280
 You kind of like want to know a comedian's perspective before you kind of laugh at their

1896
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:48,240
 jokes and clowns seem to like want to make what's ever happening an event that's happening

1897
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:49,240
 like right now.

1898
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:57,240
 Well, even presentationally, like presentationally, clowns kind of remove your ability as an audience

1899
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:00,200
 to look in to the performer, right?

1900
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:03,160
 Like the performance is its own thing.

1901
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:04,160
 It is very loud.

1902
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:05,160
 It is big.

1903
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:09,800
 It is in your face, but it's not like somebody telling a story about, you know, breaking

1904
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:13,000
 up with somebody and people in the audience are like, wow, that makes me think of that

1905
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,960
 experience that I went through.

1906
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:21,640
 It's very performance focused, which almost makes it harder because now you don't have

1907
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:26,760
 a little bit of the emotional buy in that can make art kind of like special and magical

1908
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,040
 if it hits.

1909
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:33,640
 But if it's, you know, a cloud act, then you are looking at physical reaction.

1910
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:39,120
 You're looking at, you know, athleticism, timing, like all the the basic building blocks.

1911
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:47,440
 This got fucking boring, deep into comedy, but it's important for our it's important

1912
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,440
 for our legacy.

1913
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:49,440
 That's true.

1914
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,440
 That's true.

1915
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:54,700
 I wanted to hit an eject button for me.

1916
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:55,700
 Thank you.

1917
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:56,920
 This is actually very insightful.

1918
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:57,920
 Can I tell you a joke?

1919
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:58,920
 Yes.

1920
01:13:58,920 --> 01:13:59,920
 Go ahead.

1921
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:00,920
 All right.

1922
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:01,920
 Why do Catholic priests touch little boys?

1923
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:02,920
 Why?

1924
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:03,920
 Because they can't get none.

1925
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:04,920
 Ah, OK, boys.

1926
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:05,920
 All right.

1927
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:06,920
 There it is.

1928
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:07,920
 Mystery solved.

1929
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:08,920
 I'm now regretting following that.

1930
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:09,920
 I don't know why.

1931
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:10,920
 You guys in a conversation.

1932
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:11,920
 Oh, sorry.

1933
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:12,920
 Shula scoop.

1934
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:13,920
 Shula scoop.

1935
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:14,920
 There he is.

1936
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:27,640
 This fucking liar.

1937
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:30,880
 This popped into my brain after something you said in the conversation I was having

1938
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,040
 back there.

1939
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:43,040
 When I was in college, one of my friends in theater, I was in theater at the time, whenever

1940
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:49,080
 he would go to his room to masturbate, he would tell everybody he was going to get ice

1941
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,280
 cream.

1942
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:57,840
 So, like I said, short, but that was all I had to say.

1943
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,440
 Oh, my gosh.

1944
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:01,440
 That's great.

1945
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:02,440
 That's a good bit.

1946
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:03,440
 I loved it.

1947
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:04,440
 10 out of 10.

1948
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,440
 No question.

1949
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:06,440
 That was great.

1950
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:07,440
 That's fantastic.

1951
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,440
 That's it.

1952
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,440
 On that note, I think it's time for me to go get some ice cream.

1953
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:11,440
 Yeah.

1954
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,440
 I'm going to go get some ice cream.

1955
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,960
 Hey, Justin, you want to go get some ice cream together?

1956
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:15,960
 I'd love it.

1957
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:16,960
 Let's go.

1958
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:17,960
 All right.

1959
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:18,960
 Two scoops.

1960
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:19,960
 Two.

1961
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:20,960
 Both of them.

1962
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:21,960
 Okay.

1963
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:22,960
 All right.

1964
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:23,960
 Give it up for Brian Breschwood.

1965
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:24,960
 Hey, guys.

1966
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:25,960
 Give it up for Justin Robert Young.

1967
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:28,960
 Give it up for all y'all for coming out to ScoopFest.

1968
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:29,960
 Yeah.

1969
