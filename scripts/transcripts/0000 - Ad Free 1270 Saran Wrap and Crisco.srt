The life you save may be your own

9
0:00:36 --> 0:00:43
Here's a show. Hey Johnny. Do you want to go to an ice cream social? Yeah, I'd love to

10
0:00:52 --> 0:00:53
Really

11
0:00:53 --> 0:00:57
Las Vegas rodeo this year because of a horse

12
0:00:57 --> 0:00:59
No, I don't want herpes

13
0:00:59 --> 0:01:10
Really it's great social sitting in Las Vegas. That's Matt Donnelly sitting in Pittsburgh. It's automatically sitting in Las Vegas

14
0:01:10 --> 0:01:13
Loaded with horse herpes. It's the audio guy

15
0:01:13 --> 0:01:18
Fun first off I didn't because of the music they want to interrupt but Bama lamb

16
0:01:19 --> 0:01:21
Horse herpes Bama lamb Bama lamb

17
0:01:22 --> 0:01:26
If you type in horse herpes Google will autofill Las Vegas

18
0:01:26 --> 0:01:31
Oh shit. Yeah, wait a minute if you type down herpes at all Google autofill, Las Vegas

19
0:01:31 --> 0:01:36
Can they get this by like sharing a water trough and shit? Is that how bad it can be?

20
0:01:36 --> 0:01:39
That how viral it is. Where's Nick Newman when we need him

21
0:01:40 --> 0:01:44
I was looking for him in the chat before we started. He's not in. Let's see

22
0:01:44 --> 0:01:49
No confirmed cases were reported reported in Nevada, but there is a significant equine

23
0:01:50 --> 0:01:57
Herpes virus outbreak affecting horse events nationwide causing major major disruptions cancellations

24
0:01:57 --> 0:02:00
like the all-in barrel race and

25
0:02:01 --> 0:02:07
It heightened biosecurity at the NFR rodeo, which is the one in Vegas here during early December

26
0:02:08 --> 0:02:11
So a lot of people just didn't bring their horses

27
0:02:11 --> 0:02:14
A lot of people just just left their animals at home and came to the rodeo

28
0:02:14 --> 0:02:17
Apparently the rodeo was really affected by it

29
0:02:17 --> 0:02:21
Paul says Paul Paul's Paul is right. Let's do it

30
0:02:21 --> 0:02:28
Okay, primarily directed through contact nose-to-nose or indirectly from shared items like tack buckets clothing

31
0:02:28 --> 0:02:31
even people's hands

32
0:02:31 --> 0:02:37
Oh aerosol droplets or contact infected with fluids man. It's amazing how we all don't have horse herpes. This is everything

33
0:02:38 --> 0:02:41
I'm already looking up if it can go to

34
0:02:41 --> 0:02:45
People no, it's not a zoonotic jumper. Please fuck no

35
0:02:47 --> 0:02:50
I don't want horse herpes if I

36
0:02:51 --> 0:02:57
Know our next humans cannot get infected with horse herpes. Don't worry about it. Keep on fucking those horses

37
0:02:58 --> 0:03:06
Keep on a horse a fucking use a stepstool safety first people safety first. That's right. Oh good Lord

38
0:03:06 --> 0:03:11
Yeah, just be out there hoofing it. Mr. Hands has nothing to worry about

39
0:03:11 --> 0:03:17
There'll be more horse herpy stuff in the new Taylor Sheridan show about the rodeo

40
0:03:21 --> 0:03:29
It'll be called it'll be called bull rider long dick man

41
0:03:32 --> 0:03:38
Speech guy Sheridan's running out of good names bull rider long dick man speech guy

42
0:03:38 --> 0:03:39
You know

43
0:03:39 --> 0:03:42
You know what? You know what to say about riding bulls?

44
0:03:43 --> 0:03:49
What's that a lot of times people think it's all about those eight seconds. You got to stay on the bull

45
0:03:49 --> 0:03:54
Those eight seconds. Those are the least important seconds of the whole thing

46
0:03:54 --> 0:03:58
The most important time is when you enter the pen

47
0:03:59 --> 0:04:01
My secret

48
0:04:01 --> 0:04:08
Give that bull a little light touch behind the ear. I

49
0:04:08 --> 0:04:16
See cold on my finger and I give him a little rub right behind the ear with icy cold I

50
0:04:16 --> 0:04:21
See hot and that's what he's what he's recording. What are you quoting? I'm making up a dumb

51
0:04:22 --> 0:04:24
Speech that he would do for this

52
0:04:25 --> 0:04:27
Rodeo, I thought you were quoting something but you're doing

53
0:04:28 --> 0:04:34
I'm improvising Matt. That's what I do. No, no, I don't mean I didn't mean to be that much of a dick about it

54
0:04:38 --> 0:04:42
You didn't make me feel liberal guilt, that's why I didn't think it was a Sheridan speech

55
0:04:45 --> 0:04:52
Also to be fair I don't I don't watch you don't watch so I don't know enough of

56
0:04:52 --> 0:04:55
Okay, so now I know where to go to go with it. Yes

57
0:04:56 --> 0:05:00
I rub a little bit behind there and then when that bull knocks me off

58
0:05:00 --> 0:05:04
After eight seconds if I stay on there for more than eight seconds

59
0:05:04 --> 0:05:11
Bulls outlived its life and that bull is gonna become your quesa frajita over at Chili's next week

60
0:05:11 --> 0:05:16
But you can't look at that bull and realize that's my case of frajita coming to me

61
0:05:16 --> 0:05:22
You look at that bull thing. What a noble beautiful animal and all I see is the

62
0:05:22 --> 0:05:25
999 dinner for two special at Chili's

63
0:05:26 --> 0:05:28
You fucking limp tarred

64
0:05:31 --> 0:05:33
Enter share it at checkout

65
0:05:34 --> 0:05:39
That closer is that more like yes, I don't close pretty close. That's much closer. What a dick

66
0:05:39 --> 0:05:40
You're gonna watch any of those shows

67
0:05:41 --> 0:05:44
You would hate them Paul. I know I

68
0:05:49 --> 0:05:52
Know there was a thing it was a yellow stone like last year the yellow stone

69
0:05:52 --> 0:05:58
there was this character a PIP like a hippie who got arrested, but he became like a like a girlfriend of

70
0:06:01 --> 0:06:05
Kevin Costner, but like in this like pseudo we don't like each other, but we do kind of thing

71
0:06:05 --> 0:06:13
Oh, yeah, yeah, and her job. The last season was just to get lectured by every cast member a different aspect of Montana society

72
0:06:15 --> 0:06:18
It's a good gig if you can get it and at one point this one character

73
0:06:18 --> 0:06:23
Who's a Native American who's already was already feeling guilt about marrying into a Montana family that like, you know

74
0:06:23 --> 0:06:28
It's against her Native American, you know, whatever she lectured her and I was like Jesus

75
0:06:28 --> 0:06:31
I was like everyone's breaking character just to lecture libs

76
0:06:33 --> 0:06:37
Once we torched this lib girl we can go back to fighting about real things between our cultures

77
0:06:37 --> 0:06:40
But in the meantime the enemy of my enemy is my friend

78
0:06:42 --> 0:06:43
And

79
0:06:43 --> 0:06:47
There's a plot point happening in land made right now and I and I and I and I feel crazy

80
0:06:48 --> 0:06:52
Only because like in season one this person got a payout from the oil company like a wrongful death suit

81
0:06:52 --> 0:06:55
Okay, this couple this whole season this whole season

82
0:06:55 --> 0:06:59
They're fighting over money and I'm like weren't you paying a shitload of money from an oil company?

83
0:06:59 --> 0:07:02
Why isn't that coming up in conversation? Why is it coming up?

84
0:07:03 --> 0:07:05
You're paid out

85
0:07:05 --> 0:07:12
a large plot point last season about the large plot point that's happening right now in mayor of Kingston, which I watch right now like

86
0:07:12 --> 0:07:15
Like the pilot episode is that?

87
0:07:17 --> 0:07:21
What's his name the guy got ran over by a snow blower in real life. Oh

88
0:07:21 --> 0:07:23
Hawkeye Hawkeye. Yeah. Yeah. Yes

89
0:07:23 --> 0:07:29
So that guy he has it becoming his brother's job because his brother gets killed in a botched robbery, right?

90
0:07:29 --> 0:07:33
And they went through like four seasons were like man. We haven't brought him up in a while

91
0:07:33 --> 0:07:35
So the last episode that they bring up his dead brother like six times

92
0:07:38 --> 0:07:45
So go they're really making up for the lost lost bit there Jeremy Renner Jeremy Renner is who I'm thinking of yeah

93
0:07:45 --> 0:07:47
Yeah, it's hard

94
0:07:48 --> 0:07:50
It's hard. He's it is

95
0:07:50 --> 0:07:51
He's a fucking

96
0:07:51 --> 0:07:57
Yeah, okay, you talk about somebody coming away with the wrong life lessons after a near-death experience

97
0:08:02 --> 0:08:03
Yeah, oh

98
0:08:03 --> 0:08:10
Oh, he's just kind of doubled down on his asshole or he's a bit of a shit bird. Okay. Yeah, I

99
0:08:10 --> 0:08:13
How I don't know I I like Jeremy Renner a lot

100
0:08:13 --> 0:08:20
Not a lot. I like Jeremy Renner. I'd fuck him. He's gonna break your heart Matt. He

101
0:08:20 --> 0:08:21
It's probably true

102
0:08:22 --> 0:08:23
but he like

103
0:08:24 --> 0:08:25
like

104
0:08:25 --> 0:08:32
Survived unlike like he and his brother were like split like a box like doughnut holes when they were like dirt poor

105
0:08:32 --> 0:08:38
Okay, they got by in Hollywood by like buying and flipping a house and then flipping that in other houses and doing construction

106
0:08:38 --> 0:08:39
So like that

107
0:08:39 --> 0:08:43
But like he went from like dirt as poor to like building himself up into

108
0:08:43 --> 0:08:47
Like a house flipper while trying to be an actor at the same time and I thought that was pretty cool that he was

109
0:08:48 --> 0:08:48
not

110
0:08:48 --> 0:08:53
Any kind of like nepo baby or anything that like he really had to like fight to stay in the business and try to make

111
0:08:53 --> 0:09:00
A go of it. So I do like it and her locker. Come on. That's a cool debut story. Sure. All right

112
0:09:00 --> 0:09:01
What is why is he a shipper?

113
0:09:03 --> 0:09:06
I get them vibes when I hear him talk. Oh

114
0:09:06 --> 0:09:09
Did something no, he's just kind of he's just kind of his

115
0:09:09 --> 0:09:14
Might I get along with him? I don't give a shit about that

116
0:09:16 --> 0:09:18
His stance on some shit, it's a little bit

117
0:09:18 --> 0:09:25
But whatever it's all is weary Paul is weary of good for him good for him. Do your thing make you make your money

118
0:09:27 --> 0:09:32
Poker the other day for the first time in a very long time. Yeah, and I thought I was gonna watch

119
0:09:32 --> 0:09:39
Someone get murdered. I was at the poker table. I thought one player was gonna murder another player tournament or open table

120
0:09:40 --> 0:09:48
Open table. Okay cash game. Okay. No big deal low stakes cash game one three one three. No limit cash game

121
0:09:49 --> 0:09:53
A fellow that was at the table a couple of seats down from me

122
0:09:53 --> 0:10:01
He won a sizable pot from me got a little bit lucky on the last card drew out on the last card

123
0:10:01 --> 0:10:06
Nobody I'm not saying anything to him. You know, I'm do the hand ends he wins

124
0:10:06 --> 0:10:12
It's a good sized hand just doing yeah, you're stewing. I'm not even stewing. I'm like, oh that's over. All right. He got it

125
0:10:12 --> 0:10:16
He says without me saying anything. He says to me

126
0:10:16 --> 0:10:18
Boy, I thought you were gonna draw out on me there

127
0:10:20 --> 0:10:24
And I looked I looked back I was just confused I looked back I was like I wait I was ahead though

128
0:10:25 --> 0:10:29
I was ahead until the until the last card you got the last card there and you won it

129
0:10:30 --> 0:10:34
He goes. Yeah. Yeah, but I was mathematically ahead already. I was supposed to win that hand already

130
0:10:34 --> 0:10:36
I just wasn't ahead on the cards yet

131
0:10:37 --> 0:10:40
and I and I kind of laughed I kind of I kind of good because he was

132
0:10:41 --> 0:10:45
Absolutely being genuine. He was he was saying that with all sincerity

133
0:10:45 --> 0:10:50
He was like no, no, I was supposed to win that hand. I was ahead mathematically which he wasn't by the time

134
0:10:50 --> 0:10:54
He actually made the call. He was mathematically behind when he made the call doesn't matter doesn't matter

135
0:10:54 --> 0:11:02
He won the hand I wasn't mad about it. Yeah. Yeah, so that was that was that he was a touch of a you know a

136
0:11:02 --> 0:11:07
skosh this much of a just a bit of a jerk about it just a

137
0:11:07 --> 0:11:13
Just not even not even a jerk. I was done with it though. I so we continue playing the game

138
0:11:13 --> 0:11:15
I don't say anything to him about it

139
0:11:15 --> 0:11:19
After I got it after I figured out what he meant by that didn't matter that he was wrong

140
0:11:19 --> 0:11:23
I was over it moving on so about half an hour later

141
0:11:23 --> 0:11:29
I win a big hand a very big hand off of that guy. Okay

142
0:11:29 --> 0:11:35
So I made all the money back and then quite a bit more off of that guy

143
0:11:35 --> 0:11:37
Like I say about half an hour later

144
0:11:37 --> 0:11:42
Again, this person is not sitting next to me. There is a person between us

145
0:11:43 --> 0:11:48
After I win that hand I don't say anything because I'm not stupid

146
0:11:49 --> 0:11:56
When it comes to this I'm not scenario you're in this scenario. I was not stupid at that moment. Yeah, there we go

147
0:11:56 --> 0:11:58
so I

148
0:11:58 --> 0:11:59
Don't say a word

149
0:11:59 --> 0:12:05
The person between us though looks at the guy who just lost the hell and by the way

150
0:12:05 --> 0:12:08
I had drawn out I had drawn out on this hand

151
0:12:08 --> 0:12:14
So I got a little bit lucky on this hand and the fourth card out I got a little bit lucky with that card

152
0:12:14 --> 0:12:18
Well the moment of the setup right you got lucky. That's it. That's it. Yeah, I'm just being quiet

153
0:12:18 --> 0:12:20
I'm stacking up my chips

154
0:12:20 --> 0:12:26
I'm moving on to the next hand the guy between us looks at the guy who just lost and goes

155
0:12:26 --> 0:12:28
Well, that was payback for earlier, huh?

156
0:12:35 --> 0:12:41
And I like my head just snapped up, you know, I'm looking down I'm looking anywhere but at this guy

157
0:12:41 --> 0:12:49
My head just snaps up and I just was like I whatever is happening here. I don't want to be a part of this

158
0:12:49 --> 0:12:53
That's I would give a I would give a stern stop helping

159
0:12:54 --> 0:13:00
Line to the guy over there. Don't I wanted to I wanted to so badly

160
0:13:00 --> 0:13:03
I didn't want to open my mouth though

161
0:13:03 --> 0:13:08
I was afraid that if I drew any attention to myself that it was all just gonna dump onto me

162
0:13:09 --> 0:13:11
I've you did a party you consider going

163
0:13:11 --> 0:13:13
Right and then high-fiving the guy

164
0:13:22 --> 0:13:24
Took the words out of my mouth

165
0:13:30 --> 0:13:33
You need to shut the fuck up

166
0:13:34 --> 0:13:35
Oh shit

167
0:13:45 --> 0:13:50
Would make me laugh really hard I

168
0:13:50 --> 0:13:56
Was crying at the poker table I had to get up and walk away it was awful

169
0:13:59 --> 0:14:02
Because that's it like you you have to laugh at that point because

170
0:14:03 --> 0:14:05
That's all you could do. It's all you can do

171
0:14:05 --> 0:14:12
And if that guy is above the laugh line, he's about to get kicked out of the casino anyway, yes

172
0:14:12 --> 0:14:18
Yes, yes. Yeah, so Jake I just want to make it clear that I'm not involved in whatever this conversation is over here

173
0:14:18 --> 0:14:23
I I think I'm gonna go home. I think I'm just gonna go home in that kind of scenario

174
0:14:23 --> 0:14:28
Can you can you just get up and go? Can you just get up and go after after any game after any hand?

175
0:14:28 --> 0:14:34
Open can open table you stand up any time. I feel don't you feel I have felt bad in the past

176
0:14:34 --> 0:14:40
I haven't played in forever, but I would feel bad after winning a pot and then leaving the it's called hit and run it

177
0:14:40 --> 0:14:42
You know, you're not it's bad etiquette

178
0:14:43 --> 0:14:45
To but it's also how you get money, right?

179
0:14:46 --> 0:14:51
it's certainly it is certainly allowed within the rules and the people who do it are

180
0:14:51 --> 0:14:56
Probably more intelligent than the other people who are still sitting at the table. I just stay there to lose

181
0:14:56 --> 0:15:00
But at least the DC to take a fake phone call pretend to talk about an urgent matter

182
0:15:04 --> 0:15:10
My gosh a baby now both babies both babies at the same time

183
0:15:11 --> 0:15:15
Wait more than two bit. Where's the other babies? How many babies guys guys?

184
0:15:15 --> 0:15:21
I gotta go sorry all the baby lots of babies so many babies so many babies guys. Hey

185
0:15:21 --> 0:15:28
Great game and you need to shut the fuck up. Bye. I

186
0:15:28 --> 0:15:34
Think I stayed for about five more minutes because I didn't know how to not leave awkwardly right and I was like

187
0:15:34 --> 0:15:39
This is it. I'm leaving. Yeah, you're gone to fuck that

188
0:15:40 --> 0:15:45
It was so bad it was so bad. I was like this you're gonna get yourself shot

189
0:15:45 --> 0:15:49
I'm gonna get shot just by sitting here. I don't want to get shot

190
0:15:49 --> 0:15:54
I don't want to be in a fight with some random dude in a casino at 1130 at night

191
0:15:54 --> 0:16:00
I've done I've been sitting at a table where someone hit and run and it's not even I feel that like oh

192
0:16:00 --> 0:16:02
They're there, you know that that lucky motherfucker

193
0:16:02 --> 0:16:07
It's more like all the money at the table is gone like you look like it's just a bunch of short stacks

194
0:16:07 --> 0:16:12
You're like, oh now what are we all playing for $50? Yeah, now the game is kind of over. Yeah. Yeah

195
0:16:13 --> 0:16:16
But still, you know, it's it's an open table

196
0:16:16 --> 0:16:23
That's all I would have sat and played for a while longer if this guy had not egged on the guy that I had

197
0:16:23 --> 0:16:29
Just accidentally roughed up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah the scenario the amount of scenarios where the table

198
0:16:29 --> 0:16:33
And the other guy was already putting more cash down on the table like he was staying in yeah

199
0:16:33 --> 0:16:36
So he wasn't leaving he wasn't going anywhere anytime soon

200
0:16:38 --> 0:16:40
Like no, no, whatever is happening here

201
0:16:40 --> 0:16:46
I don't want to be in it people going on tilts one of the weirdest things to watch and it's so hard to

202
0:16:46 --> 0:16:51
Deal with and yes, especially at like a low-stakes game. Yeah

203
0:16:51 --> 0:16:55
But this this is supposed to not matter, right?

204
0:16:55 --> 0:17:02
Like on on pot therapy Whitney's husband Peter, yeah, he's a professional poker player

205
0:17:02 --> 0:17:11
And so we I always anytime I play poker, which is probably I don't know at this point three times a year

206
0:17:11 --> 0:17:13
I go I'll play poker and

207
0:17:14 --> 0:17:19
Oftentimes I will end up with a story for Peter from these low-stakes games because he's

208
0:17:19 --> 0:17:24
He's won three games aren't the games that he's playing but every now and then you run into

209
0:17:25 --> 0:17:31
A professional, you know a big quote-unquote professional poker player at a low-stakes game

210
0:17:31 --> 0:17:35
Well, they all have these training apps now and they're all like these there's

211
0:17:36 --> 0:17:38
Soles and game theory stuff

212
0:17:38 --> 0:17:39
Yeah

213
0:17:39 --> 0:17:46
Makes people do dumb things on purpose to mess with other people's math and no one's getting the cards and it's gotten super weird

214
0:17:46 --> 0:17:52
But watching people do that at a low-stakes game where no one is doing the math in the first place. Yeah

215
0:17:52 --> 0:17:56
It's like meta fuck you. Yeah. Yeah

216
0:17:57 --> 0:18:03
It's it's crazy. It's just a weird crazy thing and also like, you know, and I I've been you know

217
0:18:03 --> 0:18:07
We've all been victims of bad beats, you know that kind of thing

218
0:18:09 --> 0:18:13
It's like it's poker for a reason, you know, like you're like, oh yeah

219
0:18:13 --> 0:18:19
I was doing the math and then gambling happened. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's the kind of like what we're doing

220
0:18:20 --> 0:18:24
Is tempting fate for bouts of luck and craziness

221
0:18:24 --> 0:18:29
Sometimes the wrong card just comes out or the right card speaking of gambling. Go ahead

222
0:18:29 --> 0:18:33
what are your guys takes on the current state of

223
0:18:33 --> 0:18:35
sports and

224
0:18:35 --> 0:18:41
Sort of the veneer cracking around. Oh that play was clearly somebody

225
0:18:41 --> 0:18:45
Covering a spread or fucking around for no good reason

226
0:18:46 --> 0:18:46
Level

227
0:18:49 --> 0:18:54
A lot of heat right is there gonna be is there gonna be any kind of real?

228
0:18:55 --> 0:19:01
No, cuz what I don't know but my consequence like you can't have a consequence if you don't know that something happened

229
0:19:01 --> 0:19:04
There's no way to tell if something happened unless somebody says like I did this

230
0:19:04 --> 0:19:09
I will say that I will say that I hear Paul and that like when they started loosening up all the sports gambling

231
0:19:10 --> 0:19:15
All the scenarios that everyone thought of sure came up in a hurry all the things that we like what if this happens?

232
0:19:15 --> 0:19:19
What that happens? It seems of all come to a head really quickly

233
0:19:19 --> 0:19:22
Oh, I let me be clear. I don't think I don't think that Paul is wrong on this

234
0:19:22 --> 0:19:28
I think that Paul is absolutely correct on this. Oh, what's that? I don't know. I think you're absolutely correct on this

235
0:19:28 --> 0:19:30
I'm saying I don't know how to prove it

236
0:19:30 --> 0:19:35
I don't know how to I don't know how to like get anyone but like did you see that play?

237
0:19:35 --> 0:19:40
Like it was making be viral. I've been really intentionally not watching any football anything

238
0:19:40 --> 0:19:46
uh-huh, but there was some college game and the kid is running down the field with the ball and

239
0:19:46 --> 0:19:52
Just he's got nobody in front of him. He's almost the goal line. He just walks off the side

240
0:19:52 --> 0:19:54
You see it. I

241
0:19:54 --> 0:20:00
There's so many college games. So there's so many that's things like college sports specifically, right?

242
0:20:00 --> 0:20:06
So like you can watch the NBA in the NFL. You have 30 teams going at it, right or 33 to whatever and

243
0:20:07 --> 0:20:12
With college you have hundreds and hundreds of this 30 teams just in the Big Ten, right?

244
0:20:13 --> 0:20:14
and

245
0:20:14 --> 0:20:20
And in those scenarios, right those those those smaller colleges where they're not making a lot of money

246
0:20:20 --> 0:20:27
Right. So like this if I had the opportunity to take two steps to the left and make $20,000

247
0:20:27 --> 0:20:29
I think I'd do it

248
0:20:29 --> 0:20:31
All right, you know, let's all right. Let's

249
0:20:32 --> 0:20:36
I'm in for 20. I just need a thousand people to join me

250
0:20:38 --> 0:20:42
You're not over 20,000 you're in for $20 feel like I just feel like

251
0:20:43 --> 0:20:47
You can't trust any sport at this point on a professional level

252
0:20:47 --> 0:20:53
I don't think you have here's why here's where I think you are not wrong

253
0:20:53 --> 0:20:59
But mistaken in the in the path that you're going down. Okay, I don't think you have to go to gambling

254
0:20:59 --> 0:21:05
I think you can just go to the to the legit money the quote-unquote legit money in it

255
0:21:05 --> 0:21:08
And that's all you have like I don't know. Yes, and that's gambling side of it

256
0:21:08 --> 0:21:11
You have to go to the dark money to find the crazy shit

257
0:21:13 --> 0:21:20
College football it's getting nuts and in the end of the mean that's going around is like Indiana has been terrible football for 150

258
0:21:20 --> 0:21:23
Years, you can pay players and suddenly they're good. They're like

259
0:21:23 --> 0:21:27
Indiana was the only only college playing by the rules for the last hundred and fifty years

260
0:21:29 --> 0:21:34
And I was laughing because Indiana won a crazy game against Ohio State and both players are interviewed

261
0:21:34 --> 0:21:37
We're like I want to thank God. I want to thank our Lord God Lord God Lord God

262
0:21:37 --> 0:21:39
I was like money you have the highest payroll

263
0:21:42 --> 0:21:44
You could thank old Johnny greenbacks

264
0:21:46 --> 0:21:49
You want to thank your river of money of boosters

265
0:21:51 --> 0:21:57
I want to thank God which is what I call all of my sugar daddies here at Indiana University

266
0:21:57 --> 0:22:01
Thank you God. No, it's gonna college football is gonna get weird

267
0:22:02 --> 0:22:07
College football is about to get bizarre because the amount of money that's going into that

268
0:22:07 --> 0:22:14
Through like the legit channels. Yeah, it's it's so much money. It's yeah, it's gonna be great

269
0:22:14 --> 0:22:20
Oh, yeah, and then Andy has mentioned the transfer portal that being able to transfer from from team to team much more easily now

270
0:22:21 --> 0:22:27
Oh, yeah, but coach. Oh, yeah, like coaches leave teams with like I'm gonna leave this

271
0:22:27 --> 0:22:32
$12,000,000 a year job, even though I was I thought I was trying to kind of stay for ten years

272
0:22:32 --> 0:22:39
I'm gonna leave because I was gonna pay me even more money like you can't there's no these contracts mean nothing. Yeah

273
0:22:43 --> 0:22:51
Even more infinite money than protein right, but there's 32 NFL teams, right? Yeah, just 30. I think it's 32

274
0:22:53 --> 0:22:58
So like if you're like the 33rd or 34th best quarterback, right?

275
0:22:59 --> 0:23:03
you can now make money by staying at a

276
0:23:04 --> 0:23:09
University. Yeah playing quarterback in college, right? If you just want to stay at Michigan

277
0:23:09 --> 0:23:15
So what's gonna happen make more money playing it in Michigan than you can backing up at the New England Patriots?

278
0:23:15 --> 0:23:19
What's gonna happen would just make sense for me to play six seven or eight years at Michigan

279
0:23:19 --> 0:23:23
That's what I'm wondering is gonna that's what that's where it's gonna get no

280
0:23:23 --> 0:23:27
They're gonna have 35 years playing college ball, right?

281
0:23:27 --> 0:23:32
I mean a Shador Sanders is a good example of one. He's playing for the for the Cleveland Browns now

282
0:23:32 --> 0:23:33
He

283
0:23:34 --> 0:23:40
When when the draft happened, he's a rookie this year when the draft happened the place that he got drafted at

284
0:23:40 --> 0:23:45
They said point-blank they were like he could have made more money if he had just stayed another year in college

285
0:23:45 --> 0:23:50
Yeah, but if he had got drafted in the NFL, yeah, they just say it there's like

286
0:23:50 --> 0:23:54
Oh, yeah, he he could have made more money if he had stated he played at the University of Colorado

287
0:23:54 --> 0:23:58
They either just stayed there and made more money that would have just been it

288
0:23:59 --> 0:24:00
Yeah

289
0:24:01 --> 0:24:07
Lorgan copper scale and chat says isn't isn't youth league in high school football falling out of favor for safer sports

290
0:24:08 --> 0:24:08
Yes

291
0:24:08 --> 0:24:11
And a large in the large part

292
0:24:11 --> 0:24:16
Yes, but for the less glorious positions like linemen and things like that are you're finding

293
0:24:17 --> 0:24:22
It's hard and harder to find these quality people want to sacrifice their bodies for for the thankless positions

294
0:24:22 --> 0:24:25
Well again, I can't I can't say it enough like that that

295
0:24:26 --> 0:24:32
Aaron Hernandez special segment that last podcast did they did three episodes on him. Yeah, and

296
0:24:33 --> 0:24:34
both

297
0:24:35 --> 0:24:40
Marcus and Ed were like we came up as youth people young men playing football

298
0:24:40 --> 0:24:44
And they talked about the horrors of it through high school and all that kind of stuff

299
0:24:44 --> 0:24:50
And it's just it's you know, it really it was insane. It was change their mind was insane

300
0:24:50 --> 0:24:53
They've been they've been football like Ed has been a football fan forever

301
0:24:53 --> 0:25:00
Like Miami Dolphins is like part of his identity as a human being and he's now just now after all this

302
0:25:00 --> 0:25:05
This this podcast this little podcast run and doing the research in it

303
0:25:05 --> 0:25:11
He's really just starting to change his mind around the CTE and the dangers of the sport and just the inhumanity of it

304
0:25:12 --> 0:25:12
my

305
0:25:12 --> 0:25:16
Brother was captain of his football team in the high school

306
0:25:17 --> 0:25:21
And he tells stories that I'm still afraid to repeat here now

307
0:25:23 --> 0:25:28
Like really that went down like that would be a crazy crazy scandal

308
0:25:28 --> 0:25:36
Yes, yeah, there are there are things that happened on a regular basis on the on the teams at my high school

309
0:25:37 --> 0:25:39
That people would go to jail for now

310
0:25:39 --> 0:25:44
Yeah, they would just they would go to jail for like child endangerment and things like and I'm not talking about like

311
0:25:45 --> 0:25:50
Terrible things or anything, but just you know, just just the standard things that we would practice. Yeah. Yeah

312
0:25:50 --> 0:25:55
Fights the the cursing that you know, he's all the weird. Yeah

0:29:33 --> 0:29:35
Okay, okay. Are they married?

359
0:29:36 --> 0:29:39
They had a backstory. I don't know the backstory

360
0:29:39 --> 0:29:45
Was he carrying the doll or was it in like was it in like a wheelbarrow? What are we talking about here?

361
0:29:48 --> 0:29:52
It was our arm are wrapped around the shoulder arm around the waist

362
0:29:54 --> 0:29:58
It was like a like a baby monkey it was wrapped on him like a baby monkey

363
0:29:58 --> 0:30:03
Yeah, no, don't go wrapping your sex doll around you like a baby monkey. That's

364
0:30:04 --> 0:30:07
Yeah, stick to the rivers and the streams that you're used to

365
0:30:07 --> 0:30:11
Did you carry your kids like baby monkeys? I carried whatever way they wanted

366
0:30:11 --> 0:30:17
I carried them every which way I could what's what was best was it arms over shoulders or legs over shoulders?

367
0:30:17 --> 0:30:20
That's easier, right legs over shoulders is easier, right?

368
0:30:21 --> 0:30:22
fireman's carry in a pinch

0:30:27 --> 0:30:30
Some kids rest easy on the hip and some don't it's a weird thing

372
0:30:30 --> 0:30:35
So one of my kids was very easy to just hold on the hip and one of my kids was could not it

373
0:30:35 --> 0:30:39
Was just it was uncomfortable for both of us couldn't stay there didn't like it. So what was the solution?

374
0:30:40 --> 0:30:48
Stop stop walking stop raising him. Stop loving him. Stop. Sure. Sure. Sure. Yeah, clearly we're genetically incompatible

375
0:30:48 --> 0:30:54
Put him on ice flow the way he goes. I mean, I think he's doing great. I don't know

376
0:30:56 --> 0:31:03
Happen to Matt's third son, it's our new favorite segment a baby that didn't fit on Matt's hip

377
0:31:05 --> 0:31:07
These are the reasons Matt throws away kids

378
0:31:09 --> 0:31:12
I don't want to I don't want to I was gonna out you Mike Nelson, but Mike doesn't says yes

379
0:31:12 --> 0:31:14
Me my real dog loves John wick and we had to go see

380
0:31:16 --> 0:31:17
So, okay

381
0:31:18 --> 0:31:23
Okay, so somebody pulls up with a wheelbarrow with a real doll was this allowed and they said they said as well

382
0:31:23 --> 0:31:25
They basically said as long as you pay for two tickets

383
0:31:25 --> 0:31:31
We don't you can do whatever you want. And so they made him pay for a second. Thank you. Is that funny?

384
0:31:35 --> 0:31:36
But but

385
0:31:36 --> 0:31:39
The doll is taking up the space number one and number two

386
0:31:40 --> 0:31:45
Doesn't that reinforce his dream even more that's that's what I was gonna say

387
0:31:45 --> 0:31:49
I was like I bet he I bet he like I'm sure is that oh second ticket, of course

388
0:31:49 --> 0:31:54
I'll have to pay she's another she's a person. I'm still assuming he was it a she

389
0:31:56 --> 0:31:59
It was a guy with it was a guy with a girl doll. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's what okay

390
0:31:59 --> 0:32:05
I mean, I mean, yeah, that's that's what it was supernova girl. It was Jimmy Sloan Ena Jimmy. So Nina

391
0:32:07 --> 0:32:08
Lord

392
0:32:09 --> 0:32:12
She scooped Jesus says the lady will be paying

393
0:32:18 --> 0:32:24
He like puts the money in her hand and like shakes it off on the counter to different debit cards

394
0:32:30 --> 0:32:34
Today I'm treating my man like a prince

395
0:32:35 --> 0:32:36
Baby monkey

396
0:32:39 --> 0:32:46
Apparently he did speak in her voice for different parts. Stop it. Yeah. Stop it. No, I'm so happy

397
0:32:47 --> 0:32:49
No, no, no, no, no

398
0:32:50 --> 0:32:51
No, no

399
0:32:51 --> 0:32:54
Sometimes I think the John Wick movies are a little over the top

400
0:32:54 --> 0:33:00
But I really like like the the character and his motivation over the death of his dog

401
0:33:01 --> 0:33:05
It was just an emotional connection to his wife

402
0:33:05 --> 0:33:10
Sorry, my wife's been drinking. I'm so

403
0:33:10 --> 0:33:16
My liquor speaking of liquor, it's been a minute take me to the bathroom and rough up this bus bus

404
0:33:23 --> 0:33:25
Don't try rub it

405
0:33:25 --> 0:33:28
You better put your mouth where my money is and by money

406
0:33:28 --> 0:33:34
I mean pussy hole and by pussy hole. I mean strange plastic cavern that needs cleaning

407
0:33:35 --> 0:33:36
Oh

408
0:33:36 --> 0:33:45
Built-in flashlight, okay. He wish it was a built-in flashlight. This is basically

409
0:33:45 --> 0:33:48
Saran wrap. Oh, no

410
0:33:51 --> 0:33:53
Saran wrap and Chris go at this point

411
0:33:59 --> 0:34:08
One of the robotic parts of my bus bus went failure town and he just replaced he placed my innards with Saran

412
0:34:08 --> 0:34:13
Crisco and his Crisco was a poor choice for several reasons

413
0:34:27 --> 0:34:34
My horrible innards attract flies and you can't tell where the Crisco starts and the old come stops

414
0:34:34 --> 0:34:38
So, you know clean up is not a breeze as it were

415
0:34:41 --> 0:34:42
Okay

416
0:34:49 --> 0:34:52
Only time in my life I hear old come

417
0:34:53 --> 0:35:02
Stop any old come start. I don't know. They're just not okay with that

418
0:35:02 --> 0:35:09
Yeah, at one point he drops her. Oh god. Yeah. Oh what happened eyes popped out

419
0:35:15 --> 0:35:19
I can't believe what I'm seeing at the John wick experience

420
0:35:22 --> 0:35:24
Can't believe my eyes

421
0:35:24 --> 0:35:27
This is where it gets weird up into this point

422
0:35:27 --> 0:35:31
Not weird, but this is where it gets weird. Yep

423
0:35:32 --> 0:35:33
he quickly

424
0:35:34 --> 0:35:36
again third-hand story

425
0:35:37 --> 0:35:39
Pockets the eyes

426
0:35:39 --> 0:35:42
Picks him up puts him in the pocket like oops, okay

427
0:35:43 --> 0:35:47
Still carries around the isles doll for the rest of the experience

428
0:35:48 --> 0:35:52
Doesn't go about putting the eyes back in no because

429
0:35:52 --> 0:35:57
He knows there's a possibility of a second drop and he's lucky to have fished him out when he did

430
0:35:59 --> 0:36:05
I bet cuz I bet those things are I bet those are probably some of the more expensive parts of the doll also

431
0:36:06 --> 0:36:12
He's fucking those eye holes. I that thank you. Thank you for saying it before I had

432
0:36:14 --> 0:36:16
That doll is getting skull fuck

433
0:36:18 --> 0:36:21
Those eyes are not supposed to come out

434
0:36:22 --> 0:36:26
What was I supposed to do your honor not fuck those eye holes

435
0:36:34 --> 0:36:40
If you'd seen the kind of mascara she was wearing your honor she was asking for it

436
0:36:41 --> 0:36:44
Oh has anyone done a ventriloquist act with a real doll?

437
0:36:46 --> 0:36:52
Who's that Lord Morgan Morgan, that's that's a great idea. I don't know

438
0:36:53 --> 0:36:57
Yeah, it is it's it's super it's super

439
0:36:57 --> 0:37:01
Uncomfortable funny to imagine a whole a whole doll there

440
0:37:03 --> 0:37:09
Because because it could start off like kind of normal then real quick and just be all about you do terrible things to me

441
0:37:09 --> 0:37:11
in the night all the time

442
0:37:11 --> 0:37:13

Yeah, it started this episode. It wasn't this isn't this episode. I thought it was okay

451
0:37:52 --> 0:37:56
It doesn't matter because I didn't hit record anyway, so we're only we're only getting recorded anyway

452
0:37:56 --> 0:38:02
So we're not gonna record him if he talks. So they're say they're real doll. Could you call me a cab?

453
0:38:03 --> 0:38:06
Okay, you're a cab also

454
0:38:07 --> 0:38:13
I'm gonna call myself a cab so I can escape this treacherous relationship that I have with you

455
0:38:14 --> 0:38:20
I'm very tired of having organic food stuffed inside of me

456
0:38:22 --> 0:38:27

457
0:38:27 --> 0:38:35

460
0:39:02 --> 0:39:06
One between the eyes of two behind the ears make me an angel, please

461
0:39:08 --> 0:39:09
Kill me

462
0:39:09 --> 0:39:15

463
0:39:18 --> 0:39:24
I'm glad I got that nice and clean as a drop. Oh

464
0:39:24 --> 0:39:26
It's not gonna be a clean drop tonight

465
0:39:28 --> 0:39:35
That's the worst part I wouldn't mind if it was all just you know, but but this is what becomes dinner later

466
0:39:35 --> 0:39:39
He squeezes it out of me and fries it up in a pan

467
0:39:39 --> 0:39:42
I can fuck on the bacon

468
0:39:44 --> 0:39:48
Do anything else while while they were going through the John wick experience

469
0:39:48 --> 0:39:55
Well, somebody was asking was it dressed what did you get a description of the clothing? It was a

476
0:40:41 --> 0:40:42
Oh

477
0:40:45 --> 0:40:46
That's true Paul

478
0:40:47 --> 0:40:50
This is a good time to remind people that we have an obelisk scheme

479
0:40:50 --> 0:40:53
If you're looking for one person or one person only to turn on to this podcast

480
0:40:58 --> 0:41:06
Check out the sex complaining about abuse and old gum. There you go

481
0:41:06 --> 0:41:12
Crisco was a mistake. Yeah

482
0:41:17 --> 0:41:18
$11,000

483
0:41:18 --> 0:41:23
For what I should have asked you how much do you think a real doll costs?

484
0:41:25 --> 0:41:28
Number that seems cheap. No

485
0:41:29 --> 0:41:31
Pay for your real dolls Paul

486
0:41:31 --> 0:41:37
I've looked into their pricing and like 20 so he's had like an economy model

487
0:41:37 --> 0:41:44
He's basically fucking a you go. I don't know what he that's not just looking at the website here

488
0:41:44 --> 0:41:49
I don't know the first one. He's yeah, he's out there fucking you goes you want man

489
0:41:49 --> 0:41:52
Especially if you're gonna take her out in public you better be having a Maserati

490
0:41:53 --> 0:41:56
Yeah, it didn't have need heated seats. That's right, Nick

491
0:41:56 --> 0:42:01
You got you gotta have one that's got those built-in warmers because there's nothing worse

492
0:42:01 --> 0:42:03
than 3 a.m

493
0:42:03 --> 0:42:09
Sliding it in to some cold roast beef inside that butthole. Oh

494
0:42:10 --> 0:42:13
Paul I mean I have a single thing worse than that

495
0:42:13 --> 0:42:17
Well, what's worse is after you bust and then you you forget and he turn her over and then you end up in

496
0:42:17 --> 0:42:21
The wet spot and it's like well, this is all my fault. How much for just raw doll?

497
0:42:26 --> 0:42:29
Matt I think what you'd be interested in is the torso model

498
0:42:31 --> 0:42:38
Oh, no, oh, yeah, so just torso that is very much an availability. I don't want any lip

499
0:42:38 --> 0:42:46
I don't want any mouth. That's exactly what it get you get

500
0:42:46 --> 0:42:48
Bob says leon

501
0:42:48 --> 0:42:55
Buying a real doll now is like buying a blackberry in 2003 like it's just

502
0:42:56 --> 0:42:59
we're about to get fucking crazy with

503
0:43:00 --> 0:43:07
And you think you think this is this is a dumb invest or or is this a smart move Matt and a

504
0:43:07 --> 0:43:10
Blackberry might be a smart cuz don't you want a dumb real doll?

505
0:43:11 --> 0:43:14
You don't want this thing fucking spying on you and killing you in your sleep

506
0:43:14 --> 0:43:17
These things are according to their website. They already have AI

507
0:43:18 --> 0:43:19
vaginas

508
0:43:21 --> 0:43:27
No, Jacob you misread that it's a one because of all the raw beef that's crammed in there

509
0:43:27 --> 0:43:33
A little a little steak sauce gets get things moving. It's an a1 vagina

510
0:43:37 --> 0:43:44
We're not on Twitch, right? Oh, yeah, which oh, yeah, I haven't put pictures of these real dolls

511
0:43:47 --> 0:43:52
I've definitely found some pictures of just the torsos, of course

512
0:43:54 --> 0:43:58
Or as they call it on this website the Donnelly I mean

513
0:43:58 --> 0:44:03
Jacob you drive a scooter half the time. I don't like the Donnelly Herald and I don't like the Donnelly torso either

514
0:44:06 --> 0:44:08
You know, we don't get to name our legacies

515
0:44:11 --> 0:44:18
No, it's not the episode title fuck you guys

516
0:44:20 --> 0:44:26
Well, you have to have a really active imagination to go just torso like you know

517
0:44:27 --> 0:44:33
It's not it's not about that it's about think about having to mess around with the legs all the time

518
0:44:34 --> 0:44:37
No, yeah. No, that's what I say to my wife all the time

519
0:44:38 --> 0:44:40
It saves several steps

520
0:44:46 --> 0:44:50
It saves moving giant metal poles out of your way

521
0:44:51 --> 0:44:52
That's what

522
0:44:55 --> 0:44:56
Come over here Bob

523
0:45:01 --> 0:45:04
What a world but do you think do you think they're

524
0:45:06 --> 0:45:07
Vaginas he said

525
0:45:08 --> 0:45:12
I don't know what that means. I I've been looking on their website to see what that means

526
0:45:12 --> 0:45:16
They just call it that and then if it's anything like the regular AI

527
0:45:16 --> 0:45:20
It's like it's like would you like me to keep trying to slobber it up? No, I came I'd like to go to bed

528
0:45:20 --> 0:45:25
Alright, would you like me to print out different techniques? I'd like to possibly do your wiener some other time

529
0:45:31 --> 0:45:35
Several jokes about vaginas and magicians since you're a magician the AI

530
0:45:35 --> 0:45:41
Would like that you put your dick in the AI vagina and Will Smith is in there to fight it

531
0:45:43 --> 0:45:45
That's the AI vagina

532
0:45:46 --> 0:45:51
You gotta go down there and it's just like oh hell no, yeah

533
0:45:54 --> 0:45:57
Keep my AI vagina out of your mouth

534
0:46:07 --> 0:46:09
There is a whole help page here

535
0:46:13 --> 0:46:18
Vagina yes or no nothing on this website says what that is though, Jacob

536
0:46:18 --> 0:46:21
Please look up the torso facts

537
0:46:21 --> 0:46:28
What are the frequently asked facts? What are the frequently asked questions about the robot or so?

538
0:46:29 --> 0:46:30
Matt do you have any?

539
0:46:31 --> 0:46:34
I could I could just you know guess

540
0:46:36 --> 0:46:38
No, no

541
0:46:38 --> 0:46:46
Frequently asked questions section about the torso only doll. Okay. Well, just what are some of the people with no questions

542
0:46:48 --> 0:46:50
Know what they want and they don't

543
0:46:52 --> 0:46:53
Ship it

544
0:46:53 --> 0:46:56
Torso, please. Let's go go

545
0:46:57 --> 0:47:02
Torso engage fire. There's a hole. There is a whole section on storage and maintenance though

546
0:47:02 --> 0:47:10
Okay, and the first question is the first frequently asked question is how do I style my dolls hair? Oh

547
0:47:10 --> 0:47:15
Man, I know I don't I couldn't you take it to a salon

548
0:47:16 --> 0:47:17
sure

549
0:47:17 --> 0:47:20
Like you know, like like it's like I always talk about this with Donnie Marie

550
0:47:20 --> 0:47:24
It's like the fact that like you make all these incest jokes about them

551
0:47:24 --> 0:47:26
That's not the part that grosses you out. It's not the sexual tension

552
0:47:26 --> 0:47:29
It's when they're actually brother and sisterly that you're like, oh, this is weird

553
0:47:30 --> 0:47:35
Yeah, these these older adults being like teasy brother sister is so weird

554
0:47:36 --> 0:47:42
The actual most disturbing part of the real doll website is the storage tips, right?

555
0:47:42 --> 0:47:46
That's it. It's it's the X's and O's that are the sex parts like given

556
0:47:47 --> 0:47:54
But now it's the X's and O's. Let me just read this sentence to you and see if you can just contain yourself

557
0:47:54 --> 0:47:57
Okay for best maintenance of your doll

558
0:47:57 --> 0:48:03
It should preferably be stored hanging in a neutral position with legs lightly spread

559
0:48:03 --> 0:48:06
from the provided neck bolt

560
0:48:08 --> 0:48:17
You hang the leg by the neck bolt with the legs slightly spread so that things can dry out

561
0:48:18 --> 0:48:24
Yeah, and make sure you remove the neck bolt when you're using the doll or when it is lying down

562
0:48:24 --> 0:48:31
Mm-hmm. Okay, and then it goes on to talk about avoiding creases and the silicone as that can cause creases

563
0:48:32 --> 0:48:34
How much for just the neck both?

564
0:48:40 --> 0:48:45
Hang your real doll by her neck bolt, please

565
0:48:45 --> 0:48:52
And I will see that you really love her hang your real doll

566
0:48:52 --> 0:48:59
Neck bolt in the closet for me. Oh my god. Yeah, it's a it's a

567
0:49:00 --> 0:49:06
Careful now Jacob we're on a marina ship we're on I know that's why I showed you a picture of clothes

568
0:49:07 --> 0:49:10
Like I like the evergreen

569
0:49:10 --> 0:49:16
One because it's evergreen dressed for Christmas all seasonal they were holiday themed

570
0:49:18 --> 0:49:22
It's all a guy around the holidays I busted out with my tree

571
0:49:24 --> 0:49:27

0:49:35 --> 0:49:39

601
0:51:56 --> 0:51:59
It or hey scoops to check out there you go

602
0:52:00 --> 0:52:05
That would be a good crossover boy. I found this stuff about the AI stuff that new masters

603
0:52:05 --> 0:52:11
Oh, okay. Great. Share it a second that new masters universe movie is looking like it might be okay

604
0:52:11 --> 0:52:12
Dolph Lundgren

605
0:52:12 --> 0:52:26
No, I don't know if he might have a cameo in there or not. I know you know Jared Leto is the one kind of

606
0:52:26 --> 0:52:29
So far we'll see who knows

607
0:52:30 --> 0:52:34
Did he quit? I don't think so. All right, that would be the way to go bossy if he quit

608
0:52:34 --> 0:52:41
It would be the big positive buzz, but no, I don't think so. We'll see. All right, so explain to us AI vagina, please

609
0:52:43 --> 0:52:45
According to this oh

610
0:52:47 --> 0:52:48
boy, I

611
0:52:48 --> 0:52:51
Would show you videos of it, but twitch would ban us

612
0:52:53 --> 0:52:58
Like the the mouth movements, come on, it's just science

613
0:52:58 --> 0:53:00
Come on

614
0:53:00 --> 0:53:07
The the the things they move their mouths around but it's it looks like they're kind of

615
0:53:07 --> 0:53:13
Okay, they don't look sexy when they're moving their mouth around they look like a

616
0:53:13 --> 0:53:18
Crack addict with their with their move there. They're moving their mouth around like they're grinding their teeth

617
0:53:19 --> 0:53:26
Too much in on the best day, would you trust a fake robot mouth with your dick? Nope

618
0:53:26 --> 0:53:29
No, me neither. No, what the fuck?

619
0:53:31 --> 0:53:37
For a dick akin like a simplified toy you asked that question so backwards Paul, okay

620
0:53:37 --> 0:53:40
What's the question how ignorant you are? All right

621
0:53:40 --> 0:53:44
Would you like to have safe sex with a meth head? That's the question

622
0:53:48 --> 0:53:53
No is the answer no, I don't think there is safe sex with a man head

623
0:53:53 --> 0:54:00
Don't worry the head and mouth both contain safety mechanisms to lock the neck and mouth in place

624
0:54:00 --> 0:54:04
When needed for posing or for rough play? Oh

625
0:54:04 --> 0:54:10
No, what? So don't worry about it ball. It's all taken care of no, this doesn't know

626
0:54:10 --> 0:54:16
I don't want the words rough play and my dick connected in the same sentence

627
0:54:17 --> 0:54:25
This is this is some pen talking about permanent damage acceptable. Yeah shit. No, thank you

628
0:54:25 --> 0:54:31
Permanent damage. Okay, that was the phrase right? It was Jesus Christ. I

629
0:54:31 --> 0:54:35
Permanent damage. Okay, how much of these things way? This doesn't look like it's a lightweight thing

630
0:54:35 --> 0:54:39
I'm just imagining carrying this through the John wick experience

631
0:54:41 --> 0:54:43
Yeah, that's that's your that's your

632
0:54:43 --> 0:54:48
Your gym time, I guess that maybe makes up for it a little bit that you don't have to go to the gym that day

633
0:54:48 --> 0:54:54
I guess like I can't find just a I just want to wait of what all these things are and they can't be nothing

634
0:54:54 --> 0:54:59
That's really terrifying all of its terrifying. Yeah. Oh

635
0:54:59 --> 0:55:04
The AI vagina looks like it's basically just a flesh light with a little motor type thing in there

636
0:55:04 --> 0:55:09
So it can it can move around a little bit and the reason they call them AI is because you can like

637
0:55:09 --> 0:55:12
Plug it into some software that will

638
0:55:13 --> 0:55:17
quote-unquote sync up with something you're watching on TV or

639
0:55:18 --> 0:55:21
Okay, right like stuff like that

640
0:55:21 --> 0:55:27
Like it'll it'll do that or or it can be remotely controlled by some operator somewhere

641
0:55:27 --> 0:55:31
So you don't have say on to how it's jerking your we've got a patreon level for that

642
0:55:31 --> 0:55:35
I mean, absolutely and I think it's like we keep waiting for the moment

643
0:55:35 --> 0:55:41
To declare that AI has gained its own consciousness and I think it'd be funny if it starts with the robot vaginas first

644
0:55:43 --> 0:55:47
Well, I mean I see that would not be good for us bossy is dead on here

645
0:55:47 --> 0:55:52
You know porn is always the forward part in tech. He's looking forward to the torn dick horror stories

646
0:55:53 --> 0:56:00
I'm with you. No, but it's absolutely right you you from the days of the printing press you want to know where technology is going

647
0:56:00 --> 0:56:08
What technology allows the dissemination of porn most easily and cheaply that is where tech is going

648
0:56:08 --> 0:56:10
That was what won the VHS

649
0:56:10 --> 0:56:11
beta war

650
0:56:11 --> 0:56:15
It's a lot of things. Yeah, if if

651
0:56:15 --> 0:56:22
That's a weird thing with streaming racing to the first a AI sex bot the cheapest one is that we're gonna figure out

652
0:56:23 --> 0:56:24
Yeah

653
0:56:24 --> 0:56:26
Seems a good way to become billionaires guys

654
0:56:29 --> 0:56:29
I

655
0:56:29 --> 0:56:35
Have to I have to leave right now, you know what they say build a better cock trap and the world will beat off to your door

656
0:56:37 --> 0:56:39
They do say that

657
0:56:47 --> 0:56:49
That's a Franklin bon mot right there, yeah

658
0:56:53 --> 0:56:53
Oh

659
0:56:53 --> 0:56:59
Well, that's one piece of information that Paul has but he probably doesn't have any others so he's gonna lose a jock versus nerd, okay

660
0:57:25 --> 0:57:26
Real dolls and AI

661
0:57:28 --> 0:57:33

669
0:58:08 --> 0:58:09

It is 95. He said he planned to retire at 95

672
0:58:17 --> 0:58:21
But now he plans to just keep driving for as long as he remains healthy and able

673
0:58:21 --> 0:58:26
Okay, definitely is not an indication of how our retirement system is going in this country

674
